Guys,

After wasting almost 15 dvds for my Acura MDX 2007 I have finally found a way to burn the Map DVD and it works.

Here are the steps.

1) Download the torrent which has an iso image of the White Navigation DVD V 4.92. and I has also included the ImgBurn software that I used to burn the Dual layer Memorex DVD+R dl.

2) Install ImgBurn software on your computer...and burn the dvd using that.
3) Go to your car (In my case MDX 2007). Keep the car keys in to on position. remove the original dvd you have from your navigation dvd drive under your driver's car seat.
4) Insert the new DVD. The navigation display would download the new software version automatically. 
5) It will Restart automatically and Enjoy.



That's it..hope you enjoy this..this is my first torrent and I really wanted to save you guys some 150 dollars that acura charges for the danm maps...




Above steps should just work fine..but this is just incase..something goes wrong..

If you get an error for any reason...and you wnat to revert back to your old navigation dvd follow the below instructions.

 When you put in your old disk and come up to the "Error" screen do the following : 

1) Hold down MAP/GUIDE, MENU and CANCEL at the same time 
2) This brings up a Menu 
3) From the Menu, select "Version" 
4) Then select "Download" 
5) This will download the old disc into your system.
