TENCHU: STEALTH OF THE ASSASSINS:

STORY:
The game takes place in feudal Japan, introducing a pair of ninja: Rikimaru and Ayame, members of the Azuma ninja clan since childhood. The two ninja serve the heroic Lord Gohda, and work for him as his secret spies to root out corruption and gather intelligence in his province. However, the evil demonic sorcerer Lord Mei-Oh seeks to destroy Lord Gohda, and using his demon warrior Onikage who wreaks havoc throughout Lord Gohda's province.

GAMEPLAY:
Rikimaru, armed with a single ninjato, is stronger than Ayame but relatively slower. Ayame carries a pair of wakizashi and is faster and has more combos than Rikimaru, but is the weaker of the two.

All of the levels take place at night to compensate for the technical limitations of the PlayStation; the game's high rate of redraw is reduced by setting events at night and reducing the distance the player can see.

CHARACTERS:
    * Rikimaru is the servant and protector of Lord Gohda. He has obtained the sixth sense allowing special vision.
    * Ayame is the loyal friend of Lord Gohda's daughter, Princess Kiku. They act like sisters toward each other but she, like Rikimaru, is a ninja protecting Lord Gohda.
    * Lord Gohda is the leader and loyal royal of this ancient time. He has a daughter, Kiku, as well as two ninjas just as part as his protection. He has a counsel, Sekiya, who is also the trainer of Ayame and Rikimaru.
    * Princess Kiku is the daughter of Lord Gohda and best friend of Ayame. She is respective to and from Ayame especially at training. At the end of the game, she is kidnapped, but is rescued.
    * Mei-Oh is a powerful demigod and boss of Tenchu: Stealth Assassins. He is the first to employ the services of Onikage.
    * Onikage - a ninja who serves Mei-oh and is the series' recurring antagonist. He has fought against Rikimaru several times, and he considers Rikimaru to be his ultimate rival, despite him being human, while Onikage is demonic in nature.

TENCHU BIRTH OR THE STEALTH ASSASSINS:

PLOT:
The game is intended as a prequel to the game Tenchu: Stealth Assassins and depicts the series' heroes Rikimaru and Ayame as teens, being taught by their elderly master named Shiunsai as well as another Azuma ninja named Tatsumaru. The game reveals how Rikumaru got the famous scar over his right eye (not depicted in the game's cover).
The Azuma Ninja have served the House of Gohda for countless generations. Now three young ninja, Rikimaru, Ayame, and Tatsumaru, must protect Lord Gohda Matsunoshin against a coup d'Ã©tat attempt and a mysterious ninja group calling themselves the Burning Dawn.
After the three ninja are accepted into the Azuma clan, they are called to Gohda castle, which is under attack by Lord Gohda's uncle, Motohide. After a bloody battle, which includes the death of Lady Kei, Lord Gohda's wife, and the kidnapping of Princess Kiku, Lord Gohda's daughter, Rikimaru stops Motohide from killing Lord Gohda, but can't stop Motohide from escaping. It turns out that Motohide was working for a rival Lord, Lord Toda. Toda kills Motohide, only to be killed himself and decapitated by Lady Kagami, the leader of Lord Toda's ninja. She is leading a group of rebel ninja group calling themselves the Burning Dawn, consisting of Suzaku, Genbu, Seiryu, and Byakko, the four Lords of the Burning Dawn, and led by Lady Kagami. To make matters worse, the recently made leader of the Azuma Ninja, Tatsumaru, has gone missing. It is later revealed that Tatsumaru has lost his memory and is now part of the Burning Dawn. Rikimaru and Ayame now have to save Lord Gohda, and stop a ninja uprising intended to plunge the country back into the civil war.
The Burning Dawn has its origins when Lord Ghoda's uncle Motohide allied himself with a warlord called Toda Yoshisada in order take control over his kingdom. Toda launched an attack against Ghoda castle which resulted in the death of Lord Ghoda's wife Lady Kei and the kidnapping of his daughter Princess Kiku. Motohide is later betrayed and killed by Toda, only to be betrayed and killed himself by his chief assassin Lady Kagami, the founder of the Burning Dawn. Over an unknown period of time following the death of Lord Toda, the burning dawn partake in a series of underground criminal activities such as kidnapping, theft, forced labor, smuggling and murder. This in turn attracts the attention of Lord Ghoda and the Azuma Ninja, who make efforts to end the illegal activities of the organization.
The end finally arrives when the Burning Dawns hierarchy and its flag ship 'Fire Demon' are destroyed by the combined efforts of Rikimaru and Ayame, as well as naval elements of the Ghoda army.

GAMEPLAY:
One of the game's most acclaimed features was the Mission Editor. It gave the player the opportunity to create their own mission, including level layout, deciding which characters to put in, and mission objective. It spawned a tournament in North America to find the best created mission. Due to this acclaim the Mission Editor was later brought back and revamped for the PSP installment, Tenchu: Time of the Assassins.
