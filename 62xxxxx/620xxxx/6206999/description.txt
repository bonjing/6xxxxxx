There are several people out there who have graciously ripped and uploaded the
DVDs of Dark Shadows over the last few years. However I have found that either
the quality is poor or the series is not completely available via torrent.

I have decided to fill this gap as best as I can. I am providing each episode,
as it is on the DVD.  However, I have de-interlaced it, brightened it up a bit
and cropped the annoying black areas off the sides. The result is a 4:3 aspect
video of high quality (696x480px) and moderate size (avg. 250Mb).

I have also removed the opening slates from the episodes which contained them.
I personally enjoyed them,  but my goal is to make a broadcast-quality copy of
the show, and they do become rather annoying after the 100th time.

Be sure to check out  http://darkshadows.wikia.com  for information  about the
episodes as well as the show itself!

Enjoy!
