,black_shadow_1981,2011-03-01T15:34Z,"maybe you have a bad disc, try burning again but slower i burn at 2.4X (also you need your xbox flashing to play backups)"
,black_shadow_1981,2011-03-01T15:35Z,"verbatim discs are the best to use for 360 games, 70+ games and no coasters for me yet"
,MotorLund,2011-03-01T16:14Z,Is this game AP 2.5 & does it have the new Kinect Dash ?

,FLAMinEK,2011-03-02T10:29Z,the SSv2 for this iso is on abgx but as it matches the SSv1 on the game you will need to manually patch the SSv2 as autofix won't to be live safe.
,ene831,2011-03-02T12:41Z,thanks
,asrocker,2011-03-02T15:16Z,Works great but the game has lost it you can just wagle the right stick to win and boxers have all got the chin of chuck norris.

,shaliru,2011-03-13T16:20Z,"I have a banned console with xtreme 5.3 non-stealth firmware, but cant get this game to work. I've burned over 7 coasters and have even tried patching to wave 4 and 3, but it keeps saying open tray. other wave 6 games work fine like test drive unlimited (after i patch to wave 4). I purposely got xtreme 5.3 because i heard it could play any wave game.
Is there any way to patch this game so it plays on my firmware? or do i have to update to lt +1.1"
