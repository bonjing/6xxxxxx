    Tony Robinson doesn't usually get to decide where the      
    Team should dig, but in this episode he chooses his       
    first ever site for investigation: a German              
    anti-aircraft battery built during the Nazis' five-year   
    occupation of Jersey.                                      
                                                              
    The archaeologists have never investigated anything      
    like this before and must apply all their skills to       
    make sense of a site now reclaimed by a forest. It's       
    soon clear that the gun emplacements are part of a much   
    bigger, complex fortified settlement that was home to    
    hundreds of German soldiers equipped with a vast array    
    of weapons.                                                
                                                              
    And, unlike with older sites, the Team can talk to       
    people who witnessed life under the occupation at first   
    hand.                                                      
                                                              
    What emerges is the shocking story of a fortress island  
    where German installations were built by slave labour     
    and the local population began to starve as the war        
    continued. Of terrible conditions that seem more          
    fitting to the eras the Team usually investigate,        
    rather than just 70 years ago.                            
                                                               
    Over three days Time Team uncover a fascinating and       
    frequently horrifying glimpse of life during war.
