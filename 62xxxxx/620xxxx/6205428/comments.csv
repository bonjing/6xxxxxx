[V],polisdavid,2011-03-06T09:03Z,"DO you know how to uninstall it back to snow leopard?

My DVD tells me I have to back up everything and do a clean install - this is almost impossible due to the complexity of OSX - which mean reinstalling a tons of software.

Can Time machine do it - if so how?"

,Soma1322876,2011-04-21T19:52Z,"IMPORTANT NOTICE: Do not download this if there is even a chance that you'll have problems with the start-up, and will have to re-download the software, because you need the actual Lion Disk to re-install it. It will not let you go back to Snow Leopard or Leopard."
