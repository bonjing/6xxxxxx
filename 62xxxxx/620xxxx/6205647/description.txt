According to the Wikipedia:

"Scrapple is a 1998 movie set in a fictionalized version of Telluride Colorado in the 1970s, before the town became the uber-hip ski resort. Directed by Christopher Hansen and starring his brother and writing partner Geoffrey Hansen as Al Dean, Scrapple follows a summer in the life of ski bums in the fictional town of Ajax, Colorado.

Other stars include Buck Simmonds (Tom Sullivan), who had a part in A River Runs Through It opposite his former roommate, Brad Pitt; the beautiful Ryan Massey (Beth Muller) as Tom's unlucky girlfriend; and a curious pig called Scrapple, after the Pennsylvania pork delicacy. The latter character, and the many drug references, earned Scrapple the tagline "Babe on Acid."

Scrapple features an impressive soundtrack of mostly 1960s and 1970s music. Veteran blues artist Taj Mahal produced the soundtrack, rerecorded versions of his favorite songs, and added some original incidental music."
