By his side stands his beautiful wife Lucretia who will help her husband achieve his goal no matter what the cost. Batiatus puts all his fortunes on the man who will gain him fame and glory, his best gladiator, the Celt, Gannicus; a skilled warrior who wields his swords in the arena as if it were his last day alive. However, there are those who oppose Batiatus and his future champion(s) of Capua, plotting against him only to succeed in failure.

Episode List:

-Past Transgressions-
 
Batiatus finds himself in control of his father\'s ludus and selects his most skilled gladiator to win favor of a nobleman in order to be a part of the opening games in the new arena. And thus, the story of the Celt warrior Gannicus, the original champion of the House of Batiatus begins. The origins of the Gaul, Crixus are also explored.


-Missio-

Batiatus succeeds in securing the position of primus for his man Gannicus in Vettius\' upcoming games through an elaborate scheme. Oenomaus is challenged by Doctore, killing him and receiving the title of Doctore. Gannicus and Melitta are ordered to have sex with each other for Vettius\' entertainment, leaving both of them deeply and emotionally troubled.


-Paterfamilias-

Batiatus\' father, Titus, returns and quickly undoes Batiatus\' elaborate scheme by placing Crixus in where Gannicus was to fight. Also, things are run amuck when Oenomaus feels he does not deserve his position as Doctore.


-Beneath the Mask-

The power struggle between the younger and the elder Batiatus shakes the roots of their house and sees alliances formed and loyalties divided. Lucretia sides with her husband albeit reluctantly in performing a risky plan while Gannicus finds himself on unstable ground.


-Reckoning-

Batiatusâ€™ father announces a tournament to determine the worth of the men that make up his stable of gladiators. Crixus, dedicated to proving himself, is drawn into the power play within the house.


-The Bitter End-

Batiatus seeks vengeance for all that has befallen him; the opening of the new arena promises a spectacle of combat and blood.
