,Nakorentreri,2011-02-28T09:23Z,"Same here. Getting something alike 
PlayCsvdata.cpp error or something close to that....thought maybe had to put region in Japan to make it work but that didnt do it. Any help would be much apreciated ^^ thx"
,Nakorentreri,2011-02-28T22:12Z,"Ok ive done a bit of looking around and this is what i found. Its bits from a youtube discussion. Ive edited out the names and such just to make sure im not breaking any rules here ^^

""  FIRST POST So to install AppLocale on Vista/Windows 7, go to the ""start"" menu and search for ""cmd"" (command prompt). You should see now see cmd in the list. Rightclickï»¿ on it and choose ""run as administrator"".

A black box should appear that will say something like ""C:\Windows\(system32)>"". Put the AppLocale installer in whatever directory shown in the black box, and then type ""apploc.msi"" in the black box and press the enter button. Then the installer should run just like in windows XP.

SECOND POST  I had the same problem but it is quite easy to fix (at least if you run windows XP). If you run Vista or Windows 7 you shouldn't give up your hopes cause it'll still work. (My computer run Vista) Just download a program called AppLocale and set your language to japanese (fake region). This canï»¿ NOT be installed on Vista/Windows 7 unless you install it as administrator, which you can't just by rightclicking on it and select ""Run as Administrator"".


Ok so once i had the  applocale programed installed like they said u find it in your start program. Use it and set your region to the right language (had the right one already in option for me) and then your done game will work with the start application function. 

BTW this game is TOTALLLY worth it!!! U got to make this work!!"

,wrongside,2011-03-23T20:49Z,English language or Japaness?
,sevendarkdays,2011-03-31T19:07Z,"@wrongside There's an english patch if you google a little. so far it doesn't translate the story but most of everything else, which makes the game playable even if you don't know japanese."
,evaric,2011-04-23T17:46Z,No install docs with multiple rar files. Don't waste your time downloading.

Ridiculously full of noob"
,Jurosem,2011-07-25T13:49Z,"It really could have done with some installation documentation. With a bit of work I figured it out, and I'll share some useful information.

Applocale is indeed the programme to use (I'm on Vista, don't know about any other OSs), but one thing that wasn't clear is that you need to use it with all the files/installations, AND to launch the game once installed. (This is in contrast to all the other Illusion games I've tried where Applocale was only needed to run the ISOs for the initial installation, not for updates or the game itself.) Running the game with Applocale specifically deals with the ""PlayCsvdata.cpp"" error, or at least it did for me.

Also, the ""correct"" language, Japanese, is the very last one on the list. This probably isn't obvious as the list is all in Asian characters, and for those of us who only speak English... So just scroll down to the very end.

Finally, while the game in this torrent already seems to be partially translated, I would recommend downloading the HF patch from Hongfire for this game, which includes a more complete English interface as well as a few extras, most notably the uncensor patch. Just type ""custom maid 3d uncensor patch"" into google and it should be the first return.

Hope that helps."
