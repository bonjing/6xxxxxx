In Motor City you are the President of an upstart car company. You have the control just about everything, from designing cars and opening branches throughout Europe to hiring workers and engineers. You have to build larger and larger factories. The game starts at the beginning of the 20th century and takes you slowly forward to the modern ages and the technical revolutions.
