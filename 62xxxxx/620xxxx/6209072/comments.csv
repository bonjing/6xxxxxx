,skoxpress,2011-07-29T03:44Z,Couldn't install. Installer couldn't find the .msi. Neither could I. LOL
,telecomsearch,2011-08-14T02:59Z,"There is no ""Activation Blocker""; only a ""Activation"" application which is a Pinnacle application.

The other two files/applications are ""Instructions"" and ""Install_Setup"" as stated in Instructions."
