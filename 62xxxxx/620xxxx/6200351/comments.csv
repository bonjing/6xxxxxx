The compression rate is what i got from Magic DVD Ripper.
I think this is due to the sound track taking up some space as well.
If you have some more info on this i will be happy if you posted it.

And thx for the IMDB link!"

This however does not happen on a computer or never dvd players. So let me kow if you experience this problem."
,DarkWolfDK,2011-02-26T22:33Z,"For those of you who experience the problems earlier mentioned.

I am now trying to make a new RIP of the DVD with DVDFab 8.0.7.3.
It seems i can get Menu and subs working with this one.
So i will post a link to it here as well.
Besides DVDFab 6.0.4.x is making read error and so does Magic DVD Ripper when trying to get a full rip of the disc.
I will apreciate any feedback here."
,DarkWolfDK,2011-02-27T18:39Z,"Ok.
Finally found the error to my demise.
When i use DVDFab 8 to rip the DVD and get the Video/Sound_TS folder i try to burn them using different burn programs and making ISO of the folders.
This resulted in the burned DVD not working in regular DVD players.
The solution is to use the built in burner in DVDFab.
Now the DVD is playable in a DVD player.
So now a few more DVD's will be ripped in high quality.

I hope more poeple will keep seeding for atleast a month after DL."
