,ElBigHoe,2011-03-07T04:37Z,Im guessing it works?
,skyjordan17,2011-03-14T21:40Z,"Crack works just fine; I've got no audio, but I think that's because I'm playing on linux through wine.

Thanks for the great upload!"
,deeWORLD,2011-03-24T01:33Z,how do you seed?!?!?!?!
,Plasmachinery,2011-03-31T16:41Z,"@ DeeWORLD, You automatically seed after you are done downloading the torrent. Just leave the torrent on Utorrent. Don't delete it or pause it. Leave Utorrent open and you will be seeding after the download is finished. Does that help lol?"
,Georgelopez822,2011-04-01T22:31Z,Yeah guys it works haha 
,MrSpazticated,2011-04-21T00:22Z,"i hav left it to seed for an hour now and it says 0(142) And when i open it, it says its missing vorbisfile.dll Can you tell me how to make it work."

,hiroicman27,2011-05-16T04:39Z,There is no audio help!!!!!!!!
,Georgelopez822,2011-06-01T17:24Z,"Um... I downloaded it on my other PC and it works fine. I have audio, and I get no errors. Simply drag and drop the .exe into your programfiles/rockstar/gtssa "
,MrWhippyO,2011-06-03T17:53Z,Try dll dump and see if its in their database?
,4LoKo,2011-06-27T09:10Z,Works great with the version I had.. I just replaced the .exe files and I was playing within 5 minutes!
,drtasty,2011-06-28T07:05Z,"For anyone that's wondering about the ""Missing vorbisfile.dll"" error, you have to note that this torrent is NOT the game GTA: San Andreas. It is a CRACK that LETS you play. You have to get the actual game from a different source, such as http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4207293/Grand_Theft_Auto_San_Andreas. Then replace the file you downloaded from Georgelopez822 with the gta_sa.exe in the actual game's location (Program Files -> Rockstar Games) and run it. Hope this helped!"
,Georgelopez822,2011-07-18T16:41Z,"Thank you drtasty. Like he said, just download the game from another source, then drag and drop the crack into the folder. The crack DOES work."
