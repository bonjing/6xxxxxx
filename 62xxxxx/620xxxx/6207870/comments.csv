They really don´t hide your identity.
Load down ¨Ultra-surf¨ or ¨Torpark¨.
They are much safer."

Give 'em hell Slickinator! I have had 0 problems with any of your uploads.  They are always current, exceptionally easy to run and safe.  Can't ask for anything better than that.  Plus you come across as someone with a high sense of wanting to have what you put out to be flawless within your limitations and you sure set the bar high on all your torrents.  Thank you."
,GIJerryO,2011-04-18T09:12Z,P.S. I know it's Slickinator - I just picked my nose and my finger slipped of the N to the B key - sorry.
[V],Slickinator,2011-05-18T13:26Z,lol your allowed to pick your nose when ever u want and thanx ...i always try and make torrents fun and easy
