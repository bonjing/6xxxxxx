Please let me know how you get on as I am brand new at this. Cheers"

,robert1246,2011-03-05T23:59Z,"Brilliant!! Like ""hematitec"" wrote, EPUBs only (thank you!) and, best of all, separate files so that you don't have to wait till the end of the download to get the books you wanted. Thank God you are not a .RAR maniac. Keep on the good work; I will keep seeding."
