In order to save you have to download ""Games for Windows Live"" software: http://www.microsoft.com/games/en-US/Support/Pages/accountManagement.aspx
Then make a LOCAL/OFFLINE account from the drop down menu once your in the game.
There's also a no-intro fix at gamecopyworld "

I changed the date to Jan. 27, 2008.  According to some posts on the EpicGames forum, there were issues with a certificate or something."
,Sanicle,2011-04-24T15:38Z,"Here's a better fix than setting the clock back. The problem is an expired certificate in games for windows live, not the game itself. This problem affects legitimate owners too, not just pirated copies. A patch was released that will update the version of games for windows live used so that the game will run. It's available on Gamespot as the ""gears of war certification patch"""

,thedamninstruction,2011-05-26T14:06Z,WHERE IS THE GODAMN FUCKING INSTALLING INSTRUCTIONS?!?!! I CANT BELIEVE I LOST MY TIME DOWNLOADING THIS PIECE OF CRAP
,thedamninstruction,2011-05-26T23:42Z,"
Here's a step-by-step guide on how to install the game by me!!
If you are having problems installing the game such as Run time errors, double-kick startup.exe to play gow and etc, follow these steps:

1.If you already installed the game, completely uinstall it, after that, use the software CCleaner(google it) to clean your registry."
,thedamninstruction,2011-05-26T23:44Z,2. Install Netframework - http://www.orkut.com.br/Interstitial?u=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/confirmation.aspx?familyid%3D0a391abd-25c1-4fc0-919f-b21f31ab88b7&t=AM2yfAL6WhSCuv41sqFJ-0RZ5qdLw3Ha_BVF6BHPOhTLLepkcou6qJpV89btnA5JBcIcq4CgFTjFWubyjMexdr4Egu0z4qwcLwAAAAAAAAAA

,Spockrock,2011-05-29T14:33Z,"for those who are having trouble with this torrent. it does work.

what you all are missing is the right gfwl.exe in your binaries folder. replacing the startup.exe is not enough to make it work, it will keep crashing until you replace the other executable too.

you can get it in that Polish pack mentioned in the comments here"
,navy5465,2011-06-08T00:23Z,"i downloaded the game and installed it and when i click the i icon it says ""please insert the correct cd/dvd rom and restart the application"" any help?"

,PrO.mArtIn,2011-07-08T16:21Z,"So I downloaded this and installed, THIS IS WORKS!
You have to do these step to make it workable!
1. Install the game (This game can't make folders! So It's normaly C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games If you have a 32 bit OS It's in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games)
2. When It's installed DON'T RUN IT! You have to download GearsTU1.1 (Google it :D)
3. Install it!
4. Download GoW Hamachi Fix v1.0 & v1.1 (Don't forget Google is your best friend! :D xD) There will be a option INSTALL HAMACHI FIX! Click on it!
5. When It's over open the games root folder and find Binaries (Microsoft Games\Gears of War\Binaries)
6. Find startup.exe and run it! :D
7. ROT IN HELL :D 
Please say to others to do these! And if you have some respect forward me write down: The helper was ---> PrO. mArTiN "
