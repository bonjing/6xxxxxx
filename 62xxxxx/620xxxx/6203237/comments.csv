I mean all these 349.63MB S03E15 are the same copy right?  Since they're all xvid-LOL named?

Regardless, any copy is better than none.  Thx eztv."
,yankfan75,2011-02-26T09:50Z,"Bob, it's not the torrents fault. Watch the show. It's set in the 80's so it was shot that way on purpose. EZTV was awesome as always. "
,DriverAus,2011-02-26T11:11Z,"Thx for upload!

,Bob__Dole,2011-02-26T11:21Z,"Well, I agree that it it's set in the 80's or whenever, but there is still excessive noise and ghosting that I do not think is supposed to be there.

However, it is also in the 720P, 1GB torrent too so either they were the same original capture or Fox really screwed up their broadcast... 80's tv didn't have ghosting like you're half drunk or cross-eyed."
,Sattori,2011-02-26T17:29Z,Thanks! Will see if there are any ghosts in this one...
,train716,2011-02-26T19:41Z,"I think its shot in 3D, the kind they use in the theatre, NOT the typical RED and BLUE we are all used to.     ...Or the quality of this torrent is that fuzzy. "
,shayweis,2011-02-26T19:45Z,Thanks for the upload. though this episode is a waste of time. boring and pointless
,nightprowler.,2011-02-28T19:31Z,"Bob, I watched it on network on Fox and it had excessive noise to simulate a retro feel. 

I believe it's intended."
,Darkangelas,2011-02-28T22:57Z,You're the best.
,Cleojasp,2011-03-01T04:13Z,"A & V perfectly good. Shot with a vaseline lens effect - a poor attempt to iron out the fact Walter's supposed to be twenty odd years younger!

Thanks again eztv... "

,CanadianElite,2011-03-11T09:55Z,Watched it in 720 on demand. Looks and sounds the same way.
