,tiss2,2011-02-27T21:16Z,"Good picture quality and decent download speed. 

There is a slight static like sound in the background, but I only noticed it a couple of times. No big deal, at least not on my TV speakers. 

The movie has much gore for a Syfy.. "

,fejop,2011-02-28T00:34Z,"As already mentioned, either the movie or info is wrong. The movie is not Area 51 and is not about a group of teenagers. The movie is simply called 51."

Was expecting abit more from this movie.
A few bad actors, low budget and the story wasnt top notch."
,macdodge,2011-02-28T02:17Z,"51 chronicles what happens after political pressure from the American public forces the Air Force to provide a few well-known reporters with limited access to the most secretive base on the planet: Area 51. When one of the base's hidden 'long term visitors' exploits this unprecedented visit as a chance to liberate himself and his fellow alien captives, Area 51 turns from a secure government base to a horrifying destination of terror.

,LEERV,2011-02-28T02:58Z,this is fucking fake. get a life.

,KalviK3,2011-02-28T06:09Z,"Just watched & seeded ~3GB this movie...
This movie is just ""51"", not ""Area 51"".
A: 6 (a lot of static in the background)
V: 8
M: 3.5

Bad actors, low budget and kinda crappy story as mentioned above.
I wouldn't have downloaded it if I had checked this movie's budget (cheap Sci-Fi movies = no good usually)."
,pourable,2011-02-28T07:09Z,This is not the new movie but the SyFy channel crappy tv movie with worse than porn actors (good quality video slightly static on audio 8/7 on quality imo

,Mattytha01,2011-02-28T23:43Z,hmmm not sure wy this guys saying its fake but i think the confusion comes from ezones description. it is not an accurate description.  its not about a group of teenagers and its not a dvdrip.  secondly this xerberos guy is saying that its a movie thats not gunna be released till oct. the made for tv movie is just called 51.
,Mattytha01,2011-02-28T23:45Z,some people r seriously disturbed... fart in ur nose?? why?

,KalviK3,2011-03-01T04:13Z,"@FadeToDarkness01
It's because you're fucking stupid.
The movie sucked anyways. Low budget, shitty actors, not so good story either."
,srawrats,2011-03-01T10:36Z,Whats syfy??  Oh!... Scifi 
,Toblehorde,2011-03-01T14:26Z,"@ Area 51 ... Rofl mao... such a waste of time could have been awesome but instead, they made the monsters so unreal that it was more funny than scary..."

,evoger,2011-03-02T11:50Z,To eliminate the noise sound simply put all channel to left. Since the noise is only from right channel of sound! :)
,Scobbalobba,2011-03-02T13:23Z,"@suomihanzu - Go and put your cock in a can of SPAM and sing Koom By Yar my fucken lord or all my life's a circles with all your other Riceburner mates from Japan with a name like yours and if this torrent sucks like you say which it doesn`t as Extemezone is nothing but quality, then your mum has no arms or legs and fucks like an Egyptian Echidna !"

,kshatriya7,2011-03-02T16:09Z,MOVIE IS NOT YET RELEASED --- ITS 51 NOT AREA 51
,ciroa,2011-03-03T02:45Z,"Sonofabitch, not only this extremezone guy gives a wrong title to lure people, but he actually succeeds, and then retards defend the stupid. I wonder what's the reason. There MUST be a reason. This is the fishiest torrent I've seen. Ever."
,sackingrome,2011-03-03T03:48Z,"If you're not a fan of campy syfy movies, you should move on... they are perfect for sitting around with friends to make fun of however. Nemec's other movie Stormtrooper is fun and awesomely absurd, this one though... eh, not that good on any level. Can't wait for more hybrid predator movies lol."
,PHDIKOULAS,2011-03-03T09:56Z,"REPENT HEATHENS LEST I FART IN YOUR FACES.

DL WATCH AND SHUT UP."
,paddyT5,2011-03-04T04:10Z,4 me that is totally crap .... but it is only my opinion thx 4 up anyway
,donki,2011-03-04T14:20Z,"I don't mind paying for a great movie but this is just shit but the makers will hide under the claim that it is ""Art"" and still expect people to pay for it. 

Come back Adolf! There are so many in the world today who deserve to be gassed!"
,wierd-old-guy,2011-03-04T22:31Z,"Audio - visual is fine: very good actually.
However this movie is SO bad it's actually not worth the d/l. IF it was a tiny bit worse it would be worth it because it would have been over the top but it just is the worst of the worst in scripting, editing, character development, acting, theme, you name it: it's horrible. but just not horrible enough to be funny. THAT'S the problem.
I honestly don't know why it was made. It doesn't appear to be someone's 1st attempt at a movie. It's the type of movie you actually walk away from or start reading a book in the middle of....."

,imunionjack,2011-03-06T01:37Z,"It mever fails to crack me up just how serious some peeps take the sharing buisiness. The only reason we should be uploading torrents is to let peeps have it free. The oonly comments should relate to the torrent. Quality And content. And peeps with manners should say thanks. Apart from that who gives a shit what some nutters say? Just ignore it man.
Ta muchly. Will give it a looksee."

Syfy fucking sucks. They bin good progs like SGU yet have the fucking cheek to air this? May all syfy excecutives drown in their own fucking vomit. 
,Leecher13,2011-03-12T02:18Z,y'all got negative comments... but why Seed more?...
,XxBranikanxX,2011-03-12T18:15Z,ugh the audio has this crackle sound on the left speaker its horrible i cant even watch it now
,saurabhrock,2011-03-23T13:11Z,to all the complaining motherfuckers..cribbing over a free movie..u assholes..go and buy 'em for some dollars from a nearby store..instead of thanking extremezone & other uploaders..this is the shit you assholes write...u all horrible cock sucking loosers..
,cigaretteburns,2011-04-01T19:46Z,This is NOT the upcoming cinema release Area 51. This is syfy cheap flick 51. Remember syfy also made Battle in LA before Battle LA came out in cinemas. Doh!
,Damien_74,2011-05-25T19:52Z,As previous comment states. The movie isn't even ready yet. This is a cheap syfy knock-off.
,DMNKLR,2011-09-18T04:55Z,"Ok, at everyone saying ""It's not the real one, it's the SyFy one"", THAT'S WHERE THEY PUT IT, morons!  Try going to the After Dark site and checking it out under ""after dark originals"", then watch the trailer.  It shows that it was aired on SyFy back on February 26th, 2011.  Geez, now quit trolling.

It's an AFTER DARK ORIGINALS MOVIE PEOPLE, and that's what it's supposed to be.  Nobody said it was something else, so stfu about it already, damn trolls."
,ackonish,2011-10-25T19:18Z,"Thanks Extremezone :) 
I always read about this place, and watched so much documentaries Tonight my friends are  coming and we will watch it ... nothing better than some aliens and beer :) "
,RickRosenthal,2011-10-30T01:25Z,Xx y'all have your audio swapped. It's on the right channel. XZ you have a shorted cap between ground & right input or output (if it didn't come from the source that is).
,RickRosenthal,2011-10-30T01:46Z,"As for the rest... well, what the hell. It's SyFy. Don't expect much. SyFy movies mostly suck. If you don't know that by now then the sooner you learn it the sooner you can stop ""wasting"" your bandwidth. And Fade â seriously man. Learn to use your client's obfuscation facilities. Jesus. You don't also go smoke joints on the courthouse steps & then complain when you get thrown in jail do you?

Thanks for the ul extremezone. And jic that noise is in the source, DePopper can suck that out for ya."
