Pilot: Sheen accidentally launches into outer space and crashes on the planet Zeenu. The Emperor of Zeenu mistakes him for a genius and appoints him for a Super High Royal Supreme Advisor, the jealous Dorkus vows to destroy him, and he befriends a space chimp. Viewers: 3.5 million[1] Note: Otis and Pig from Back at the Barnyard make a cameo appearance in Sheen's dream. Also, Aseefa could be a homage to Neytiri from Avatar, the 2009 film. This is also the only episode so far to show Sheen wearing his trademark Ultra Lord t-shirt (All other episodes so far show him wearing a jacket of some sort, the emperor most likely gave it to him)
