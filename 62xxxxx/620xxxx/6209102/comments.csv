,jmac85,2011-02-28T18:45Z,Thanks 20-40! Great mini-series... I'm starting to watch a few more British shows than I have before. They are different (and sometimes better than many) American shows.  [+1]
,bixdes,2011-02-28T19:14Z,Typical leftist propaganda - the Jews are the same terrorists as the Arabs.
,Ghw16xxx,2011-02-28T19:41Z,"Thanks for the series. For anyone who is unfamiliar with Palestine/Israeli affairs, it's a great place to start. 

On a sidenote, thanks to the Independent Spirit awards, I've only just discovered ""Please Give"". While there are other seeders, I would prefer to take it from you. As of this morning I'm up to 44%. Can you help?"
[V],twentyforty,2011-02-28T20:05Z,"Sorry, it has nothing to do with me."

,bixdes,2011-03-16T00:57Z,"""A Film Unfinished"" - an UNBIASED torrent now out that seems to indicate the palestinians are/were not treated by the jews, like the jews were treated by the nazis - er.... as the leftists claim."
