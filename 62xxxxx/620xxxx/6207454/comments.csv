[T],MelloYello,2011-02-28T08:51Z,"My bad this is the UK series. Duh
I watch the US one. Not interested in this one. Enjoy it though. EZTV rocks.  Give it a little while and you will be able to download nice and fast. "
,thedeadguy,2011-02-28T14:22Z,"The US one is a complete rip off of the UK original. The writers went to SyFy years ago(back when they actually played Science Fiction shows) and pitched it. SciFi said: A vampire, a werewolf, and a ghost living together in an apt? That's too silly, we don't want it."" So they went to the BBC, and now the show is in it's 3rd season. Then SyFy see's its a hit, and they want it, but the BBC isn't willing to do an american version, so SyFy pays the royalties to use the characters, but they can't use the scripts so they have to change everything...but they make the characters look EXACTLY THE SAME, down to the wardrobe...add some new characters and a storyline change, and they call it a SyFy original series.   In fact, you know why SyFy changed their channel name? To appeal to an audience that doesn't like Science Fiction. How stupid is that?

Watch the original Being Human, it's much better, there's more gore, they actually have nudity on the BBC and the story arch is just so much better. You can download it all here."
