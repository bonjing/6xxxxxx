Why Download something Encoded with x264?

x264 is an open-source encoder for the H.264 codec and H.264 is a new video codec standard which can achieve high quality video in relatively low bitrates. You can think of it as the successor of the existing formats (MPEG-2, DivX, XviD etc) as it aims in offering similar video quality in half the size of the aforementioned formats.

Install VLC Media player if there is any problem in viewing the files.
