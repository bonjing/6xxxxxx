Nope, you need to jailbreak your PS3 in order to play this."

,Shauncold,2011-03-29T00:24Z,"Big THANX to swelogz, this game absolutely works on CFW 3.55 Wutangrza JB(don't see many people using this JB but to each their own). Simply download and Winzip on the RAR file(yes I used winzip and it worked, wasn't paying attention when I started it) and transfer over to external HDD and plays fine on Multiman 1.16.11."
,Shauncold,2011-03-29T00:26Z,"Also, since none of the files are over 4gb(it's only a 5gb file N E ways), the game will play from external HDD without putting it on internal PS3 HDD. THANX again."
