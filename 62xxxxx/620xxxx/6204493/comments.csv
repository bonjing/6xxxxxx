You would make a lot of people happy. right now many think its a converted mp3 which is useless for quality listeners. 
thanks again"
[T],rjordan21,2011-02-27T04:36Z,"^^^ whose the many?  The only person here at TPB who brought it up was me here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6176259/Little_Feat_-_Time_Loves_A_Hero__[1977]__[Robbie60]_[FLAC]

I used to have AudioChecker before my HD crashed.  I can't find it anymore.  If you question the validity of his files figure out how to validate them but don't throw out bs about the ""many""...... it's only you pal.

Thanks Robbie6ty...... keep it up."
,Robbie6ty,2011-02-27T12:51Z,I will re-rip some older torrents with EAC. All my torrents I have ripped myself from original CD's. They are NOT converted Mp3's.
[T],rjordan21,2011-02-27T17:45Z,"^^^^ dBpoweramp is a great program too.  Like EAC you can rip in secure mode using C2 pointers (depending on your drive) I switch between the two..... dBpoweramp is much faster though. You can download it here at TPB:

Do want you want man, but I wouldn't re-rip anything to placate anyone.

Thanks for all the great shares....
