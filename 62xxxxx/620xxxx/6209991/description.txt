PLOT:
After con artist Eddie Sullivan (Feuerstein) incurs a large debt 
with a local criminal ringleader, he creates a get-rich-quick 
scheme and enlists a sweet gentle giant named Walter (Wight) as 
his unwitting accomplice. Walter\'s orphanage -- the only home 
he\'s ever known -- also needs funds desperately. Upon overhearing 
Walter\'s predicament, Eddie convinces the no-nonsense head nun, 
Sister Francesca (Malick), that Walter can win the money as a 
fighter and pay off the church\'s debts. Eddie\'s plan: travel 
from town to town with Walter and enter small, unsanctioned 
fighting competitions for prize money Sister Francesca dispatches 
Mary (Hardin) as a chaperone for both Walter and the money and 
gives Eddie a week - and a prayer - to make it happen. During 
their journey across the south to the annual Pro-Am MMA tournament 
in New Orleans, Walter discovers what life is like outside the 
orphanage, while Eddie becomes morally conflicted over whether 
to take all the loot for himself or keep his promise to Walter, 
the one person he can actually call a friend
