Louis Clark, former arranger for Electric Light Orchestra, conducted the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra playing a collection of very recognizable extracts from classical music pieces played over a continuous beat (sometimes an overtly disco fast beat, sometimes a slower and more subtle rhythm produced by a LinnDrum on the first and third albums and live drummers on the second album) that linked the segments together. This is called the Symphonic Rock or Orchestrated Rock genre, like London Symphony Orchestra did in its Classic Rock series but with less electronic effects.

The first cut of the initial album was a very successful single, reaching Number 2 on the UK Singles Chart and Number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 in late-1981/early-1982. At least two more "Hooked on Classics" albums were produced by Louis Clark in 1982 and 1983, as well some other "Hooked on..." albums on subjects such as swing music. The series was still running as late as 1988, when "Hooked on House" placed classical music extracts against a synthesized bassline and house-music-style drum pattern. In 1989, the orchestra released Mixed-Up Classics, dropping the Hooked On... name but recognizably continuing the same style of medley.

Contemporary efforts to combine classical music with contemporary arrangements included Walter Murphy's A Fifth of Beethoven and the efforts of Waldo de los RÃ­os.

The phrase hooked on gained some wide usage for various media products. One of the longer-lasting ones was the learning series Hooked on Phonics.
