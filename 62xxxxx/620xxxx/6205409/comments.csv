You SERIOUSLY KNOW NOTHING YOU TALK ABOUT! THE FILES I GET ARE IN THEIR ORIGINAL FORMAT! I DONT CHANGE THEM, GO COMPLAIN TO THE CORPORATE WEBSITES THAT HOST THE FLVS! SORRY I DONT CHANGE OR TINKER WITH THEM SO YOU WILL LIKE THE END RESULT! YOU ARE A NOOB BECAUSE YOU JUST DONT REALIZE EVERYTHING STREAMED ISNT A FUCKING AVI! feel free to talk back, but i already pointed out what you didnt realize before speaking last! 

sorry, this dude just attacked my uploads as useless, then said he could play them later on, what an asswipe!  Yessir, FUCK YOU, upload ANYTHING then call me out!  FUCKING LEECH!"
,P2P-ftw,2011-02-27T06:39Z,"(continued) sorry I had to add more, but you saying ""I can play flv but choose not too as they are only used when ripping youtube clips because they are shitty quality""

ONCE AGAIN, you know all of shit, XViD, Mpeg-4, Mkv, ANYTHING HAS LOWER LEVELS OF ENCODES, SO DOES FLV! FLV ALSO HAS HD VIDEO!

Any format can encode to crap with the wrong settings, and MOST of the new formats can encode to HD! FLV IS JUST A CONTAINER, it is the SAME AS A MP4, THEY ARE BOTH MPEG-4! LEARN THEN COME BACK NOOB! "
