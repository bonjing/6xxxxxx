,55trucker,2011-04-21T15:44Z,"To NLUPPER: 

One small minor error here. The video track is always supposed to be I.D #1 & the audio track will be I.D#2 etc. etc.. In this case they have somehow been muxed in the reverse. You might want to remux them to remove that small error. lol  "
,KickassWashingMachine,2011-05-11T01:18Z,"The reason the tracks are muxed wrong is because this is just stolen from TWiZTED, and AC3 added to it (for no good reason). TWiZTED here (smaller download, exact same (pretty bad) quality):

,KickassWashingMachine,2011-05-11T01:34Z,"...about the bad quality, that is - not about it being stolen from TWiZTED, which it is."
