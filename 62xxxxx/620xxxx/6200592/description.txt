The Lake Poets is one man from Sunderland called Martin Longstaff. Martin makes honest, haunting & moving Acoustic/IndieFolk music.

Despite only forming mid 2010, The Lake Poets has seen Martin already share the stage with not only some of the North East's best musicians & groups, but also some of the cream of the U.K and U.S. Indie/Folk/Acoustic scene. By combining heartfelt & haunting lyrics with an astonishing voice The Lake Poets have quickly amassed a legion of fans in a short space of time around the North East region, as well as further a field.

Having played a number of prestigious venues across the North East and the UK to stunned silences followed by rapturous applause, a triumphant set at Sunderlandâ€™s flagship music festival â€˜Split Festivalâ€™ in September 2010 solidified The Lake Poetsâ€™ position as an act to watch closely in the Indie/Folk genre.

The music is of the Lake Poets has been described as stunningly affecting & haunting, regularly bringing members of silent audiences to tears with its combination of beautiful melodies tinged with moving & thought-provoking lyricism.

The Lake Poets are currently writing for an upcoming debut E.P, expected in mid 2011, as well as performing across numerous venues around the country in February and beyond. Have a browse through the following links for more Lake Poets information, news & live dates.








The Lake Poets is one man called Martin Longstaff. He makes honest & haunting & moving Indie/Folk music. In the words of others "With a style harking of Fionn Regan and heart-on-sleeve honesty in his lyrics, Martin Longstaff aka The Lake Poets is a rising star worth going out of your way to see." Just by picking up his guitar and singing a bit Martin has already met loads of lovely interesting & creative people, and he'd like to meet more, so get in touch if you like what he's up to.
