This is a compilation of many torrents of the Ben 10 series, which is unarguably one of the best cartoons ever. It contains all 52 episodes, including the movie "Secret of the Omnitrix". All episodes are labeled with their name and episode number and season, based upon Wikipedia. There are no subtitles; voices are in English.

The video quality isn't all that great for viewing on HD screen, but what do you expect? It's an old TV show.

The average length is 22 minutes per episode; there's no ads except for the stupid ones that pop up during your show. The average file size is 180 MB.

The torrent's files are uncompressed, so download the torrent and select the episode you want to download.

By the way, you better seed. I will catch you if you hit and run my torrent.
