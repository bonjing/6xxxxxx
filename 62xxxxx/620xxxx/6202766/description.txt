Version Notes:
I was not happy with the size of my previous release. I tweaked a few things,
and managed to get below 200mb, even smaller than the original 12.0.1 version.
If you are happy with my previous 203mb release, then continue to use it. This
version does not add any new features, only a reduction in size.
