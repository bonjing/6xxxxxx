Guys.. i have released a newer version with multiple fixes. 

- Now includes all default plugins, default adjustments, default effects. 
- I improved the ""Stealthiness"". I found a few folders that was created, but i have fixed this in the new version.
- I highly recommend you download the new version.

The reason i included all default effects, adjustments, and plugins is because when editing images/graphics: the best ""Plugin"" is knowledge. I have been using Photoshop for graphics design and have never installed or used any ""Plugins"". 

Aftermarket plugins slow down photoshop tremendously. Not to mention the impact it leaves on your computer. 

As stated, the best plugin is KNOWLEDGE.

Photoshop is so robust it can do anything and everything you will need for graphics design. Pick up a tutorial or just play with it and you'll figure things out. Once you get the basics.. everything will fall into place and seem easier."
