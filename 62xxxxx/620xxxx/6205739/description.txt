1 Disaster   5:42 
2 For Agent 13   5:12 
3 And You Lied to Me   7:20 
4 Devastation   5:50 
5 Because Tonight   7:11 
6 Rides the Rails   4:56 
7 On Bedford and Grand   5:06 
8 Cedric's War   4:05 

It's like a Beach Boys album when it's calm and a Queen album when it's crunchy, but all filtered through what must be one hell of a record collection over at the Goreas-Lasek homestead.
