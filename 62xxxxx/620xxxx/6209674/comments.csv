,p475,2011-03-11T12:58Z,"The tracks don't sound like they're actually encoded in 256kbps, ie displayed bitrate is a container for a lower quality source.  For example, the stereo imaging of the originals is much better, and there is audible distortion.  I would appreciate if some others confirm this too.  thanks a lot for sharing anyway."
,jafooley,2011-03-13T21:12Z,Audio quality isn't very good.
