The London band Noah and the Whale are set to release their third album, Last Night On Earth, on March 15h via Island Def Jam. The band's first album since 2009 will feature ten brand new tracks, including the infectiously melodic first single "L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N." 
Lead singer Charlie Fink set to work on the album in January of 2010. Fink notes that the lyrics of the album were heavily influenced by poetry. Last year, he read the work of Frank O'Hara for the first time, falling in love with the poem Having A Coke With You. The album's title is also a nod towards Charles Bukowski's poetry collection The Last Night of the Earth -- Fink says he was attracted to the sense of "loser's pride" in Bukowski's work.
