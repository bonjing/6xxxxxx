Spartacus = 9
Camelot = 4"

That's fuckin' gay... Why when something comes along that pushes the envelope in such awesome ways like Spartacus and proves that kind of plot+sex+violent adult content has a market is the next ten years followed by complete and utter shit?

I guess that's what happens when most of the industry is run by uh...Syrians instead of Gauls. Present puny cock and jam harder in fucking ass. Same thing happened in the 80's. Two steps forward, one step back.

Looking forward to Spartacus S2 even without Andy (even though he was great). I think S0.5 proved it'll work out fine."

,PurityDeath,2011-02-28T22:22Z,"You know, I checked this out and I didn't really see it trying to copy Spartacus at all.
Having a single sex scene and a murderous plot twist is pretty much par the course no matter how much is actually being shown.
You could substitute this with Mists of Avalon and you'd pretty much be on the same level even though it came out 10 years ago (that's the sad part of this story, Camelot brings nothing original to the table.)

It was sorta good and kinda interesting and has James Purefoy who I thought was awesome as Marc Anthony in Rome. Definately could get better as things move on but could easily go worse too.

I think the biggest problem here is they took such a derivative story to work with. Same thing for the Robin Hood movie (which I didn't bother to watch) I mean we already have Merlin ongoing right now, who doesn't love Merlin? This just feels like a dressed up less funny Merlin or a dressed up redone Mists of Avalon that's gonna make us sit around and Cliffhanger on all this stuff we already know. ""What? Morgana's pregnant!? Dun dun DUUUUH!""

Out of the million fantasy novels/series/worlds/original ideas out there why did they feel the need to put lipstick on this pig? Especially when it's more attractive cousin is already spread eagle and ready to go on Sci-Fi."

You both are retarded baboons! 
This is not Spartacus! Why the fuck would Starz need to make a ""3rd rate, politically correct attempt at copying Spartacus""? They fucking own it!

As for PurityDeath, --- Wow I was gonna tear you a new A-Hole untill I read your latest comment. (good thing I did, I don't want to make a fool of my self) 

I actually enjoyed the hell outta this. Its not half bad. ( and nothing like Spartacus, AT ALL) Plus its just getting started. Who knows what could happen?

@PurityDeath
You are not a baboon. Thank you for coming to your own honest opinion instead of further rambling off your assumptions. (formulated by the comment of a baboon!)"
,clonies,2011-06-06T02:03Z,"Jeez...try to chill a little? It's obvious that people have different opinions and that some people decide about a series before even watching it. Spartacus isn't good just because it has sex and violence in it but it is a good series because it's well-made. It doesn't really add anything new to the genre either from my perspective. This series has good rating on imdb (7.3/10) so I don't think it's all bad, even though both Spartacus and King Arthur are used like a worn crack-whore. I don't see how you add something new to the Arthur saga without spoiling it or making it ridiculous. Make Morgan queen of Camelot and Arthur her loyal servant maybe? x)"
