,DDjusD,2011-02-27T22:22Z,Sorry for the upload rate. I'm experiencing internet issues at the moment.
,DDjusD,2011-02-27T22:39Z,"Just got off the phone with my ISP and according to them, they are having technical difficulties. Until they get it worked out (they said anywhere from 30mins - 2 hours) the upload will be very slow. Sorry."
,DDjusD,2011-03-10T03:52Z,"Sorry, I was away and left my computer on to keep seeding while I was gone, power went out at my place. Will be seeding again in a few minutes."
,mr.funkalicous,2011-03-12T00:53Z,"@DDjusD I have Windows 7 and I'm at Step 4, how do I exactly drag it?"
,mr.funkalicous,2011-03-12T00:55Z,"@DDjusD I have Windows 7 and I'm on Step 4, how do I drag them? Also I didn't choose any specific place to store the game I jjst went with the default."
,Shungbat69,2011-03-17T07:30Z,"I keep getting this HTTP 404 page not found when I click ""Download this torrent""."
,DDjusD,2011-03-17T23:20Z,"I'm not sure what the issue is, I can't even download it"
,DDjusD,2011-03-20T00:52Z,"Try clicking the ""Magnet Link"" button. It will open allow you to get the torrent by opening it straight into uTorrent or whatever your using."
,1ThtGuy,2011-04-05T00:16Z,if it does everything it promises i will seed for weeks
,Jesuskipz,2011-04-07T19:48Z,virus free?
,DDjusD,2011-04-14T07:22Z,"@1ThtGuy - That would be nice, If you get an error when trying to run the game after the install, go to where you installed it, open the ""Redists"" folder and run ""vcredist_x86.exe"" once that's finished, open the ""directx"" folder that is in the ""Redists"" folder and find and run ""DXSETUP.exe"". That should clear up any issues with the game not running.

@Jesuskipz - Yes. I'll comment again in an hour or so with a VirusTotal Scan."
,DDjusD,2011-04-14T07:28Z,"Correction, I can't do a VirusTotal scan, way to big."
,Mars11,2011-04-20T02:34Z,No input file specified.
,Falloutkid,2011-04-22T18:41Z,How come when i try and play it is says xinput1_3.dll is available or something?
,BLACKHEART6K,2011-05-02T23:30Z,If it works i will seed till my ratio for it is 30.00
,BLACKHEART6K,2011-05-03T04:32Z,"Worked Perfectly, I did have to do the spec's that you told 1thtguy but after that i had absolutely no problems, thank you very much, i shall seed this till the government comes to my door and hands me Osama's head =)"
,ThatGuyMartin,2011-05-08T00:01Z,"Hey, I just finished Installing, I encountered an Error: ""Application Load Error 5:0000065434"". I went thru the redists fix and still it pops up. Any suggestions?"
,DDjusD,2011-05-08T23:17Z,"@Mars11 - Use the magnet link thing, it has something to do with thepiratebay but this seems to be the only way to get this torrent.

@Falloutkid - Run the ""DXSETUP.exe"" File in the ""directx"" folder in the ""Redists"" folder which is in the install folder (where you installed Fallout: New Vegas).  It needs to update your DirectX files and such, took me about 10 minutes to get done.

@BLACKHEART6K - Thanks! He's dead now, so lets see what happens.

@ThatGuyMartin - I'm not sure what could have caused this. Is it from Fallout Mod Manager? If so, just re-open it and continue. Else then that, I'm not sure. More info would help me find a solution to your problem."
,Vegasbob,2011-05-11T13:27Z,Any chance of a 1.3 patch and crack update soon? 
,Dragon890274,2011-05-13T07:43Z,"I'm downloading it now from 150-190 kB/s. I hope to god this works lol. If it does I'll keep Vuze open to the end of time to upload this to other dieing people in need of Fallout: New Vegas. But if this doesn't work I'm gonna be so sad lol, but if it's a Virus I'm gonna Rape your dead body. so I hope its not a Virus. lol"
,Dragon890274,2011-05-15T10:35Z,"Alright, You Sir, Are absolutly friggen AMAZING! Honestly I was skeptical, but according to other's comments, they said...they said it was true. And so for that! I LOVE you. Because it was, it works, absolutly fine, and its amazinggg!! ^_^ Of course at the beginning I was like wtf? though cause it wasnt running lol, I messed up and didnt read the notepad you put to read x_x...but i did read it afterwords and it works, lol was a 24 hour download but it workedddd. anyway, to other people who rely on comments instead of ""Trusted"" cause there isnt anyone ""Trusted"" seeding, i tell you now, this download is for real, absolutly 100% real. and wonderful I might add. I mean c'mon who would upload something 7.25 gigs of fakeness? Idiots... thats who x_X"
,DarkMerc,2011-05-17T20:11Z,"LOL i better download the game from here with 2 mb speed then download the 6 update than downloading this for days 8)
anyway cant wait for Honest Hearts dlc :d
i think skidow will release it tommorow with a 7 update so ill go rlslog pc and refresh every second :d"
,DDjusD,2011-05-19T04:22Z,"@Vegasbob - I'll probably just upload it as a different torrent.

@Dragon890274 - Yea, it may take a while to download but its worth it. People are seeding like they say they will, it's just not getting by. I will be seeding again once it re-downloads, my other computer died. I need a surge protector.

@DarkMerc - I've been sticking with this Update because all the Update 6's I've downloaded put a virus in my Main Boot Files. Once I find a trusted upload for either, I'll let you all know."
,SpeedXshadow,2011-05-28T08:24Z,"ok, i did all the steps for the game and it worked fine... until i entered the saloon after the doc patches you up at the begginning of the game! i was so damn excited and now i'm so damn dissappointed. please tell me you have a fix? it's like this, the first time i entered the saloon, my game stopped working and the comp froze so i restarted. the second time was when i loaded the save game back to the saloon and the loading froze... please help me. this is the closest i've gotten to a bloody WORKING fallout NV download and i REALLY want it to work... please help?"

,killerseemore,2011-06-08T00:07Z,"Hey im trying to download this and when i click download this torrent its says ""No input file specified."" and the Magnet link comes up with no information. Please help "
,Mafia200100,2011-06-23T15:14Z,"Needs more seeders, so I think I'll seed it for a while.

Also, I had to do a re-check twice for it to work, quite a few files were missing or corrupt. Not sure if that's just me, but what the hell."
,DDjusD,2011-07-22T10:11Z,"Sorry guys, I stopped playing Fallout New Vegas for the time being (mainly since I had to get a new update trying to get a cracked update). I would download this and seed but that will have to wait until I get another computer with more space.

Who knows. Sometime in the future I plan on buying a seedbox. If I do, I'll download this to it and seed with mega speeds, if nobody could seed it, I'll make another one, along with it, I will probably seed a lot of movies I've been downloading onto an external hard drive.

@SpeedXshadow - It's been so long since I've been on here, I almost forgot about this. It sounds like either a bad install. I'm not sure what could be causing it as I'm not the most tech savvy person.

@killerseemore - I'm not even going to answer this. Read the comments, you'll find the answer.

@Mafia200100 - Thanks! It was probably because I lost the files when my other computer got ruined and nobody downloaded all the useless files."
,DDjusD,2011-07-22T10:12Z,Meant because I had to get a new computer because the cracked update I downloaded was a virus that corrupted my Main Boot Records.
,liamf91,2011-08-08T16:30Z,"i hope this one becomes available again, both links dont work. 

looks like a great download, will down load when u start to seed again, or atleast upload it again as a different torrent."
,liamf91,2011-08-08T17:04Z,oh wait never mind
,liamf91,2011-08-08T19:43Z,awww stopped at 98.8% :(
,liamf91,2011-08-08T19:44Z,"just ppl know, if you use the magnet link and it looks like there isnt any data in when it comes up on ur software, dont worry it is there, thats what i first thought

although my download is stuck at 98.8% lol"
,starlightskies,2012-02-05T06:58Z,"I do not know when I try playing New Game,
The Game Crashed. I think I have already installed all including netframework and visual+"
,DredPriest,2012-02-13T04:48Z,How do I seed?
