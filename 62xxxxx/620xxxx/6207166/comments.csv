,xnamkcor,2012-01-08T19:32Z,"You, somehow managed to make the video less than 640x480 when DVD starts at 720x480. You used 128KB/s MP3 when DVD audio is perfectly transferable to the AVI container, and for a musical no less. If this were an NPR recording or some webcast, 128 would be acceptable, but for Les Mis? I do not think so. Also, where are the subtitles? I understand the point of this ""rip"" is to make the filesize smaller and make it more accessible, but you could have done much better."
