,Mshake,2011-08-12T05:39Z,"I've been using this site forever but I had to register after seeing this. Its $1,000 + of material here. Rather amazing. I plan to set aside an old 100gb external just for it. Much thanks. Amazing. Ill be seeding from till it finishes DL till this time next year. Ill check to see when/if you add the newer episodes between now and then."
,latino24m,2011-09-23T01:04Z,A10 V10. So i started downloading it yesterday and it took me approximately 22 hours to download it at 1.8Mbps. I will continue to seed for the next 48 hours.
,Mshake,2011-09-24T09:24Z,48 Hours huh? Sissy. Im going for 48 weeks unlimited. Only being uploaded at like 150kbs though. I know my Internet is better than that.
