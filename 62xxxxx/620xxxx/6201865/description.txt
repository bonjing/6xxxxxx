This is the official Mortal Online setup file(s) needed for installing the game.
In this torrent is included: Mortal Online Setup 1 through 3 as well as patch 1300002to1340824.
Remember to seed this torrent, since a lack of seeding is the reason the Mortal Online Launcher is so slow when it comes to downloading.

You can download the required client from their official site here: http://www.mortalonline.com/download-game-client

When you have installed the client, you must do the following:
Locate where the game is installed. For this example it's located at D:\Games\Star Vault\Mortal Online
Put the downloaded files (all of them) in the mortal online folder: D:\Games\Star Vault\Mortal Online\mortalonline

Run the Mortal Online client and it should say that it's downloading the files (which it aren't) and then it will start installing them.

Having trouble getting it to work? If you have Kaspersky, either add the game to your exclusions list, or temporarily pause your anti-virus while it's installing the game.
