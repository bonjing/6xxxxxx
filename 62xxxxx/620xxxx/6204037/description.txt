Because of some structure problem I couldn\'t make both subs watchable at the same time (except with VLC). English ones are working now, of course. If you want the French ones, just demux it, change in the subs .sup file \"21\" to \"20\", and the other way round, and reauthor it. This goes for all Gosha Hideo HK dvds.
