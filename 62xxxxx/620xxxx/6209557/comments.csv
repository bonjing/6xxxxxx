Sounds Good but it's not 320kbps

Thank you"
,Jahorse,2011-03-11T06:17Z,Most early releases aren't unless the uploader encoded it up to 320 kbps from a lower source which doesn't make it sound any better. Thank you for not unnecessarily doubling the file size to make it look like it was 320 kbps! Sounds great anyways.
,Jahorse,2011-03-11T06:20Z,P.S. - Any chance we can get the itunes bonus tracks? I know there's atleast Wu Crime
