I'm presenting this album to you all in two different qualities.
This album is hard to come by and after doing a stream recording some time ago, I finally came across what seems to be a retail cd rip.
The reason I'm presenting the stream recording and the rip I found in a dusty corner of the internet is that I actually enjoy both versions and decided to leacve it to you all as well to make up your own mind.
My guess it that Elliott Smith fans particularly may find this album interesting as the sound comes very close to his music sometimes and I would not be surprised if Blue-Eyed Son got some inspiration from the legacy Elliott left behind.
Decide for yourself & most of all: Enjoy!


Oh, just to mention it: the bonus tracks I collected myself from different websites (eg MySpace) and are VBR-MP3 stream recordings and have different qualities according to the quality they were offered in.






Blue-Eyed Son is an American indie rock band.

The title of the debut album West of Lincoln refers to the ocean west of Lincoln Boulevard, Santa Monica. "Blue-Eyed Son" may be a reference to a lyric in Bob Dylan's A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall, and the album features a cover of Dylan's "I Threw It All Away". The songs "When I Come Home" and "Step Away from the Cliff" have been featured on the medical drama Grey's Anatomy, and "Step Away from the Cliff" on the dark comedy Weeds. West of Lincoln has been described by Allmusic's Alex Henderson as a "softer, more acoustic guitar-friendly effort" than Heilprin's earlier work. Henderson goes on to say the album "has been greatly influenced by the Beatles' more psychedelic work of the late '60s." Also Elliott Smith fans might be charmed by the simular sound of the music.

Andrew Heilprin has removed his sonic smoke sunglasses to reveal a Blue-Eyed Son. Former front man for surf-punk band 40 Watt Domain, Andrew's musical focus has shifted gears into a stripped down, acoustic orchestration. On June 1st, Andrew's manifestation was released to the world, in the form of Blue-Eyed Son's West of Lincoln.

West of Lincoln draws on a wide variety of influences but still manages to be as unique as any child's sand castle masterpiece. Building on the back of Andrew and his acoustic guitar, the songs are layered with inspired piano and matched with up-tempo set drums that will help a person get out of bed in the morning. West of Lincoln is an album whose pace rises and falls with the tide, leaving the mark of an indelible listening experience.
