Hello Everyone Here Is Another Upload From Me.



The album received a positive review of 8.8/10 from the Metal magazine "Metalholic", with James Baysinger stating "One thing about DevilDriver, their style may not change much, and you know what youâ€™re gonna get, but it still kicks your ass every fucking time. That said, the intensity and anger of Fafara seem to have increased to a higher level in this album. Beast is full of extreme, harsh lyrics. Fafara, who says he was going through a dark time when he wrote this record, also had to move in with friends for a few weeks due to wildfires and attributes these as other factors in the albumâ€™s angrier works." and "Overall, this album is a major step forward for DevilDriver and they should enjoy even more success than they did with 2009â€²s Pray For Villains. And that record was pretty badass! Beast pounds your brain from beginning to end and there is no slowing this locomotive down. The added brutality should bring DevilDriver even more death metal fans as the Beast is truly unleashed upon the eager souls of millions of fans. And the restâ€¦well, I guess they are just grinfucked! Beast is a masterpiece of death metal brutality!"
