,uvs,2011-04-07T16:34Z,"FRONTLINE dispatches teams to Cairo, going inside the youth movement that helped light the fire on the streets. We follow the â€œApril 6thâ€ group, which two years ago began making a bold use of the Internet for their underground resistance â€” tactics that led to jail and torture for many of their leaders. Now, starting with the â€œDay of Rage,â€ we witness those same leaders plot strategy and head into â€œLiberation Squareâ€ to try to bring down President Mubarak. Also in this hour, veteran Middle East correspondent Charles Sennott of GlobalPost lands in Cairo for FRONTLINE to take a hard look at Egyptâ€™s Muslim Brotherhood â€” the most well-organized and powerful of the countryâ€™s opposition groups â€” as a new fight for power in Egypt begins to takes shape."
