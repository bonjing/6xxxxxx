The first big budget movie from the controversial director of Driller Killer and Bad Lieutenant features an unforgettable performance from Christopher Walken as gangland supremo Frank White. Recently released from prison, White sets out to be "King of New York" by gaining control of a multiracial gang of drug dealers - to the horror of the Traditional Mafia - and the city's poorest area.

But New York's streets have grown meaner since Frank last walked them. Enemies on both sides of the law are determined to stop him in his criminal and philanthropic ventures and the consequences can only be violent.
