Alan Bennett gives AA Milne's characters the voices you felt they were always meant to have in this collection of stories about Winnie the Pooh, Piglet, Tigger, Eeyore and Owl. Includes the BBC Radio CD collections 'Winnie the Pooh', 'The House at Pooh Corner' and 'A Party for Pooh'. I believe these 3 were also released in a single box set titled 'The Collection'.
