,relax999,2011-03-02T23:15Z,Extremly slow download
,scytheh,2011-03-06T06:35Z,"The original uploader is still uploading the file. It is at 64.2% at the moment and increasing. By the way: don't waste your time waiting for the download to complete, let torrific do the job. And yeah, google it."
,prototype4o8,2011-03-07T20:37Z,stuck at 65% 
,joaquimario,2011-03-08T20:41Z,"Great effort for the uploader. Next time you should do different. Anyway, I'll wait. Now it's in 71.4%."
