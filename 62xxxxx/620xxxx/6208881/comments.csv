,Jonasx,2012-06-13T23:00Z,"Subtitle issues. There are only full-subtitles, not ones specifically for non-english parts which is a must if you're softsubbing. This isn't the fault of the uploader (Bobnjeff uploads great stuff generally!), but there are *no* subs except full tracks for this release. Anywhere."
,Jonasx,2012-06-13T23:13Z,Found a fix for the subtitle issues: Download the non-english subs from the Refined 720p release and rename them. They seem to more or less match up. Great version otherwise.
