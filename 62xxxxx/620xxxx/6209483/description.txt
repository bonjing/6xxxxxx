Formed in 2008, Emptyhead were originally a trio consisting of Cathal Redmond on bass, Brian Steemers on drums and Michael Pender on guitar and synth. Ted Oâ€™Connor joined on vocals in the summer of 2009 and thus the band was complete. The name Emptyhead originates from an insult directed at one of the members and it stuck. The group brings together Rock, Hip Hop and Electronic influences to make a Pop-Prog style of dance rock.

They have recently released a self titled, 5 track EP which received a good review in Hot Press and are constantly writing new material.
