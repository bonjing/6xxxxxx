4th release from cheap production label Breakdown and this one was released in late Aug., 2004. The famous Seattle '76 soundboard and of course the same show of "By-Tor's Battle" etc. I would like to take March 28, 1976 (during "2112 tour" due to lack of synth arrangements or song order etc) for the date but widely known as October 25, 1976 ("ATWAS tour"). Anyways, this one sounds very good, I gave EX-, just like "By-Tor's Battle V2.01" but used different generation & root source tape than "By-Tor's Battle V2.01". Although the first cdr release of this show, "Seattle Supersonic" contains Ged's song introduction for "In the End", obviously placed on the top of side two of 90 minute tape, but "By-Tor's Battle V2.01" does not have that (so we know there are some separated way of tape succession). And this "2112 Seattle Night" has that introduce. The instruments are pretty well separated and it is a bit better than any other versions of this show and also has slightly warm bottom end I believe. But not so big difference. It's possible that because of the majore EQing.    (2004-09-21)
