The punk rock ladies of Sick of Sarah have released their record, 2205 on Adamant Records. The album itself is infused with dirty guitars, heavy drum beats, all strung up by lyrics that beat away all "chick-rock" clichÃ©s.

Spinning off the album name from their old home and rehearsal space, Sick of Sarah welcomes you into their "home" with the release 2205.
