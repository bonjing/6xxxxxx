Ultima Steganography 1.5


Ultima Steganography is an extremely easy-to-use steganography software for Windows. With the help of the program you can easily encrypt your secret files and hide them in a regular image file! Once a file is hidden in an image the saved picture is still a picture, it will load just like any other image and appear as it did before, the only difference will be that it contains a hidden file which can easily be extracted again with this or another steganography program. You will assign an encryption key to the image, which is necessary to retrieve the file using this or any other program. If the image is altered or edited in ANY way, the encrypted data has a chance of sustaining damage and becoming unrecoverable. Keep your private data safe with the help of Ultima Steganography!

This program is compatible with both 32 and 64-bit operating systems, and runs on Windows XP or later. Registration name and serial are in the text file. If this software works as stated for you, be sure to tell others here. Enjoy and please seed!
