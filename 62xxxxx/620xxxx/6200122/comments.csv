,jaidi,2011-02-25T05:28Z,"Thanks for the download Dean - as usual A10 V10.
I grow my own fruit and veg too, preserve a lot of them for the winter months, climate here in Bulgaria is perfect for this as weather wise we have four properly defined seasons. If I lived nearer to you I would come to do some digging for you as payment for the generosity that you have shown to me over these past years with the Corrie downloads. If I can be of any other assistance, let me know. X"
