,pjsmoke,2011-06-05T12:52Z,"Season 1-4 are good quality however I'd avoid season 5 if you hate people's hardcoded watermarks and the such. As soon as I saw that [napisy pl xvid asd] ""logos' at the bottom placed there by arseholes lol, I deleted that season and downloaded another and re-encoded it myself.

However, I appreciate guys like mkvGOD uploading the insane amount of tv shows he does in a logically sized files [so people actually seed] rather than those people who upload 80-100gb torrents and people just hit & run making the download take even more longer."
