,aarque,2011-03-02T10:30Z,"ah well considering the .bglman and .bglmanx cracks only worked in FS9 and you haven't noticed that yet, I wouldn't worry about it - unless of course you are also using FS9, in which case you would want to ask the creator of this torrent for the FS9 version if it conflicts with komu's spyware

,TopazMan,2011-03-02T13:03Z,it works super but if you use komu's bglman (FSDT crack it doesn't work and ive got the QW ServcPack installed to. well thats the way it is for me. you have a choice QW757 or Komu's FSDT
,camus_to,2011-03-02T19:07Z,"User's comment: It's working!! Just follow the instructions carefully with DON'T RUN the ""add on manager"", this great bird will be with you."
,mickyfinnny,2011-03-02T19:18Z,"Copy the gauges folder from FS 9 version to the one with sp2 updated FSX version,and it is fully working:+)"

,Skankzter,2011-03-06T17:47Z,"Ok, i didnt realise all the liverys were the same for all models..Service pack to from QW website doesnt work...4 downloads all diffrent sizes..40mb, 86mb, 114mb...should be 196 mb.i got it here   and it worked.thats link is SP2..the SP2 *update* from QW site worked for me.With thanks and lots of man love ( not the gay type lol) to cruzu for uploading...i dont have nothing uploaded but to contribute the best i can i will seed..My pc is on most of the day..thanks again.Flys really nice, FPS seems good."

,1742,2011-04-18T09:22Z,Every time I download service pack 2 it is corrupt. I have downloaded it now at least four times now and it's size is 194mb which I believe should be 196mb. Please help this is really pissing me off. I have even deleted my cache and temporary files with no avail. 
,GWBushJnr,2011-04-20T16:41Z,"@roume1
Could you check B757 and sceneries are working during nite time. Thanks"
,saintamadas,2011-04-22T19:56Z,Thanks Cruzu for this wonderful machine. kinda check QW's website to download the SP 2 as recommended all i got was 194mb. Had to ask someone to download to confirm my system might be the cause to no avail.Was hoping if someone here that has the the SP2 kindly upload so we don't have to visit QW website as i want to believe the SP2 was compromised on purpose due to the fact that people are not buying the product anymore and downloading the pack. I maybe wrong. Any solution out of this impasse will be highly appreciated. Skankzter if your download is complete perhaps you can assist?
