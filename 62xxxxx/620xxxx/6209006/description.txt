"Stomp Stomp, I've arrived!" struts the opening lyric of Jessie J's debut single, 'Do It Like A Dude' â€“ a heavy urban-pop tune set to juddering beats and laced with her own brand of ghetto-fabulous, sordid swagger.

The instantaneous skank-inducing debut has already picked up airplay from the likes of Twin B, 1Xtra and Mista Jam, Radio 1, with the white hot remix from man-of-the-moment and good pal Labrinth rocketing Jessie J straight to the top of the HypeMachine chart in under 24 hours - all an impressive 3 months ahead of release.

The 22-year old, Essex-born songwriter has penned tunes for the likes of Alicia Keys, toured with Chris Brown and notably wrote Miley Cyrus's Number One billboard smash 'Party In The USA!' While her multi-octave voice and self-made attitude has earned Jessie J the respect of music's glitterati; from Justin Timberlake commenting 'Who is the best singer? Jessie J!', to Cyndi Lauper pulling her on stage at Shepherds Bush to sing her legendary anthem 'Girls Just Wanna Have Fun' alongside her.

'Do It Like A Dude' is a ghetto chic, crotch-grabbing, urban-pop diamond amongst the rough which cements Jessie J's debut album firmly in place as one of the most anticipated releases of 2011.
