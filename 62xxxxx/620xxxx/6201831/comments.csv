,juanadearco,2011-02-27T05:50Z,in spanish also?
,lookwhoshere_wow,2011-02-28T09:18Z,It says reading and then it says open tray... NOT WORKING :(
,mhrteam,2011-02-28T12:35Z,Because you have to wait until release
,lookwhoshere_wow,2011-02-28T15:15Z,MASI50 - It is ap2.5 man... Don't give wrong information... I burned and wasted 2 dvd's thanks to your comment saying it's not ap2.5.
,FLAMinEK,2011-02-28T19:28Z,"lookwhoshere_wow
open tray means firmware needs updating to LT+
black screen then dirty disc means failed ap25 challenge/response, logged for a ban,check with xval (LT+ protects from this just turn console off/on within 3 mins when at black screen to bypass dirty disc screen and consoole logging ap25 fail).
they can release ap25 in a title update like they did with mw2,halo reach ect but again if you got LT+ your protected.thanks c4eva (make a donation if you appreciate his work).
This game is currently ap25 free & wave 6.

,FLAMinEK,2011-03-02T10:34Z,"the SSv2 for this iso is on abgx but as it matches the SSv1 on the game you will need to manually patch the SSv2 as autofix won't to be live safe.

lookwhoshere_wow are u using verbatim,did u burn at 2.4,did u set layerbreak 1913760?if yes then I have no idea m8 soz."
