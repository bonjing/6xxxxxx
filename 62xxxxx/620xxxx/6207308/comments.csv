,dexy19,2011-04-20T10:08Z,Wow! This is great! Thanks!
,aienment,2011-05-10T07:47Z,Great upload man. Hope the quality would be a lil bit better. Thnx a lot.
,Atheist22,2011-12-05T05:10Z,yes i love real avi hd and it gets a bad rap for some reason but its better then mkv or even mp4 hd funny thing is that most the avi you will find on here is shit because its transcoded in sd resolution e.g you can have a fantastic looking 700mb movie transcoded at 1080p then one thats transcoded at 480p and its just the screen resolution .... avi still is the best. the only problem is noobs downloading a miss labeld torrents and then saying all hd avi sucks so other people wont download noob: oh i checked to see what the files said there avi D: dont download..... ummm did you watch the fucking video??? no then dont give a fucking torrent a bad name unless you have checked it completely    
,fillinthisspace,2012-01-14T13:42Z,"""you can have a fantastic looking 700mb movie transcoded at 1080p"" - Atheist22

Every so often I read a comment that really makes me laugh. Thanks for that. The irony that is came from a person who's one and only upload has been someone else's torrent consisting of MKV files is what really did it for me.

No that I'm bagging this torrent at all, I just find it amusing when people who obviously have no idea what they're talking about use the word ""noob""."

,TyMod,2012-05-18T05:32Z,"THANK....YOU!

After playing the game and watching an episode or 2 on AMC I decided I would give the series a try.

What better then to watch it in HD with high quality surround! :)

Thanks a shit ton mate."
