,mhawkebert68,2011-09-02T02:00Z,"@pinzmoo

i haven't tried this torrent, but it sounds like you need to play with your gfx plugin settings. do a google search for ""best config for ff9"" and look for a link to ngemu.com. follow posts instructions exactly. should fix it."

,VinnyT85,2012-03-23T04:08Z,"For anyone confused with how to get these running for ePSXe Emulator, it's best to go to the FAQ Section on the emulators website

http://www.epsxe.com/files/ePSXe_FAQ.txt

You will need to configure it with a BIOS and plugins. All of which is explained in the above link :)

BTW - Awesome torrent, I have all the original PSX games but my PSX and PS2 no longer work properly. Brings back many memories of wasted hours during high school. Will seed this for a while :D"
