[T],PeteSapai,2011-02-28T23:05Z,"Yes, I have (I never comment on quality without listening) and I can hear its low quality effects, but I know a lot of people can't disscern 128kbps (or even lower) from original/lossless. If you're one of those people, that's good for you and I hope you enjoy it :) If you aren't, I suggest waiting a day or two until a quality release shows up."
