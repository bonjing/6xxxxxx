In Older Brother, Younger Sister, director Mikio Naruse's adaptation of an oft-filmed popular novel by Saisei MurÃ´, the eldest daughter (Machiko KyÃ´) of a rural family comes home pregnant, testing some already tenuous family bonds.   Naruse shows his considerable skill at portraying household dynamics, filming KyÃ´ in relaxed and/or reclining positions (indicative of her character's exhaustively maintained independence) that are then intruded upon by her ill-tempered older brother (Masayuki Mori), whose initially comic, brute-force presence grows increasingly menacing and treacherous as the film progresses. Among the stand-out sequences: an illuminative interlude by a river where several hundred townspeople let loose a flurry of small model boats carrying candles and a bittersweet scene where KyÃ´ and her bookish younger sister return home, after some world-wearying big city experiences, along literally divergent country roads that eventually intersect.

A snippet from the Film Society of Lincoln Center:
In Older Brother, Younger Sister, the ground floor of the family home is a vast space offering neither solace nor protection to the family members, who occupy it like travelers at a rest stop; an emblematic shot shows the angry brother in the foreground, with the pregnant and unmarried sister and the resigned, fatalistic mother isolated in separate areas of the background.
