Question to all -

Why aren't subtitles included in most of these torrents? I am sure that subs are included on most retail BluRay discs and retail DVDs but they seem to be ignored by rippers. Subs are so so small but very precious for someone who does not hear so well (and for people who play the volume down low for various reasons). I know subs can be found on the web but it can be hit or miss. I wish the scene would come up with some standard for movie releases regarding the kind of information provided in the NFO and, of course, subtitles. I just don't understand why subtitles aren't automatically included in BluRay or DVD rips like this, especially in Matroska containers which can hold audio, video, and subtitles in a single file. Hopefully someone more knowledgeable than I will fill in the blanks here."
