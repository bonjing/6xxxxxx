Comments :
It is just another day at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), 
a few astronauts were repairing a satellite until, out of nowhere, a series of 
asteroids came crashing into the shuttle, destroying it. These asteroids also 
decimated New York soon thereafter. Then, NASA discovered that there is an asteroid 
roughly the size of Texas heading towards the Earth, and when it does hit the Earth, 
the planet itself and all of its inhabitants will be obliterated, worse, the asteroid 
will hit the Earth in 18 days. Unfortunately, NASA's plans to destroy the asteroid are 
irrelevant. That is when the U.S. military decides to use a nuclear warhead to blow 
the asteroid to pieces. Then, scientists decide to blow the asteroid with the warhead 
inside the asteroid itself. The only man to do it, is an oil driller named Harry Stamper 
and his group of misfit drillers and geologists. As he and his drill team prepare for 
space excavation..
