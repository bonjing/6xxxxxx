,alex0008,2011-07-18T07:57Z,"I watched this film (Young Guns II) several times when I was living alone for the first time in my life.

It was kind of a ""the world is now completely open to you"" time for me, and somehow this film really relates, or something like that.

To the uploader - Thank you very much!"
