@thetorrentbitchlord  Dude, you are getting this for free.  So it take a minute for the vid file to uncompress, so the fuck what?  If you don't want rar'd files, then start some torrents up that aren't.

Mainly since we lost some of the 720p poster recently, no one should be bitching that we are getting some.

Seriously, your very fucking ungrateful.

I also think rar's shouldn't be used. People probably seed better if they don't need twice the HDD space (rared+unrared). I know I seed more if it's uncompressed.

But thanks anyway!"

All you have to do is click the .rar file from the file list in your torrent client, then click the file that pops up in the extraction box.  No exctracting.  No folder creation.  Just rwo mouse clicks and the thing will launch, or at least it will with VLC. If all you do with you zip app is extract videos, you can set the default app for zip files as VLC, and VLC will launch them directly.  I think I can handle two mouse clicks as opposed to one.  Thanks for the upload!"
