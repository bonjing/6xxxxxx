VSO Image Resizer
Version: 4.0.3.2


Resize and convert
Resize pictures or convert them into different formats easily. Select your output resolution, create a copy, resize the original, move and/or rename files, or compress them and choose a specific destination for your processed images. Work on individual photos or edit large numbers of images by doing a batch resize in just one click. 

 
Extra settings
Add your own watermark to protect your work or add a copyright to photos with html-like text formatting and transparency support.  Customize pictures by converting them to sepia or add a border. Use the live preview to see what the final result will look like before actually processing the image. Image Resizer works on files, folders and subfolders, and supports RAW formats.  With multi-core support integrated, convert images even faster. Launch the application easily from Windows shell explorer with a right click on the image or folder.  

 
Output and export
Photos can be added directly as attachments, individually or in a ZIP file, to email by using the publish function, without exceeding the maximum size permitted by email servers. Create PDF files from your images, like jpg to PDF; do this for individual or multiple images. Edit, create, export, backup new profiles with your favorite settings. The most popular profiles are already pre-defined, such as FULL HD resolution wallpaper images, Ipod, NTSC, 640x480. Access to profiles in 1 click with the shell integration.  

 
Digital frame
Transfer photos and optimize space on digital frames with the Digital Picture Frame Wizard. Resize pictures to the frameâ€™s supported resolution, and add even more photos for viewing!
