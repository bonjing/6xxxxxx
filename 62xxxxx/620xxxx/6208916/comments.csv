Cheers"
,1shankly1,2011-03-02T21:32Z,Always welcome. Happy listening. 
,mrwout,2011-03-05T16:47Z,Thanks again for another splendid mixtape. You are doing the music industry a great service: I wouldn't buy half the CDs I buy now without your compilations !!
,thepdw,2011-03-08T01:53Z,Thanks so much! Still missing those dance compilations ;-)
,mattyjmorr,2011-03-10T21:07Z,Does anyone have any idea why I can't seem to download any of shankly's files any more? I haven't been able to download in a few months.

,mattyjmorr,2011-03-16T23:35Z,"Thanks but I can download other (inferior) mixtapes from the Pirate Bay, but not Shankly's. :("
,thepdw,2011-04-04T00:58Z,Try his mixtapes that are listen on BTjunkie.
,thepdw,2011-04-04T01:00Z,Ehh listed*
,mattyjmorr,2011-04-05T22:30Z,"Awesome! It works!
Shanks - can you put all future torrents on BTJunkie too please?"
