Able to flit gracefully between sultry, come-hither coos and emotive yelps, Ices' vocals are indeed impressive, and while most of Necima's material calls for somber intonations, she displays a knack for accessing even the hard-to-reach upper registers. Of course, beautiful singing alone does not a great record make, and here Vernhes is on hand to infuse nuance into the album's arrangements. He puts to use a bevy of divergent instrumentation-- electric guitar, bass clarinet, various organs, a Colombian hand drum, and many others-- to add texture and unexpected flourishes of sound throughout. When Ices and Vernhes find a creative symbiosis, usually on the record's shorter, pop-leaning tracks, the results are spectacular.
