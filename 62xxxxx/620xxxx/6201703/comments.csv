bootcamp is 4 free"
,limeguy,2011-03-12T15:31Z,"adolf_h: Yes, but Apple's downloads are painfully slow. At least torrents get progressively faster..."
,gbean,2011-04-11T00:25Z,"Hey, for some reason the original boot camp Assistant application dissapeared from my intel based mac, first set up with leopard. Could you tell me which installation disk (1 or 2) has boot camp on it and how to get it back?"
,boring123,2011-04-16T08:24Z,Do these updaters require an earlier version of Boot Camp to work?
,limeguy,2011-04-24T01:27Z,"@gbean: You want to find the disk labeled ""Mac OS X"" Disk 1, or something similar. 

@boring123: I just called Apple about the same issue, it seems that 3.1 will install without 3.0 from your Mac OS X DVD. "
