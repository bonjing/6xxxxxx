This torrent contains Boot Camp Updates 3.1 and 3.2, for both the x86 and x64 Architectures. If you don\'t know what any of that meant, you shouldn\'t be installing Windows on your Mac in the first place.

Also remember, you install these inside your Windows installation AFTER you install the base Boot Camp drivers from your Mac OSX dvd.
