                Sarah's ambitions for her school find their focus in
                Lydia Holly, the gifted eldest child of a labourer
                and his wife who live with their six children in a
                shanty town on the fast eroding South Riding cliffs.
                Meanwhile, Joe Astell's housing scheme runs into
                problems in the form of his fellow councillors, who
                are more interested in lining their own pockets than
                in public works. And Robert Carne, haunted by
                memories of his beautiful wife Muriel, must face the
                consequences of a life spent paying for an act of
                madness a decade and a half before.
