All polydor/polygram cd's from the 80's, in general the best sounding Abba cd's. 
From Arrival-Visitors go for the Polydor/Polygram. For the "Abba" go with the Polar 1988. For the first two albums, eithe
r CSR 2005 or Polar 1988, Swedish pressing, but are very hard to find. Anyone?

Compilation:
Abba Greatest hits vol. 2
One of the best sounding Abba cd's. Audiophile by Abba standards. Contains the best sounding version of for example: Danc
ing Queen, Knowing me Knowing you etc.

Atlantic cd 16009. Canadian pressing.	

Abba Polcd-262: Abba "Abba" 1975. POLCD-262 (1988). Audiophile.
Best sounding: 1988 Polar [one of the best Abba CD's ever made]
Very hard to get-cd. If you're an audiophile Abba listener you know which cd this is.
