In Princess Maker 2, the second game in the series, you play a swordsman who adopts a ten-year-old girl, Olive, and raises her to the age of 18. The player controls the girl's schedule from the age of 10, filling it with activities such as education, part-time work, adventure and free time. During 'adventures', the player controls the girl directly, using a top-down view similar to that seen in RPGs of that period. As with the other games in the series the girl's eventual fate is decided when she reaches 18 years of age, based on her experience and statistics. Princess Maker 2 is the only game of the series to have been officially translated into English. However, the translation was never finished and the game was never officially published. The translation was leaked onto the internet and is considered abandonware, despite a statement from SoftEgg requesting that it not be distributed. This game was re-released in Japan in a 'Refine Edition' with enhanced graphics.
