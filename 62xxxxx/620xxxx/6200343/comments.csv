,caprikornius,2011-07-20T17:59Z,how can you guys rate video as 10?? the torrent says 720p but its description says hight: 528. I just donÂ´t understand. is it HD or not? just be honest. Its just that i donÂ´t understand why some guys post their torrents as HD 720p but the description of the torrent says otherwise
