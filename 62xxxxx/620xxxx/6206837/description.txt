         In the early 1980's there was someone killing    
         the children of Atlanta. Eventually a single     
         man was caught and convicted in one of the       
         largest manhunts in our nation's history. Ever   
         since the case has been closed until four        
         years later two reporters investigate charges    
         that the original investigation was filled       
         with errors and tainted evidence. They seek to   
         find the truth behind the Atlanta Child          
         Murders.
