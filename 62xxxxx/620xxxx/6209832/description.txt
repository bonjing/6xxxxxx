PLOT

Frances O'Brien, devout Catholic and panic disorder  sufferer,
runs a very tight  ship at the Middleton  Interactive Learning
Centre, a modern outer suburban library. Always quick to point
out she "doesn't make the rules" when in fact she does when it
comes  to  her  library. Despite  the  chronic  vandalism, the
dysfunctional staff and her own particular challenges with the
ever-growing  Muslim   community,  Frances   wears  her   Head
Librarian's badge with relief.
No more so than during the head period leading up to Book Week
- precisely the moment her life suddenly takes a turn for  the
worse!

EPISODE SUMMARY

Episode 3.01: Mother Of Pearl

Frances is devastated when she learns that her mother,  Pearl,
suffering   from   both  dementia   and   a  really   horrible
personality, needs full time care. But to make matters  worse,
a  government  bureaucrat  Xavier  Fisher  rules  that  public
libraries are to turn a profit or face closure.
With a million dollars to raise, Frances appoints Dawn to head
up  the  fundraising campaign.  But  getting the  rest  of the
Middleton Interactive  Learning Centre  staff motivated  isn't
easy. Matthew is  pursuing a book  deal; Nada is  fighting off
advances from her ex-husband Hasan, Neil has a new  girlfriend
Jane, and Ky is busy planning his wedding day.
On the home front, Terry tells Frances he's reforming his  80s
tribute band  Oils Ain't  Oils. If  that's not  enough to send
Frances  over the  edge, she  learns that  her detestable  mum
Pearl  has run  up an  unimaginable debt  and ends  up on  the
O'Brien's doorstep.
