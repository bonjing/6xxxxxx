,Kiberia,2011-02-25T20:21Z,Does LAN work or it has Gayspy?
,Kiberia,2011-02-26T13:03Z,"Don't download. Not because torrent has viruses or something. It's just this game... sucks! No coop mode as was stated, no multiplayer either. You will be in the first room for 10-15 minutes. And in the second one too. I didn't go any further, 'cause it was boring as hell.

PS. I completed the original game Painkiller."

,zippyderppyguy,2011-03-09T07:27Z,"Ok, gotta ask... First, Skidrow, you do good work... But, why do I always see a steps flaw on your rips? 

2.mount
3.etc
4.etc
5. buy if you like it

Notice the flaw? I see it on Skidrow games all the time... Inside joke? Is downloading the missing step 1?? It baffles me....... Just wondering."

,LoydMongo,2012-04-17T15:11Z,"Thanks SKIDROW & extremezone, great dlspeed and works great! Well, except I can't update the game. This is the 1.01b version and I want the 1.03a. Downloaded the Painkiller_Redemption_103a_EN_ddpatch.exe from GamersHell, but it says Painkiller Redemption is not installed. What to do? Anyone know where I could get the patch as separate files and just overwrite the old ones or something?"
