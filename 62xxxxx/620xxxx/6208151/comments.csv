,kaduzy,2011-02-28T13:58Z,"Can you please help me?  I downloaded this torrent and wound up with many different files organized into CD file folders, all with the extensions ""cd1.hdtv.xvid-2hd.r00"" or ""cd1.hdtv.xvid-2hd.r01"" etc. and my Mac will not play them!!  I am dying to watch this show and I live overseas so options are limited!  PLEASE, do you know how to convert these files into something my computer will play back?  Right now it doesn't even recognize them as video files, it says they're all documents!!"
,osku3000,2011-02-28T14:15Z,"kaduzy, you are truly rookie. Use Winrar to unzip the files."
,arkot111,2011-02-28T14:23Z,You need RAR arhive program. can be found at http://www.rarlab.com/ or all over the web
,piratjenka,2011-02-28T14:25Z,"hi kaduzy,
sorry if I misunderstand your question, but in my mac viewer the files show up as rar:s, in other words zipped files that you have to open with zipeg or some other expander. then you get the video file that can be opened with vlc or whatever player you prefer.
cheers!"
,lenny_ray,2011-02-28T14:33Z,"@kaduzy - They're archive files. You have to extract them to get the video format files. I use WinRar on a PC laptop. An equivalent for Mac would be Stuffit Expander. This guide will tell you how to do it, if you're not familiar. http://www.ehow.com/how_2091902_open-rar-files-mac.html"
,DreamsofBeingChased,2011-02-28T15:40Z,Thanks a lot for the torrent. I'm so desperate to watch this.
,alfred421,2011-02-28T16:04Z,"Okay, my question is like kaduzy. So I downloaded the torrent and I'm looking at all the rar files and r# files. But who do I get them all to work with each other even if I unzip them all? What do I have to do to get them run as one video not clips? I hope someone gets what I'm trying to ask. Thanks"
,hotrod666,2011-02-28T17:12Z,"how to view files for rookies..

1. download winrar (google it)
2. install it !!!
3. goto cd 1 folder, right click on 83rd.annual.academy.awards.cd1.hdtv.xvid-2hd.rar and select extract here. and wait to complete. 
4. do the same in each folder."
,piratjenka,2011-02-28T18:48Z,"alfred421,
I don't know how to make a ""playlist"" out of the three clips, but what's the problem with opening them seperately after each viewing?
=/"
[V],AiTB,2011-02-28T19:21Z,"you don't really need to unrar,
some players like bsplayer or vlc can play files from archives
open ...rar file"
[T],theburningbush,2011-02-28T19:40Z,"I hope those of you new to rar files have now figured out what you need. If you need more help, try these links: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAR and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7-Zip . I use 7-Zip under Windows for decoding rar files; works flawlessly for me. (Every time some whiner complains about someone posting rar files -- which hasn't happened in this thread -- I feel like slapping them up against a wall for being such pussy whining lamers!!)

As for taking the three AVI files resulting from this torrent and creating a playlist, do what I do: in the same folder where the AVIs are, create a file named .m3u, the contents of which are a list of the files in the order you want them played. Then just open the m3u file in your favorite media player, kick back, and enjoy.

For this torrent, the content of the m3u file would be:
83rd.annual.academy.awards.cd1.hdtv.xvid-2hd.avi
83rd.annual.academy.awards.cd2.hdtv.xvid-2hd.avi
83rd.annual.academy.awards.cd3.hdtv.xvid-2hd.avi

If you insist on having one big AVI file, Google ""concatenate avi files"" sans quotes."

,ubisuck,2011-03-02T15:38Z,"@ AiTB:

Thank you for both files (red carpet too)

Great work as always ;-)"
,kellorfull,2011-03-03T04:53Z,"I downloaded the whole file but when I go and extract CD1, it worked all the way up till the 22nd one. 
a window popped up saying ""The contents of the file ""83rd.annual.academy.awards.cd1.hdtv.xvid-2hd.r22"" can not be extracted with this program.""
and i am on a mac"
,aziul,2011-03-09T14:21Z,kaduzy your a noob one im just a kid and i know this stuff
,mandarp,2011-03-11T01:52Z,subtitles ???
,asjam,2012-01-25T12:29Z,Thanks so much. To find this available a year later was terrific. It's a great show in a very accessible and high quality format.
