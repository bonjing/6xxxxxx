Jew Bankers Piss on Morals. 



In reality, the issue is very simple. The (jew) bank is the only source of the
dollars you use to fuel everything you do. So they give each of you some
dollars, but attach interest to each and every dollar you get. Since there is a
debt attached to every cent in circulation, even giving up every last penny in
America would never pay back the debt. The debt itself is over and above
every last cent ever created by the privately jew owned non-federal reserve.
Thus there is no escape once the system is in place. This is why as long as any
amount of interest is applied to money, it is to be considered usury. The only
way to fix it is to abolish the system completely and start anew, because this
model is designed to wreck you.

This is the game of the money changers, and it hasnâ€™t changed for thousands of
years. This didnâ€™t just start yesterday, itâ€™s happened to almost every nation on
earth.
