,Nickyboy7,2011-02-26T13:50Z,"I think this is the last episode of season 4. Longest season yet. Look forward to all your future GA uploads, thanks a lot for this."
[T],trialNerror,2011-02-26T16:24Z,"You're right Nick, this is the season finale.
Enjoy."
[T],trialNerror,2011-02-27T04:04Z,"Okay, maybe there is no HD version.  =|  
I've been peeking around and usually YouTube will indicate there being an HD rip, but the vids on there are from the standard broadcast and not Travel HD.  One of them being the same as mine and another that has the extra 15 seconds of intro sequence is also non-HD (can tell by the Travel Channel logo at the lower right).  So, for the time being it still appears that this is as good as it's gonna get."

,nonchalant713,2011-02-27T23:05Z,"thanks!
anyone have ep21?"
[T],trialNerror,2011-02-28T03:12Z,"Due to the mix up of episode numbers, what some are looking for as episode 21 is listed as episode 19.

The Valentine's Day Special is posted as episode 18 or 20, and technically there is no episode 21 listed.  Ugh. Very confusing! So sorry!  

I'll post the COMPLETE Season to possibly help fill in the voids and clear up the confusion of episode list."
,DirengreyxDeathgaze,2011-05-10T07:42Z,"You know, it would help alot if you'd just post anywhere what house they investigated. Problem solved.

With that said, is this the episode where they investigate Madame Tussauds Was Museum? Considering they investigated that for episode 22"
