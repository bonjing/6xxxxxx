Coach to Vienna is one of the basic works of the Czech new wave, but due to the absency of any editions (well, there is vhs, but no subtitles) almost unknown in the world. The plot is quite simple and focuses on an artistic elaboration rather. Husband from a woman were killed by german soldiers and a widow shortly after that meets another (austrian) soldiers, on whom she wants to take revenge. They together are heading on her coach slowly to Vienna...
