It looks as if a 2D smoother has been applied - like leaves on trees are pretty much one color, solid, while contrast areas are still pretty high res. Looks like a cartoon, more or less.

V: 3 (or 8, if the source is as bad)
A: 10"

THE VIDEO IS GOOD, it's MPCHC that fucks up.

Sorry for dissing, don't listen to my first post.

Thanks for the up, and sorry for the misunderstanding."
,KickassWashingMachine,2011-05-11T01:47Z,"Okay, final rant, MPCHC is also good, it's this awful ATI card. Damn, what a piece of shit hardware. No way I'm ever buying ATI again. Completely unable to produce a signal to my plasma, and the defaults are to mangle video to the point where everything looks like a fucking cartoon. Christ almighty :("
,ninline,2011-05-23T18:55Z,I can't say about ATI hardware since the linux drivers for their cards are such shit as to be almost totally useless.  I'm in a Nvidia only world now because ATI can't or wont write decent drivers.  Conversely the Nvidia drivers are equivalent to their windoze software.
