Plot outline:
In 740 A.D., in Britain, the disciple of Merlin Maxim Horvath joins to the wicked Morgana le Fay and betrays his master. However, the other two disciples of Merlin Balthazar Blake and Veronica defeat the evil and Balthazar traps Horvath in a magic vessel and Veronica merges with Morgana and they are trapped in another recipient. Along the centuries, Balthazar unsuccessfully seeks out the Prime Merlian, the only sorcerer capable to destroy Morgana, using a dragon ring and he finally finds him in the present days in Manhattan. The clumsy nerd Dave Stutler is chosen by a magic dragon ring and Balthazar teaches magic to him. However the sorcerer's apprentice is in love with Becky Barnes and questions whether he is really the chosen one.
