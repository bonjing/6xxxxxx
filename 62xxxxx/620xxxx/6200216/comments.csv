you are really requested to guide me if the link shown below has an English menu and English subtitle
New Moon (2009) Fan Edition PAL DVD9

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5753352

would be really helpful for me
thanks"
,Night_89,2011-03-01T03:31Z,"I have downloaded many of your torrents in which you din `t mention English dvd menu and English sub but it was included in it
e.g. Titanic deluxe edition
New moon is of 20GB that is much for my 100Kb/s

that`s why I asked you for surety
sorry
I will download it and then check it myself"

Yea, you are right.. Sorry for my harsh reply. I was in a bad mood last night. Shouldn't be modding when I'm in that mood ;)

It does not have english subs."
