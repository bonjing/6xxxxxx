TESLA THE GREAT RADIO CONTROVERSY
Label Geffen
Original Year 1989
Format: Mp3@320

For their second Geffen Records studio release, Tesla unleashed an excellent set of bluesy metal and straight-rockin' '80s arena anthems on The Great Radio Controversy. With a title and theme derived from conflicting claims of who invented the radio made by Italian scientist and the band's namesake Guglielmo Marconi, the album strays a bit from the aqua-netted template of the glam metal era. Opting for a T-shirt and jeans image, front man Jeff Keith's sandpaper-coated vocals embody the band's emotionally energetic and slightly rootsy style. Guitarists Frank Hannon and Tommy Skeoch perfectly compliment each other's standout harmonic leads, which play nicely over Brian Wheat's solid low end and Troy Luccketta's time-keeping. This album also features the hit single "Love Song," which was a notable success for the band and received considerable MTV airplay, solidifying an ever-growing mainstream fan base.
