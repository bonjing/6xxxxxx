Ok, so I tried to find a descent single-file xvid of this one, but most of them were jerky as hell. Then I got my hands on the 2Lions-Team NL DVDR rip and it was smooth and nice, so I decided I'd give it a try.

And behold, here it is.

I'm not entirely satisfied with the video quality, but then again, I don't do this so often...
so I don't know if the quality is normal for the video resolution and compression rate.

I'll let you decide instead.
