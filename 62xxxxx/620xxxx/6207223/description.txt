While American popcorn-eating tourists wobble around Paris and pigeons are too fat to fly, a starving French gendarme is desperate for food. Watching the birds feast on cakes and crumbs brought by an old lady, he slowly realizes that his best chance of survival is to dress up like a pigeon and try to trick the old lady into feeding him as well. The old lady doesn't seem to suspect anything and serves the oversized man-bird all kinds of food in her home, and while he slowly gets fatter and fatter, the line between man and bird is getting blurry. And when he at last finds out what he has gotten himself into, it's far too late to turn back...
