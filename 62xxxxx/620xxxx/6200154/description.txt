INSTALLATION:
Use an Emulator to run the games.
Recommended: ePSXe 1.6 or 1.7

I have also uploaded the emulator to run this game on the following link

NAMCO MUSEUM VOL 1:
This was the first in the long series for the PlayStation and contains Pac-Man (1980), Rally-X (1980), New Rally-X (1981), Galaga (1981), Bosconian (1981), Pole Position (1982), and Toy Pop (1986), which was relatively unknown.

All of the games were ported from the original arcade version's source code â€” Galaga and Pac-Man allowed for an alternative screenmode to compensate for the lack of vertical monitor, whereby the scoreboard was located on the left of the screen, or rotated the image 90 degrees if the user possessed a vertical monitor or was willing to risk placing the television/monitor on its side.

The control systems of six of the games were well preserved. Since the PlayStation's analog controller was not available at the time, and analog control for Pole Position is only supported in this compilation by Namco's neGcon joypad.

The package also featured a "museum" mode where the player could walk through a virtual museum containing various curiosities surrounding the games including images of the mainboards, marketing material and conceptual artwork (all from the Japanese releases; neither this nor the others contain any American materials). For this reason, the games themselves are based on the Japanese releases, although for the U.S. the games retain their U.S. changes (i.e., Pac-Man is still "Pac-Man", as opposed to "Puckman"; the ghosts still have their U.S. names, etc.).

NAMCO MUSEUM VOL 2:
The second installment of the PlayStation series features Mappy (1983), Xevious (1982), Galaga sequel Gaplus (1984), Grobda (1984) (a Xevious "spinoff"), Dragon Buster (1984) and Super Pac-Man (1982) (in western versions), and Cutie Q (1979). Although Cutie Q is only playable in the Japanese version, its code can be found on the American release of this compilation. It enjoyed similar success to the original, and contained a similar "museum" mode. The Japanese version also features Bomb Bee (1979) as a hidden game. There is a glitch in this volume where in Dragon Buster the high score is not saved properly. It is shown in the record book, but does not appear in-game. The default hi-score is 10,000.

NAMCO MUSEUM VOL 3:
The third PlayStation volume contains Galaxian (1979), Dig Dug (1982), Pac-Man sequel Ms. Pac-Man (1981), Pole Position II (1983), The Tower of Druaga (1984) and Phozon (1983). The first four were well-known in the U.S., but the latter two were relatively unknown. It contained the now-customary museum mode. Two unique versions of The Tower of Druaga were also hidden in this volume. One called "Another Tower", and the other called "Darkness Tower". Both are harder than the original and require different methods to beat the game.

Volume 4 for the PlayStation features Pac-Land (1984), Assault (1988), Ordyne (1988), the sequel to The Tower of Druaga known as The Return of Ishtar (1986) Genpei TÅma Den (1986), and Assault Plus (1988) as a hidden game. The usual museum mode was included. Genpei TÅma Den was renamed "Genji and the Heike Clans" in this collection.
