After a botched mission in Cuba, professional mercenary Shale and his crew Joey 
Six, Hollan, Rem, and Wellman head home to Miami, Florida, where Shale is reunited
with his fiance Jane Hetzko, who is a history teacher at Columbus High School in
Miami. Some of Jane's students happen to be members of a street gang known as the
"Kings of Destruction" (KOD), led by Juan Lacas, who has been terrorizing Jane.
After Jane's kneecap is broken by a big seminole named Bull, she tells Shale that
she believes Lacas ordered the attack, so Shale goes undercover as Jane's
substitute, and initially, Jane has no idea that Shale is doing this. At the
school, Shale meets principal Claude Rolle, librarian Hannah Dillon, and english
and drama teacher Darrell Sherman. It turns out that Lacas is one of Jane's
students. As Shale investigates the attack on Jane, he discovers that drugs are
being circulated into the school...
