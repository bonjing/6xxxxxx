Thanks in advance"
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-02-28T11:20Z,"God, I removed saw 1-7 last week from my hard disk :(
The Sixth Sense is accepted, it's such a superb movie.
I've a long queue of requests now, but when any new movie releases, I postpone the requests. 
Please bear with me.
Green Zone has already finished. No time to upload it. but I'll do it tomorrow friends :)
btw
Bad Boys II is still downloading... poor speed.. Avatar will be upped after Green Zone & Rabbit Hole ( if there's no new releases )."

[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-03-01T23:36Z,"I skipped JackAss, thought that it wont get much hits :P
Tangled is getting ready...

                            *************ONE THING***************
As I'm having a limited connection like many of you, it may take a day or two for me to upload my version of new releases, please wait, as you all know, I may be late, but mine will be the best in quality than any of other small sized rips or encodes (below 400MB). Thanks friends, for trusting and waiting for me :) 
I'm really grateful to you all."
,banukaknight,2011-03-02T05:18Z,"well you said that right boss.
i downloaded green honet for the second time right after u done the rip.
cos well all go for ticten :)
there are many others below 400 ripping..
but not the ones that do below 300
in that case .. you ruless"
,a6h1sh3k,2011-03-02T09:51Z,"waiting for Hereafter :)

but what about Mr.Nobody...bhai ? :'("
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-03-02T14:39Z,"I try to do all the requests from a >4GB file. it takes much time to download and believe me, my upload speed is just 50kbps :( 
That's why this much delay.
I'm very sorry for that, nothing in my hands about the speed. 
I'm uploading Hereafter now, Downloading Tangled, The Fighter, Avatar, Bad Boys has downloaded :(
IT'll be upped soon. Thanks friends. "
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-03-02T14:46Z,"Also, I request everyone to spread my torrents to the regional sites in your respected countries, I'm happy for that. Currently I'm uploading to 8 sites, 
Crediting is not mandatory. you can rename the file and upload as ur own :(
I just want to help the peeps. 
And pls check subscene.com for the subtitles. I'll be giving English by default( if available).
Thanks again, Sorry for multi commenting, posted comments are not editable :P"
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-03-02T14:48Z,"Mislabelled the smiley. Renaming the file is ok :) 
[ not :( ] 
I'm always :)"
,jaack29,2011-03-02T16:27Z,hey dude what about green zone...??????????
,stingy.scrooge,2011-03-02T17:42Z,Ticten...isnt it possible to download 720p small sized mkv files and then rip them into your micro mini size? That way it will save time...But is it even possible? just a thought.
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-03-02T22:12Z,"That's possible, good idea :)
It should be a perfect 720p, like HDlite or 3li release, then it's not a problem."
,dexter__1996,2011-03-06T10:39Z,"thx 4 acceptin d request
