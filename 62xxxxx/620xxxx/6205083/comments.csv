,RL269,2011-02-28T08:37Z,"What I find funny is the fact that the stories about Obama are contradictory.
supposedly he is:

1) a supporter of Zionist Jews.
2) an Islamic Muslim.
3) belongs to a Christian church with a radical preacher who said some REALLY stupid things.

The Obama haters really need to get together and decide which lies they want to spread. "
,12bob,2011-02-28T19:24Z,FAF! I bet that there's a secretive group that thinks up all these conspiracy theories. Probably meet under a mountain somewhere. Definitely Jews. Or lizards. What's the deal with Jews any way. Last time I was over in the colonies there were crosses everywhere. Can't get much more Jewish than the man that was nailed to one in Judea. His mum was Jewish and that nails it for me. Wouldn't have got into my school.

,plaidfish,2011-02-28T23:11Z,"Kenya became a country 3 years after Obama was born.  This fact is easily verified at a library or on the internet.

If Obama were born in Kenya as alleged, he would have both American and British citizenship - not Kenyan.

i am actually surprized by reading ur comments. u think usa giving aids to muslim countries as a fortune for no reason. dear, please have a second thought again. this war is killing thousands directly and millions indirectly."
,akicita,2011-06-04T22:50Z,"Wow, I've really had my eyes opened by these comments! For a long time, I thought that Obama was a flawed, but fairly reasonable and intelligent president! I thought a lot of his policies had done fairly well, a few had not performed as hoped, but that all in all, America wasn't in any apocalyptic nuclear or Biblical end-times crisis. Silly me--I was fooled by all that ""improved employment rate"" and ""job growth"" and ""25 Obama tax cuts and credits for 95% of taxpayers"" and ""highest corporate profit in history"" and ""lowest tax rate since 1950"" and ""children no longer excluded from health care for pre-existing conditions"" and ""getting Bin Laden"" nonsense. Now I see the truth--that these are mere peccadilloes to distract from the REAL issue: the FUCKING BIRTH CERTIFICATE! Thank you, right-wingers, for calling attention to my spoiled priorities, because before today I would have thought that all of those were signs of, well, a GOOD presidential performance! Golly,  http://whatthefuckhasobamadonesofar.com/ has misled me so badly. 

Man, reading badly-spelled curse-riddled comments on PirateBay.org has had the authors' intended effects: why, I've changed my entire mind! Kudos! 

(Truth be told, I *almost* wasn't convinced, but that one extra ""dumbfuck"" put it over the top...I mean, how can you NOT respect the mind that puts forth an argument as keen and astute as that?)

Down with Obama! Save me from employment, tax breaks, health care, clean environment, endless war, Bin Laden and that lower crime rate! "
,joyof10,2012-03-10T21:10Z,"A singularly remarkable event has taken place in the United States of America. This event occurred in Arizona on March 1st and was an earth shattering revelation.

A long awaited press conference was given by Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a five time elected Sheriff, which should have made national and international headlines. Arpaio’s credentials include serving in the United States Army from 1950 to 1953, service as a federal narcotics agent serving in countries all over the world with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), and served as the head of the Arizona DEA. Without doubt, this is a serious Law Enforcement Officer, not one to be taken in by tin-foil-hat wearing loons.
The American Press is deliberately hiding the evidence published on the internet about this defrauding of the American public and the deliberate evisceration of the Constitution of the United States. It is hiding Barack Obama’s Fraud as it has been revealed by a Sheriff in Arizona. The silence of the American press would be unbelievable if it weren’t so blatantly obvious.
It is nearly as egregious as the audacity of Obama’s fraud itself"
