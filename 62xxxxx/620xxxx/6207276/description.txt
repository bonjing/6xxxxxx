                With the court case looming, Danny realises he might
                have to sacrifice his principles in order to save
                Leopard's Den. And Caroline decides that they need
                someone on the inside, so she takes a job working for
                the mining company. In desperation, Du Plessis fakes
                an archaeological site full of arrowheads and other
                prehistoric artefacts, but Dr Bloem the National
                Parks assessor uncovers his deception and all seems
                lost.
