Having been seduced by the spectacular (not in the good sense) releases of subsequent Star Wars ""episodes"", I meekly accepted the CGI revisions of classic material. But now that I am awakened, I ask myself, (and the viewing community), where do we draw the line? Our memories are our own, to keep and cherish! I saw the the ""first"" Star Wars movie as a child, with my estranged father, and I clearly remember being freaked out, afraid (!) by Darth Vader's first appearance. No one can take that away from me, not even Hollywood moguls. I have a poster of this cover PDF....it is still with me, in my childhood stuff. Let us all be insistent that original content be preserved. We are the electronic historians/preservers/keepers of records of our generation.  I hope that this upload keeps true to the original..."
