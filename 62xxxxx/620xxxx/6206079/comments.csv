,Skembear,2011-02-28T02:53Z,"Hi YIFY
downloaded the first episode, its not an MKV at 100.4 MB its an avi at 220 MB, the same size as the original upload of the show, is it just me getting the wrong compression and size? anyone else?
I have all the seasons at avi and 17GiB, would love this at the 6 GiB, think I have downloaded nearly all of your other rips, outstanding"
,Skembear,2011-02-28T04:21Z,"@ YIFY

this is the page i'm getting it from, most confusing, I click the files link and it has all of what you have uploaded in mkv and smaller size, but the torrent i'm getting is the 220 MiB .avi files, tried quite a few times and always the same .avi
freaking me out now"

,Jaywalker987,2011-04-10T06:05Z,I was going to go on a rant about the disappointing quality but I don't like people who complain so instead I'd like to point out that season 2 episode 3 had several glitches and the audio cut off at one point so if you could fix this sometime YIFY that would be great thanks.

,Kagirion,2011-05-13T11:37Z,"I hope that you naughty internet pirates respect the work that went into this work in particular.
It really is a bacon of creative integrity and such.
SO SUPPORT QUALITY, especially if you CAN afford such things and perhaps buy a season or frikin two.
NAUTY PIRITS!"
,Subtracting,2011-05-21T11:38Z,download a different torrent most of the episodes have glitches you can hear when theyre talking they dont even finish their sentences gay torrrent

,blossomingbeauty,2011-06-21T10:08Z,ty!
,jsnow,2011-07-02T19:02Z,"Not sure what's up with these MKVs but the Audio seems to lose sync badly on some (most) of the episodes from the first two seasons that I've watched so far, whether I watch it on MPlayer Classic, VLC, and GOM - and what's even more of a pain in the ass is when I match the audio up with the video by moving it back or forward .1 second at a time... in 3-5 minutes it goes back to being unsynced again.... Never had this problem before."
,[RWolff],2011-07-14T02:12Z,"Thanx a lot, Mate!"
,Free_Pixels,2011-07-31T22:45Z,i used media player classic and the audio/video went in slow motion.
,spancer_87,2011-08-15T16:51Z,"The audio and video lacks nothing, but the subs are trash! man, the person doing them must be a foreign guy!"
,fofo141,2011-08-20T04:43Z,Amazing
,ronnieonetime1,2011-08-30T12:09Z,"Actually, the video quality is pure crap and reminds me of what television and VHS gave me 10 years ago. The subtitles are adequate. Sometimes there are glitches ie lurking/looking. The value this torrent possesses is that it is SMALL. The .mkv compression is stupid for video and audio of this low quality. If ya just want to WATCH the series, this torrent is fine.If you want to EXPERIENCE Weeds, then this torrent blows chunks."
,ronnieonetime1,2011-08-30T12:11Z,"The 720p claim may be real, but the QUALITY is 480."
,merethan,2011-11-24T12:46Z,"There is no such thing as ""mkv compression"". Matroska (.mkv/.mka) is a container, not a codec.
To put it an another way: You are using a matroska container to store an audio stream and a video stream. Those streams are the result of encoding.
(mp3 for audio and xvid for the video part for example)"
,ghenghis1,2012-03-07T06:00Z,"Thanks much Yify!

And merethan...shut your fucking mouth and thank the man you little prick!"
,spacespacespace,2012-03-16T12:22Z,"Hey, thanks for the upload...  I'm not sure if its just me but Iv'e been getting some audio dropouts.  I decided to get the 17gb one after the last 12 minuets of S2E3 went silent.  Tried 3 different players, all the same.  Its probably just my copy but I will appreciate the higher quality.  Thanks"
,cyopx1,2012-04-11T05:50Z,Please add add'l seasons of Weeds.  Thank you for your great work!
,3csmom,2012-05-19T16:55Z,Thank you so much. I need to catch up. New twins keep me from my favorite shows.
,Mr.Anarchy,2012-06-15T01:10Z,"there is no season 6, it has the right episode names but they are all the season 5 episodes"
