,shadysoldier10,2011-02-25T23:37Z,"DarthExile - MP4 is usually better quality then the avi's from the weekly wwe uploads so I don't see the problem
thx for torrent tdk"
,BlaTaN,2011-02-26T00:12Z,"DarthExile - only a complete and utter DOUCHE would even bother typing out what u did.....MP4 is better quality and sound by far... AVI's SUK ASS! The only good thing about them is they are small files.... 

Oh btw... just because you can't afford a machine that plays mp4's or have any other equipment that does, shouldn't mean that you need to come online and try to act all tough... UR PITIFUL!"
,Keithy12345,2011-02-26T07:57Z,If u dont like mp4 the go download a programe that converts them to avi u idiot its not that hard...
