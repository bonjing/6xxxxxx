Dr. Philâ€™s guests say the green-eyed monster is tearing apart their marriage. First, Paula claims she has been nothing but unwaveringly loyal to her husband, Mike, but he still questions her fidelity. This jealous husband admits he placed listening devices in the home, has set up surveillance cameras to follow her and has subjected Paula to not one, but two polygraph tests. Find out what other devices Mike uses to track his wife and why heâ€™s so paranoid. Plus, when Paula gets a third polygraph by a Dr. Phil expert, will Mike's suspicions finally be confirmed? Then, Tara says sheâ€™s suspicious of her husband, Andrew. Can Dr. Phil help fill the void of trust in these relationships before it's too late?
