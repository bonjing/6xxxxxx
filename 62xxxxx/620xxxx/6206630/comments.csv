[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-27T20:55Z,Ignore the lies from the poster above. He has put this on every one of my uploads. I'm trusted because I can be trusted. You will not find higher quality files than I upload. Check out any of my torrents and you'll see they are all top quality. Click on my user name and then any torrent and you'll see the liar has put the same comment on all of them.
[T],ILPruny,2011-02-28T17:55Z,"Seed please. i need this for my dvd player. This is good quality, normal hdtv format 624/352."
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-28T18:33Z,"For those who haven't worked it out, Steo38 is lying. He's put it on all of my torrents. Check for yourself, click on my user name and click on another torrent. He does it all the time, he's been banned 4 times and he keeps re-registering. Some people get jealous when they realise they can't do uploads as good as mine so they put negative comments on perfectly good torrents. He'll be banned again soon and his comments will get deleted again. Unfortunately he has such a miserable life that he'll be back again tomorrow and we can laugh at him all over again.

,Night_89,2011-03-01T11:40Z,"pleases try to upload 

Twilight (2008) 3xDVD9 deluxe edition
New moon (2009) 3xDVD9 fan edition

untouched with English DVD menu and English subtitle

would be really really grateful to you for this

I`ve found both of them but non of them have English DVD menu and English subtitle and please reply if possible for you to upload earlier or later"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-03-01T13:23Z,"I've found Twilight Deluxe Edition 3 X DVD. It's 16.6 GB. Is this the one? 

I've found New Moon Fan Edition that 20.7 GB 3 disc ISO. Is this the one? This one has no seeds but there are peers still on it so I'm hoping a seed will come back at some stage. Let me know if these aren't the ones you want. "
,Night_89,2011-03-01T14:38Z,"yeah man

these are the same you are talking about
but there are two problems
1. No seeds and it (both) cannot be completed with peers , I am stuck
2. These do not have English DVD menu and English subtitle, they are dutch versions
I would be really grateful if someone uploads both collectors edition untouched with English DVD menu and English subtitle
Thanks for your reply"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-03-01T15:57Z,"Night_89, I've got seeds on them both now. Do you not need them? I'll stop them if they're no good for you. Let me know.

Sorenstrop is a liar BTW people. He does this every day until he gets banned and his comments get deleted. If you see any negative comments on any of my torrents, just do a quick check and you'll see the same one over and over again on them all. Just ignore him, I think he's a bit retarded.  "
,Night_89,2011-03-01T17:14Z,"could it be possible for you now or later in the future to upload both of them untouched extended editions with ""English"" DVD menu and ""English"" subtitle
I can wait for them if you could upload English versions
Steo38 or SorenStrup
These kind of jerks are everywhere
you need not to mention about them
if your down loaders trust you they surely would download without any hesitation
thanks and reply"
,Night_89,2011-03-01T18:37Z,SorenStrup
,Night_89,2011-03-01T18:48Z,"SorenStrup
if don`t like any torrent or if you have any problem with the specs, just make a complain comment.
why you start fuck up again and again
this uploader has many leeches in each of his torrent and he is also trusted, that`s a sign of his fine uploads
and you idiot
you don`t even write the new sentence in the complain, you just copy the same sentence and paste it in every torrents
JERK"

[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-04-12T18:44Z,"Hahahahahaha
superdonna is the same person as sorenstrop. He's lying. 400 seeds and he thinks people will believe that it's all in Dutch. What a loser."
,_The_Game_112_,2011-05-11T18:48Z,"Thanks Toilet_sniffer_V, was looking for this, we got rid of TMN when it started.  Any chance you know where I can find ""Shameless"" , I have found a bunch but they are the original, I want the new one that just started when Gods of the Arena did.  Thanks Again!"
,bibaloa,2011-05-16T09:43Z,"Toilet Sniffer, I LOVE YOU........
One by one kick-ass torrents, you always say if it's dvdrip or hdtv. Quality is always A++, very good speed for big files.
Only one question, Your upload of Breaking bad 1,2,3. The third season isn't dvdrip are you planning to upload a dvdrip?

Thanks! and keep up the good work!"
