T MODEL FORD & GRAVELROAD TALEDRAGGER
Label:Alive [0115LP]
Release Date : Jan 10 2011
Format:Mp3@320


Recorded in the studio during last yearâ€™s US tour, Ford is backed by his talented touring band GravelRoad on the eight songs which include a couple of Howlinâ€™ Wolf tunes as well as others that have been covered by other legends like Muddy Waters, Champion Jack Dupree, and Jerry Lee Lewis. T-Model Ford is also joined by Brian Olive (Greenhornes, Soledad Brothers) and Matthew Smith (Outrageous Cherry, Volebeats) on a few of the songs, showcasing his raw and rugged vocals with heavy reverb laden guitar. Standouts include â€œBig Legged Womanâ€ which clocks in at just under 8 minutes and traditional blues closer â€œLittle Red Rooster.â€ T-Model Fordâ€™s other nickname is â€œTaildraggerâ€ (an aviation term for a landing gear configuration) and whether or not the album title is a play on his nickname, referring to all the tales and folklore that follow him around, Taledragger is sure one of the best blues releases this year. â€“ JFelton 

What Ford, Olive, Smith, Alexander, and the rest have wrought on Taledragger is a modern blues album with primitive roots. The tension works. Itâ€™s a far more interesting recording because of its "impurities" â€” paradoxically, making it a far more "authentic" blues record because it is linked to multiple historic traditions simultaneously. Itâ€™s exponentially more enjoyable and exciting as blues than anything coming out of Chicago in the 21st century. â€“ Thom Jurek / AMG
