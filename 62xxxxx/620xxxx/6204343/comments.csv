A version of the software required to install this update was not found on this volume."" I have also uninstalled and reinstalled office 2011, would you by any chance be able to help me?"
,bjuice100,2011-03-05T14:24Z,"ppp7yu, make sure you install first the ""Microsoft Office 2011 14.0.0 Final for Mac (Volume Licensed)"" from the .dmg that you've torrent Downloaded.
Open the various programs of office to make sure that they work.
Then apply the update file.
(Make sure that you don't allow any automatic updates etc, when you finish the installation)
Hope that helps"
