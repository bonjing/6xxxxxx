Zeit 2 is a traditional side-scrolling, 2D, shoot-'em-up game that brings
unprecedented elements to the game experience. Zeit^2's unique time travel
feature has yet to be seen in this genre even after decades of great games. 
Intuitive controls allow players to move forward and backward in time making
it possible for the player to combine shots and power, and even be assisted
by a shadow version of yourself. Blast away swarms of enemies, get the
highest score and discover how you can assist yourself in new exciting ways
by warping time at will.
