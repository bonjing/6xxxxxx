In fact, I have the whole collection from '53 to date as magazines. But this is awesome. 

1. My magazines can stay in the wallets.
2. I can put these on the ipad as I please (the PBHDD is VERY Restrictive


Thumbs Up!"

OUTSTANDING!!
Can't wait to download em all, excellent work here!
Playboy from it's beginnings in 1953 through the 1970's was really CUTTING EDGE! some of the finest writers,topics,music and most of all REAL WOMEN, NOT full of PLASTIC!
Cheers mate
Fantastic well done"
