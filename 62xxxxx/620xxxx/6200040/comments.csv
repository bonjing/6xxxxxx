,alfrgp,2011-03-09T04:38Z,How do I update this addon if I have a previous version? Do I just download and replace in the folder? Will this make me lose any preferences data?
,TPBrullz,2011-03-11T03:33Z,"@alfrgp

You won't lose any settings because those are in a different folder from the addons (addon configuration are in WTF as well as game configuration), just delete the Zygor folders from your Interface folder and put the new ones there instead."
,alfrgp,2011-03-11T15:51Z,@TPBruiiz Thank you.
