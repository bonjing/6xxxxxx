,Jshep2,2011-03-24T04:14Z,"Yes this is Age of Empires 1... It is Mac OS X only, (INTEL)"
,juanitopomes,2011-03-24T18:19Z,"I do not work, when the bar is green, click on ""show in finder"" and open the application and does not work"
,Jshep2,2011-03-24T18:48Z,"It I works for me... It is currently compressed, open the ""Age of Empires Mac.app"" and it will unpack the game automatically.

Sorry for the confusion."
,juanitopomes,2011-03-24T19:09Z,"lo he descomprimido, abro el juego y no me funciona"
,juanitopomes,2011-03-24T19:10Z,"I unzipped, open the game and does not work"

,juanitopomes,2011-03-25T13:45Z,what must be done to make the game work?
,Jshep2,2011-03-25T13:49Z,"I can't say it much simpler...

When its done, find the file (In Finder) double-click (Or Command-O"" and it will unpack...

I don't know if GMA video cards work or not."
,pedropf16,2011-03-27T06:40Z,"jshep2 do a video and post on youtube, it's better"
,srgroot,2011-03-27T14:57Z,"so here's the solution to play this game:

click onto the ""blue box"" with right click and then choose ""show package contents"" then go to recources and unpack ""Tome.7z"" (with Winzip or something) then just double-click on the AoE Icon in the New Folder. Have Fun ;)

NOTE: The Game is very Dark in the selection screens but in the real game it's as bright as the monitor itself


Hope i could help, greetings from Austria"
,pedropf16,2011-03-27T23:16Z,dosen't work.... on new folder click right on age and show the contents click on contents next MacOS next Wineskin and sey have a problem
,Jshep2,2011-03-29T19:26Z,"Okay... If you have a folder with AoE in it then DON'T go into the contents just open it. If you have a blue box then you can ether double click (The blue box) and it'll unpack

or you can use srgroot's solution, in which case you would need a 7z unpacker, just google 7zX and download it."
[T],nobody2007,2011-04-02T20:20Z,"This file does not work (MacPro and iMac 2010)
Who has this file stuffed must be an idiot. It jumps in the dock 1 time and quits than by itself. Has anybody tested it before uploading it? This is crap."
,AOFathy,2011-04-04T21:50Z,"Works on Mac OS X 10.6.7 nVIDIA 8400GS - 1GB Ram - OSX86 PC Intel

Options are dark game working correctly
As of quits when loading in dock run again and wait, if not DELETE IT!!"
,xylodian,2011-04-17T22:18Z,"Well, the file downloaded and I was able to open it but only because srgroot was kind enough to post proper instructions on how to do so - otherwise none of the other instructions are at all helpful. So now I have the game icon sitting there, but when I try to open it, I get 'Age of Empires Quit Unexpectedly'. I can do this over and over again until the cows come home and it never opens. Anyone know why this is? Thanks."

,TheSkygge,2011-07-09T20:59Z,"Not working at all on Imac 2010. Bounces and goes. Sad, because it's my favourite AoE."
,cdbboyce,2011-09-22T23:15Z,"PROBLEM!!!

The file I downloaded is a .mdf and a .mds file.  How in the hell can i open and install this game?!  This is the only torrent I've been able to find with the ORIGINAL AoE and expansion and I'm dying to play it!!!!"
,Daxxari,2011-11-23T03:18Z,"OKay, not working at all. I have no idea what the hell to do, my mac (10.6.8) Is not even opening your folder and any other instruction given in the comments is not working. Is it possible to get this game elsewhere?"
,x3x6,2011-12-17T02:15Z,i wanted this game but i found the AoE 2 gold edition up in here!!  is awsome and runs on PPC G4  good
,Witse987,2012-05-08T18:22Z,"You have to unpack the .7z-file with the program 7zx (download:http://7zx.en.softonic.com/mac/download). If u unpack it with stuffit like i did at first, it won't work. But when i used 7xz it works like a charm. "
