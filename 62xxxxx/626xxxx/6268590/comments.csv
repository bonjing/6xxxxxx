It abrutly comes back on when somone is talking or there is music. I use VLC player, but it does the same on WMP. I hook up my comp to my pc using a VGA cable and a 3.5 mini plug, I think(the headphone slot). It only messes up when hooked to the tv."

,jenchai,2011-04-03T06:49Z,Its a 1920 x 800 movie not 1920x1080 long faces movie. Absolute stupidity in ripping.
