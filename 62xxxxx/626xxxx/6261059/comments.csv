,danielion,2011-03-22T10:39Z,@GoodFilms: How about finishing seeding your other torrents before continually uploading new ones? Still waiting on Les Miserables at 50.2%. Very poor uploader.
[V],GoodFilms,2011-03-22T10:58Z,les mis was ages ago and that was one torrent and i deleted it. move on :)
,danielion,2011-03-22T17:15Z,"So, why bother uploading the torrent in the first place if you had no intention in finishing it? There were over 1000 people stuck on 50.2% last weekend. It would be greatly appreciated if you could finish it."
[V],GoodFilms,2011-03-22T19:28Z,shut up and be grateful for all the other torrents that work. a working version of les mis will appear soonish. PS i have nothing positive to say about YOUR uploads.
,danielion,2011-03-22T20:06Z,At least my uploads were seeded to completion GoodFilms - or should your name be HalfFilms?;)
[V],GoodFilms,2011-03-22T20:46Z,but nobody wants them. witty remark there btw. nearly fell off my chair.
