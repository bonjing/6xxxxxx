        Release Notes:

        We are extremely shocked how far some of these NFO comments
        have gone lately, even as far as criticizing the artist is
        completely disrespectful. We have seen it twice this month in
        the biggest releases of the month that you have supplied. Our
        question is why? Please keep these opinions to yourself. 
        Please and Thank You.

        No Props to FTD for not providing zee proof of the Classified. 

        Also, to that other somebody out there. There is no need to
        title other groups in the scene as "FAGS" just because you
        dont like the specific genre. Seriously. Whats the big deal?
        Last. The rules indicate its perfectly fine to release. 
        4 divided 12 = 0.333333333%

        Enjoy.
