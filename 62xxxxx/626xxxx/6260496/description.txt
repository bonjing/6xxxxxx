This is most of Demon Hunters music, I say this because I know I have missed a couple of the alternative versions of their songs, plus it's just a matter of time before new ones come out. All of their albums are included, and I added the single, The Wind. Please comment if you would like me to upload something I may have missed, please comment if you like it, don't like it whatever, and please seed. Thanks, enjoy.
