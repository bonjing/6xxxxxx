,spelonkar,2011-03-24T08:11Z,"Thanks for the up, this should be a good copy, skidrow doesnt put shit out, also excellent speed so far considering its so new, 23% with 290 kb/s avg, although its dropping with the people figuring out its here :P"

To some people that are wizzes with anything you dont know about you are a complete and utter noob. 
You all act like you know everything about everything when you dont.
Downloading something is really easy by the way and installing some games can be quite hard depending on the game. If you look at the posts the majority of the people posting are having problems.
I suggest go look in the mirror and have a long hard look at yourselves and then maybe go outside and get abit of sunlight and maybe even laid.

Go into your installed Homefront directory.

run PhysX_9.09.1112. This installed it properly for me. Reboot system.
it should run fine after this. 
My system is all AMD, so PhysX  must be running on my cpu. "
,ziegs2020,2011-04-02T18:25Z,"***WINDOWS 7 USERS***

If you have windows 7 read this. You must use the right click menu option; ""run as administrator"" option when using setup.exe, or else the extra setup files will not install properly.

This should solve most .dll or physx issues. 

Also for whatever reason, the binary folder in the skidrow section is empty.

Copy ALL the files in ""skidrow"" into the thq homefront binaries folder instead. 

This will solve any steam issues.

I know I shouldn't complain about free, BUT DOUBLE CHECK THE DAMN FOLDERS! The crack folder is empty, and I WAS wondering why it was not working."

True gamers only Pirate a game like FPS'ers because they wanna test the game play engine, playability, fun, etc.  People only buy games for the MP.

If you complain on the fact that it requires steam to play it doesn't. You guys just haven't patched it yet here's what you do

OPEN SKIDROW FROM THE MOUNTED IMAGE 
COPY EVERYTHING INSIDE THE SKIDROW FOLDER 

NOTE : BINARIES IN THE IMAGE IS EMPTY 

PASTE it in the binaries where you installed the game 

I know there are 2 binaries the one in GGC ignore it place the crack in the 1st binaries folder you saw

Got a few .dll problems, but fixed it by googling em.

,nairrb,2011-08-02T17:34Z,"Hi all. Let me first thank extremezone for this torrent. Great seed too. I initially had a problem at the start on bus where the game halts after the crash. That was fixed by either homefront sound + ammo crack by UFO.Sule or homefront.update.1 by rlf-rls (since I installed both of these). The game went well till the fire rain part and the game again came to a halt after reaching the tower. Once I get in, I can leave the tower and all I can do is walk around in the tower. Waiting below the tower and slowly going in or tricks like that does not help. Reinstallation also did not help. When the initial game halt can be rectified, some genius will have a solution for this too. I have seen a couple of us having the same problem. If someone found a solution kindly post the same; it will be of a great help to many. "
,NeedWeed,2011-08-02T22:41Z,yes this game can be played on tunngle google TUNNGLE and u will no what i mean i could not get it to work but i know that it does TUNNGLE TUNNGLE TUNNGLE TUNNGLE google google
,nairrb,2011-08-02T22:56Z,"Hi all. This is connected to my previous post. The problem of the tower stuck in Homefront firesale level. For those who have problem with this, pl try this. Do not rush and climb as you reach. Wait till conner says to come up. Then just attempt to climb half way when Rianna pass in front of you up. She will wait on the 1st plat form and you could continue climb. She will follow to the next platform. After the 3rd platform you are supposed to go inside the tower, but don't. Press Z and crawl back all the way down. Crawl back on the floor from where you came between the fire. Go a little further as far as you could and turn back and crawl back up the tower (you may back but I crawled to be on the safe side LOL) and get inside the tower and turn around. You could see Rianna entering the tower and the game will continue. I initially tried this trick a couple of times, of course I did not crawl but walked instead; but I could not make it work and gave up. Now this worked. Hope for all who have this problem, I wish is may work for all and let all could know what the rest of the game is. After this, you have the Goliath but to make it online, first you have to take the soldier with the RPG on the roof top when they appear. So initially you have to take cover, kill the soldiers on the ground and kill the RPG guys for the goliath to bring on line. When you get the goliath on line, you could use it to destroy a Humvee that will show up as well as other vehicles and soldiers. Later use it to bring down a chopper. Rest of the game, play as it comes up. (NB: The goliath will be on line only if and when the RPGs are taken down (the red icon of goliath on your monitor will turn white) or you will get sick shooting and get killed over and over again)."

,nikeair94,2011-12-25T14:48Z,"Read through every page, followed every instruction given within the pages of comments. Downloaded multiple cracks, constantly uninstalled and reinstalled Homefront, and not 1 thing worked. Can't even get it to launch in any way possible. Took me a week to download this all for nothing. Waste of time. PS: I am running Windows 7 64 Bit Ultimate, so if you are also running this version of windows expect a similar fate."
