RELEASE NOTES

The year is 2027. The world as we know it is unraveling after fifteen
years of economic meltdown and widespread global conflict over
dwindling natural resources.

A once proud America has fallen, her infrastructure shattered and
military in disarray. Crippled by a devastating EMP strike, the USA is
powerless to resist the ever expanding occupation of a savage, nuclear
armed Greater Korean Republic.

Abandoned by her former allies, the United States is a bleak landscape
of walled towns and abandoned suburbs. This is a police state where
high school stadiums have become detention centers, and shopping malls
shelter armored attack vehicles. A once-free people are now prisonersâ€¦
or collaboratorsâ€¦ or revolutionaries.

Join the Resistance, stand united and fight for freedom against an
overwhelming military force in Homefront's gripping single player
campaign penned by John Milius (Apocalypse Now, Red Dawn). Stand
alongside a cast of memorable characters as an emotional plot unfolds
in this terrifyingly plausible near-future world. Experience visceral,
cinematic first-person shooter action as you fight your way across
Occupied USA using guerrilla tactics, and commandeer military vehicles
and advanced drone technology to defeat the enemy.

Features:

Discover a terrifyingly plausible near-future world - the familiar has
become alien in this nightmare vision of Occupied USA

Fight for a cause - join a cast of memorable characters as your
resistance cell wages a guerrilla war against overwhelming military
odds in the name of Freedom

Witness the human cost of war - a gripping story from the pen of John
Milius is told through immersive, interactive 1st person cut scenes

Experience explosive FPS gameplay - battle through a dynamic mix of
infantry and vehicle combat in a gripping single player campaign
boasting intense, memorable set pieces

Take the battle online - experience large scale multiplayer action like
never before in epic infantry and vehicle warfare
