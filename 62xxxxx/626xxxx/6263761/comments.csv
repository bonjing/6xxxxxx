,dendiput,2011-03-23T19:48Z,"Thanks, but stuck on 55.4%.  Give us a boost online please."
,BuzzMe,2011-03-27T03:28Z,Been stuck at 99.3% for several days.  What's with the seeding?
,mac-860,2011-03-29T16:16Z,Thanks for the upload! Anyone who has the whole thing please help....stuck at 99.3% for days. 
,mtrspctr,2011-03-31T11:52Z,"this is a prime example of the scourge of leechers..
as this is a somewhat obscure torrent, a stable seeder base is an absolute must. for more popular torrents, seeders are a given. I have now been at 99.3% for almost a week."
,dendiput,2011-04-09T21:00Z,Please go online and seed!!
,dendiput,2011-04-10T17:10Z,"I have posted the Dune in Kindle Mobi format on the below, which includes those in this torrent were not completed.

,nil7,2011-05-23T13:55Z,"Despite being stuck at 99.3 forever, it was still possible for me to salvage almost every book (either epub or morbi) - except Children of Dune.

Worth it, because the formatting is significantly better than another torrent I downloaded. I'm still missing a nice formatted version of Children..."
,nil7,2011-05-23T14:04Z,... I suggest to use the torrent from dendiput! - also includes a ok formatted version of children (despite being converted from pdf). Thanks!
,supershkunk,2011-07-30T04:09Z,You are awsome!  Thanks so much.
,Tuneyloon,2011-08-23T21:01Z,"I've Uled the complete Dune collection in Epub format, only requires converting for kindle using calibre. Lots of other collections too and another updated library is currently in the making."
