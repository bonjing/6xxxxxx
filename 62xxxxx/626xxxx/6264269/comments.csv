,hexonyxx,2011-03-28T20:52Z,Hooray! People who want more at everyone else's expense rejoice! Your ready-made patina of amateur philosophical excuses is here!
,Barkingspyder,2011-04-11T22:08Z,"So hexonyxx, you obviously have no real knowldege of Rand's philosophy.  Rand advocated getting what you can earn, through your own efforts, not through force or coercion.  That's the job of politicians."
,traffic,2011-04-30T09:01Z,Barkingspyder- you're a randroid. You're the lowest of the low. Period.
,Barkingspyder,2011-11-29T20:00Z,"How is EARNING your way at the expense of someone else?  Seems to me the lowest of the low are those who expect to get a handout when they are to lazy or incompetent to make their own way.
Where does the notion that we owe people that we've no connection to.  Compassion is wonderful and a virtue, but it can't and should not be through force."
