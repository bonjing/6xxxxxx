A California neo-Nazi (Oscar-nominee Edward Norton) gets sent to prison for murder and comes out a changed man. But can the reformed rebel atone for his sins and prevent his younger brother (Edward Furlong) from following in his hate-filled footsteps? With searing performances and gut-wrenching realism, Tony Kaye's sobering drama offers a compelling and anguishing look at racism, family and forgiveness.
