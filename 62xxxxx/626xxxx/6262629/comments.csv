,creative77,2011-04-08T22:17Z,"I walked the Camino a month before this movie was made, this movie describes the Camino very well, The experience you will feel when you have walked the camino is something you will carry with you for the rest of your life..."

,debuggest,2011-10-23T08:36Z,thanks! but what is the reason for 2 files?
,camo12345,2011-11-02T08:36Z,"I downloaded this from you in April, and this was the first time I was aware of the ""Camino""...

One month after watching it, in May, I was in France, St Jean Pied de Port, ready to begin the Camino de Santiago! After 31 days of walking, I arrived at Santiago, 3 days after that I arrived at ""The End of the World""! (Finisterre). 

I just want to say that it completely changed my life around for the better, and when I had finished walking I came home and found a job where I take young people on this walk!!! It is amazing. It's by far the best experience I've ever had.

But it hit me a little while ago... if I had not downloaded this movie, I wouldn't be where I am right now. And for that I am thankful for this website, and especially to you extremezone... if it wasn't for you, I'd still be in a dead end job, hating my life. In a way, you saved my life, thank you!"
,wagga7,2012-03-10T22:10Z,Tks again for this great torrent Extremezone...you ARE the best....:)
