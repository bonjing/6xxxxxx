BAFTA winning comedians Lee Mack and Tim Vine star alongside Sally Bretton, and Katy Wix in the highly anticipated fourth series of the hit Royal Television Society and Rose Dâ€™or award-winning BBC sitcom Not Going Out. Happy-go-lucky â€“ but entirely hapless â€“ Lee (Lee Mack) is still desperate to win the affections of his flatmate Lucy (Sally Bretton, The Office, Green Wing). But despite last yearâ€™s Christmas kiss, itâ€™s still not plain sailing; and itâ€™s not just Leeâ€™s complete lack of drive that gets in the way. Trouble seems to find Lee at every turn. Not only are friends Tim (Tim Vine) and Daisy (Katy Wix, Torchwood) â€“ Timâ€™s ditzy girlfriend â€“ on hand to cause problems but this year Lee also has to cope with stolen drugs, missing OAPs, long-lost daughters and a coma. Packed full of the jokes, jibes and general misunderstandings of Lee and his friends, this is a comedy definitely worth staying in for.
