,selvad,2011-03-23T08:02Z,Cool. Thanks! 
,HaukEye,2011-03-23T08:13Z,"This is not a CD rip, its from iTunes Japan."
,Wallboy19,2011-03-23T08:46Z,"Thanks Hauk, that explains it. The CD version rip will sound better once someone gets a hold of that."
,HaukEye,2011-03-23T16:24Z,I plan to upload a FLAC rip as soon as I have it.
,NickNLCA,2011-04-24T20:32Z,It's wayyyy too quiet. I had to amplify it by 10 decibels for it to be listenable. It's not bad once you do that.

it's kind of different... and i'm pleasantly surprised."
