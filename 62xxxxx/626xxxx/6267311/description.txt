Book Description
================
With more than 52 million pet dogs in America today, it's clear we are 
a nation of unabashed dog lovers. Yet the relationship between dogs 
and humans remains a fascinating mystery, as no one really knows what 
goes on in the canine mind. Now, in Inside of a Dog, Alexandra Horowitz 
fuses her perspectives as both scientist and dog owner to deliver a 
fresh look at the world of dogs---as seen from the animal's point of 
view. 

Inspired by her years of living with her own dog, Pumpernickel, who 
was a constant source of delight and mystery, Horowitz's mind became 
filled with questions and ideas. In crisp, clear prose, she draws on 
her research in the field of dog cognition to give listeners a sense 
of a dog's perceptual and cognitive abilities---and paints a picture 
of what the canine experience is like. Horowitz's own scientific journey, 
and the insights she uncovered, allowed her to understand her dog better 
and appreciate her more. 

Containing up-to-the-minute research and providing many moments of dog 
behavior recognition, this lively and absorbing book helps dog owners 
to see their best friend's behavior in a different and revealing light, 
allowing them to understand their pets and enjoy their company even 
more.
