The old BitComet that you are using has been obsolete for many years now."
,sukr4m,2011-03-23T06:20Z,"@velvet As you might be able to see once you are moderator, I am really new to uploading and seeding. I will try the other bit torrent clients. Will I need to upload the torrent again or just keep it uploading from the new one?"
,kmemo,2011-03-23T13:04Z,"Thnx for the up, i've been waiting long for this release. Only now i'm stuck at 12% :S So pls keep seeding!"
,sukr4m,2011-03-23T17:11Z,"@kmemo. Sorry for this problem. I had to go sleep, but I let my computer seeding until the battery ran out. I am seeding again. If it happens again it is because I had to leave. But I always come back. But remember, this release is mostly in english but it has some dialogs in portuguese with no subtitles."
,vat91101,2011-03-24T19:43Z,Is this the real Senna:Beyond the Speed of Sound?
,000tyinget,2011-03-26T04:58Z,"""SENNA -The Movie.avi"" is the same video as ""Directors Comment.avi"" 

surkr4m
Would you be so kind and post the movie without the director commentary? "
,sukr4m,2011-03-26T09:43Z,You can downloadit without that movie. Select only The Movie.

,dlxmax,2011-03-27T07:04Z,"Fuck this torrent. After days of downloading and no completion, I'm bouncing over to dollar's torrent. That one's got subs too."
,gold333,2011-03-30T18:44Z,"The uploader does not understand: Both 1.43gb files are identical. I.e. they are both the hard coded commentary version. It's nice but it would be good to have a better version of the original 104minute version than the standard 600 and 700mb copy's floating around.

Can the uploader upload the ""real"" 1.43gb non commentary version?"
,sukr4m,2011-12-27T18:56Z,I apologize for the incorrect torrent. I will learn with time.
