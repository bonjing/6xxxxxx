No matter how many times i try the money hack in the shop or the needs hack it doesn't do SHIT, NOTHING, ZIP, NADA. Sum it up, simply, it does nothing at all whatsoever no matter how many times i press the buttons. And yes, i have pressed the insert button to turn the trainer on."

to avoid obvious questions.
Yes, right version, yes numlock has been turned on off tried while on and off. I also read the Nfo which has no informationwhatsoever on where to activate the trainer or how the needs hack works exactly.

Though i got testingcheats 1 in the commands.ini folder, suppose that interferes anyhow?"

Don't want a trouble pasting again and again a crack everytime you update the game?
THEN USE THE ""MINI IMAGE""
Just mount it in Daemon Tools Lite then play the game! YOU CAN FREELY UPDATE THE GAME EVERYTIME! AND NO NECESSARY CRACKS NEEDED EITHER! USE MINI IMAGE!
