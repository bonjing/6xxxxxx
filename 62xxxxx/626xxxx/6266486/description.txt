                Death in the Slow Lane.
                Neil Dudgeon's first appearance as the head of
                Causton CID. New DCI John Barnaby is intrigued when
                he learns that the remains of famous racing driver
                Duncan Palmer have been discovered at Darnley Park
                School - 40 years after he was thought to have
                drowned in the Lake District. During the school's
                classic car show, racing legend Peter Fossett is
                annoyed that his fellow judge is club DJ Dave 'Doggy'
                Day, who knows nothing about cars. Soon afterwards,
                Doggy is crushed to death under a classic car and
                Barnaby thinks the video diaries of two pupils could
                hold clues to the killing. Then a new lead takes him
                to meet someone at the barn where Duncan Palmer met
                his death. When the killer turns on him, could
                Barnaby's first case also be his last?
