use only recent client torrent,please !
few old versions of utorrent make hard conflict on my torrents ! sometimes old versions can be banned by certain trackers...and even more. 
suggest you to use minimum utorrent 2.0...
BitSpirit works very well when you are behind a router also.Many hide ip use proxy and in certain cases,it can make hard conflict and slowing down your connection.
Take care,please,otherwise your connection could completely freeze my seed by your fault !
set correctly your torrent and give enough upload !
if needed disable your anti-virus for a while.
Few anti-virus can make huge problems on torrent.Avoid to use any proxy !
avoid to use too much anti-virus/anti-spyware together at the same time cause they will slowing down your connection.
set correctly your router/firewall also for best performance.
ty for understanding"
