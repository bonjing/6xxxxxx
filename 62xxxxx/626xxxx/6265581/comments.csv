,gaffya,2011-03-24T00:50Z,I looged on just to comment here.For me it is lousy.It's so low budget that it's not even filmed in color.The story may be fine IDK. but it's so low budget I cant even watch it.
,gaffya,2011-03-24T00:53Z,For me it's lousy.the story may be good IDK.but it's so low budget I couldnt even watch it.Not even shot in color.It's not 1955 anymore black and white action movies just dont cut it imo.
,wizzkid1970,2011-03-24T02:00Z,"black and white movie in this day and age , dont think so will give this a wide berth forever !"
,kosuke85,2011-03-24T02:10Z,Really appreciate the uploaders that take the extra time to post the imdb link on the torrent. Many thanks. ^_~ 
,Zegunda,2011-03-24T03:14Z,"People, the movie is NOT black and white, some things are in color like Sin City style."
,Misterkriskooper,2011-03-24T03:46Z,"""It's so low budget that it's not even filmed in color.""
I know! When are they gonna make a cheap goddamn color camera! "
,cradonium,2011-03-24T05:40Z,logged in just to say to the people that said that its low budget because its in black and white are fucking retarded. wow. schindler's list? sin city? 
,Devilishredbeardishness,2011-03-24T08:18Z,"looks good, I liked Sin City, don't like high budget shit kicker for story films, I'll give it a go."
,kareru,2011-03-24T17:14Z,"It's called 'Film Noir' people, they are usually shot or stylized in black and white to emphasis the shadow and light which represent mood.

,maureenmo1,2011-03-24T19:51Z,i love the old black and white films but there is no need to make films in black and white today so i wont be watching this then
,donki,2011-03-24T20:58Z,"This is so not the way to adapt a graphic novel to the big screen, it does not work on so many levels,take half the actors from an old Guy Ritchie flick, an unbelievably bad supporting cast, throw in a dire script, mix in some cheap production values and your half way there to describing this low budget, made on a shoestring British gangster movie.It is so full of clichÃ©s and annoying effects especially the filming in black and white with the touch of ""Schindler's list"" using the hint of red to denote danger and death.This is what happens when a director tries to emulate a film like Sin City without a budget, script and most of all talent.Total waste of one hundred minutes of your life."
,mufuti9,2011-03-24T21:38Z,"quality is ok for a 700mb file but DAMN what a disappointment.

A hint for the film makers (and the poor folks enduring this film) - shooting a film in black and white does not make it a film noir.

and this is not one, even though the basic premise might hint at it.
 Sorry, dont want to offend anyone, if you enjoyed it great. but it is a giant insult to the few neo-noirs actually deserving of the name to call this poorly acted and executed piece of shit ""film noir"".

,Theirishfront,2011-03-25T06:32Z,its not cheap just because its in black and white. they made it that way because they wanted too. lol damn
,ronibob,2011-03-25T07:21Z,"i doubt you can by black and white cameras now days, who the hell sells them?"
,skeelol,2011-03-25T09:20Z,"Lmfao I can't believe how dumb some people are. 

""It's so low budget that it's not even filmed in color""

BWAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA I'm literally rolling on the floor crying I'm laughing so hard.

If you can't handle B&W then you don't deserve to even be watching movies. Furthermore they did put some color in it for you crybabies but it obviously didn't help. After 2 minutes in your brain doesn't even realize it's not in color, you silly kids put the movie on and first thing you see is B&W, cry like a bitch and turn it off. Seriously, fuck off and go put on the Miley Cyrus 'movie' you are seeding."
,azzwipe74,2011-03-25T09:47Z,lmfao thats the way skeelol give it to em...will coment after i watch it.
,Phatfish,2011-03-26T01:36Z,"Black and white = Cheap

is not as retarded as it might sound actually, maybe just a bit out of date.

The movie is most likely to be shot with a digital camera coz its way cheaper but if it wasn't its considerably more expensive using color film.

Still, shooting, special FX and editing a film that's BW is WAY easier and less time consuming then color.

However, i dont think that's the main reason it's BW. It's obviously a sad attempt to look like Sin City"
,summer73,2011-03-26T02:23Z,Far all u moaning retards should just not hop on this site if yr just gonna moan n groan like old men n women u guys r proberly making money of this guys hard work GROW UP and be F****en grateful.Great work Tvteam will you be putting Thor out soon been waiting a long tym 4 that movie thanks Kylie

pretty good movie 
and just for the record it is more expensive to turn colour film into black and white rather than just leaving it raw, although it is a low budget film (£2 million/ $3.2 million) it wasn't the best indie film i have ever seen but certainly worth the watch."

,azzwipe74,2011-03-28T08:31Z,"A/9  V/9  M/6 not the worst movie ive ever seen, story line was ok i supose, nothing like sin city or shindlers list type of quality."

,ct7476cm,2011-03-30T01:01Z,"@skeelol hell yea 


a movie is a movie who cares if it is black and white plus no one asked you to download it so ahut the hell up already "
,f4l53,2011-03-30T04:32Z,"so if a movie is black and white, it has to be as good as schindler's list?"
,jm413d,2011-03-30T05:48Z,"People these days are so ignorant. Thank you to those who pointed out the difference between raw B&W, and a film shot in B&W. Downloading this now but wanted to comment on that before I forgot. If you people want to comment on the movie quality go create an IMDB account. If you don't like it delete and move on. It's FREE for fuck's sake. Commentary on the A/V quality is fine but we have IMDB for storyline quality. So fuck off."
,Alkeis,2011-03-31T21:20Z,Didnt get anything from this movie? Few nice scene but mostly just rubbish?
,CyANiDe-TRiP,2011-04-01T01:47Z,"aXXo - Can you guys make sure all your movies stream sound on the Ps3 Please, You guys are the best on here but half to most of your movies don't have sound on the Ps3. THANKS "
,tmankeny,2011-04-03T22:59Z,"the fact that it is black and white doesn't help the movie.  i don't understand why some directors use black and white in this age of media.  i have HD, who doesn't?  i guess the director of this crappy movie.  very boring and slow....oh did i mention its in B&W. ???"

,Crazy Bastard,2011-04-07T00:03Z,one of the worst movies EVER... pure crap!
,Ghostface1983,2011-04-07T15:01Z,"@jm413d

I understand your point but i dont agree with it. I have chosen not to download movies because of alot of bad reviews here. 9 of the 10 i did see, at some later point, did suck.

so commenting on the quality of the movies aswell as the quality of the A/V isnt a bad thing at al imo. Its a good thing even...

*just my 2 cents*  "
,KickassWashingMachine,2011-04-10T14:07Z,"I love how IMDB has trailers so that you don't accidentally download stuff like this! :)

Thanks for the effort, though."

,jjeshop32,2011-04-12T00:22Z,@AZZWIPE74 you put sin city in the same league as shindlers list? Are you serious?

,TorrentTimUK,2011-06-10T08:58Z,Thanks - but the movie/acting not very good.
