[V],twentyforty,2011-03-23T15:24Z,"@billylopez: Movie is not released yet - by end of the Spring, maybe."

"">>shailesh417 at 2011-03-22 14:26 CET: 
plz do godzilla (1998) in 720p type with 700mb size.

i tried riddler's print but its too slow and someone also said the quality is not good.

so plz you do it. 

 twentyforty at 2011-03-22 16:29 CET: 
Godzilla, eh... First of all, I warned you about 1 seed left. Second thing is something that you probably not want to hear, but give a try:

Stating in public that something is bad JUST because someone said so (I guess you have no idea who was that, his credentials and did he saw that at all) - makes me mad, because that type of ""statements"" make my life incredibly harder, even if he is already.

Chances that Riddlera's rip is bad . is ridiculous. His rips are incredibly good regarding size.

Problem is in ""Godzilla"" BluRay: it's voted in ""shittiest"" 20 Blu-ray disks a while ago, sitting there firmly since then.

I watched it for a second time last night - and it's absolute truth.

Godzilla is approx. 2h11 long (when I cue-out on ""Puppets"" in Credits and in no way could be smaller than 1 GB.

BTW - I done it last night.""

So, I expected some other reaction, than pompous ""reminder for service not provided"".

I expected too much, as usual."

,formerly_azrielle,2011-03-23T22:22Z,Thanks to whomever it is with bittornado that made downloading this a speedy pleasure!
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-23T22:49Z,Eh... that's me.
,formerly_azrielle,2011-03-23T22:50Z,"Assuming some generous soul manages a ts or cam of The Lincoln Lawyer, or Hop, for that matter, and should you have opportunity to lay your hands on either, would you consider encoding, regardless of original's quality--or lack thereof?  (Lincoln Lawyer wmv with decryption supposedly available if you go to some website, probably for a fee--at best--or MPAA trapsite at worst, is available on kickass but I deleted it when I found that out--I don't suggest anyone going THERE for it)   Thank you in advance."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-03-23T23:01Z,"*Eh... that's me.*
suspected, shows stars n bars in Bittorrent.  I'm not even going to speculate as to how you manage that--I don't think I want to know!"
