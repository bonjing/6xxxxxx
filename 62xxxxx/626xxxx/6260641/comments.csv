Took me some time to figure out how to crack this maybe I'm just slow but ill share how i did it with the rest of you.

Install DownloadHelper and ConverterHelper (I did it from their own website)
Extract the ""crack"" folder from the torrent
Navigate in windows file explorer to 
c:\users\YOURUSERNAME\Appdata\Roaming\Mozilla\FireFox\Profiles\RANDOM LETTER AND NUMBER COMBINATION.default\extensions

Inside that folder their should be a file something along the lines of {b9db16a4-6edc-47ec-a1f4-b86292ed211d}.xpi  
Extract it using winrar or something similar into a folder of the same name without the .xpi
open this folder and navigate to componets now copy and paste dhConvertMgr.js from the ""cracked"" folder into this folder and replace.

Delete/move the xpi and dowloadhelper should now be cracked.

Thanks again HERiTAGE  :D"

Any help is appreciated."

The folder where the crack used to go is now a file."

,Darklocq,2011-06-16T05:51Z,"I can, sadly, confirm that this no longer works (assuming it used to). I tried it with DownloadHelper 4.8.4, and this version of the add-on doesn't even use a ""dhConvertMgr.js"" file. "
