,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-23T09:27Z,I am currently uploading one of these two songs after just uploading. Thank you so much.
,wintersbutterfly,2011-03-23T10:16Z,"Thank you again in so very much in dl and listening to these...maybe not in what anyone does in these things to resolve any of this...but maybe in these...when I play I play what I felt when Eddie, and if you can feel that...than that is more important to me than anything...and in this is a relief to me. It does not tear at em the the words do in trying so very hard to reach out...in this music...I can reach out. Thank you. I hope I continue to get better at this. I enjoy it and your listening makes me feel better. thx "
