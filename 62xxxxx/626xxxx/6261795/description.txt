Storyline:


GABRIEL tells the story of an archangel who fights to bring light back to purgatory - a place where darkness rules - and save the souls of the city's inhabitants. 

Gabriel is a dark action/drama that takes place in the realm of Purgatory. It reveals the struggle between Arc and Fallen angels for control over the city and its population of re-born souls. At present, darkness rules and Gabriel, the last of seven Arcs sent to return light, must assume a human form for the first time. In the darkest places of the human soul, this lone arc angel's battle with his human feelings and emotions will prove as perilous as facing the Fallen. Purgatory's dangerous and seedy underworld will reveal the human condition as frail and strong, as corruptible and honorable but always undeniably powerful and precious.
