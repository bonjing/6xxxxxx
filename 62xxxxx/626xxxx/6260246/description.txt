This install package was taken directly from an iBook G4 software install disc. This allows you to run classic mac apps (requiring OS 9 or earlier) on PPC Macs (G3, G4, G5) running Mac OS X 10.4. It will NOT work on 10.5 or higher (Leopard, Snow Leopard...). It will NOT work on computers with Intel chips, Mac or otherwise.

Mount the DMG and then run the installer inside. After installation, you can configure Classic via a newly-added pane in System Preferences.
