Having been nurtured on good ol' 70's and 80's rock and metal (Aerosmith, Sabbath, Ozzy, Priest, Maiden, etc.), I have to say that when I first heard KoRn, I was COMPLETELY dumbfounded. I had never HEARD anything like it before. The guitar, usually an instrument of MELODY, had become a roaring instrument of percussion. The vocals, in some brilliant passages, becoming the jittering and throbbing rants of a mental patient before receiving his meds. After listening to the CD a few times, thought, I'm genuinely IMPRESSED. KoRn represents a completely NEW genre of music. It's NOT metal, rap, hip-hop, or rock. The best way I can describe it is that it is the most TRIBAL, EMOTIONAL, ANGRY and INNOVATIVE music that I've ever heard. Sure, It's easy to just call it noise. But this is the kind of stuff that represents what music is all about - the naked expression of feeling, emotion, and experience. You might not care for the emotions or experiences communicated on KoRn's CD's, but you have to sit up and take notice. This is REAL. This IS new. And, unfortunately, that RAGE, ESTRANGEMENT, and ANGER effectively communicates how lot of young people are feeling today. Try it a few times. I DARE you...
