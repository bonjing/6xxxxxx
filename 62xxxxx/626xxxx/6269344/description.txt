Synopsis

MANHATTAN IS UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT.
THEYâ€™RE NOT FROM AROUND HERE.

Welcome to the Big Apple, son. Welcome to the city that never sleeps: invaded by monstrous fusions of meat and machinery, defended by a private army that makes Blackwater look like the Red Cross, ravaged by a disfiguring plague that gifts its victims with religious rapture while it eats them alive. Youâ€™ve been thrown into this meat grinder without warning, without preparation, without a clue.

Your whole squad was mowed down the moment they stepped onto the battlefield. And the chorus of voices whispering in your head keeps saying that all of this is on you: that you and you alone might be able to turn the whole thing around if you only knew what the hell was going on.

Youâ€™d like to help. Really you would. But itâ€™s not just the aliens that are gunning for you. Your own kind hunts you as a traitor, and your job might be a bit easier if you didnâ€™t have the sneaking suspicion they could be right. . . .

NYC 2023. Terrifying alien invaders stalk the streets and a nightmare plague strikes down the city's myriad inhabitants with brutal epidemic speed. The city's systems are in chaos, its streets and skyline are smashed and in flaming ruin. The battle is on against the lethal, armoured, bipedal war machines that stalk ravaged New York.
The novel ties in directly to Crysis 2 and is penned by crticially-acclaimed and Hugo Award-nominated author Peter Watts.
