So if you feel like you waste too much time on Facebook, Twitter, or some other internet site, then this turns off the internet for a set time you tell it to.

Who'd want this?  I love my distractions "

you can also download it here if you like ~ http://visitsteve.com/made/selfcontrol/ 

Give him a dollor or two if you like it. I gave him ten, because he is not some selfish developer. He made it for himself because he thought it would be helpful... then, rather then selling it, he gave it to us for free."
