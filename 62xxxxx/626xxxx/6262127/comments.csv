,hahalolfailmupp,2011-03-22T10:46Z,"peekey you tosser, look at the fucking seeder/leecher ration"
,ArkAngel666,2011-03-22T11:15Z,"@hahalol dude chillax, there are always gonna be ppl that ask stupid questions so just get over it.

as to speed im downloading @ 150-225KB/s so... maybe get a new internet provider or better speed plan you guys that have primative internet? lol"
,lenard102593,2011-03-22T13:57Z,seed more!! pls
,ArkAngel666,2011-03-22T15:49Z,"well now i'm downloading at 500kb/s. im not complaining with that, compared to the ratio thats pretty good i think....

to those that do complain about the speeds, you really need to either lower your standards or get a better internet plan. seriously."
,lenard102593,2011-03-22T16:02Z,this torrent works right??
,Aledd,2011-03-22T16:09Z,You need other sims or is this just a normal game :)
,DarosSkyler,2011-03-22T16:43Z,"@Aledd
It's a new game ;)
so you don't reguire the sims 3."
,ArkAngel666,2011-03-22T17:58Z,"@lenard it comes from a Green Skull (VIP=Safe&Working)

@Aledd Sims Medieval is a stand-alone expansion, meaning it runs on its own without any other requirements."
,walleteater,2011-03-24T20:28Z,"Works well. When copying the crack, first take it off the disc, then rename it .exe ,  as its .ex_. then put it in the proper folder and good to go. thanks "
,ChaseUbito,2011-03-26T08:00Z,"'The dependacy or service group has failed'
I keep getting this."
,mjyumping2,2011-03-27T03:20Z,"Don't want a trouble updating the game from the launcher?
Don't want a trouble pasting again and again a crack everytime you update the game?
THEN USE THE ""MINI IMAGE""
Just mount it in Daemon Tools Lite then play the game! YOU CAN FREELY UPDATE THE GAME EVERYTIME! AND NO NECESSARY CRACKS NEEDED EITHER! USE MINI IMAGE!

,rulerdude,2011-05-26T04:23Z,"Works great! Thanks! Whenever I start the game, though, it tells me there is an update available. Can I install it, or will it detect a cracked game and not be playable any more?"
,rulerdude,2011-05-26T04:38Z,"I managed to find a cracked update that seems to work. You can download it here

,lexi-bby,2011-05-26T06:19Z,"I've downloaded the torrent, burned the disc image, installed, and copied over the cracked content but when I try to play I can't even get past the first quest. As soon as I try to go upstairs to have the sim look in the mirror my screen starts flashing between the game and my desktop and eventually my computer just shuts down. It pops up a blue screen saying something along the lines of ""there was danger so you computer shut down to save itself"". It's happened like four times now and I've uninstalled and reinstalled the game once. Has this happened to anyone else? Help?"
,hejmysticsoul,2011-06-21T14:57Z,What serial number do I type in? Where do I find the freakin keygen?
,hejmysticsoul,2011-06-21T15:53Z,"I figured out how to do it now, but i have one problem. When i copy and try to paste it to the bin (it's supposed to be there right?) it says that there is not enough space. What do i do?"
,mnmari,2011-07-19T07:32Z,Works perfectly. Thanks!
