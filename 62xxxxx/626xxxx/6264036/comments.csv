,morninwoody,2011-06-29T23:17Z,"Hey guys, sorry for taking forever but I have been busy recently when a death of a friend and work/school. I downloaded it myself and everything works fine, but if you guys are having a problem something obviously is not right. I will try and have this re-uploaded within the next couple weeks. I will post the link here and re-upload it to tpb. Thanks for being patient"
