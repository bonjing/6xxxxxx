,policji,2011-03-23T21:38Z,"Why make a torrent of the patch, when you are requested to download it as soon as you start the sims?
Especially odd when cracket to v1.1.10 contains a trojan?"
,NeutralGold,2011-03-24T00:52Z,"I can think of several reasons to post the patch as a torrent. But since your question is meant to belittle the up-loader, I think I'll pass on answering it. 

But I just wanted to let you know that I think you are a moron. Most people would have just ignored your post but I was feeling a bit generous. "

,Unit431,2011-03-24T07:43Z,"policji, I uploaded it because a) some people can't get it through the launcher due to network issues, b) others don't want EA to obtain their IP addresses by allowing the launcher to touch home when it downloads the patch and, finally, c) because I fucking can.

And the 1.1 crack by Trivium IS NOT infected with any trojans. You've either downloaded whatever crack you're talking about through a bad source or you have an over sensitive virus scanner giving you false positives on cracked dll and exe files."
,mjyumping2,2011-03-27T03:21Z,"Don't want a trouble updating the game from the launcher?
Don't want a trouble pasting again and again a crack everytime you update the game?
THEN USE THE ""MINI IMAGE""
Just mount it in Daemon Tools Lite then play the game! YOU CAN FREELY UPDATE THE GAME EVERYTIME! AND NO NECESSARY CRACKS NEEDED EITHER! USE MINI IMAGE!
