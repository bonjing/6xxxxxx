,Markstern,2011-06-04T19:42Z,"jvi2742: Download a Torrent client program (there are several to choose from, BitComet uTorrent, BitLord, BitTornado, Azureus/Vuze etc etc, most are open source and can be downloaded from Sourceforge after a quick google for the client you want) and install it. Configure it (for connections, ports etc, usually more or less automated) and you're ready to go! When you wish to download a torrent after this you just click the Download This Torrent (or whatever it says in Eng) and pick open file, then pick your torrent-client (if it doesn't suggest/bind it automatically) and you should now see a download dialog inside your torrentclient. Pick save location and/or file(s) to download (if not all) and click OK. The download should now begin, and you're done. Hope you can get it to work from this description. Regarding which client to pick it's MOSTLY up to the visuals/control interface you prefer (though some clients are prone to crashing and/or freezing up temporarily sometimes). I myself tried BitLord first, didn't like it, tried uTorrent (liked it but it was prone to crashing on my system, though several of my friends still use this with no problems) and finally settled with BitComet (which I consider the most powerful since it has a great UI imho and is at least alot less unstable than the alternatives on my system). I suggest you try several different clients to get the feel for which one you prefer).
