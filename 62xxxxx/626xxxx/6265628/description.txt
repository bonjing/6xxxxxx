The author is an independent psychic investigator who, with his late wife, Amanda,
spent twelve years researching communication with those in the spiritual world. This
book reveals the results of their work and contains explicit instructions on how to
converse with relatives or friends who have passed on.
Never before, have the principles of such communication been known but now the
author has revealed the secrets of easily learned methods so that serious seekers of the
knowledge of their continued existence after death may find the proof that they need.
Working independently of any organisation, the author has made an important
breakthrough in the technology of communication with the so-called dead and has
received astounding information from the Spiritual Hierarchy which they have asked
him to pass on to others wishing to learn the facts about their own existence.
The methods described may be used by you, alone and at any time. There is no need
for seances, darkened rooms, mediums, trances or special apparatus. All you need to
start with are pencil and paper.
After applying the principles in this book, you may end speculation about survival
after death because you will know. Your psychic awareness, once awakened, is
limitless and it could lead you, as it has done for the author, to unbelievable peace of
mind and happiness as a result of great enlightenment.
The fifty-six principles were given to me by by the late Professor Carl Jung, a High
Spiritual Being once a very famous man on earth, now enjoying the fruits of his
labours on a high plane in the spiritual world where he works with the Hierarchy.
Your psychic channels are opened wider and wider as you progress with your
practices and studies.These Principles constitute the most revealing definition of the mind ever disclosed to mankind.
