Biography

Tub Ring formed in 1992 as a high school punk band.
The band really took form with addition of keyboard player Rob
Kleiner, who spent his teenage years following around the band Mr.
Bungle. With Kleiner added to the band, Tub Ring adopted the
similar sounds of Mr. Bungle. Mr. Bungle guitarist Trey Spruance
took note of Kleiner's passion and creativity and ended up
producing their first official full-length.
Eventually, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Tub Ring associated
with Dog Fashion Disco and Mindless Self Indulgence. For example,
Rob Kleiner filled in for Mindless Self Indulgence's injured
Guitarist, Steve, Righ?, on the road in 2004 and 2005.
On December 10, 2005, Tub Ring came in second place during MTV2's
"Dew Circuit Breakout" competition. Tub Ring performed two songs
throughout the competition including "Future Was Free" as well as a
cover of Justin Timberlake's "Rock Your Body".
On October 17, 2006, it was announced that the band had signed with
the experimental metal/rock record label The End Records on the
label's official website. The band released their album, The Great
Filter.1 on the first of May, 2007.
