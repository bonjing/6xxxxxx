,Cajar_Queen,2011-03-23T19:14Z,"Is this like the retail PC/MAC version, i.e. will it install on Macs?"
,cheezysteeve,2011-03-24T00:14Z,Where the hell is the keygen? I can't find it in the file or iso.
,NeutralGold,2011-03-24T00:58Z,"Hey I just wanted to say, after installing the game and updating it to 1.1, I've been able to play just fine. But upon saving and exiting, restarting my game and trying to load the save, the game crashes. 

No matter what save file I use, it won't load any of them. If anyone else is having the problem and maybe has some kind of fix could you please post? I've only seen one other person mention of this. I've also tried creating several new games to no avail. They all crash once the loading bar fills after trying to load the town.

,mjyumping2,2011-03-27T03:15Z,"Don't want a trouble updating the game from the launcher?
Don't want a trouble pasting again and again a crack everytime you update the game?
THEN USE THE ""MINI IMAGE""
Just mount it in Daemon Tools Lite then play the game! YOU CAN FREELY UPDATE THE GAME EVERYTIME! AND NO NECESSARY CRACKS NEEDED EITHER! MINI IMAGE!
