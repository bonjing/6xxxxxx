"Chuck Versus The Muuurder" 

Chuck (Zachary Levi) is put in charge 
of a top-priority mission, but his 
leadership skills are pushed to the 
limit when there is a murder in Castle. 
Meanwhile, Awesome (Ryan McPartlin) 
takes on a mission of his own when 
Ellie (Sarah Lancaster) finds an 
alarming new hobby. Elsewhere, Morgan's 
(Joshua Gomez) leadership is also 
tested when his Buy More troops wage 
war against Large Mart.

Enjoy :)
