,Markbng,2011-04-11T11:37Z,"I found a method on youtube that works....
Just block Regsitrybooster from the internet connection.
Paste this with wordpad in ""RegistryBooster2011.reg"" and double-click the file:

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{66135455-2579-3429-2ff3-452b757a0104}]
""License""=""RB-T5Q5J-TLUEE-8A4TE-9KTJ5-8FADX-BUBRG""
"
,rogantu,2011-04-25T09:10Z,"thank you lol.
guys just download the normal registry booster ^^
I entered the serial RB-T5Q5J-TLUEE-8A4TE-9KTJ5-8FADX-BUBRG first without internet, but it needs internet.
voila internet on+serial+the real version = win"

oh yes I downloaded ur torrent, but it is not needed, thanks for just posting the picture and thanks to the dude above me for posting the code so I could copy it :)"
,shailm_85,2011-05-04T15:17Z,"its working for me

1) install (dont allow internet access)
2) register with ""RB-T5Q5J-TLUEE-8A4TE-9KTJ5-8FADX-BUBRG""
3) it will say it needs net access & will give u a manual register link, click it
4) it will open webpage with a download link of a ""register_uniblue_product.reg"" file
5) download it & run it.
6) Quit Registry Booster from the system tray
7) restart it.
Done. Enjoy....."
,shailm_85,2011-05-04T15:28Z,"2nd Methord

1) install (dont allow internet access)
2) open regedit 
3) open find window Check all options including ""Match the whole String""
4) search for ""FC"" (without Quotes) it will be like
eg. ""HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Wow6432Node\CLSID\{16202563-2579-3429-2ff3-452b757a0104}"" for 64 bit
""HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{16202563-2579-3429-2ff3-452b757a0104}"" for 32 bit
5) right click in the empty space below ""FC"" 
6) New > string value
7) name it ""License"" with ""RB-T5Q5J-TLUEE-8A4TE-9KTJ5-8FADX-BUBRG"" as its value/Data
8) Quit Registry Booster from the system tray
9) restart it."
