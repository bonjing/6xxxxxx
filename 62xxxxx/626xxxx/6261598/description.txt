Subtitles: None
Date: 2011.03

Director: Daniel Anker, Barak Goodman
Genre: Docu
Plot: A look at the infamous "Scottsboro Boys" case that occurred in Alabama 
in 1931, in which nine young black men were arrested, tried and quickly 
convicted in the rape of two white women, despite overwhelming evidence that 
showed their accusers had falsely accused them and the fact that one of the 
women later admitted that no rape had in fact occurred (although both had had 
sexual relations with their boyfriends on the day prior to the "rape"). The 
case was one of the first that shined a spotlight on what many called the 
"legal lynchings" that occurred in the South whenever blacks were accused 
of crimes, especially against whites and most especially against white women.
