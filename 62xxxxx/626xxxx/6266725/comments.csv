plz help my!!!"
,condiff,2011-03-27T10:33Z,You must copy the paul.dll file to the installation.  This file is giving a false positive for a virus on AVG.  I looked up the details on the AVG website and they have no information.  I disabled anti virus protection for the paul.dll file as well as the LegoCloneWars.exe file and it works fine.  AVG identified the crack and seems to think it's dangerous.  It is a false positive!!!  Again...  There is no virus!!!
,jamie365,2011-03-27T12:25Z,Can someone please send me the crack for this its no longer in my install folder for some reason. just pm me for my email 
,clemet123,2011-03-27T19:16Z,"where i can get activation code???

,jpmaximus,2011-03-28T07:00Z,"Ya so the game plays fine up till chapter 1 part 5 where you have to go to the weapons factory. You cant beat the level. Once you get the reactor down to about 1/3 its HP, it wont go down any further. SO i dont think the game is fully cracked yet. Any word on when another crack is comming?"
,VectusKL,2011-03-30T17:31Z,"this game doesnt work. you need an activation code even with the Paul.dll file in the skidrow folder does nothing. 

getting abit fed up how long its taking for games to get cracked nowadays. If I have to wait half a year for that to happen, I might as well just wait to buy the game. pretty lame, so lame. useless site."
,VectusKL,2011-03-30T17:38Z,"I noticed when you copy the Paul.DLL file in the installation folder, it just does egg timer for 3 seconds and then nothing. I went and tried it on my brothers windows 7 PC, and I had to get tons of .DLL files just to get it working, after that it just crashes. such a load of shit, I cant believe i wasted 8 hours downloading this, taking about an hour and a half to install. then nothing. 

this game has been out for 5 days. Im shocked its not even been properly released on this site yet. didnt see black ops, AC Brotherhood and all them taking days to weeks to get cracked and working. whats the excuse for this? "

,Krysik,2011-04-03T16:11Z,"Dear Everybody who has been having trouble with installing the game.

1) THERE IS NO VIRUS!
2) So yeah the paul.dll is required.
How to make the game work without the cd-key popping up:

Open the installation folder when you mount the cd. There should be a MAP SKIDROW there. It has two files. paul.dll and SKIDROW. 
Copy these files and paste them into the folder where Lego Star Wars 3 was installed. 
Then..... double click on the SKIDROW Application and either watch the video or just press Escape. 

Now you no longer need a cd-key. "
