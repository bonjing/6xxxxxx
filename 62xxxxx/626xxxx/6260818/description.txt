Now That's What I Call
Club Hits 2 (2010)


Released just over a year after the first volume, Now Thatâ€™s What I Call Club Hits, Vol. 2 rounds up some of the more successful club singles of late 2009 and 2010. Unsurprisingly, it is heavy on remixes of songs that were popular in non-remixed form, including Katy Perry's â€œCalifornia Girls (Armand Van Helden Remix),â€ Usherâ€™s â€œOMG (Almighty Mix),â€ Black Eyed Peas' â€œImma Be (Wolfgang Gartner Mix),â€ and Lady Gaga's â€œBad Romance (Skrillex Remix).â€ In fact, Cascadaâ€™s â€œEvacuate the Dancefloorâ€ is the only track to appear in its original form. Regardless, this is a decent overview of mainstream club music that, like the parent series, documents a specific point in time.
