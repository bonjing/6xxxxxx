Perkinsâ€™ death was confirmed by his agent, Hugh Southard, who said the musician lost his life due to cardiac arrest at his home in Austin, Texas. His love for work was infinite and at this age he was active as a young horse while he registered his name as the oldest Grammy winner in February for Best Traditional Blues Album for â€œJoined at the Hip: Pinetop Perkins & Willie â€œBig Eyesâ€ Smith.â€ Perkins became the part of Muddy Waters band in 1969 and enjoyed great success with it.

In 1980 I went to a local blues bar to see Mike & the Tornadoes featuring ""Pinetop"" Perkins.
On the first set Pinetop was not playing and I must say that I was not impressed with Mike & his group.
Pinetop came out & started playing on the second set.
There was a transformation. Everyone in the group feed off Pinetop and took it up a notch. It was excellent.
Pinetop had the ability to bring out the best in other musicians.
Oh yeah and during breaks he did like to talk it up with those pretty women.
R.I.P. Pinetop"
