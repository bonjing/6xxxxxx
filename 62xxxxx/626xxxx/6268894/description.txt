Implant - F Paul  Wilson

Young doctor Gina Panzella deeply respects her boss, plastic surgeon Dr. Duncan Lathram. Charming and brilliant, Duncan has invented an implant that allows incisions to heal without scarring. Duncan's artistry in the operation room is the salvation of Washington's biggest power players whenever they need touch-ups for C-Span.
But there are a few things about Duncan that Gina can't quite figure out. What caused his daughter's death and the breakup of his marriage? What is his connection to two committee members who died in accidents not long after Duncan operated on them?
With the help of Gerry Canney, a high school classmate now working for the FBI, Gina determines to find out what ruined Duncan's personal life and aroused his wrath against the congressmen.
