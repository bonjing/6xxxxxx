[V],Shroo,2011-03-24T01:49Z,"You have to trust us, n I think Green skull should explain that there is no bs :]"
,GMDFUCKU,2011-03-24T04:44Z,"it wasnt a false positive. windows popped up saying it was trying to access some shit and asked if i wanted to let it. i know i can trust u, i just thought it was weird. never had that happen."

,toxicity2,2011-03-29T01:17Z,"still no luck. Man wtf, I've tried every single crack/fix and other fix out there, and I got nothing.

Tried deleting the thing in my documents, tried editing some .ini's, even fucked with control panels settings and stuff. 

Running windows 7 64 bit, could that be the problem?"

,xiIix,2011-04-27T10:20Z,Still have the sound issue. It's so horrible. Sounds like overmodulated shit. It's so bad.
