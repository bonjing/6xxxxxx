,eMelus,2011-06-23T15:51Z,"The video is EXCELLENT...but I didnt realize that it was DTS, which my computer doesn't natively support...so I downloaded the torrent from http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6332365/The.King_s.Speech.2010.480p.BDRip.x264.AC3.D-Z0N3 and muxed the AC3 audio into this torrent's video. Anyways, for the 1080P AC3 version, http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6266220/The_King_s_Speech_(2010)_1080p_AC3_DTS_Eng-Spa-NLSubs-DMT"
