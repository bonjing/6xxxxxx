Might be helpful to know a tiny bit about string theory and cold fusion to enjoy it fully.

Highly recommended sci-fi movie, in the true spirit of the genre. 

Thank you! :) "

Do NOT waste your time watching this sorry
excuse for a film. Read the reviews in IMDb
and pay attention to the ones with less than
two stars, they're dead on. I don't know which
is worse, the fact that I sat through this turd,
or that someone actually had the audacity to
make it. I want my hour and a half back!"
,sardox,2011-03-27T07:01Z,"What happened to my comment?
I can't review the damned film here?
I'm not some MPAA stooge, I'm a real
person, and I'd like to let everyone know
how horrible this film was. I wasted 1:28
watching this turd. Read the reviews on IMDB
and believe the ones with low numbers."
,captaincarter1st,2011-03-27T08:17Z,"funny sardox... ""ah man... they got it in for me"".. you do realize what type of site this is sardox? this is the last place that would silence someone.. too funny!"

,BillVero,2011-03-29T14:52Z,"Ditto on what sardox said - is may be the most boring, useless movie I've ever seen. Out of the 90 minutes or so there was probably less than 15 minutes of dialog. I could have been watching a slide show. The download is good but the movie is not."
,blueblood95,2011-03-31T13:49Z,"Im with Sardox too, this movie was nothing but a waste of fucking time.

,davo71,2011-04-01T04:51Z,"A/10 V/10 The quality is very good but the movie is horrid. M/-10 thats a negative ten. If I had of paid to watch this movie, I would not only demand my money back. I would have wanted credit for next time."
[V],matimike,2011-04-01T15:02Z,thanks
,fightthenwofuckers,2011-04-07T21:33Z,MUST BE A JEW FILM. TOTAL SHIT BRAIN MUSH
,PhiberOptix,2011-04-10T14:52Z,"If you are a religious zealot who knows nothing about science, then clearly this movie isn't for you.
This is a very interesting movie however, like Lugubrizione pointed out, you need to have an interest in science to fully enjoy this movie. "
