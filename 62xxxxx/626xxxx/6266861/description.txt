Assassin\'s Creed II Brotherhood, the inner sequel to the amazing Assassin\'s Creed II, while it didn\'t live up to AC2 it won a place in our hearts with us AC fans and it tied in the events as noted in the books perfectly.

So, step in the Animus and prepare to enjoy the full OST from AC:Brotherhood, composed by Jesper Kid(Bad Sp, possibly) and relieve the memories of playing such a good game.

Full list of the songs can be found here
