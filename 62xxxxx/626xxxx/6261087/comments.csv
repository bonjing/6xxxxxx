,SupDotCom,2011-03-23T06:19Z,are there any differences between the eu and us version?
,Shadow7th,2011-03-23T09:43Z,I am currently downloading...! Thanks in advance for the upload. KIU
,Shadow7th,2011-03-23T09:47Z,"Also to answer to some questions. The is NO difference between the two versions (EU, US). The only difference is on what Demo you have played. EU demos will load only on the EU edition and US on the US version. So there is not an actual difference besides this. Hope I help you :)"
,Atlas91,2011-03-23T16:14Z,"There are two uploads for the US version, this one and the Mexat one. Mexat's is 1.56gb. Why the drastic size difference? "
,notforlonger,2011-03-23T16:42Z,cause this is compressed and the other one is not
,Atlas91,2011-03-23T17:09Z,"Ahh, ok. Just wanted to make sure because it's a really big difference. The other one's almost twice the size."
,NitrogenUA,2011-03-23T22:54Z,"yup. my way to save the bandwidth, especially, when so much titles coming out.

also results in shorter download times - C.O. ;)"
,RayMafnas,2011-03-24T06:23Z,umm what do i get when i use a demo savedata ? like exclusive stuff and things? cause i didnt try the demo cant find where to download...

,sylvanalex,2011-03-24T08:27Z,NitrogenUA i got a favor to ask.... can u upload Legend of Heroes 2 and 3 i really cant find a fast torrent to get it cuz they are a bit old games for psp :/ 
,cstkyd,2011-03-24T16:27Z,"working with 5.00 m33-6, nitrogenUA = my idol"
,NitrogenUA,2011-03-24T19:13Z,"RayMafnas, they are equal content-wise, pick whichever you like. I've chose US version, since i've played original Dissidia of US region, therefore i can import my savegame from original.

Speaking of Prologus, i haven't tried it too, but i've heard you can get a bonus character in 012 by importing completed savegame from Prologus.

,Nafis666,2011-03-24T20:22Z,okay...I've been having this problem which made me open this account in the first place...I downloaded both your EUR and US versions...both of them start up perfectly and then after the first tutorial sequence it just freezes in the loading screen. the orbs keep floating and all but nothing ever happens...i'm running 5.50 prome-4 (phat) without any plugins..help?..please!! >.< 
,Nafis666,2011-03-24T20:29Z,okay i downloaded both your EUR and US verions..both of them start up perfectly and then freeze at the loading screen after the first tutorial sequence..any solutions? :/...running on 5.50 prome-4 with psp fat..got no plugins :/
,Nafis666,2011-03-25T09:13Z,damn..sorry for the double comment...internet's acting crazy 
,JIHUIN,2011-03-26T05:03Z,"@Nafis666
Did you already check the setting of your CPU Clock XMB and CPU Clock Game. Go to the recovery menu by pressing the SELECT button and see if the clock is set to ""Default"". Try also to set your on 333.
Check also the setting for UMD ISO MODE. Set the mode to SONY NP9660 or M33 driver...see which of the two modes can make the game run.

I hope this could help you. "
,NitrogenUA,2011-03-26T09:25Z,"sylvanalex, i don't think you need a password. that site doesn't require registration in the first place. also both links lead me directly to torrent downloads. most likely the speed is pain, but it's free afterall. Anyway, good luck downloading these."
,Nafis666,2011-03-26T09:32Z,"@JIHUIN...nah tried that..no help..i guess the problem is with my MS..the last game i tried playing on it was God of war ghost of sparta and it would shut down completely after just starting :/
gotta get a new one >."
,JaiCameron,2011-03-27T16:22Z,"Whoa fast download, very nice dude! Anyway I'm gonna test this out with pro B3 on my psp 3000, I'll report back results. "
