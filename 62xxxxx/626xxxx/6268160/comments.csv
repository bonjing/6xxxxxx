,hakuna_matata,2011-03-24T17:26Z,"@20-40

Thanks for Bibles.Buried.Secrets .. I was looking for this yesterday. How many parts are in total?
"
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-24T17:37Z,"Thanks.

Regarding LOST GIRL:

New encodes are 489p HDTV without TV logo - old ones were plain 352p SD.  I must warn all interested - to DOWNLOAD new encodes within 48h - and I would not be doing Season Pack afterward. I cannot.

Therefore, download as they go up - and - I (and many of the fans of that show) would be happy if someone with decent Upload speed (50 kB/s and above) make Season Pack and up and seed torrent for at least one month.

Same goes with all my TV shows encodes.

Let me remind all that I encoded that show as the result of request of my friend ""lilars"" (Bob) who died last year, and probably these new encodes goes on his moral account too. Rest in piece, my friend, you deserve it."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-24T17:45Z,"@hakuna_matata: Three, you missed two by now. This one is re-up of last week episode.

This series is so fundamental ( and in three parts only ) and good and recommended and a must-see that I would up HDTV 480p versions when show ends."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-24T17:49Z,"LOL

ERR.

 489p HDTV =  480p HDTV"

,jon4fun,2011-03-24T18:28Z,"Hi 20-40,

Big THANKS for re-UP'ing Bible Buried Secrets - Part 1.

But...Lost Girl is such a GOOD FANTASY series, it stands on its own merit.  I understand it got renewed--now if its parent network can just survive..."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-24T22:03Z,"@formerly_azrielle: Luckily, for people who download my encodes of TV shows, faith of shows  and even what would be in these Packs is not entirely up to me. If that is the case, I would be encoding three-for episodes in week, and maybe one or two movies in whole year. I listen, keep eyes wide open and do my best to guide people through the jungle full of wishes, few wet drams and just handful of nonpoisonous fruits."
,the_shroud,2011-03-25T00:48Z,"omg, never realised lilars has passed on. RIP Bob"
