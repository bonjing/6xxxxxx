I can´t get further than trying to copy the Flipendo sign because I always perfectly copy it but I can never reach the 50% because it won´t go over 30%. 
Does anyone have an idea how to fix this"

,unknowen,2011-11-28T17:12Z,"Had one issue with this torrent. After installation when I tried to play the game I got the message:

General Protection Fault 
History: AppInit

I resolved this by searching for the file hp.ini and deleting it. Then I was able to run and use the game as usual."
,legend786,2012-02-24T06:46Z,when i am trying to install the game it says that insert disk 2 that contain the file ..\System\Editor.u can anyone help me??????

,debudspup,2012-06-08T21:21Z,"ok so im sort of a noob at all this and im a little slow in some technological areas, so please explain in simple terms. When i try to install the actual game it says i need a 16-digit code from the back of the box. Obviously i don't have the back of the box. What is the code and where did you find it (i want to know where to get the code so i don't have to ask every time i download)"
,debudspup,2012-06-08T21:29Z,Never mind i got it. Now i feel like an idiot
