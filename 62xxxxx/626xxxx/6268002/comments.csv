there is nothing in quran about 70 offshoots, I memorized all quraan and nothing like this is in quran.

and about the 170 who claim to be true muslim; all of them have the same quran, and the right muslims of those 170 are who obey quran exactly, so it is very clear who is true and wrong, & FOR YOU MY FRIEND ALL WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO TO KNOW THE TRUTH IS TO LEARN BETTER ABOUT QURAN & it will be then very clear who is the real muslim, so please don't judge on islam by deeds of muslims(not real muslims, but masking by islam), just judge by what you read in quran

may allah guide you the right way (this is the goal of islam, not to kill nor to burn in hell)

best regards

no one hate you or wish you to be burn in hell; it is just that the aim of islam to guide people to the right way, but you are talking unrespectfully about allah & Muhammad _ peace upon him_ & that what you will be hated and wished hell for, and we are not going to respond the same way, we will leave this to time wich will show you how wrong you were ,,,, that's our morals in talking to people (respect, no anger, no respond to bad by bad),  allah said in quran in Surat FuÅŸÅŸilat ayah 34 : (((And not equal are the good deed and the bad. Repel [evil] by that [deed] which is better; and thereupon the one whom between you and him is enmity [will become] as though he was a devoted friend.)))

and in Surat Al-QaÅŸaÅŸ ayah 55 : (((And when they hear ill speech, they turn away from it and say, ""For us are our deeds, and for you are your deeds. Peace will be upon you; we seek not the ignorant."")))

and in Surat Al-FurqÄn ayah 63 :(((And the servants of the Most Merciful are those who walk upon the earth easily, and when the ignorant address them [harshly], they say [words of] peace,)))

those sections from Quran where a good proof that islam never order bad things even for those who do bad things for, so you can only judge on islam by looking to quran and what he orders and teaches, not by semi-muslims deeds
