,TempDude29,2011-03-24T11:37Z,"Its probably a false positive, but when I run the installer I get a trojan warning in my temp folder."
,TempDude29,2011-03-24T11:38Z,"My antivirus reacts to the file ""dll.exe"" and thinks it is a trojan. ""TrojWare.Win32.Olmarik.AOG"" to be precise."
[H],HeroMaster,2011-03-24T11:49Z,@TempDude29 Disable your anti-virus then install and start the game.
,TempDude29,2011-03-24T12:31Z,"Yeh I can put the file on the ""exceptions"" list.
I figure I'd comment on the false positive here in case anyone else got the same virus-warning"
