Crimson Hardcore
REDALiCE (ALiCE\'S EMOTiON)
[TCSLCD-0001] 2009
FLAC
Hardcore, Happy Hardcore, Gabber

This is a hardcore album independently composed and published by REDAliCE, the founder of the ALiCE\'S EMOTiON and HARDCORE TANO*C music circles. Guest appearances by Nomiya Ayumi in tracks 04 and 15, and DJ CHAMP in track 08. The album is enjoyable, containing two of my favorite songs, Presonus 2008 and Cross Breeding. If you like some upbeat and friendly hardcore, give this album a shot, you might even become an addict of REDALiCE like myself ^_^.

REDALiCE works very hard to organize the ALiCE\'s EMOTION and HARDCORE TANO*C circles, and is a very active and prolific producer of fresh, innovative music. If you enjoy his works, and if you are able, I encourage you to support him in producing music by purchasing the albums he appears on, attending his live-sets, or sharing tracks with your friends.

Enjoy.
