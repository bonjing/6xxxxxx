Animated Themes

PhotoPresenter 4 ships with many new and revised high-quality themes to create impressive animated slidehows. Select the photos or movies you'd like to present, along with music from your iTunes library; then just choose a theme and you're done. With only a few clicks you can show your clients, friends and family a selection of elaborately animated photos from your last photo shoot.

iPhoto, Flickr, Facebook, Photo Booth, Aperture

PhotoPresenter 4 is a good citizen on your Mac. It integrates with all of the iApps â€” iTunes, iDVD, iWeb and iPhoto â€” and also with Photo Booth and Aperture. If you're part of the Flickr or Facebook communities, you can access your photos there as well and use them for your presentation.

Sharing

The most elegant way to share your masterpieces is to create a standalone player. With a standalone player, every Mac user can enjoy your work at the best possible quality without having PhotoPresenter installed. If your audience does not have a Mac, you can export the presentations as video with many formats to choose from, including DVD, web, iPhone, iPod, iPad and Apple TV.

Automation with Smart Albums

PhotoPresenter 4 recognizes changes in Flickr Groups and Sets as well as in iPhotoâ€™s or Apertureâ€™s Smart Albums. New photos are integrated into the presentation instantly. This is the fastest way to keep a portfolio or your clientâ€™s projects up-to-date automatically. To optimize your workflow, PhotoPresenter can be extended easily with Automator Actions and Applescript scripts.
