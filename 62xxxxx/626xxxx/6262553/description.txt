Joseph Campbell - Masks of God

Joseph Campbell published a four volume series called The Masks of God between 1962 and 1968. The work represents almost a lifetime of exploring most of the cultures of the world. Joseph Campbell had the superb ability to probe the mysteries of life through the eyes of many cultures. I know of no other work as broad and as deep as The Masks of God.
