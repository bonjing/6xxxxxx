Linda Ronstandt - Tell Him [Bananas tv show ].VOB


Very HQ Bananas tv show promo music video from an outstanding and very rare 1980's tv show from Germany, broadcasted from 1981 to 1984, this is practically unknown in America, but this show has very well known artists of the 1980's.

The rarity of this show is that, all the appearances of very well known guests are a whole new promo music video production that easly could be considered as never seen before videos or second versions of several classic 80's videos.

"Tell Him" is a song from Get Closer, a Gold-plus, Grammy-nominated album by singer/songwriter/producer Linda Ronstadt. It arrived two and a half years after Linda's controversial Punk Rock Mad Love album. It was taken out of print in 2009.

Get Closer found Ronstadt returning to the genres that had resulted in her commercial and critical success throughout the 1970s, and working again with British musician and producer Peter Asher. It was noted by critics that, whereas she had spent the '70s channeling the music of then-upcoming songwriters such as Warren Zevon, Elvis Costello, Karla Bonoff and J. D. Souther, on Get Closer Ronstadt sang older songs, some originated by established artists such as Billy Joe Royal, George Jones and Ike and Tina Turner, and others originated by lesser-known soul artists and one-hit wonders such as the Knickerbockers, the Exciters, Lee Dorsey and Wade Flemons.

Commercially, the album fell short of Ronstadt's prior efforts, peaking at #31 on the Billboard album chart in late 1982 and being certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of over 500,000 copies. (By contrast, 1980's Mad Love had debuted in the Top Five and was certified Platinum in several weeks.) Get Closer was Ronstadt's first album release in 10 years to miss a million-selling Platinum certification although it reached sales of 900,000 copies.
