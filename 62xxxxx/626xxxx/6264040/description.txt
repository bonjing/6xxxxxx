About amiraÂ®
Amira is a powerful, multifaceted software platform for visualizing, manipulating, and understanding 
Life Science and bio-medical data coming from all types of sources and modalities.


It allows you to visualize scientific data sets from various application areas, e.g. medicine, biology,
chemistry, physics, or engineering. Amira provides methods to generate 3D grids from voxel data 
representing an image volume, and it includes a general purpose interactive 3D viewer. 
Amira's State-of-the-art visualization techniques allow you to gain detailed insight into your data. 
Graphics hardware support is utilized to display even very large data sets at interactive speed. 
Powerful automatic and interactive segmentation tools support processing of 3D image data. 
Novel, fast, and robust reconstruction algorithms make it easy to create polygonal models from segmented objects. 
In addition, true volumetric tetrahedral meshes can be generated, suitable for advanced finite-element simulations. 
Simulation results as well as other data defined on a variety of different grids can be investigated using a 
large set of powerful visualization methods.
