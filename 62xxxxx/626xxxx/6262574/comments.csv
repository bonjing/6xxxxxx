[T],extremezone,2011-03-22T19:36Z,"NOTE
If you start the game without copying over crack first it wont work
To solve it you just have to rename the .ex to .exe and it should be fine"

,Whatlaws,2011-03-23T06:33Z,"Green- the patch 1.1 stuff people are talking about refers to a patch that EA released to fix a lot of bugs in the original software. I highly recommend patching to 1.1 if you plan on playing the game. There is a torrent for the 1.1 patch crack floating around on here as well and the patch can be found through google easily.

Just finished installing, playing through the tutorial, running super antispyware, cccleaner (habit), malwarebyte, and spybot without getting a hit vital to this software, the patch I grabbed from the net, or the crack of the 1.1 patch. Enjoy and download without fear.

As always, if you end up enjoying the game, support the devs by buying a copy! A+ to extremezone yet again"
,Green-Banana,2011-03-23T06:35Z,That's not really what we need.  Apply it to the context.  Version 1.1 and this torrent.  The foremost apparent question would be how they two relate.

Yes its patched, and cracked, and the crack IS necessary or you get an ""invalid CD"" message and the game shuts down. Option menu doesn't work.

 If your lucky enough to have it not crash during the tutorial, you can make it through by saving an ungodly amount of times because of the random crashing. So i'm going to amount it to a bad copy and am going to try a different torrent to see if theres better results."

so now i'm reinstalling it and i'm going to use a different keygen, but i'd love to know a solution for this just in case it comes up again. i might have accidentally done something wrong, but if someone could reply to me in a timely fashion, it would be most appreciated. thank you!

Copy over the crack, but then when you copy it over, Rename the file that saids TSM.ex_ to TSM.exe. If you haven't done it already, and then you have to create a shortcut because you have to start it up by double clicking the cracked file. Or atleast to me I have to. If you did these things then, I have no idea O.o.

@simsgirl

Hmmm, When you copied over the new crack that I put a link out for, did you create a shortcut of the new one? Is there a possibility that you have the 1.1 crack but you are using the old one? Double check. Make sure you have a shortcut to the new 1.1 crack . and open it from there. Let me know, if that helps! "

,Metal-head,2011-03-25T01:31Z,"For Mac users:

First update your game to 1.1.
then use 1.1 crack, TRIVIUM or Reloaded.

- Go to your sims medieval folder
- Right click on the Sims.app en select ""show package contents""
- Double-click on Info.plist and open with TextEditor
- Search for SMLauncher.exe and change it to TSM.exe
- Save it and close.
- no go to your Application folder and start sims normally (sims.app)

it should work

hope this helps"

1. Download this torrent
2. Mount using PowerISO (It's what I used anyway)
3. Install the game (Do not play just yet)
4. Go into the ""Crack"" folder of the game
5. Copy ""TSM.ex_"" and ""TSLHost.dll"" into the ""Bin"" folder. You will probably be told that this file already exists, and given some options. In this case, just click on the option to replace.
6. Download this torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6264085/The.Sims.medieval.v1.1.only.crack-TRiViUM_
7. When torrent is finished downloading, extract the folder to desktop or wherever you want, and copy both files into the game bin.  Again, if prompted, just click the replace option.
8. Now you can play! :) Always use the ""TSM"" icon to play the game, not the original ones. Have fun! :)

Yes,

You should update too 1.1 because 1.0 crashes alot.
Someone on this site uploaded 1.1 update + crack in one package from RELOADED.
I suggest you download that and crack it.

If you already updated your game find a 1.1 crack (I recommend RELOADED 1.1 crack on this site) and copy TSM.exe and TSLHost.dll inside the sims medieval contents it was something like transgaming/c_drive/gamedata/bin/ etc etc etc.

hope it works"

here is the one I used (I just trust RELOADED)

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6268933/The_Sims_Medieval_Update_v1.1.10_Cracked-RELOADED

you need to replace TSM.exe and TSLHost.dll
then go to Info.plist and just double click so it opens with TextEditor
find the line where SMLauncher.exe is and just backspace or delete it and type TSM.exe.
save it and play ^^"

Although I have been gaming 'illegally' I made a truly dumb mistake, which i have seen in several posts here, namely renaming the .ex_ file. 
Of course you cannot change a file while its still on the cd (duh, took me hour to figure out), so first copy it to where its supposed to be (in Bin map), delete the original .exe file and then copy the crack and rename it. 
Secondly a lot of people where complaining about the crack so on forehand i downloaded and used trivium (i know i am not spelling this right but u know what i mean) crack. With this crack the game crashed indeed. So I used the crack with this torrent, worked perfectly! As said in post before, the .dll file is only necessary to copy when starting is from launcher in stead of tsm.exe.. 
As for serial (which has also been mentioned before) there are several serials in these comments and there is a serial generator in the crack map. 
I hope this helps some people.. Game has worked perfectly for me!"

,Metal-head,2011-03-28T21:27Z,"@Candide_Slater 

What i mean is replace the original TSM.exe and TSHost.dll (something like that) with the crack file.
If you updated to version 1.1 DON'T use the crack on the iso. The files on the iso are for 1.0
go for RELOADED 1.1 or TRiViUM 1.1 crack.
Replace the original files with the reloaded or trivium one.
If you did that and you changed the Info.plist
just launch sims medieval normally.

I have a similar problem, mine pc crashed whenever I tried to add a new building, after a while I stopped trying to add new ones and continued playing with what I had until I passed that 'level' and went onto the next ambition. I thought I had gotten rid of this dreaded crashing business for good but unfortunately no, it keeps happening.

I have found however, that reducing all possible settings to the lowest level they can go does reduce the amount of crashes but it isn't a permanent fix. This is simply a glitch that cannot be fixed with any patches etc, EB games will have to sort this one out which may take a few weeks. When they do, I plan to download a different version of the game."

Here is the solutions!

You will need to install the game first. You won't be able to open the keygen since it can't open in Mac, so you will need to find a serial. I found mine on tpb comment section.

Then update your game to 1.1. You can do that by opening the Sims Medieval and let it auto update.

After that, download a 1.1 crack. Copy and replace the content here: The Sims Medieval -> Show Package Contents -> Contents -> Resources -> transgaming -> c_drive -> Program Files -> Electronic Arts -> The Sims Medieval -> Game -> bin

- Go to your sims medieval folder
- Right click on the Sims.app en select ""show package contents""
- Double-click on Info.plist and open with TextEditor
- Search for SMLauncher.exe and change it to TSM.exe
- Save it and close.
- no go to your Application folder and start sims normally (sims.app)"

For those with MACS

Here is the solutions!

when your done downloading this mount the disk in the The.Sims.Medieval-RELOADED folder 

You will need to install the game first. (You won't be able to open the keygen since it can't open in Mac, so you will need to find a serial. I found mine on tpb comment section.) try one of these 
YAF7-QJKH-MNEP-LMNY-SRLD
BP2S-NQSX-8DBW-48DG-ZRLD
JYDM-2WXX-V7E3-RV72-7RLD

Then update your game.  You can do that by opening the Sims Medieval (the actual app its in a folder in your applications!)  and let it auto update. when it asks would you like to update click ok. let it do its thing.

After that, download a 1.1 crack. this one (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6261577/The_Sims_Medieval-RELOADED_CRACK_ONLY_DiBYA)

open up the crack folder and open up the .rar file (I use UnRarX its free also) take all the files that were un .rar-ed (accept the Readme@DiBYA.txt) and Replace the content here: The Sims Medieval -> Show Package Contents -> Contents -> Resources -> transgaming -> c_drive -> Program Files -> Electronic Arts -> The Sims Medieval -> Game -> bin

just drag those three files over and  Finder will ask do you want to replace these files? and say ok.

close all unnecessary windows and

For those with MACS

Here is the solutions!

when your done downloading this mount the disk in the The.Sims.Medieval-RELOADED folder 

You will need to install the game first. (You won't be able to open the keygen since it can't open in Mac, so you will need to find a serial. I found mine on tpb comment section.) try one of these 
YAF7-QJKH-MNEP-LMNY-SRLD
BP2S-NQSX-8DBW-48DG-ZRLD
JYDM-2WXX-V7E3-RV72-7RLD

Then update your game.  You can do that by opening the Sims Medieval (the actual app its in a folder in your applications!)  and let it auto update. when it asks would you like to update click ok. let it do its thing.

After that, download a 1.1 crack. this one (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6261577/The_Sims_Medieval-RELOADED_CRACK_ONLY_DiBYA)

open up the crack folder and open up the .rar file (I use UnRarX its free also) take all the files that were un .rar-ed (accept the Readme@DiBYA.txt) and Replace the content here: The Sims Medieval -> Show Package Contents -> Contents -> Resources -> transgaming -> c_drive -> Program Files -> Electronic Arts -> The Sims Medieval -> Game -> bin

just drag those three files over and  Finder will ask do you want to replace these files? and say ok.

close all unnecessary windows and

- Go to your sims medieval folder again (in your applications folder)
- Right click on the The Simsâ„¢ Medieval.app en select ""show package contents""
-open the contents folder
- Double-click on Info.plist and open with TextEditor
- Search for SMLauncher.exe and change it to TSM.ex_ (its in the middle of the length of text one of the longer sentences)

1. Fail,
or, 2. Are kinda slow sometimes or haven't downloaded anything in a while. You have to look in the .iso file itself to find the crack, most downloads have it in a Separate folder than in the .Iso. This doesn't. Lol. ^_^ Also, can anyone tell me where the .ex file is? I couldn't find it. They were all .exe where I looked."
,miss_cunt,2011-04-10T00:56Z,"@itjedog: I had the same issue, since keygens are usually labeled as such. I looked through everything and it's in the Crack folder. The file is rld-tsmk.exe. It said something about not being a valid Windows program at first, but I pretty much remounted the ISO and tried it again. It worked. If you update the game, make sure you use the game loader in the Crack folder."

,-Eris-,2011-04-11T00:21Z,"@XorfaX it might not make sense but, after patching, try and ovewrite it with the previous crack file anyway, because the crack just modifies the loader as far as I can tell, so the game version will still be updated in spite of that."

,DnoobxP,2011-04-12T07:25Z,tnx! now i'll seed it like hell
,ismellfunny67,2011-04-13T00:20Z,"Awesome upload. For those of you asking how to change the file name, it requires using command prompt. It isn't as simple as just clicking and renaming the file. I'll try to lay out the steps.

1. Once in command prompt, you will need to expand the .ex_ file into .exe with the expansion utility.
2. First you'll have to find the directory your crack was downloaded to. It makes it easier if you move the crack folder into the C drive under its own directory (not under program files etc.)
3. After that type expand c:\crack\tsm.ex_ c:\crack\tsm.exe
4. You should now see the fully expanded tsm.exe file in your crack folder =) copy it over and enjoy.

Note that depending on what directory you have it in, your command line might be slightly different."
,huuley,2011-04-13T01:06Z,"all you have to do to get this torrent running is:

1. un rar
2. install
3. exit
4. open the 'crack' folder. and go into folder options (under 'tools') then go to the 'view' tab. un check 'hide file extensions'
5. once you do that you can just rename the one file that is labeled .ex_ to .exe. so it becomes a useable file.
6. copy all three of those files
7. paste here:

C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims Medieval\Game\Bin

this worked for me. it shoudl work with everyone else unless you did a custom install then the root directory would be where ever you put it."
,huuley,2011-04-13T01:09Z,also the file that you change from .ex_ to.exe is the new icon that you should boot from. get rid of the one that automatically goes on the desktop

,aevergreen,2011-04-13T22:31Z,"***FOR ALL MAC USERS*** 

I tried for about 1hr to get this to work and to no avail downloading every different no cd/dvd patch i could find.

A solution- this has worked before on other games that require the game disk, even after i apply the crack.

USE TOAST TITANIUM- MOUNT THE DISK IMAGE ISO

THATS IT!! ENJOY!!

*girl power!*"
,huuley,2011-04-13T22:52Z,"to rename the .ex_ file:

- go into the folder options and under the 'view' tab un-check 'hide known folder extension'

- you must install the game first. you can rename it in the .iso unless you have a .iso editor. install it by mounting it in a program like magicdisk.

- once again you are not changing the file in the origional .iso that you download. once you install the game it creates a directory for sims. in that directory (in your 'program files' folder) go to the 'crack' folder

- in that folder there are three files one of them is this 'TSM.ex_' now you must right click this and either go to the 'properties' menue or select 'rename'. then use your keybord and delete the last character and replace it with an 'e' so it will look like this 'TSM.exe' (remember you cant do this unless you un-check 'hide known file extensions' first! in the 'folder options' menue)

-once your done with that take all the files in the 'crack' folder and copy, then paste here:

C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims Medieval\Game\Bin

then you should be good to go. 

but make sure you load the game from the TSM.exe file ( send it to your desktop) and get rid of the old desktop icon. and if this still doesnt work for you then your better off just buying the game."

Right click on game and show package contents
Find TSM.EX_ with the one in the crack folder
Rename TSM.EXE replace with existing

save it

,Legenderek,2011-05-03T07:29Z,"OK originally had several problems with this program but. I finally have a 100% working game using the latest (as of right now 1.3.13) version. 

What my problems were : 
CD not legit - Contact customer support.
Unable to save/ options menu not opening.
Few crashes throughout game.

What I did to eventually fix all issues and work with the latest update :

1. Download this torrent and install the game - Never mind the crack other than to use the keygen.

2. Open the file SMLauncher and turn off automatic updates (to protect yourself from a crack becoming unstable in the future) but download the update 1.3.13

3. Download the crack located here : http://gametipcenter.com/the-sims-medieval-no-cddvd-crack

4. Use WinZip to extract it to the game/bin folder. And say ""yes to all"" (if there were any problems with this step continue to step 5 otherwise skip to 6)

5. (If you had no problems with the previous step - ignore this step and continue to 6) Make a new folder pretty much anywhere on your pc and extract the files from WinZip to this empty file, then copy and paste them to your game/bin folder, overwrite prompt = Yes to all.

6. Now open the file TSM and enjoy your game!

,Tazadar3,2011-05-08T17:58Z,"To all who have problems with the ""Cannot validate if this is an illegal cd"", and/or cant change name on the file.
Heres is how to fix it. Explorer the dvd/mounted image, open crack folder, make a new folder on your desktop called crack(or whatever). Now copy TSLHost.dll and TSM.ex_ into that folder, NOW rename TSM.ex_ to TSM.exe (the same way you rename other files and folders). The reason some of u cant change the name of it, is coz you have copied the TSM.ex_ file into the games bin dir where a file is allready called TSM.exe, so you wont be allowed to do this here.
This worked for me at least, and btw the place to paste the cracked dll and exe file into is C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims Medieval\Game\Bin (or whereever you have it installed). Hope it helps :)"

,Banzay27,2011-06-02T17:53Z,"Works just fine. 10x men

Though, goodness... the game gets repetitive quickly. And it's never actually impressive. Really for those who like to re-hash and routine - I hate routine.
So it gives you challenges which basically you have to start a new kingdom all over each time to fulfill them. Now, this wouldn't be bad if only your Sims weren't retarded and needed their diapers changed for them. Even with autonomy on high, they'll still only go to sleep when their Sleep bar is really low and the same for eating, upon which they'll always make Gruel, which is the base meal and always available, and a good an annoying debuff losing 5... or 10 focus, I forget. Point is, we ought to be able to preset what meal is it we'd like the AI to opt for. And then beyond those cock ups, high autonomy rather than low really just means they'll engage in random activities, never really doing anything productive, so forget about them doing their daily ""responsabilities"". That's why it's a goddamn pain to play with 2 or more of them in a single quest, the micromanagement is still there, which includes profession related things like mindless gathering of herbs and ores, going to the village which takes about 2 damned hours and so on... I really pass most time with speed 4 than normal speed. Anywho, I'll probably rid myself of this little cracked common gemstone 'soon as I'm done with the first kingdom/challenge.

(Confirmed working for me)

1. Download the crack
2. Open the file including fixed TSM.exe and TSLHost.dll. Open the Medieval package file. You will find the Bin folders (/applications/the sims medieval.app/contents/resources/transgamingc_drive/progam files/elecronic arts/the sims medieval/game)and replace the TSM.exe and TSLHost.dll
3. This is important: Find a folder name: Contents(first layer of the game folder), and then you will see a file named info.plist. 
a. make a backup for that file
b. use textedit open it and find this coding: CedegaGameName
c. Change the last part to read TSM.exe instead of SMLauncher.exe
d. save it

4. Once the file is in your list in Daemon Tools, click the mount button (shaped like a play button)

3. Install the game and use the keygen when asked for a serial
4. Copy over the cracked content
5. Play the game
6. Support the software developers. If you like this game, BUY IT

lol instructions in black and white. That's why it's asking for the disc because you didn't follow these instructions. Btw the UL has renamed ""TSM.exe"" to ""TSM.ex_"" just make sure you have ""Hide known extension file types"" disabled, copy the files over from crack directory on disc to installation folder. Rename TSM.ex_ to TSM.exe and launch the game :). Gl! and ty UL it works perfectly"

So if you installing them in the old folder position it is not installing and causing a crash.

Once extracted,install it in Origin Games.Then when you get to installing the code copy the code then close the Keygenerator. Now when you get to installing that in the window. Just copy/Paste the numbers and letters in the first window. They should all line up. Now hit enter. It should all install. If it doesn't work just give up and go to Steam.com an wait for the Sims 3 to go on sale for 5 dollars an expansion again."

3. Go back to main folder run simsmedievalsetup.exe, paste serial, finish install.
4. Go back to crack folder, copy TSLHost.dll and TSM.ex to desktop (Note: had to click organize, folder and search options, ""view"" tab, uncheck ""hide extentions for known file types"", and apply, to avoid confusion)  Then rename TSM.ex on desktop to TSM.exe.  Then copy and paste both into C:/ProgramFiles(x86)/ElectronicArts/TheSimsMedieval/Game/Bin.  It will ask to copy and replace and say yes to both.

if your loading it from the luncher ( the link that appears after install on desktop) your allowing your sims to connect to there server which will lable it as a pirated version and will be blocked so uninstall and reinstall and lunch it from the main file also make sure you have the newest display drives make sure the file is still mounted

@lux125
make sure you have the file still mounted also i suggest useing magic Disc instead of demon tools

there is 1161 seeds just wait its 5.12GB its big and some ISP try to block such downloads ( torrents are blocked even more ) "

Once downloaded you need to burn it to dvd or get a program like daemon tools or power iso, magic iso, others... etc 
Something that has a Virtual Drive!!!

A (Virtual Drive) is software that can mount and read disc images (Copies) like iso, nrg, bin/cue...etc like the iso included here straight from your Hard Drive without burning to disc first.

Once you install your Virtual Drive Software, you then open it and select mount Image then browse to the folder your game image is and choose the iso, nrg, bin/cue, whatever it may be. It will then load as if it were on a DVD and inserted into the drive. It will also now show up in Computer folder along with C: drive, regular DVD Drive...etc From there you can browse the disc for keygens cracks... Whatever!!!
Hope This Helps!!!"

I have this huge problem with every iso file I download.. 
When I copy all the three files that is in the crack map and try to paste them into the bin map, it tells me that there is no more room in the map (bin). Anyone else who has this problem, and someone who can help me? I'm desperate!

And btw, I played the game without cracking anything, because I could still play as long as I used the DVD for the sims pets. But I think that kind of ruined everything, because all of a sudden the whole game crashed, and gave my computer a blue screen :( pleease help! I can't play the sims at all anymore.. "
