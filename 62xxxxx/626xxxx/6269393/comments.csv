[T],MelloYello,2011-03-25T04:15Z,I think all the 175.03 sizes of this are all missing the final scene. I watched this on TV and the other one I downloaded didn't have the final scene.  If the final scene has Michael in it then it is cut short. The final scene has Dwight and Jim only in it.  It happened after the last commercial.   Can anyone verify?
,HoslerG,2011-03-25T09:32Z,"Yes, definitely missing the final scene"
,NiP010,2011-03-26T22:17Z,in this one the last seen is when they announce their moving.
,kaycoo,2011-03-27T23:42Z,Is there anywhere to get the whole episode and/or last scene?
,5p1n47,2011-03-28T04:21Z,Watch it on project free tv or megavideo or divxden or.......any online streaming site.  If you watched it on TV why do you care so much about seeing it again anyways?

,SammoSammy,2011-04-16T03:48Z,"Well, fuck. Normally VTV is top notch, but now I hear that I might be missing parts of episodes? Fuck me sideways."
,SammoSammy,2011-04-16T04:26Z,"Okay. This is not the latest episode with Will Ferrel. It's the episode before. As for episodes being incomplete, missing a final scene and what not, I have yet to test it. "
,SammoSammy,2011-04-16T04:28Z,Fuck. Can't check them because I'm not in America. Fucking racist NBC. 
,bubble09,2011-04-17T17:37Z,"@boyd889 Actually, episodes 11/12 of this season were merged on the bay, but not on imdb. in other words, episode 11 on imdb is episode 11/12 on the bay. does that help?"
,geubzzz,2011-04-19T23:37Z,"Thanks for the upload, you're the greatest. Could you upload the lastest episode of The office. I think its episode 20. Thanks again."
