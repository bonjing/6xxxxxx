This is a bootleg containing tracks from the two albums Tony Martinez recorded for Blue Jackel Entertainment. Tony was very lucky to have good friends who happened to be outstanding musicians. The band's name, The Cuban Power, may sound like an overstatement but as soon as you check who's in, and most important, what they have accomplished here, you get a different perspective. One of the two records Tony recorded for Blue Jackel was Maferefun, from which most of the tracks are taken. It was selected by AFIM as best latin jazz album of the year.

The band includes piano virtuoso Gonzalo Rubalcaba and drummer Julio Barreto, who usually plays with Rubalcaba's jazz quintet. If that's not enough there are two former Irakere members, trumpet player Julio Padron and conga genius Miguel "Anga" Diaz, who also played for Buena Vista Social Club and AfroCuban All Stars, before recording his excellent album "Echu Mingua".

Tony is a very talented musician. He plays sax, flute, piano and percussion. He composed and arranged all the tracks on this compilation showing his exceptional understanding of Afro-Cuban roots and jazz.
