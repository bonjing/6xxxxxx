Experimental drivers so use at your own risk
might be unstalle and buggy as well
see yourself !

Win7 both version only of course.However might work on vista both version also.
Anyway all catalyst 11.4 early preview drivers from March 7 or 22 or 23 are only supported on Win7 both version.Perhaps on vista also.
Dunno...

enjoy
