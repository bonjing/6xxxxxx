Electro Glide in Blue is a 1997 album by the British band Apollo 440. The album features Charles Bukowski, Billy Mackenzie and a tribute to Gene Krupa; all three of whom had become deceased by the time of the albumâ€˜s release. On the day that Princess Diana died, BBC Radio One suspended its regular schedule out of respect and spent the day playing more understated music; the track Stealth Mass in F#m was played several times on this day. The title of the album is a reference to the movie Electra Glide in Blue.
