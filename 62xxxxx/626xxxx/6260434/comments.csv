,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-04-10T04:22Z,"If I get at least 6 seeders, I will upload the DVD quality of season 3, I'm only asking for at least the number of seeders, as the number of leechers I have currently"
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-04-10T04:32Z,"I am currently leaving my PC seeding all day, until I get more seeders. If I get at least 6 seeders on each of the seasons, I will upload DVD quality of seasons 1-3, I also have DVD quality of 4-5, I will upload those, as soon as I get sufficient seeders for the first 3 DVD quality seasons."
,nada0111,2011-04-19T06:13Z,could someone please seed its stuck on 10% with no seeders
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-04-28T04:23Z,"There are now enough seeders, could people continue to seed? It is helping out a lot, I am working on seasons 4-8, trying to reseed those."
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-05-13T03:18Z,"Seasons 1-5 now have enough seeders, I'm currently working on 6-8 to get those re-seeded. I hope you are all enjoying RVB so far. I will let you know when I have the DVD quality of the seasons up."
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-05-27T07:20Z,"All seasons are fully seeded and season 1 on DVD is currently up, please seed if you can download it, it is fairly new, so it might take a bit to download. But it is completely ripped off the dvd."
