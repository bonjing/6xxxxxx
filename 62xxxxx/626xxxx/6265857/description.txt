Bug Fixes:
-------------------
March 23rd, 2011

Alliance Guides Change Log:
* Fixed a typo in Loch Modan 12-13 guide
* Fixed a typo in Un'Goro Crater 55-58 guide
* Fixed a quest issue in Burning Steppes 50-52 guide with the Burning Vengeance quests (you can only pick up 1 of the 2 quests with the same name, depending on whether or not you completed a quest line in Redridge Mountains at a lower level)
* Fixed many guides that were being suggested when they shouldn't have been (99% of guides should now be correctly suggested - there still seems to be a problem with suggesting guides for low level characters. We are currently looking into that.)

Horde Guides Change Log:
* Fixed a typo in Un'Goro Crater 55-57 guide
* Fixed many guides that were being suggested when they shouldn't have been (99% of guides should now be correctly suggested - there still seems to be a problem with suggesting guides for low level characters. We are currently looking into that.)
