Video:OWN/ ELEKTRI4KA thanks

Audio:IMAGINE/Own

Okay here we go with Battle L.A ts we decided to use our own video has better colors and less cropping issues then russian there is some movement but nothing major thats makes it unwatchable,
it was missing about 2 minutes in beginning so we used our cam for video and about 45 minutes in another 30 seconds you can easily tell when it switches,also for first 20 minutes there is a boot on the bottom right of screen not distracting look at screens,and
toward end for 2 seconds harry potter looking nerd stands up and walks other then that no other people moving around or any other issues.

On to audio majority of audio we used was IMAGINe thanks guys cleaned it up quite a bit had some noise on lud scenes and lacked bass etc,we had about 20 minutes of line so muxed it all to 5.1 AC3 and synced to our video.

Also i heard a lot of people saying that the russian cam was missing ending well it wasn't but just for the hell of it our cam goes till the last ending credit so for the doubters have fun,watching ending credits

As always check out sample before you d/l Enjoy.
