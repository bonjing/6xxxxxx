.rar files are the type of files that the antipiracy organizations use to track you, so when people see a .rar file they can get suspicious. But with .bone. you can't go wrong"

,tman2610,2011-03-26T04:29Z,"@swissjoe - Telecine is from a booth with audio direct and telesync or TS is a general cam video done even from the floor of a theatre dubbed up with direct line audio, such as the FM transmission in theatres for the hearing impaired. So great audio but the video isn't necessarily as good as a Telecine. Telecine is hard to find now a days. This is a great copy and properly labeled a TS."
[V],.BONE.,2011-03-26T06:12Z,ts and cam are the same but ts does have better audio 9/10 cams that are released are the same copys just ran threw different filters and and someone elses name stuck next 2 it but sometimes u can polish a turd hard as u can but its always gonna be a turd :)

,poonjabb,2011-03-27T11:30Z,quality?
,blusniffer,2011-03-27T13:34Z,"not great, almost developed epilepsy. The movie itself is filmed with the camera flitting from actor to actor so when the rips slightly blurred it is murder!!
Cheers anyway!"
