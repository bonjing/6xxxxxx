When Vishal Bhardwaj comes to you with his film, your expectation will always be lofty as when OUR SIRJI uploads a movie in d TPB !

The story is about an umbrella, a little sweet very intelligent girl & d villain Pankaj Kapur.

d direction, photography ,cinematography & camera works did a splendid task.

Human faith,breaking human relationship in a very inhuman manner, their avarice & then change of mind also - these kind of human nature were presented so artistically that makes this film a masterpiece !

I personally have it previously, there is also a very melodious song ""Neeli Chhatri "".very sweet lyric & also d music. 

A must watch for everyone.My heartiest congratulation goes to you SIRJI for this,many many thanks. "
