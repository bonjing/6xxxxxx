,Village_Kid,2011-03-22T16:24Z,"Hello TF,
Had a suggestion, if/when u re-upload an old episode in new torrent could you add aired date to name so its better to not make and mistake and re-download. i generally assume ypu have put the latest and just check the serial nale and select the ep. i have downloaded over 7 ep twice over past 2 weeks"
,Village_Kid,2011-03-22T16:29Z,"eg yesterday ""White.Collar.S02E09"" or just add R-White.Collar.S02E09 or something..
say what? "

,vNa5h,2011-03-23T13:01Z,why dont u include mike and molly ...its a godd show too
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-23T13:27Z,"@dark_defender: ""Endgame"" follows path identical to many Showcase shows - totally unreliable airing type or no capturing at all, by no one! Same thing as with in last few days often requested Lost Girl. Plain SD airing, but HDTV follows day  after! It's stupid, and for two first episodes  of Endgame I encoded first one out - as 352p, but episode 1 once again, next day, as my normal HDTV 480p. I wont do it  again - ALL future episodes would be encoded as  352p, from SD source, as one today. 

I cannot waste my time for no good reason and - make people to wait one day longer to get 20% better quality from 480p. So, who doesn't like 352p, easily can go someplace else. Sorry."
,kzrockz,2011-03-23T18:31Z,Thnkx for HIMYM.
