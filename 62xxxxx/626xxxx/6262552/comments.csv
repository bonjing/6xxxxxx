[V],twentyforty,2011-03-22T16:29Z,"Godzilla, eh... First of all, I warned you about 1 seed left. Second thing is something that you probably not want to hear, but give a try:

Stating in public that something is bad JUST because someone (I guess you have no idea who was that, which are his credentials and did he saw that at all) - makes me mad, because that type of ""statements"" make my life incredibly harder, even if he is already.

Chances that Riddlera's rip is bad . is ridiculous. His rips are incredibly good regarding size.

Problem is in ""Godzilla"" BluRay: it's voted in ""shittiest"" 20 Blu-ray disks a while ago, sitting there firmly since then.

I watched it for a second time last night - and it's absolute truth.

Godzilla is approx. 2h11 long (when I cue-out on ""Puppets"" in Credits and in no way couldn't be smaller than 1 GB.

BTW - I done it last night."
