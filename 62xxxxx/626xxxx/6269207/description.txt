Payback Time With Style

The Sacramento Kings stormed back from a 35 pts. deficit to take the win the last time they played at the United Center and Rose swore it will never happen again.
Have you seen Thibs sitting in the sideline or have you heard about the Turkish Hamma', how about Asik and Destroy? Bulls bench displayed their offensive arsenal. Will the Kings deliver again? Enjoy this entertaining game.
