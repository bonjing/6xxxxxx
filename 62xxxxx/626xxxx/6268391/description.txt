Personnel:
Larry Johnson - guitar, vocals

Notes: The first time I heard the beautiful singing and easy-picking guitar of Larry Johnson I was amazed that the old style of country blues should suddenly turn up, in 1966, on a tiny obscure label - Blue Soul and what's more, bang in the middle of the United States largest city - New York ... for many years considered sterile for blues activity by bout resident and visiting collectors. The songs I heard were "So Sweet" and "Catfish Blues" and the music on that rare single release is now avalable here alongside a dozen have been issued previously!

When I was in New York in the summer of 1969 the first artist I saw on stage was ... of course ... Larry Johnson.
