But I don't understand why you refrained from encoding the same into mp3 or aac format instead. Now I can't transfer them into my ipod and can't transcode them into mp3 or aac either, without noticeable quality loss. Don't know why you go for wma only. Thanks for the effort though."
[T],MARCELODRGZ,2011-03-27T05:23Z,"Because WMA is far superior to MP3. At the same bitrate and the file size, better quality WMA. A track is 160kbps WMA to MP3 at 320kbps like (half the weight for the same result) Take this quiz: listen at full volume an issue in 160kbps WMA, then the same MP3 320kbps quickly and you will notice the difference in the bass mainly . With the first sound fair, the second, saturation. Try to do that and bury the MP3. In addition and as informative data, this and other discs that were originally subi FLAC or WMA lossless. Encode to MP3 would be a crime. Finally, I WMA is better to me because I can hear my CDs in the car or on the phone (they are my backup for daily life) Best wishes and thanks for your comment. I hope you enjoy this album as I do."
,abhi.m,2011-03-29T01:27Z,Ya sure am enjoying it by getting it transcoded to ALAC format for my ipod. And thanks for such a great info. Appreciable work and reply. Best Wishes!

,Padoogi,2011-03-30T17:03Z,"""Because WMA is far superior to MP3""... according to whom?  MP3 will encode at 320 as well at the same sample as WMA.  There's a FLAC out there that's lossless of this album.. torrent ranked down.  Use FLAC or MP3 or don't post at all (they're the only two useful audio formats).  WMA is so 1999 (and complete shit), but I guess some1 here bought the Microsoft hype."
[T],MARCELODRGZ,2011-04-01T18:47Z,"Before talking about formats, you should find something about it (I recommend google) Hint: MP3 is an old format and much lower. It is true that MP3 WMA 320 and 320 are equal in size but the result is very different sampling. Clean your ears of any obstruction and do the following test: put the same issue in both formats at the same bitrate and same volume, then you will notice the distortion at low quickly when you are with the MP3. Want to get this album in another format with or without loss? then later ... To me, WMA lossy format is ideal for sharing music."

I don't agree with a lot of the write-up though..."
