Do we have to remove that first, or at least stop the Diskeeper Service, or just run the installation program on top of the existing one? Another thing -- so many files named setup.exe? I'm assuming you first run the big 64bit setup file and once it's installed, run the small one, right? Please clarify, I'd like to upgrade my Diskeeper to 2011."
