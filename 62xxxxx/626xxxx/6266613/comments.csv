,thearches,2011-06-20T20:47Z,"Good and bad.  Choppy playback using MPC.  Smooth playback with VLC - BUT the aspect ratio is wrong.  Corrected by changing the aspect ratio setting in VLC from default to 2.21:1.  So fine to watch.  But it might be a problem if you want to view it on some other device.  Unless you don't mind everyone looking fat, because that's what it does to them.

Other than that, excellent quality so far."
