"A Message Back"

Thomas (Clifton Collins, Jr.) summons Sophia 
(Laura Innes), Diane Geller (guest star 
Gabrielle Carteris, "Beverly Hills, 90210"), 
and the other Sleepers to reveal the 
contents of the game-changing message he 
received. With newfound intensity, President 
Martinez (Blair Underwood) confronts Vice 
President Ray Jarvis (Bill Smitrovich) about 
his betrayal. Sean (Jason Ritter) blackmails 
Vicky (Taylor Cole) into helping him on a 
mission of vengeance. Elsewhere, Dempsey 
(guest star Hal Holbrook, "Water for 
Elephants") continues on his hunt for 
experimental subjects.

Apologies on house, guess I won't keep old
streams lying around anymore. 

Enjoy :)
