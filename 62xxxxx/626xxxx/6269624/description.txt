A psychologist buys an old mansion at a bargain price and asks a colleague 
and his students to help him fix it up. Things are fine until a cross is 
removed from a stone door in the basement and satan himself starts reaking 
havok on each person one by one. Their only hope of ever leaving alive or 
dead is the ghostly resident that built the house.
