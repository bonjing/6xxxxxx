If I get at least 6 seeders on each of the seasons, I will upload DVD quality of seasons 1-3, I also have DVD quality of 4-5, I will upload those, as soon as I get sufficient seeders for the first 3 DVD quality seasons."

,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-05-13T03:05Z,"It should be fine now, it has 11 at the moment, I hope the number keeps climbing. "
,SteampunkMD,2011-05-22T10:22Z,missing ep 100
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-05-27T07:47Z,"Wait, what? How did I miss one, wow, I guess I did. Sorry about that, when I upload season 5 on DVD, it will be included."
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-06-07T07:03Z,"Lol, the ONE episode that ties everything together"
,Zarconeus238,2011-07-21T01:16Z,Dude I downloaded like all of your uploads dealing with RvB and I have something to tell you about this one; IT DOESN'T HAVE EPISODE 100 ON IT
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-08-31T21:05Z,"I will upload episode 100 by itself if you like. Then all you have to do is download videopad, which is on my page, and add episode 100 to the end of the season 5 video. But like I said I will upload it on the dvd rip when I get that far."
,dardack,2011-10-11T04:58Z,Can you upload episode 100?
