These authors have created a book to really help students visualize mathematics for better comprehension. By creating algebraic visual side-by-sides to solve various problems in the examples, the authors show students the relationship of the algebraic solution with the visual, often graphical, solution. In addition, the authors have added a variety of new tools to help students better use the book for maximum effectiveness to not only pass the course, but truly understand the material.
