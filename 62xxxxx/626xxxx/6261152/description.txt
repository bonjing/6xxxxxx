this is the complete 4 part file listed at snesorama.us. normally you would be expected to download each individual zip piece (four of them total) and compile them into a CDi and burn it in DiscJuggler.

i got tired of waiting ondownloads, so i decided to help others out who are also tired of it. this is a NON PASSWORD PROTECTED, READY TO GO CDi IMAGE. 



you must have DiscJuggler (or other program that can burn CDi images) to burn this to CD-R. you can find a torrent of DiscJuggler, too, just look around out there, it\'s usually always seeded in my experience.

this is a SELF-BOOTING DISC image for immediate use & play on your standard Dreamcast system.




PLEASE: SEED! the gaming world (ESPECIALLY CLASSIC SYSTEMS) needs more seeders, so if you have this or anything related to gaming (XBOX, ROMSETS, ETC.) please seed for others! 


i hope you all enjoy this torrent!


from the thread at snesorama.us:
Yes, i have posted it before. Yes, it\'s the same rom selection. No, it\'s not for 99 minutes CD-Rs. You aren\'t dreaming. This disc will fit on a standard 80 minutes CD-R. I\'ve taken the roms from the other disc, grabbed the builder and built a new disc, with a modified skin (this one is grey, much nicer than the red one, and with a new splash screen). It has most of the in game screenshots, NSFs, box scans, tittle shots, cart scans and more, but i haven\'t included the manuals in the disc (FYI, the manuals are BIG in size, they occupied a little less than the half of the entire disc), making it fit in a standard CD-R. Hell, the whole compilation is 450 MB in size. There\'s still plenty of space in the disc. Note that the disc wasn\'t dummied since this is a emulator and the loading times are inexistent, thus it wasn\'t necessary.
