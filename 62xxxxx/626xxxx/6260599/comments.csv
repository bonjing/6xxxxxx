,HelpForHeroes,2011-03-23T05:54Z,"very very good quality thanks uploader.On the other hand shockingly bad film no where near as funny as the previous ones,i think they deffo should have stopped after the 2nd one!"
,Reviewer,2011-03-23T06:49Z,If you came here thinking you would see a good movie based on the fact that you thought the other movies were good..... well lets just say I don't think highly of your opinion.

,fightthenwofuckers,2011-03-23T19:20Z,THE CUNT THAT WROTE THIS FILM SHOULD HAVE HIS WRITING HAND CRUSHED AND THEN SEWD DEEP UP INTO HIS ARSE. HE SHOULD HANG HIMSELF WITH THE OTHER HAND.
,outofstate,2011-03-24T03:56Z,"I am a true Martin Lawrence fan and I must say he should have stopped after the first movie, but hey make that money if you can. Part 2 was horrible and 3 was just plain fake as hell looking. On the other hand I could have paid 10.00 to find out how corny the franchise has got, but we have the hook-up here. It has its funny moments but nothing to cheer about."

,ZeroOhm,2011-05-06T22:10Z,"A typical movie that gets made , goes straight to DVD and then tossed into the the 2 dollar basket as the video shop.

Even that is a rip off."
