- Thousands Protest in Syria After Gov't Forces Kill Scores of Demonstrators

An estimated crowd of more than 20,000 has turned out for the funerals of victims killed in a Syrian government attack on a mosque housing protesters in the city of Daraa, which in recent days has seen some of Syria's largest demonstrations in decades. Twenty-five people have been confirmed dead, but witnesses say the toll could be far greater. Daraa is under curfew and the Syrian government has reportedly issued announcements telling residents they will be shot if they leave their houses. We speak with prominent human rights attorney Haitham Maleh in Damascus and with his son Iyan Maleh, in Brussels.


- Radioactivity in Food, Water Sparks Fears of Widespread Contamination in Japan

Japan is facing growing fears as radiation leaking from the badly-damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station has contaminated food and water supplies. Bottled water was in short supply across Tokyo after Japanese authorities warned that tap water is too dangerous for consumption by infants. Thousands of people remain without potable water in areas of northern Japan ravaged by the earthquake and tsunami. We speak with Aileen Mioko Smith of Kyoto-based Green Action, one of Japan's leading voices challenging the production, commerce and transport of nuclear material, and calling for sustainable energy policies.


- As Obama Completes First Latin America Tour, Anniversary of Slain Salvadoran Archbishop Romero Evokes Legacy of U.S.-Backed Crimes

President Obama has returned from his first trip to South America since taking office. Obama faced protests in Brazil, Chile and El Salvador as he sought to boost regional trade and improve security ties. In El Salvador, hundreds of demonstrators called for Obama to renegotiate or dismiss the Central American Free Trade Agreement, which has devastated El Salvador's agricultural sector. Obama was also confronted with the legacy of U.S.-backed repression in Chile and El Salvador.

Today marks the 31st anniversary of the slaying of Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero, who was killed by members of a US-backed death squad. We speak with investigative journalist Allan Nairn, who has reported extensively from Latin America since the 1980s.
