  Gray Matter is the first adventure game by renowned author Jane Jensen since 
  the release of Gabriel Knight 3: the story mixes eerie goings-on with 
  supernatural events in best Jensen-style. Neurobiologist Dr. David Styles 
  is one of the game's central characters: since losing his wife in a horrible 
  accident some several years ago, he has become a recluse, seldom leaving 
  Dread Hill House, his English country estate.
