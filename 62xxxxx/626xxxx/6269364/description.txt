    In this third episode of the series, chef and proud        
    Yorkshireman James Martin takes on the challenge of       
    reviving the British apple. Forced off the supermarket   
    shelves by identikit fruit that have been shipped in      
    from as far away as New Zealand and Chile, James is        
    determined to show off the qualities of our native        
    varieties. He discovers that we can all play our part    
    in the revival by checking if that tree at the bottom     
    of the garden is one of several hundred varieties          
    thought to be extinct, and by showing us three            
    delicious recipes that highlight the variation in        
    flavour of this under-appreciated fruit.                  
                                                               
    Leading the charge on behalf of mutton is chef Matt       
    Tebbutt. Knocked for six by cheap imports of lamb,       
    mutton has lost its place as a family staple. But Matt    
    is determined to win back its reputation and discovers     
    that the cause is being taken up from the mountains of    
    Wales to the markets of London. He also demonstrates     
    how tasty and versatile this meat can be by cooking a     
    melt in the mouth stuffed shoulder and a spicy North       
    African inspired tagine.
