The Ohio Players put up one of the wildest fronts of the 1970s' funk bands: towering Afros, raunchy rhythms with guitars cranked as loud as horns, kinky album covers. While never quite as inspiredly free-associative as James Brown at his best, their chanted catch phrases bridged the gap between threateningly tough and playground-ready. Gold collects high points that are still a joy to hear--can it be?--a quarter century after the band's peak. Never as clever as George Clinton with Parliament and Funkadelic they were able to have a mild success. Fire was the hit that brought them to my attention and their most popular tune ever. I remember collecting their albums mostly from the $1 cut out bins at the record stores. If the album turn out not to have any real hits at least I had a picture of a hot chic to enjoy. This collection in my opinion only is missing one song and that is "Honey" from the album with the same name. If anyone reading this has that CD will upload that album (in the .flac format of course) you will be a true friend.
