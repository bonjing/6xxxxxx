,kornchild2002,2011-03-23T23:31Z,I am a little confused.  You said you ripped the album using the Lame mp3 encoder to both WAV and mp3 at 320kbps.  So does that mean that the WAV files were sourced from lossy files?  I am downloading this torrent now and will seed for a while but I want to make sure I am getting true lossless files.  I plan on analyzing the files to see if they are truly lossless.
,Zachariahre3,2011-04-20T20:59Z,this is truley lossless. I riped the cd to wav with exact audio copy and then converted the wav to mp3 with lame. Sorry i didn't make that clear.
,Zachariahre3,2011-04-20T21:02Z,"I also saved the log, and that proves that i ripped the cd to wav."
