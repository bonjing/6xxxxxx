UB40 - Red Red Wine [Bananas tv show 1983].VOB


Very HQ Bananas tv show promo music video from an outstanding and very rare 1980's tv show from Germany, broadcasted from 1981 to 1984, this is practically unknown in America, but this show has very well known artists of the 1980's.

The rarity of this show is that, all the appearances of very well known guests are a whole new promo music video production that easly could be considered as never seen before videos or second versions of several classic 80's videos.

"Red Red Wine" is a song written and originally recorded by Neil Diamond, that was then covered by Tony Tribe, and more famously by British reggae group UB40, whose version topped the U.S. and UK singles charts. In the song, the singer finds drinking red wine is the only way to forget a lost love.

UB40 made their rendition for their cover versions album Labour of Love. According to the band, they were only familiar with Tony Tribe's version, and their version featured a lighter, reggae-style flavor compared to Diamond's somber, acoustic ballad. This version reached number one in the UK chart in August 1983, and number thirty-four in the U.S. in March 1984. This cover version adds a toasted verse by UB40 member Astro, opening: "Red Red Wine, you make me feel so fine/You keep me rocking all of the time".

UB40 are a British reggae band formed in 1978 in Birmingham. The band has placed more than 50 singles in the UK Singles Chart, and has also achieved considerable international success. One of the world's best-selling music artists, UB40 have sold over 70 million records.
 
Their No.1 hit singles include their first number 1 "Food for Thought" and two U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number ones with "Red Red Wine" and "Can't Help Falling in Love", while "I Got You Babe" also topped the UK singles chart.
