For me it was: sys_game_folder=F:\Crysis 2\gamecrysis2

,VinBoy,2011-03-25T00:33Z,"sorry for being an ass about the waiting it won't work
the error has to do with the DirectX initializing or whatever

you must run it in window mode, that will solve your issue
Having problems with that there is one easy fix
put a bigger monitor behind your main monitor

a 9.45 gbs. file. Easily found on Demonoid or Pirate Bay"

,xiIix,2011-03-25T04:16Z,"Also there is no reason not to buy the game. This is not a typical console port, at all. The PC version features higher resolution textures and DX11 support. It's way fucking better than the console version, and I think that deserves some recognition, because from a financial standpoint they didn't even NEED to release it for PC, let alone give us exclusive features."
,zazally,2011-03-25T04:31Z,Mbb15 if you quit I might quite life :( please don't I mean it we need you in our lives since you give this lonely man some sort of enjoyment in life anyway thank you so much for your work and good luck to whatever you guys get up to in the future you will always be welcome here your work is just incredible very much appreciated take care again

,kaz050,2011-03-25T05:30Z,"@xiIix hate too be the kill joy here, but did u get hit by a stupid stick crysis was made for the pc,so they make crysis 2 and they thought why not even make more money because not alot of people have high end gaming rigs so lets make it for console aswell."
,Blackluc,2011-03-25T05:41Z,"Found the problem...  So to prevent you guys from having the trouble I had,

*THE GAME WON'T RUN IF YOU HAVE A USB HEADSET*

One thing that I really hated about Crysis 2 was that usb headsets didn't work.  Since the patch ""fixed"" it I downloaded it but it's just worse, the game won't run at all.  I saw in a log or something that the game will now see your headset with the patch, but it just fails seeing more than one sound card"
,beetlespin,2011-03-25T06:38Z,"im just wondering, but i have followed the direction as listed. i have 1 problem. after i choose the difficulty, the game begins to load only to get this error: cryengine error ""[PlayerProfiles] CGameContext::StartGame: No users logged in."" without the quotes. when i play the game or attempt, im not connected to the internet. what does this error mean??

,keaze,2011-03-25T06:53Z,someone answer this.  How do you get the option for EXTREME graphics?  Is there a patch?  Why is the option not on this version? 
,darron66,2011-03-25T06:55Z,"I used the crack from another site but thanks anyway. To those of you asking does this crack work if you have updated your install to v1.1, yes, seems to be ok so far, I have played to the first checkpoint no problems at all. The pc version graphically is superior to the console version, I'm playing on hardcore setting with Nvidia 3D Vision which by the way is brill, gonna buy this, Crytek deserve it !"
,Euphobia,2011-03-25T07:00Z,"Can't get it to work for me. I leave the crack out and launch the game, but I just get to the activation. No update. Put the crack in and try launching the game and nothing happens. The launcher starts in task manager, but then closes. Same happens with just Crysis2.exe, starts then closes in task manager. No windows pop up or anything."
,baem2,2011-03-25T07:10Z,Could it be that this crack does not work with the uploaded limited Edition?!

,qhdsagjuj,2011-04-01T15:21Z,"I found out this game forces you into updates so delete all of the contents of C:/Program Files (x86)/Electronic Arts/Crytek/Crysis 2/bin32/EAcore. After you do this there no longer will be any more forced update. When you start the game it takes a bit longer, but it still loads! Just leave the EAcore folder there empty! "
,grimfandango83,2011-04-02T14:07Z,After installing the game there seemed a choice to install EA Download Manager..Is it good to install this also or not? 
,damnken,2011-04-03T10:48Z,"Hey Guys, I try to install the actual game (not this crack) but it just comes up with a window saying the file type isn't compatible with my operating system. I'm using Win 7, 64-bit, with more than enough speed and specs. What can I do to make it work?

Thanks in advance."
,pclove,2011-04-04T03:01Z,"Dear fellow Pirates,

DO NOT STEAL THIS GAME. I'm a die-hard pirate myself but this title is just too... wrong. Crytek is extremely dedicated to PC gaming, they're one of the few big companies that make games exclusively for PC gamers. This title was on other platforms but everyone knows who it's meant for. DON'T MESS THIS UP! crysis 2 has been devastated, cracked before its release AND multiplayer cracked too? if this doesn't end now it may be the end of PC gaming as a whole. BUY THIS GAME!"

,Info-wars,2011-04-06T20:13Z,"The game doesnt even start for me: It installs the patch but does not run the game. And every time i run the game it downloads the patch first, then it searches through the files and once it's done searching it says ""You already have the most recent version (1.2) of Crysis 2 installed on your system"" And then that is it. nothing happens after that. 

So does anyone know what i need to do?"

,Esmad3,2011-04-17T18:50Z,These are not the cracks you are looking for... For multi-player and 1.2 support (dl and aply 1.2 or you'll find only 10-30 servers) this is it http://www.kickasstorrents.com/crysis-2-crack-1-2-t5390311.html
,Esmad3,2011-04-17T19:15Z,"@ pclove: Lol at u. Crysis 2 is a console port through and through. Oh Dx 11 is coming? It should have been there from day one along with proper 64 bit support. Any pc owner with more than 4gb ram would be hard pressed to see Cryteks love. Crysis 1 set a standard for pc games at the time of it's release, Crysis 2 is not even an attempt at that"
,Esmad3,2011-04-17T19:29Z,"and btw, I have always found it to be a funny notion that consoles will one day kill pc-games, since you don't even need cracks or serial keys for pirated console games. Once chipped or mod'ed you just copy and play, and multi-player always works."
