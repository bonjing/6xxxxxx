,bert16,2011-03-23T02:52Z,What exactly does this thing do?
,k0nsl,2011-03-23T03:30Z,In simple terms: it upgrades your Windows XP to Windows 7...
,Regimus,2011-03-23T15:40Z,It would be nicer if the whole Windows 7 would look like XP & not vice versa.
,bert16,2011-03-24T04:05Z,"It would actually save you the trouble or reformatting? What about drivers and incompatible apps and so many other issues. And of course it works with Win 7-32 only, right?"
,k0nsl,2011-03-24T18:07Z,"I have no issues to speak about and I am all over the place...
Actually I've never had a problem with Win 7 except perhaps in the beginning but that was because it was so new.
(Yes, I know the base is Vista--so spare me the thoughts on that).
In any case, enjoy pretty good torrent =)"
