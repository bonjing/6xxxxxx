[V],polisdavid,2011-03-22T06:04Z,THANK YOU SEEDERS!!  :~)
,niarlttep,2011-03-22T11:26Z,"Thanks, it's seems great!
I got a problem, the archive gives :
TotalFinder.app and TotalFinder.mpkg 
My questions :
1/ 	What do you mean exactly by ""1) Install the total finder application""? 
Launch TotalFinder.mpkg or move TotalFinder.app to the folder Applications?
2/ 	What do you mean exactly by ""2) Replace the Total Finder.app with the total finder with the one in the archive""?
do you mean ""replace System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app with TotalFinder.app"" ?
I'm lost !"
,niarlttep,2011-03-22T18:59Z,"That's wonderfull !
Thanks very very much.
You know, I donâ€™t only want to do, but I want to do properly and UNDERSTAND what I do!
Without your answer I â€˜ll try what you answer told me, BUT Iâ€™ll have a dout.
For 3) Iâ€™ll do the following :
	first Force Quit the Finder.app by choosing Finder in the â€˜Force Quit Applicationsâ€™ (by pressing Command-Option-Escape) it automaticaly relaunch the Finder.
	second launch the TotalFinder.app
Well if not necessery it wonâ€™t harm !
BUT Iâ€™ll be happy to know which is necessery !
Many thanks for your time :o)"
