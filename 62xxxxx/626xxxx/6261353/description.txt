Tabbed Browsing

Add tabs on top of Finder. The same tabs as seen in Google Chrome.

Show System Files

Show me all files on the disk. Not afraid to see the invisible files.

Visor

Convenient system-wide Finder always one key-press away.

Folders on Top

Don\'t make me think. Folders should always go first in list view.

Cut & Paste

Use keyboard shortcuts to move files around. Faster than drag & drop.

System Requirements:

Mac OS X.6
