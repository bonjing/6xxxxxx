Well, the Aaron Lewis - Live & Acoustic is not 320, but everything else is. I'm pretty sure thats also a bootleg, as the recordings are poor quality anyway.

Otherthan that, as always, 500x500 art, 100 complete/accurate ID3's

Six studio albums
1. Tormented
2. Dysfunction
3. Break The Cycle
4. 14 Shades of Grey
5. V (Limited Edition)*
6. Illusion of Progress

Three compilation/live albums
7. The Singles 1996-2006
8. MTV Unplugged
9. iTunes Originals

Four singles
10 Fade
11 For You
12 So Far Away
14 Zoe Jane (Promo Only)

My bonus inclusion of Aaron Lewis solo stuff
15 Live & Acoustic

Enjoy, please help seed, this is a good clean collection, as are all of mine.
