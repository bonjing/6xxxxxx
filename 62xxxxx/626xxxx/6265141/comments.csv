Also this torrent is bigger in size due to higher video quality encoding. 

So Njoy!"

,jtrory,2011-05-23T06:52Z,"Hey what the hell do I do with this? All I have in the ZIP folder is a .dll file and a .tptb file which is I guess is some clever reference to the uploader! Neither of them can be extracted from the ZIP, I get an error. Even if I could extract them, what do I do with two useless files? Am I missing something? It says in the instructions ""run setup.bat"". What setup.bat?"
