This is the song that first came back in the hospital over a year ago when I had heard that my nephew was being hurt again.
It is a time for us.
I have always known how to play the first part of the melody here. I have never known how to chord, other than having read volumes of music theory at one time and knowing that you take the root and build the First Third and Fifth of it. But it came back in the hospital when a young woman asked her to play for here in the library to help her sleep. It came back and she is a blessing to me, and anyone that has the pleasure to know here.
And I have since started fighting again with my guitar, but I have to build up the strength again my left hand mostly. Thx again.
