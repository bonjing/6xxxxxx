Take a year out of the life of Armin van Buuren and you'll come to find he's been living more than one at once. Aside of his personal life, the number one DJ spends his time globetrotting, producing and hosting, all in the name of music. 2010 was made up with nothing but highlights, including the release of his 'Mirage' album as the summit of all of his hard work. Along with its release, a new Armin Only world-tour was kicked off, as well as the preparations for the celebration of the 500th episode and 10th birthday of his beloved A State of Trance radio show.

One of the few constant factors in his roaring life as a superstar DJ and producer, is the weekly 2 hour radio show in which Armin reaches out to the average of 15 million listeners. No matter how many awards, accolades or prestigious gigs the Dutchman got, it never made him lose his love for radio. Ranked number one in the critically acclaimed DJ Mag Top 100 for the fourth year running, as the first DJ ever, Armin van Buuren keeps his fans up to date on the latest in trance and progressive with a relentless passion and energy. Always ahead with exclusives and fresh, unreleased tracks, Armin also presents an A State of Trance compilation, representing a new year in trance on a special 2 disc mix. A yearly highlight to millions of dance lovers, the ASOT compilation series has been going strong since 2004, nominated for and winning many awards ever since.
