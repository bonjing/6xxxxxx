,joemack0,2011-03-25T13:22Z,"works great on pspGo 6.35 pro B3.

Thank You NitrogenUA"
,NitrogenUA,2011-03-25T13:42Z,"dr1zzt77, lol, why even bother to post without testing yourself? Shame.

Ghanijazz, it is meant to be this way. Saves are region-locked.

Speaking of patched version, it seems like i failed because of my faked memory stick. Today i decrypted EBOOT and it was enough for game to work on my 5.50 GEN-D3. Please, someone test it on your consoles and report back. If this method works, i'll post a patched version for guys with older firmwares. Peace.

P.S.: I was really bothered by the standard ""Shooter type"" controls, especially after playing japanese version. Switched to ""Action type 2"" for the sake of own sanity :)"
