,drive-786,2011-03-23T01:42Z,"fuck it i am getting this for the hell of it since mirrirmaster1982 say its all good , "
,mufuti9,2011-03-23T04:07Z,"audio is FUCKED (keep reading, not a codec issue)

only right channel working.
sure you can work around it but makes the already poor audio quality even worse. "
,mufuti9,2011-03-23T04:14Z,"AUDIO is broken.

left channel is completely missing, only right channel is working.

yes, you can work around it  but this makes the audio obviously even worse than it is to begin with...

too bad really, was looking forward to this one

[V],mirrormaster82,2011-03-23T19:40Z,"Fucking shit...just checked today,mufuti9 is right.Audio is fucked up...but  great and almighty TvTeam couldn't mention it...in all their other releases they are talking shit like ''we bring you best releases...blablabla...we are the greatest...'' and here they couldn't give us simple info that the audio is fucked up.Fuck you TvTeam,I really wanted to see this..."
,SamHefron,2011-03-23T22:40Z,"Wow, you're an absolute dickhead mirrirmaster1982. Grow up."
,mufuti9,2011-03-23T23:33Z,"not TvTeams fault, when uploading as much as these guys something like that can happen.
have not tested it myself yet but here is a new release and since it is aaF I am optimistic it will be awesome (for a 700mb dvdrip...)

[V],mirrormaster82,2011-03-24T18:40Z,"I'm not a dickhead ,I just wanted to see this movie so badly and to find out this about the audio really made me angry.I thank TvTeam for the better version which I'm now downloading,but they won't get apology from me for this release 'cause even when you upload tons of stuff the least you can do is give a minimal info about the release... "
,Phatfish,2011-03-25T02:35Z,"A/V - Video would have been ok for a screened but feels a bit on the low end for a straight dvdrip. Watchable though.
Audio is only mono but apart from that its ok.

M - This should really have been a much better movie, but so much was poorly executed that its merely mediocre. Too bad, could/should have been great.



@mirrormaster82:

You got sum issues mate..."
