,EndGenius,2011-03-23T19:06Z,"51618 FONTS give or take a few, this current collection ive built from a a load of free font sites and a few small torrents. 

btw it unpacks to 3.5 gigs worth."
,EndGenius,2011-03-25T08:50Z,"WARNING!!
Windows users

If you install all of these Fonts to your ""C:Windows\fonts"" you will destroy your computers boot up time because Windows reads the fonts folder in boot up, so watch out! and extract them somewhere else like ""C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\Fonts"" or something.

I made that mistake.
X6 4ghz CPU and 8GB DDR3 2000mhz (OC) =  21min boot time.

yeah so enjoy :)"
,Foxxel,2011-03-26T15:35Z,"@EndGenius Not really, my boot time is like 2min at least. I think what matters is your RAM mostly. But it shouldn't take that long to read 3-4GB of Fonts. I can see if your using an older setup, but loading like 10-12GB would take like 20min for your computer to boot up.

(Windows Vista Ultimate 64bit,16GB RAM, AMD Phenom II x6)"
,EndGenius,2011-03-28T03:19Z,"@Foxxel, did you install all those fonts and reboot to see how long it takes you? 
not that it really matters, the warning was because if it happend to me its bound to happen to someone else, especially someone with a lesser spec system , mealy a giving anyone who dose it a heads up.

(not everyone has 16GB of ram to play with :P )"
