"Black Hand and the Shotgun Man"

The detective duo of Jarek Wysocki and Caleb 
Evers investigates an international drug dealer 
whose family is in jeopardy. FBI Division Chief 
Cuyler (guest star Arkin) intervenes, 
complicating the high-profile case. While 
visiting grieving families with Alderman 
Gibbons, undercover cop Liam Hennessey becomes 
increasingly vulnerable when he feels the pain 
of victims. The family drama follows Jarek home 
when he visits his ex-wife, and wedding bells 
continue to ring for his fiance.

Enjoy :)
