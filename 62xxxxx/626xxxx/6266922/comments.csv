[V],mkvGOD,2011-04-10T14:55Z,"When first shown on network television, many episodes were aired out of order, much to Judd Apatow's dismay. When it was originally released on DVD, the episodes were presented in their production order, which was a mistake according to Apatow.[3] However, newer versions of the DVD present the episodes in the correct chronological order, restoring all storylines and character developments.
