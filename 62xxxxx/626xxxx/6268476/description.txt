about:
this show was requested..
and realy has been in need
for lossless copy to come upon
the internet...i have never seen
a lossless copy floating on the web
not on zero web site nor forum !
alot time when intoo getting this.
so too any hypocratic forum or site's or bad minded ppl
out there,do not add this show on on your domain !
nor any ppl share this on any p2p network like DC++ , etc ,etc.
keep it lossless ! too much lossy shit out there !
keep a seed ! keep the archive as you get from me 
intact & do not change nothing within file structure.
that is all i ask of you !
