     The sixth and penultimate edition in Sub Rosa's ongoing assembly
     of crucial noise and electronic music looks at the period
     1957-2010. So far the series has been duly noted for its
     excavation and reappraisal of lesser known works by important
     artists and vol. 6 is no different, presenting 26 exclusive and
     original compositions including the work of Tzvi Avni, Joseph
     Nechvatal, and Kohei Gomi/Pain Jerk among better known titans of
     the avant garde such as Stephen O'Malley, Dick Raaymakers, John
     Weise and Z'ev. We enter disc one to the thrilling electroacoustic
     composition 'Mi Vida' by Prix Ars Electronica award winner, Israel
     Martinez, exploring the visceral narrative of a car ride which
     ends in a crash. Ata Ebtekar presents an original commission in
     'Turquoise Gas in Ice', a complex piece of electroacoustic
     composition playing Persian classical scales on acoustic
     instruments which are then run through a modular synthesizer to
     create dazzling abstract harmonics. From La Monte Young's former
     archivist Joseph Nechvatal, 'Ego Masher' is another revelation,
     offering a vivid Cageian collage which undoubtedly reminds us of
     James Ferraro's recent exploits, while on 'Trautonium Jetztzeit
     #4' Oliver Strummer + Liesl Ujvary use the same machine that
     created the sound of birds in Alfred Hitchcock's classic to shape
     an acrid noisescape and the work of the hugely influential Henry
     Cowell is represented in 'The Banshee', a 2'30 summoning of
     dynamic electronic ghosts. The second disc starts with the drum
     practices of Z'ev and follows through Daniel Menche's drones and a
     intense noise attack from John Weise. The Pain Barrier's 'Virus'
     offers a blackened chunk of speedcore gabber, thematically linked
     with Julie Rousse's 'Flesh Barbie Techno Fuck' glitchcore, and
     followed with Bird Palace & Cristian Vogel's micro-to-meta
     expansion of sound fragments in 'PHing'. One of the oldest
     recordings is Else Marie Pade's 'Syv Cirkler' from 1958,
     distinctly reminding of Daphne Oram's ethereal experiments and
     finding similarities in the high frequencies tones of Stephen
     O'Malley's 'Dolmens & Lighthouses' but also sharp contrasts in his
     use of ultra low subbass registers. This historically ripe
     collection of sound warrants your attention without delay.
