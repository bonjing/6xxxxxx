Title: Engage EP


Bristol tough guys, Radical Project continue to dish out a heavy onslaught of sonic sickness blending upfront beats and growling bass lines alongside their own unique barrage of twisted synths and keys.

The Engage EP delivers an explosive slice of Drum & Bass and Dubstep action with enough weight to cause serious dance floor destruction.
