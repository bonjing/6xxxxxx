Dragon Age 2 savegame editor cheat trainer Torrent includes:

1: gff4editor-0.5.3.rar:     gff4editor 0.5.3 that I found online - all credit for the work goes to him:

5: this text file (readme.txt)


All support for this should be handled at that location...




daosavegame.exe is the program that will allow you to edit your savegame in a very easy to use interface.

editor.exe - I havent used it, not sure what it does.

erfextract.exe - not sure what it does  - maybe it has to do with importing old game data to the new game?

Observe my screenshot - it shows the location of the savegame file (in my case it is   C:\Documents and Settings\conrad\Documents\BioWare\Dragon Age 2\Characters\Marian\Saves\Slot_116    )

If you look at the program 'Dragon Age: Origins Savegame Editor' you will see that I have a Dragon Age 2 save game loaded - and all you do is click the box and modify the number... easy as can be!



So to make this work - 
1: download torrent 
2: unzip (use win Rar or some other program)
3: pick a location to store it (no installation needed)
4: Run the 'daosavegame.exe'
5: Open the savegame file you want 
6: modify the settings that you want
7: save your modified savegame file
8: load it in the Dragon Age 2 game  (no need to turn game off to mess around)

Anyone who finds a valid cheat / trainer please post a comment!

CheatHappens has one available for those who wish to pay the $50.00 yearly membership fee... No one has leaked it yet
(the savegame editor can do many things - such as make you near invincable -  but the trainer can make you truly invincable)

After reaching level 20 - and earning nearly 200 gold honestly - I used this savegame editor to max out all my stats on all characters... worked great!
