runscript pc_immortal
And voila, you cannot die...Here is the full list of commands you can use :

What's the challange? gotta be so boring with cheats. 
Just saying..."
,blombardo,2011-03-26T03:37Z,I played fair one time through - now I just want to see the different cut scene/story plot options so I want to blow through all the combat stuff; just saying Anders turned out to be a 'you know what' so I'm going back and getting Merrill to move in... makes for a much more amusing experience!   So anyone who doesn't care to deal with combat - or would rather 2 shot any enemy - or if you just need an extra 5 gold to buy some goofy weapon - HERE YA GO!
,blombardo,2011-03-26T05:26Z,Attributes can be modified directly - but for the Ailities - If it is not obvious- the way to get all your abilities would be to purchase one of the Elixers that give you a new skill - then save... edit your inventory to give yourself 60 or so... then you can drink yourself a lot of new abilities!

,syrus1987,2011-04-28T02:11Z,that link you posted did not help i tried both ways and both did not work. my keyboard even stopped working in game when i tried the second one.
,kadesh179,2011-08-20T04:44Z,"If you look at the program 'Dragon Age: Origins ""Savegame Editor' you will see that I have a Dragon Age 2 save game loaded - and all you do is click the box and modify the number... easy as can be!""

I feel like a dumbass, i dont get this. How the heck do you change this so it works for DA 2? thanks!"
