Get the TV Rips where the file size is ~1.1GB, because the whole point of HD is better quality which you're simply not going to get from super-compressed material like this."

The video is encoded at only 384 Kbps, while the audio is at 640 Kbps. The audio makes up 2/3 of the total filesize.

mkvGOD, rethink your name, you're clueless."
