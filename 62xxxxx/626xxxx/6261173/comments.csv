The first 3 eps are poor quality - possibly what you have here (downloading it now... can't wait!).  The other 2 are from my own VHS off air copies, and are pretty good quality though not 100% intact.

Can't agree more that this should be released on DVD... SO annoyed when all I can find is $$$ bootleg copies that are probably the same quality as we're all now so eagerly downloading.

THANKYOU"

Just looking at the first few eps that have downloaded.  They are about as good (bad) quality as the 5 I put up on TorrentPortal.

Having recently been working on video restoration, I can see immediately that there's been some colour shift.  This can be corrected fairly easily in Final Cut Pro with an add-on filter, and it's surprising how good the results can be.  It's very time consuming however, having to convert the file to DV, adjust the colour, then export, and reconvert to AVI (seems DV is too big for downloading).

I love this show that much though... :) It just may take a while..."
