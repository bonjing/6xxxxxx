***NOTE*** - This excellent TV show (1993-1996) has never been released on VHS or DVD. This torrent is what remains of an older torrent that some OP ripped rather poorly from old VHS copies taped from television in in 1990s. They are of very poor visual quality, and are missing most of season one. However, I decided to up it in hopes of keeping it alive and that SOMEONE out there might be able to supply the missing episodes. These are S1 ep5 â€“ S1 ep21, and S1 ep24

The John Larroquette Show is a situation comedy that ran on the NBC network from 1993 to 1996. The show, created by Don Reo, was a vehicle for John Larroquette following his run as Dan Fielding on Night Court. The series took place in a seedy bus terminal in St. Louis, Missouri and focused on the people who worked the night shift.

Plot

The show revolved around John Hemingway, a recovering alcoholic newly appointed to the role of night shift manager of the St. Louis bus depot.

Much of the show revolved around John's attempts to stay sober. John constantly struggled to keep control of the station, with regular conflicts with his secretary, Mahalia, the janitor, Heavy Gene, and most strongly with sandwich bar attendant, Dexter, who had been turned down for the position that John was appointed. Sexual tension happened with prostitute Carly.

One regular guest star was David Crosby, who played Chester, John's sponsor for AA meetings. Another episode guest starred Bobcat Goldthwait, who played an assistant to John who was constantly a mess but became suddenly efficient and 'normal,' as soon as he got drunk. Richard S. "Kinky" Friedman appeared as himself in a jail cell.

Pressures from above

In the second season, due to network pressure, the creators removed much of the dark humor and much of the bus depot setting for a more 'toned-down' look.[citation needed] The sets were brighter. The cast got transferred from the night shift to days. John's dingy boarding-house room was traded for a nice apartment. Oscar, the old bum who lived in one of the bus station phone booths cleaned up and became a shoeshine boy, and the prostitute character Carly (Gigi Rice) went "straight" and bought the bar at the bus station. The producers also decided to give John a 
romantic interest (Catherine Merrick, played by Alison LaPlaca).

Cancellation

The John Larroquette Show was canceled abruptly only one month into its fourth season. John and Carly got married in the third season finale while Catherine was seemingly pregnant with John's child. It was revealed that Catherine was experiencing a phantom pregnancy and left the show. The show's last episode aired on October 30, 1996 showing John and Officer Eggers on a date at a Halloween party. Six episodes remained unaired until being shown on the USA Network years later.
