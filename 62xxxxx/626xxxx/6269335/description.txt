Space Colony is best described as a people sim meets a city builder. You manage and nurture a group of dysfunctional space dwellers colonizing the most unearthly corners of the galaxy. These unique colonists can fight, argue, become depressed, go crazy, and fall in love. But even if half the staff is brawling, the Harvester Robot is chain-sawing its way through the oxygen supply, and small furry aliens have taken over the disco, remember--this is your home.
