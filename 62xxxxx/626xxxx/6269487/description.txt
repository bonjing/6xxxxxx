This is the CRJ-200 Sound Pack for FSX. I have installed it, taken out the sound folder and uploaded as a RAR. This is the new updated crj soundset since   08 Feb 2010 from TSS.

I went to the trouble of paying for this soundset for the crj and uploaded it to here now I would like to request the following :

TSS - Airbus 380 Sound Pack X - for FSX  (available at fspilotshop.com )

Thanks and please seed
