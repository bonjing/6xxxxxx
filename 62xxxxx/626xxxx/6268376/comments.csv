Thanks for your effort, but voice is not in sync.  Also, there are some advertisement sounds from 00:19:22 to 00:19:58.  Probably this Hindi audio was from some TV-rip.

I use 'eac3to' for frame rate correction (i.e. 25fps or 23.976fps) and Audition for further synching and editing purposes and get very good results."
,amit6666,2011-03-29T08:48Z,"@oedipust
agree with u this is TVrip Audio
but the movie full in sync..."
,dinosaur58,2011-06-21T09:27Z,"The English Audio track is perfect. The best I could tell [don't speak Hindi] the Hindi track also plays back perfectly synced in MPC, and no problems in the 19 min time frame. Don't know why Oedipust had issues."
