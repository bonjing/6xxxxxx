                Medical drama series. With his family home up for
                sale and his teenage son Nick refusing to take his
                calls, Monroe throws himself into his job, tackling
                life at the hospital with his usual energy and
                humour. When an ex-soldier is admitted with a blood
                clot in his brain, Monroe takes the controversial
                decision to avoid surgery. As he comes under
                increasing pressure to operate, will his 'wait and
                see' approach be the right one? Meanwhile, will
                Bremner break her own rule and let emotion get in the
                way of her clinical instincts?
