If anyone like me isn't on expert level yet, this is still worth it. Just use the no fail cheat (very simple cheat code entry, just strum random notes until it unlocks everything) for the harder songs. 

Difficulty overall ranges from very easy expert charts to absurdly hard with chord notes I've never seen before. And it actually saves your scores. Great stuff, thanks again."
