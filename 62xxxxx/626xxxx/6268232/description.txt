*NOTE*

Green Day recorded every show on the 21st Century Breakdown global tour. 
When it concluded, the band members, singer-guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, bassist Mike Dirnt, and drummer Tre Cool, sifted through the recordings to deliver the best performances from their shows around the world, which resulted in the epic CD/DVD package 'Awesome As F**k'. The footage on the bonus DVD was shot at the band's show in Tokyo, Japan.
