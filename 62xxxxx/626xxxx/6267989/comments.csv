A word of warning for others though, the game's settings were set to ultra and high for default (at least for me they were). Just check them because if your like me and running a mobility Radeon 4250 your gpu is gonna come back with a sad face lol."

Downloaded quickly, installed smoothly, had fun playthroughing first time already - Imperial Guard.

Ironically, the Inquisitor is the worst hero unit of them all. And I was even into the Van Helsing-style holy witch-huntress vibe.

While I'm at it, hint: Castor's your mobile powerhouse, Commissar's your tank and Merrick's pretty good fire support with the plasma rifle and frags, flamer sometimes - but you'll want him behind a good heavy bolter or autocannon. Got one of each nearer the end, that's when he really started to rack up the kills! "
,sksd,2011-07-08T17:14Z,"i mounted the image, install to destinate folder, copy the crack to installed folder, but got this relic crash. anyone have solution for this?"
,bitcop,2011-07-21T09:22Z,"Hey TbagX  if you do not have anything positive to say just shut your fuck-hole up. Just because somebody ran it a few problem doesnâ€™t make you superior over them. No hard feelings though you said you mind and I just did as well.


OK to those who have ran into a few probs with this release try this.

1.	I think there is a problem with this release running on Vista so try W7. I think it will install fine and probably take you to neca0000â€™s problem.
2.	If it does then you will need to install the latest version of directX which in this release seems not to install when it prompts you on the â€˜finishâ€™ stage of the installation. You can get directX in the assets of you other games I got mine from Chaos Rising installation folders I canâ€™t remember exactly but you would have to look for it there or just download it. The file name could be DXsetup.exe
3.	Having done that copied the crack and all and launching the game it will play the cinematics and take you to the bridge/menu. Wait a minute donâ€™t hurry off in to the game itâ€™s not done yet. Proceeding with trying to load the first mission might bring that crash report that we are running away from. So do step 4
4.	Access you graphics settings I think via the options and lower them to the lower level than the one currently selected. This depends on your graphics card so canâ€™t tell you exactly what to put there. If the one displayed is ultra then put high if the one displayed is high then put medium I think you get the picture.
5.	Say thank you. If it gives you a problem with the crash report still when you try to play keep playing around the graphics settings until you find the level that you graphics card can handle with this game.


My thanks goes to SKIDROW nuff respect and letâ€™s buy this game if we enjoyed we all love our friends at relic."

,Casey84,2011-12-09T20:42Z,"I'm getting the crash error, too.

I downloaded the torrent, mounted the image, installed the game, copied the contents of SKIDROW to install directory (overwrite files),

Launch the game...and crash error.

I uninstalled and repeated, step by step as listed here in the Torrent.  Anything I'm missing?

Also updated DirectX and installed the microsoft framework update, etc"

,MACHlNE,2012-03-09T01:15Z,"Torrent does work. I have played campaign and LAN skirmish.

How to make dawn of war work-
1. download torrent.
2. Get an ISO program and mount the sr-d2ret file. 
3. Go to my computer right click on the Mounted Cd and install.
4. When installation is done just click finish. 
5. Get the Skidrow folder and copy all the contents, paste these into the folder where Dawn of war was saved to [e.g... D) games, Dawn of war.] Override existing files. 
6. make sure graphics card and direct x is updated along with the computer having 1.5gb virtual memory and game should work.

Although if you know anyone who has this game pirated, you can always play with Hamachi."

A lot of you need to grow up, I've been pirating for almost 5 years, and even I couldn't get this working, so either my download missed something, or a lot of you saying "" THIS WORKS, YOU'RE JUST A DUMB-ASS "" are false posters, so lighten people.
