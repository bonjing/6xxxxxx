- Debating Intervention: Is U.S.-Led Military Action the Best Solution to Libya Crisis?

Forces loyal to Libyan leader Col. Muammar Gaddafi continue to advance on rebel-held towns amidst ongoing U.S.-led air strikes. Gaddafi's deadly crackdown on the Libyan uprising has sparked debate on longstanding questions around international intervention. We host a debate between Libyan poet, scholar and University of Michigan professor Khaled Mattawa, who supports U.S.-led intervention, and UCLA law professor Asla Bali, who says the U.S.-led coalition has ignored viable alternatives to military attacks.


- Fate of Libyan-American Student and Rebel Fighter Muhannad Bensadik Unknown After Shooting in Libya

Muhannad Bensadik is a 21-year-old Libyan-American medical student who has joined the armed struggle against Col. Muammar Gaddafi's forces. He was reportedly shot during fighting near Brega earlier this month, but it's unclear if he is dead or missing. We air an interview conducted by Democracy Now!'s Anjali Kamat with Bensadik just two days before he disappeared. We're also joined by Bensadik's mother, Suzi Elarabi. She recently learned that her son may not have died in the shooting as previously believed.
