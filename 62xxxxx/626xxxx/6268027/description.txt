Notes:

 - Already posted here ( http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3599863/Female_Trouble--NJT_Release_Re_Upload--Full_DvD.rar ) but it's uncompressed at >4GB, so here's a much smaller but still quality alternative

 - Please note that this film isn't like my other mostly G-rated offerings. :^) Rated NC-17 for nudity and sexuality.
 
 - To use the subtitles, simply extract the .SUB file from the .RAR archive into the same folder. A free app. that will extract .RAR archives is 7-Zip from http://www.7-zip.org/
 
 - I seed using "Initial Seeding" which means that the torrent may show zero seeds; disregard this as I will seed for several days until there are other seeds.

 - Please make sure to seed as my upstream is rather slow (256kbps.) Small-scale torrents of hard-to-find large files such as rare movies are more vulnerable to dying if everyone doesn't seed to 100% or higher. Please do your part so free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to 101%, no torrent would ever die.
