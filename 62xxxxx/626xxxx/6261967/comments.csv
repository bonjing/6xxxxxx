,KnuxTheFox,2011-07-18T17:10Z,"I have my Wii hooked up to a standard TV (SDTV - 480i) so I need to not only force NTSC but 480i because for some reason, most games like to default to 480p, which will display on the TV, but will be distorted and colorless."
[V],HobbitGamez,2011-07-23T04:13Z,"@KnuxTheFox

Are you using composite cables? These are only capable of displaying 480i. Also, go to Wii Settings > TV Resolutions > Standard TV (480i) rather than EDTV/HDTV (480P)."
,doghead64,2011-09-22T06:53Z,"i have usbloadergx and its been updated as of today and i have cios revision 21 (it was a successful update because black ops works now)[plus i had revision 17 when i first installed cios 249 and all the games worked fine, i upgrade to a newer cios until 21 and it still didnt work] when i loaded it on usbloadergx it gave me a black screen and the the remote lost connection. i forced NTSC but it still does not work at all. i think it could be some of the things i have on priiloader or something but i am not too sure. do you think there is a reason for this?"
