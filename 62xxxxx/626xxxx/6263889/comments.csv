,redactedwv,2011-03-23T03:36Z,"found a little more @ some 'exile media' site:

""Terry (2010) - Synopsis - When media student Charlie Ruez starts filming an â€œup closeâ€ expose of small time gangster â€œTERRYâ€ for his college project, he gets more of an education than he bargained for. His life quickly spirals out of control as he plays witness to Terryâ€™s violent, drug-fueled existence. Dangerous Terry takes us on an utterly raw, compelling and voyeuristic journey into gangland London. In to a world ruled by class Aâ€™s and intimidation. But whatever happens... just keep filming.

TERRY is bold, utterly real and features a soundtrack from the hottest properties of todayâ€™s Urban scene""


kind of hard to find info on, but...might b cool. Thx TvTeam!"
