At 43-years-old, New Englandâ€™s Roomful of Blues has been around even longer than Alligator Records. For all that time, theyâ€™ve celebrated the jump blues, R&B and early rock â€˜nâ€™ roll music of the horn-powered golden era of the late 1940s and early 1950s. Roomful donâ€™t simply recreate the famous and obscure 78s and 45s of those years. Inspired by the spirit of the groundbreaking bands of the post-World War II decade, theyâ€™ve breathed new life into vintage songs, infusing them with boundless energy and fiery, swinging solos and vocals. For the last two decades, Roomful has been led by Chris Vachon, one of the most underrated guitarists in the blues. For 40 years, their hard-charging horn section has been sparked by Rich Lataille on tenor and alto sax. Energizing the band on Hook, Line & Sinker is their terrific new vocalist, Phil Pemberton. Philâ€™s performances showcase his flamboyant, multi-octave voice, fun-loving attitude and his deep understanding of the era when jumping blues bands were fronted by huge-voiced singers like Roy Brown, Wynonie Harris and Big Joe Turner. This album also gives more showcase space to Chris Vachonâ€™s tough guitar work. His version of Gatemouth Brownâ€™s Gate Walks To Board proves his talent can match that of the best string-benders. Hook, Line & Sinker is a proud addition to Roomfulâ€™s glorious musical history.
