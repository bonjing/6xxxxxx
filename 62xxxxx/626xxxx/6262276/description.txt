JOE BONAMASSA DUST BOWL INTERVIEW from Joe Bonamassa TV Channel @ YouTube

On Dust Bowl, my mission statement was to re-establish myself as a solo artist. I wanted to make a rootsy blues record and remind people that Iâ€™m not from England or Greece, which some fans may think. Getting some earthy grit on the tracks was important, but at the same time, I wanted to make a blues album that was different. Basically, I didnâ€™t want to compete with myself. â€œIf you listen to my last few albums, you hear a progression. Last year, though, I did an about-face and made a big rock record with Black Country Communion. Obviously, I knew I shouldnâ€™t try to out-rock that! [laughs] But I didnâ€™t want to repeat what I had already done solo-wise. So I had to look for new places creativelyâ€¦mentally, spiritually. It was challenging. â€œA few people have remarked to me that Dust Bowl sounds more â€˜mature,â€™ and I thought, Well, I made my last record a year agoâ€¦ Iâ€™m not that much older!
