Your Affordable Homemade Fallout Shelter [Japan Quake]

Excellent instruction manuals with lots of diagrams and schematics for different types of affordable homemade shelters against radioactive fallout.

Comment: FEMA has done something constructive here for a change. No FEMA death camps are needed anymore - build your own one at home. LOL - No, seriously these manuals are great.
