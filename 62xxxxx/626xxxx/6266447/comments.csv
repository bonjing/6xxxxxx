eset smart security 4

go to setup and use ""temporarily disable antivirus and antispyware protection"" and the crack will work BUT when you turn in on again it will remove tha cram to quarantine. When you want to play the game just restore it and disable antispyware again.

Not the best solution but it works for now."

,tpbfan32,2011-09-09T08:21Z,This upload worked for me in first shot. Don't know why people are complaining all over. Childish game but fun... Thanks Chris-Aksel & to all the Seeders!
,seevee1969,2011-09-24T22:22Z,"Note that after following these instructions, when attempting to run, I get a Securom error 8017, which apparently has something to do with detecting virtual drives.  Even after disabling VirtualCloneDrive & killing the executable from the Task Manager, it still gives the error.  A shame as all the other games I've run from TPB with the paul.dll work fine.  Is there a possibility of a LEGOCloneWars.exe that doesn't use Securom ?"

,davidis4god,2011-09-26T08:29Z,"This torrent is bull shit! The fucking crack is a virus that makes more viruses! I thought SKIDROW was legit, but now I have strong doubts about them! DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,Assassin2000,2011-10-02T21:01Z,Can anyone tell me how I can stop my antivirus (nod 32 smart security) to stop deleting the crack every time I open it...... PLEASE I REALLY NEED TO PLAY THIS!!! thank you..
,xXxprogamerxXx,2011-10-17T20:20Z,pliz seed will it work?? i must know before downloading
,ocdpcdoc,2011-10-28T20:22Z,"Works perfect, as always.
For those concerned about viruses, I would suggest either 1) making an exclusion just for the file in question (that way even IF it launched something it would be intercepted by your AV) or 2) Running your games in a separate partition. It means a separate install of Windows, but it's well worth it.  That being said, SKIDROW's stuff has always run fast and clean for me, no problems"
