Phunqest House Dreams Vol1
--------------------------
3 hour chilled house mix
ACS Day (VA)
ACS Day (mix), Various Artists, DJ Alex Flitsch
2011    House

New mix by ACS Day for late March 2011. 
Roughly 80% is from two different DJ Alex Flitsch mixes, but cut and mixed more by ACS Day. 

THE STYLE: 
Mostly a chilled house style, kind of like deep house, with a few more energetic parts also. Really a funky deep experience type thing.

IN THIS MIX I ACS DAY IS MORE LIKE JUST A \\\\\\\'DJ SELECTOR\\\\\\\' THAN A DJ OF THE TYPICAL KIND.

ACS Day (VA) huge bigups to DJ Alex Flitsch
and Connaisseur Recordings for their parts.
