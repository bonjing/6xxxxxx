Rockin' 70's (2004)


Sony Music's three-disc set Rockin' 70's is a fun-packed trip through the archives that hits on some very big names in '70s rock but also gathers up some obscure tracks as well. There are songs here that are monolithic examples of the power and glory of '70s AOR like Heart's "Barracuda," Rick Derringer's "Rock and Roll, Hootchie Koo," Electric Light Orchestra's "Do Ya," and Blue Oyster Cult's "(Don't Fear) The Reaper." There are Southern rockers (the Charlie Daniels Band, Molly Hatchet), pop/rockers (Eddie Money, Toto), corporate rockers (Boston, Kansas), and even both Winter brothers (Edgar's "Free Ride" is a highlight). Everyone from Ted Nugent to Mountain to Native American rockers Redbone gets a look in. Some of the surprises to be found are Andy Pratt's melodramatic "Avenging Annie," Iggy & the Stooges' awesome "Raw Power," and Mother's Finest's foundation-shaking funk-rock fusion jam "Baby Love." As with any compilation of this nature, you wonder about the bands and songs that were left off. In this case, Journey and REO Speedwagon leap to mind, as each produced some fine rock for the Sony family in the '70s. Despite these omissions, Rockin' 70's is still a good comp that provides a sense of the variety and quality of rock music in the '70s.
