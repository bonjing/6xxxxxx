@davis2503

The first few days the speed will be slow, but after a while, when new seeders start seeding (if they don't hit 'n run), the speed should go up.

@ItsMorgie & @xxxreaper100xxx

  Please open the .rar file you downloaded using only WinRar, which can be downloaded from www.games4theworld.org . (If you use any other software than WinRar, like WinZip or 7-zip, the files will get messed up!)
When you've opened the file using WinRar, select Ã¡ll the files in it and drag & drop them to a folder on your Desktop. When the extraction is done, close the .rar file and open the folder on your Desktop. 
Now, start by reading the included ""# Installation Guide.txt"" and you should be able to get the game to work yourself. Good luck!

@ekapa

These problems should be fixed in later updates of the game. If you need to update, please keep an eye on our Forum: www.games4theworld.bestgoo.com
We'll post information on how to update there.

@koraay

Do you get an error? Try running via the 'TSM.exe' in the Game Directory. Run it as an Administrator. (Right-click on the .exe and choose ""Run as Administrator"")

@yaycwars

Just drag & drop the crack to the folder specified in the ""# Installation Guide.txt"" and then choose ""Replace"" on the pop-up that appears, telling you the files already exist.

@zomie

That problems occur to almost Ã©veryone, even to people with a legal version of the game. It's a bug in the game. You'll need to wait for EA to update the game. When the new update comes out, just apply this fix to get the latest version of the game: http://games4theworld.bestgoo.com/t916-the-sims-medieval-ultimate-fix-should-fix-most-of-your-problems

They're working hard on it.

@Tenoke

Yes, that's possible, but then you'll need to convert the Crack (.exe file) to a format that is also used in Mac's, using some software.
After you've done that, just copy the converted file(s) to: Contents/Resources/trangaming/c_Drive/Program Files/Electronic Arts/The Sims 3 Outdoor Living Stuff/Game/Bin/      
and choose ""Replace"" on the pop-up that appears, telling you the files already exist.

If you can tell me how to fix this I will be very happy but at the moment I am on a negative review on this torrent.
,SophieMaccy,2011-06-16T11:57Z,"I think, to fix the disk problem, there should be a file called 'tsm' (that is, once you've finished downloading it, obviously.) Rename the file with '.exe' at the end of it, and that should get it working.

So it would look like 'tsm.exe'
Hope I helped. Thanks for the torrent!"

If you're getting the ""no cd inserted"" error, this should help! And, I haven't actually started playing the game yet, so hopefully everything else works fine."
,madjad022,2011-06-23T06:34Z,How does the link work?

[T],Games4theworld,2011-07-05T13:44Z,"Hello,

@N7_Steph
This problem is not caused by the torrent, but because of an EA bug. Try updating the game to the latest version, using this Fix: http://games4theworld.bestgoo.com/t916-the-sims-medieval-ultimate-fix-should-fix-most-of-your-problems


@SophieMaccy
This torrent doesn't require doing anything like that. Just read the included ""# Installation Guide.txt"" and you're done.

Once I start my first quest, I click to make a monarch.  I choose on the two people but nothing ever happens.  I try making a monarch in Create-A-Sim but it never loads up.. Anything I can do??"
,drakeluvr,2012-05-19T02:54Z,"I downloaded this game and can't get the updates. Anytime I say to update, it says it loses the connection to the internet. I have an always on connection and haven't lost a connection since I was with DSL. So, I downloaded the updates from the EA site, and it says I can't use them because I'm running 64 bit and I've not got an option on them to run 32 bit. Also, there are times I load the game and it still thinks it running and won't reopen it, even after I've shut out of the game entirely. I don't know if this is a game bug, or the downloaded game from yours that's got the bug, but I usually have to restart my whole system to get back into the game after a save and quit. "
