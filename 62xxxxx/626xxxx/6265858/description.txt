review my Jason MacNeil

The Machines are a tight rock group from Kitchener, Ontarioâ€”one that has no problem dishing out catchy rock gems like the garage-y â€œWhat Have I Doneâ€, which comes complete with sweet harmonies and an ample supply of hooks. And nothing much changes throughout the album, whether it is the surefire rock of â€œThis Townâ€, which has been done thousands of times before, or the fun and summery â€œTimeâ€ that screams to be a rock radio single. The band seems to excel on these ditties, not really challenging the listener, but giving them plenty to grin about. The Machines also rarely mail in performances, especially when the tender, slower, and memorable â€œMy Girlfriend Saysâ€ comes on. However, they put the album on its head with a country-meets-rockabilly surprise called â€œIâ€™d Like to Thank You Allâ€. There is not a lot here to choose from musically, as they simply hone their chops with each song, although â€œSnatching Defeat (From the Jaws of Victory)â€ seems to have the band losing the plot slightly. Perhaps the truly great song of the bakerâ€™s dozen is â€œThree Chord Montyâ€, which seems to bounce along perfectly a la the Jam or the Kinks.
