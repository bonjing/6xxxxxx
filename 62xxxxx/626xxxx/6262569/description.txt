Reception
=========
Cavett Binion in Allmovie notes: Millands performance conveys the requisite amount of hand-wringing torment (in the mode of The Lost Weekend), even if he fails to capture the manic intensity that Price brought to the other Poe films. Cormans deft direction, employing a rich palette of colors and superb widescreen compositions, is on a par with the series finest installments.
