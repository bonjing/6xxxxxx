      Art of Murder: Cards of Destiny is a single player, crime-solving,     
      action/adventure for PC. Developed in the best traditions of classic   
      police thrillers, in it players match wits against the cunning of a    
      ruthless serial killer with a macabre signature of leaving playing     
      cards at the scene of his gruesome crimes. An extra variable in this   
      desperate pursuit is that the killer is not only aware of your         
      pursuit, but enjoys it, making it just as dangerous for you as it is   
      for any other potential victims.
