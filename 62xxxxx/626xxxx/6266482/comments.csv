,jpmaximus,2011-03-28T07:01Z,"Ya so the game plays fine up till chapter 1 part 5 where you have to go to the weapons factory. You cant beat the level. Once you get the reactor down to about 1/3 its HP, it wont go down any further. SO i dont think the game is fully cracked yet. Any word on when another crack is comming?"
