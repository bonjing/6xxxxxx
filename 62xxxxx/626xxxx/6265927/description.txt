Storyline:In 2006, an apparent burglary occurs at the home of Kristi (Sprague Grayden) and Dan Rey (Brian Boland). Every room is ransacked except for that of their infant son Hunter. The only thing stolen is a necklace that Kristi's sister, Katie (Katie Featherston), had given to her. Following the incident, Dan installs a number of security cameras throughout the house. Kristi and Ali, Dan's daughter from a previous marriage, start to hear noises and see items fall or move on their own in the days ahead. Martine (Vivis Cortez), the family housekeeper and nanny, feels increasingly nervous and attempts to cleanse the house of "evil spirits," but Dan is uncomfortable with these beliefs and actions, and fires her after catching her burning sage. Kristi talks to Katie about the events in the home, and reveals that the girls were tormented by a demon or unknown spirit when they were children, but Katie cuts off the conversation saying it's better not to discuss such things. Meanwhile, Ali (Molly Ephraim) begins investigating the mysterious happenings in the house. She reads online that on occasion, a human can make a deal with a demon for wealth or power by forfeiting the life of a firstborn son. She realizes that until Hunter, there had not been a male child born in Kristi and Katie's family since the time of their great-great grandmother, and concludes that perhaps a demon is tormenting the family in order to claim the boy for its own
