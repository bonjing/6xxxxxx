,ItsNotPro,2011-03-26T08:44Z,it says protection error and says contact support ! and what is little snitch ?!?
,DeathPiracy,2011-03-27T10:21Z,@ItsNotPro Little snitch is a prgram that blocks connections for a application to access the internet which usually mean the application is checking if the serial is legit.... By downloading and installing the little snitch u won't get the contact support error... :D
,djknox,2011-03-31T11:19Z,i downloaded little snitch and im still having issues.. it quits and is there a way i can download he skins too?
,Novatoons,2011-04-10T16:57Z,"Hope it works, downloading it now =]"
,InFamous_DriftR,2011-04-21T05:56Z,Does this download still have problems???
,jtc46,2011-04-22T08:51Z,"Hey I downloaded this and its asking me for a serial number, whats the serial number?"
,jtc46,2011-04-22T09:02Z,"ok nevermind my last comment I got it to work, but I can only use it for like a minute then it closes and says Protection error 8. Please contact us at blah blah blah...why is that?"
,jtc46,2011-04-22T20:09Z,and yes I already downloaded little snitch
,Imballen,2011-04-23T08:26Z,"You dont need Little Snitch. Will not load if your airport is turned on. They have flagged the serial but if you go offline when you open it, it works just fine. I have been able to reconnect my wireless as soon as its open and havent had a problem. Thats definitely the error you guys keep getting though.

Other than that, perfect torrent."
,jtc46,2011-04-25T07:50Z,ok thanks turning off airport helped. But does anyone know if its possible to download stuff off their webiste?
,Daku786,2011-04-28T06:15Z,WORKS GREAT..JUST TURN OFF AIRPORT BEFORE ENTERING SERIAL!...THEN START IT AGAIN!
,mishasaike,2011-05-02T12:43Z,YEEEESSS!!!! I wait this very much. It works. THANXX
,RiotTheory,2011-05-02T15:59Z,Great torrent works brilliant. Just follow others advice and turn airport off before you enter serial then back on afterwards. Thanks a bunch man been waiting for 6 months for this. Will seed to a minimum of 50:1
,bbarnett1028,2011-05-17T01:15Z,Thank you!! Turned off Airport before serial and worked fine!!! Thanks again!
,Akocani,2011-06-02T11:44Z,"Hey guys, this might sound stupid...but in the folder I found a .rtfd file which I'm guessing is where the serial number is.  can someone please tell me what the serial is because I can't open that file with my mac. Thanks soo much"
