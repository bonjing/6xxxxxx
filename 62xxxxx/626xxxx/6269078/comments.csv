,azitromax,2011-03-25T13:26Z,"Wikipedia: 

Negu Gorriak (Basque for ""Red Winters"" or ""Severe/Harsh Winters"") were an underground Basque Crossover group. Their musical style combines various styles of rock music such as hardcore punk, hip-hop, ska, and reggae, although it is impossible to separate the band from its political ideology and its identification with the Basque Country and its language (Euskara)."
,player_uno,2011-03-26T02:03Z,"hey azitromax, I'm trying to download your kortatu torrent but nobody's seding! T_T can you please seed it?
by the way I had the honor to attend to 1 of the 2 shows negu gorriak played in Mexico and I was impressed by the energy they transmitted to the audience, even though no none in attendance spoke euskera."
,azitromax,2011-03-26T08:57Z,"I can imagine N.G are great live, but unfortunately I haven't seen them. 

The Kortatu torrent should be seeding and working. Try to download it, and please let me know if it's not working. "
,player_uno,2011-03-27T04:19Z,"guess what? I just finished downloading it about an hour ago! thank you, keep up the amasing torrent work!
by the way, are you from Spain (specfically from Euskadi) or how do you know so much about Euskadi's music?"
,azitromax,2011-03-27T09:53Z,"No, I'm not from Spain, i'm Scandinavian. I started listening to Kortatu & Negu Gorriak already 18 years ago and I still love their music :) "
