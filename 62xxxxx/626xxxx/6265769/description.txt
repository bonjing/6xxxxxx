Description: 
In this rather up-market episode, the Bikers head to 
Wales for some posh nosh. They discover Welsh cuisine 
is far more sophisticated than leeks and laver bread as 
they meet three Mums, each with their own take on what 
makes food fancy. For Avis Davies, it's a Maltese stuffed 
marrow dish; Derith Rhisiart takes the humble Welsh cake 
as the basis for her very posh cheesecake, and for Jewish 
mum Ruth Joseph no posh table is complete without her 
special orchid gateaux, made in the tin her mother brought 
to Britain when fleeing Nazi Germany as a child.
The Bikers aren't too shabby either though. In a formal 
garden setting, they rustle up some double-baked cheese 
souffles before a quick game of polo on the lawn; and a 
stately home provides the location for their posh alter 
egos Archie and Gerald to enjoy some Biker-cooked lamb 
cutlets en croute with a red wine gravy.
With the Mums on board and their posh family recipes 
tried and tested, the Bikers head to the recipe fair where 
foodies from over the country have brought their family's 
bestest, most poshest recipes. Gerard, the food historian, 
is on hand to shed some light on where our posh nosh 
originated and also to devour the many, many cakes and 
other delicious morsels on hand. At the end of the day, 
the banquet is a feast of the ultimate poshness.
