First, you told people to shut their mouth and then you will shut their mouth by killing them... "
,suminoe,2011-03-22T10:27Z,"Some lunatic paedophile mass murderer and robber told a lot of stories to his followers about 1,400 years ago, to justify his criminal behaviour.
Unfortunately, they were stupid and superstitious enough to fall for his crap, and some years later, it was written down together with accounts of his crimes - described as the perfect way to act, and an ideal for all mankind.
And thus, we got islam, one of the sickest ideologies in history..."
,ed.boey,2011-03-22T12:16Z,"we know what we believe because we use our own brain and will not let other to dictate what we have to believe...

The only reason I comment in wasalnaser upload is because your religion claims about what is right and wrong (well, it is the ""only perfect religion"" according to your ""perfect prophet"" and your ""perfect book"")...

Let your truth be your own truth and let everyone, in this era of information, find their own truth.

All I know is when I see those ""Full of Anger"" moslems, I know that they will be a big problem in the future. (Imagine millions of people like your ""perfect prophet"", that is disaster for our woman and children).

If you are the type of ""Peaceful"" moslems, well I think you should try to convert those ""Full of Anger"" moslems first before you try to convert anyone who don't wanna know and don't wanna care about anything that came from your religion. "
,ed.boey,2011-03-22T13:59Z,"@Zakimar: well, thank you... It is an honor for me to receive such a nice compliment from someone who are willing not just to ignore, but also to kill 12 millions people from this planet just because his god and prophet permit him to do that kind of thing...

I never like the bankers, financial people, the capitalist and everyone who treat people as their slave for money... but I will never kill them just because they don't see things, the way I see things."
,suminoe,2011-03-22T15:42Z,"Why is it forbidden to draw Mohammed?
Could it originally have been because it would have made it easier for any authorities to identify, and therefore bring to justice, the sick bastard?

Had Mohammed lived and preached today, he would be on the most-wanted list of all police forces in the world for his numerous crimes: robbery, rape, mass murder, paedophilia...

How any person with a healthy mind can consider such a swine ""the perfect man"" is waaaay beyond my comprehension."

,YushaIbnNun,2011-03-24T05:41Z,so sad...those that think they are not deceived are deceived already. allah (note lower case) is an imagination of a criminal. muhamed is just another imposter.
