,amobema,2011-04-08T03:31Z,When i run the homefront.exe it keeps coming  up with. D3Dcompliler.dll not found?
,A_Bridge_Too_Far,2011-04-12T01:29Z,"@ amobema:   Because this game is already installed,..You still may have to install the Redistibutables: Direct X,...Vurtual Runtime 2005 and 2008,...and PhysX,... installers to get it to run correctly on Your Machine.  They are found in the ""Redist"" Folder in the Install Directory,..(or wherever You extracted the ARC File.   though it sounds like Yours is mainly a Direct X Issue,...but I would install all of them to be sure it has needed files for it to run properly,...You should be good to go once You're done.  Injoy!!"
