Notes:

 - And yet another one for the "I can't believe it isn't already here" file; nominated for 6 Oscars including Best Picture, won for Best Musical Scoring, and has almost thirty songs and other pieces written for it by Irving Berlin

 - The audio was originally mono; stereo separation was simulated. As it's a musical, I encoded the audio at 160kbps VBR.
 
 - To use the subtitles, simply extract the .SUB file from the .RAR archive into the same folder. A free app. that will extract .RAR archives is 7-Zip from http://www.7-zip.org/
 
 - I seed using "Initial Seeding" which means that the torrent may show zero seeds; disregard this as I will seed for several days until there are other seeds.

 - Please make sure to seed as my upstream is rather slow (256kbps.) Small-scale torrents of hard-to-find large files such as rare movies are more vulnerable to dying if everyone doesn't seed to 100% or higher. Please do your part so free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to 101%, no torrent would ever die.
