This is a conversion from the iso file found from KevinRB's torrent. It is a vhs rip so it is horrible quality but it's worth the watch if you remember how funny the movie was!

Please comment! This is my second torrent I've ever done; the first one that is video, so criticism is welcomed.

I will be seeding 24/7 until there are at least 2 other seeders, at which time I will only be seeding intermittently.
