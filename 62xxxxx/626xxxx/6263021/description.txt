- Jeremy Scahill: As Mass Uprising Threatens the Regime, A Look at the Covert U.S. War in Yemen

The crisis in Yemen is growing following high-level defections from the regime of U.S.-backed President Ali Abudullah Saleh. On Monday, a dozen top military leaders announced their pledge to protect the protest movement after 45 people were killed and some 350 were wounded when Yemeni forces opened fire on demonstrators in the capital of Sanaâ€™a on Fridayâ€”after two months of nationwide demonstrations. In recent years, the United States has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in military and security aid to Yemen. â€œThe Obama administration has really escalated the covert war inside of Yemen and has dramatically increased the funding to Yemenâ€™s military, particularly its elite counter-terrorism unit, which is trained by U.S. special operations forces," says Democracy Now! correspondent and independent journalist Jeremy Scahill. "It could get much worse if President Saleh decides to release the U.S. trained counter-terrorism units on his own."


- â€œThe No-Fly Zone Has Always Been a Recipe for Disasterâ€: Jeremy Scahill Says Libyan Strategy Has No Endgame

The U.S. and allied air strikes on Libya have entered their fourth day as part of an international effort to enforce a no-fly zone. While the United States is denying it is attempting to assassinate Libyan leader Col. Muammar Gaddafi, allied forces bombed his compound for the second night in a row. â€œIn Iraq, [the no-fly zone] resulted in the strengthening of Saddam Husseinâ€™s regime ... I think it could end up backfiring in a tremendous way and keeping Gaddafi in power even longer,â€ says Jeremy Scahill, Democracy Now! correspondent and independent journalist.


- Long Nightâ€™s Journey Into Day: Democracy Now!â€™s Exclusive Interview Former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide

Former Haitian President Jean Bertrand Aristide and his family returned to Haiti last week for the first time since a 2004 U.S.-backed coup forced him out of office. A 2005 State Department cable recently released by WikiLeaks recounts how U.S. and French diplomats threatened to block several Caribbean countries and South Africaâ€™s seating on the UN Security Council unless South Africa kept Aristide in exile. This time, President Obama called South African President Jacob Zuma to tell him not to fly the Aristides home to Haiti. South Africa refused to comply. In a Democracy Now! broadcast exclusive, Amy Goodman was there on Aristideâ€™s flight from exile. Today, part two of her conversation on the flight with Aristide the plane approached Haiti.
