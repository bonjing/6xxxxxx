This is a 720p rip bro, it'll take around 500MB, Give a +1 to his rips, he's so fast in doing requests, I'm not, lol
'HandBrake' is a nice tool for beginners, it'll handle mp4 too, get the latest build.

@deff
Thx friend, you're doing nice. Pls do mention 480p or 720p in ur titles, it'll get you more hits, sure.
I've completed encoding 'Veer Zaara', I'll up it soon, As I'm upping 'Red Riding Trilogy' to the server.
'Guzaarish' was fine :) 
Good luck with more dual audio movies, cheers. . "

,penisfuck,2011-04-18T01:37Z,"Same old ""BRRip"" shit that's been floating around ever since. He simply relabeled it.

Actually, it's a rip from HDTV (see logo on the top right corner) and it's total rubbish quality."
