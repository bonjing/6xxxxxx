,JackBack,2011-03-28T19:11Z,Be really careful about uploading. These trackers have one hell of a strict penalty for slow upload rates. If you are not consistently uploading at a speed of 50kbps or higher your download speed will never reach above 100kbps.

,Esmad3,2011-03-29T10:52Z,@ XJonhX: Because your internet sux. Just because you have 1mb internet doesn't mean you can use it all for downloading this torrent. Each connection produces it's own overhead and therefore you are limited not only by bandwidth but also by the number of connections you can handle. With faster internet you increase the chance of getting faster connections.

Try with Alt+TAB when black screen appears, than set the firewall to allow/deny internet access, and check option to remember your answer... After that return to the game or kill it and start again."

I would recommend to everyone else here. Never Download Crysis 2 only but it so you have the Case, CD, Book, Guide and all. Crysis is for the True PC players and so is Battlefield 3. But Do Download TES V Skyrim since its only Single Player. wich means your missing out on nothing if you download it. But im still gonna buy it at the store lolz..."

,wanderer23,2011-03-30T12:36Z,"@SpinZ23, it might be a power useage problem thats causing your comp to just turn off. Crysis 2 is hungry for the juice, and the load on your graphics card might be too high for your power supply unit.

now once installed double click on the iso file to open it.

now go to your desktop and create a new folder and name it Crysis 2.

now extract all files from the iso file to that folder.

then all you do after is close the iso file and click run from the Crysis 2 folder. 

hope this helps ya."

However I would like to check and see if my PC will handle the game on the highest available settings. I have an HP ENVY 17 Notebook. Core i5 450 M OC to 3.2 Ghz, ATI Radeon 5850 mobility using AMD gpu overclock tool. 8Gb Memory. Intel 80gb SSD. I can Run Crysis warhead at highest settings with almost no lag. My question is, if I download this torrent to test it out first, can I still download the DX11 patch? I want to make sure I can handle the tessellation. Other wise If I cant run it at highest, then I will just purchase the PS3 version and just appreciate the Gameplay alone on console. Thanks for reading. "

,sudokill,2011-04-02T00:46Z,"I downloaded this last week and I've removed it. Very rare for a pirated game there's a multiplayer patch too, played single player most the way through and a lot of multiplayer and in my opinion the game sucks. The controls are too laggy even with good fps and mouse fixes, multiplayer games are too short and maps are too small.
No free roam gameplay like Crysis 1, hardly anything is destructable unlike Crysis 1. All the things that make Crysis good are removed, it's even copied COD with the perks. So many fps's are copying COD. Crysis 2 is like a direct cross between COD4 and Crysis 1, except COD runs a hell of a lot faster, and Crysis 1 is a hell of a lot bigger and better, so this game is completely pointless imo"
,sk897halden,2011-04-02T00:49Z,i played the game in 6hours and quit i am going to bed next morning i played crysys 2 and it hasent been saved so i must start my game at new campain how do i fix this save problem ? i ust now.. plz.. i realy want to save ..:) tnx
,jonoace,2011-04-02T00:58Z,"TO ALL THOSE WITH INSTALLATION PROBLEMS PLEASE FOLLOW THESE STEPS EXACTLY AS FOLLOWS.

1. PLEASE ENSURE YOU UPDATE ALL YOUR DRIVERS TO PLAY THIS GAME, THAT INCLUDES WINDOWS UPDATE,ESPECIALLY FOR OLDER SYSTEMS.I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH.

2. PLEASE BURN YOUR I.S.O AT NO MORE THAN 4X SPEED DUE THE LARGE SIZE OF THE FILES TO BURN.ALSO DO NOT USE CHEAP DUAL LAYER DICS AS THEY CAN COURSE MIS-BURNING LEADING TO CURRUPT FILES.(I SUSPECT ALOT OF THE PROBLEMS ARE COURSED BY USING CRAP DISCS)

3. ONCE BURNED INSTALL THE GAME.PLEASE TURN OFF YOUR INTERNET DURING THE INSTALL.(JUST A SECURETLY PRECUTION).

4. ONCE INSTALLED GO INTO C: DRIVE AND LOOK FOR PROGRAMS (X86 FILES).

5. ONCE IN THERE CLICK WHERE IT SAYS ""ELECTRONLIC ARTS CLICK ON THAT.

6. ONCE IN THERE YOU WILL SEE A FILE CRYTEC CLICK ON THAT.

7. NOW YOU ARE IN THE GAME FILE DIRECTERY(CRYSIS 2) ,NOW CLICK ON  ""BIN 32""

8. ONCE IN THERE SCROLL DOWN WHERE IT SAY'S CRYSIS 2.EXE.NOW RIGHT CLICK WITH YOUR MOUSE ON THAT FILE (PICTURE OF HELMET).

9.NOW YOU COME UP WITH A LIST OF OPTIONS ,GO DOWN WHERE IT SAYS RENAME.CLICK ON IT.NOW THE CRYSIS FILE WILL BE HILIGHTED,NOW RENAME THE FILE TO CRYSIS 2.EXE.1(OR ANY OTHER NUMBER) PRESS ENTER (WINDOWS WILL ASK DO YOU WANT TO PROCEED SAY YES).THAT FILE WILL NOW BE A BLANK WHITE FILE (CANNOT BE USED).

10. FIND YOUR FAIRLIGHT CRACK ON YOUR DVD DISC AND RIGHT CLICK MOUSE COPY FILE.

11. RIGHT CLICK MOUSE AND PASTE THAT CRACK FILE INTO YOUR BIN 32 CRYSIS 2 GAME DIRECTERY IN YOUR C:DRIVE(WINDOWS SHOULD SHOW FILE BEEN LOADED TO THAT DIRECTERY ON SCREEN)

12. ONCE DONE GO INTO YOUR BIN 32 DOUBLE CLICK ON CRYSIS 2.EXE FILE (ONE YOU JUST PASTED IN)AND THE GAME SHOULD NOW LOAD.

PLEASE NOTE: DO NOT TOUCH THE ""CRYSIS GAME LAURCHER.EXE LEAVE THAT ALONE DO NOT TOUCH IT,AS IT MAY COURSE A PROBLEM TO LOAD THE GAME FROM YOUR CRACK.

ONCE THE GAME IS WORKING YOU CAN GO BACK INTO BIN 32 COPY A SHORT CUT OF THAT CRACK FILE ONTO YOUR DESKTOP,AND YOU CAN LAURCH TH GAME FROM THERE.

OK I THINK I HAVE SUMED IT UP FOR YOU GUYS .SOME GAME CRACKS DON'T ALWAYS WORK WITH JUST COPY AND PASTE AND THERE FOR YOU NEED TO RENAME THE ORGINAL EXE FILE TO SHUT IT DOWN.IN THIS CASE IT IS FOR THIS GAME. 

SO PLEASE FOLLOW THE STEPS AS ABOVE EXACTLY AS I LAYED OUT AND YOU CANNOT GO WRONG HAPPY GAMING AND ENJOY FOLKS!!

REGARDS SQUASH SLAYER."

If i had already overwritten crysis.exe, obviously the patch will not install, but upon updating the game to version 1.1 I still get the patch download sequence (In this case, to version 1.2).

* SCAR Hologram Decoy - This special attachment to the SCAR will project a hologram image of the player, allowing them to confuse their opponents with the decoy.
* SCAR Weapon Skin - This digital camouflage skin will allow players to add a personalized touch to one of the more popular assault rifles in the game.
* Platinum Dog Tag - This special one-of-a-kind dog tag is one of over 250 that will be collectible in Crysis 2 multiplayer, helping to separate you from the rest of the field

Well what do you expect its clear  to me you have NOT FOLLOWED THE INSTRUTIONS PROPERLEY. From your comments ABOVE is NOT going to win you any Friends or getting help!!

Well this method,it has worked perfectly for me and others  on here. Please remember everybody's system is different. If you want me to help you please post  back with the problem

However I will ask ""YOU"" to do 3 things before you DO.

1.DO NOT USE OFFENSIVE COMMENTS 

2. DO NOT USE ABUSE AGAINST  SOMEONE WHO IS TRYING TO HELP.

3.I ASK YOU TO REFRAIN FROM USING THE F WORD,AS THAT DOES HELP YOUR REPUTATION ON THIS SITE.

From what I have gathered you have tried to copy the CRACK file into the RENAMED original EXE FILE. DON'T.

Just copy the Crack File into your BIN32 FILE.And use that file to load the game.

If you still have a problem post back ,but I MAKE IT VERY CLEAR TO YOU, IF YOU START BEING OFFENSIVE, then clearly I am not going to waste my time helping you nor would anybody else on here would either,and most people would agree. Choice is yours mate.Enough Said.

,2012637,2011-04-07T23:49Z,"Works fine, single player is pretty fun but it honestly doesn't compare to the first Crysis. Not to mention I felt like it was still in beta with the minor bugs, the most annoying being a total of 3 game crashes upon fully completing single player, even after updating to the latest patch (all software side, I have logs to prove it). People may laugh that I point this out but I haven't played one game that crashes upon release, unless there had been computability issues of course.

The game itself is not so much open-world as the first one, more of ""go here, then here, then here, you win"", even if the maps are of a decent size.

Multi-player was fun while it lasted, though I still wasn't utterly impressed with that either. I say ""while it lasted"" because now all the privately hosted servers have an updated serial check through EA. (That means if you want to connect, you need a legit serial now). 

Everyone complains the ""graphics aren't as good as the first game"" when they are actually noticeably superior after you download the latest patch. (No, fps does not determine the graphics of a game). The Cryengine 3 was a huge improvement over the last, that's probably one of the only pros.

Overall, well worth downloading for just the single player. That's about it though, I'll have to pass supporting the developers on this one. EA could have made this true history if they had made the map open-world. (Unfortunately they rushed it's release too quickly.)"

Before getting to any of the steps Jonoace listed on page 17... I can't install the game in the first place.  Autorun starts the launcher with options for Play, Tech Support, View Readme, or Quit - but no Install.  Clicking Play runs the updater, which then gives an error, because of course Crysis hasn't been installed yet.  I thought there might be an option using EASetup, but that asks for a serial. 

I've run countless torrents from here before and occasionally had to do a good bit of finagling, but I'll admit this one has me stumped.  I assume it must work somehow, since so many people are reporting good results.  Thanks in advance!"

1 . Downloaded this torrent. Very good speed btw.
Thanks to all the seeders. about 5000 atm.

2. Make sure you have the program ""PowerIso"". It's free and take small space.

3. When the files is finish downloading from your torrent program (itorrent/utorrent), right click & show files.

4. make sure the largest File is an Iso file. if it's not, download it, right click on the file & make it a ISO file.

5. Right click on your ISO file, hold over the PowerISO title and mount it to one of the disc's that appear. 

6, when you have done that, go to My computer and press on the new disc that have appeard. That should be ""Cryses_2-FLY"" or something close. If it didnt work the first time, just do it again. it may be slow sometimes.

7, Now you shall install the game. Do not go on ""luncher"" as it will ask you for a CD-key. Btw, dont even try find a keygen for Cryses 2. Evrything is fake, cost money or have virus.

8. Now we are almost finish. The only thing left to do now, is to replace the Crack file with the orginal file. When you are finish downloading Cryses2, you'll recive some files. 

One of these files are the Cryses application. i found mine this way: 

Start menu, Search, Electronic Arts, Crytek, Crysis2 2, Bin32.

This file shall be replaced with the Crack file. 

The crack file is located in the ISO file at the ""Fairlight"" folder. Simply switch these files and your good to go :)  Have fun!

Minimum Requriements for Cryses 2 is:

Intel Processor	- Core 2 Duo E6750 2.66GHz

I have installed countless games from here..

But I honestly feel like a complete idiot having to ask this. I am trying to install this on a new system Windows &, I run the setup as admin.

1. Do you install the Download Manager?
2. Should anything be blocked by the firewall?
3. I have installed like 4 times, copy the crack, go to run the game and absolutely nothing happens...Nothing!!!!

Anyone have this running on Windows 7?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. I for the life of me cannot figure what I am doing wrong. The instructions are not that hard. I have found the game install folder, the bin folder, copy in the patch, and nothing happens.

Fuck this is just nuts.

please e-mail me at jsvez2010@gmail.com if you have this working on Windows 7 64bit"

patches have been put on all in order, cracked after the patches have been installed, used different cracks and so on. searched the problem on google with no results. Anyone???? Please:(

1. If you have  crysis 2 already installed you must first un-install it.
2. If you have not installed it or you just just finished un-installing it then install it now.  Do not copy the crack over the to the bin32 folder yet.
3. run the game uncracked.
4. let it update to version 1.4
5. copy the crack over the the bin32 folder then run from the launcher.

it worked for me"

If you delete the file, it comes back later with a different number, if you remove the autostart from the registry it re-applies itself to the registry immediately."

So, I've installed it and everything, but when I try to copy over the fairlight file into the bin32 file, it says I need an additional 53 Mb in CRYSIS 2.  I ran the crysis2launcher and got the updated patch (v1.8 now), but when the patch tries to install it says it can't delete the target file (crysis2.exe) and then quits.  I can't manually delete the file either.  It's possible that I'm overlooking something simple, I really don't know what I'm doing with this stuff, but I'd really love any help.  Thanks!"

1. After download completes U get, (A) - Crysis_2-FLT and (B) - FAIRLIGHT nfo (This fairlight nfo is not the crack)
2 - Just EXTRACT the Crysis_2-FLT, and when it's done go to where ever the files r Extracted CLICK on the EA AUTO RUN or EA setup, and voila the Setup wizard installs it for u...
3 - Now u can see Crysis 2 in ur start menu, it won't work yet so go to those extracted files, there is a Fairlight Folder(and trust me it's there) open and copy the crysis 2 file(THE CRACK) And go to the drive where the game is installed open Electronic Arts folder-then crytec-then crysis 2  and paste the crack in the ( bin 32 ) if it asks u to replace Existing file do it.................................

4. Copy the cracked Crysis2.exe over, (from FairLight\ directory on the mounted drive to something like C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\Crytek\Crysis 2\bin32\) 
5. Right click on the .exe , choose compatibility - Windows XP SP2.

Note: do not use Crysis2Launcher.exe - it updates game and the crack would not work even if you copy the cracked file again. "

Only thing you can do is load the level and try to progress like that. skidrow has said that this is a bug with the 1.9 patch itself, not his crack. looks like were waiting for 2.0 for the real working version but just be pro for now.

1.You cannot use a Controller for this.I tried it.An the forums say that it does not work for this one.

2.Your screen may turn black due to your video card not being compatable and lacking graphics.Updating drivers does not help.It is not build for systems that cannot handle high end Graphics.My laptop cant handle it but my desktop can.It is based off your graphics card.

3.There are some lag issues and crashing with the current version and this one too.See forums for more details on Crysis 2."

I copied crack from fairlight folder and pasted it into bin32 folder clicked YES when asked for overwrite.
I tried to run the game it said ""Game Folder game not found"".
Then I ran Crysis2launcher, and it updated my game to v1.9.
I again ran the crack it gave the same error.

I've read many of the comments here, I feel like only those people are able to play the game who burned them on DVD's or mounted it and installed here. I have actually deleted the .iso file that I downloded and left with these extracted files, and I find no where that I can install it.

,shotslikerain,2011-08-29T09:06Z,"Like it was mentioned in an older post, here's what you have to do to get rid of the black screen error (where all you see is the mouse cursor)

1. Uninstall the game
2. Reinstall the game
3. DO NOT launch it from the regular .exe file, this will patch it which causes the black screen issue
4. Before launching the game copy the crysis2.exe from the fairlight folder into the bin32 folder of Crysis 2 directory
5. Click replace for the .exe
6. Launch with the new cracked .exe and there will be no need for a key, and the black screen problem will be fixed
7. Basically, only launch using the crack .exe

Goodluck!"

tried different solutions for the compability problem but nothing gave results.

i have dl'd and installed alot of games but this have never been a problem before...

what am i missing? "

,pockiies,2011-09-05T07:46Z,"there is no serial key!!!
1. download
2. mount - when i mean mount, i mean mount the .rar file (i used daemon tools lite)
3. install
4. after installed, copy ""Crysis2.exe"" from the .rar file and copy it into ""wherever you installed it""\electronic arts\ crytek\crysis 2\bin32 and then overwrite. so for example, my install location is ""G:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\Crytek\Crysis 2\bin32""
5. launch the game via the crack you just copied into the folder.

N.B - crack is located in win.rar file>""fairlight"" folder"
,lazabar,2011-09-05T16:06Z,"okey, seems if you extract the iso before running crysis2.exe via autorun it wont work.

Has anyone had any luck enabling the dev console on this? the tilde key (`) doesnt work. Ive combed through a hundred forums, with almost no success. from what I can find, this issue has been fixed in a patch, but any patch applied to a cracked version of the game causes it to freeze..ive re-installed this twice since it freezes after a patch. ive also tried the ""DEV"" thing in the shortcut..no dice. 

adding a system.cfg file to the game directory doesnt seem to work either.. anyone have any luck? some info on this would be appreciated. ive played through the game already, but would like to play as an invincible human wrecking ball this time around..lol  thanks in advance!"

Download patch 1.9 from:

Get the original Crysis2.EXE off the ISO and replace your cracked EXE with it. This is so the installed can find Crysis 2, it won't recognize the cracked EXE.

Run the patch, and after it's done updating download the 1.9 patch crack from here:

For all those who want to play this game under DX11(requires installing DX11 upgrade and 1.9 Patch), you may follow below steps (They worked for me)
1.	Download this torrent and follow the instructions to install BUT do not copy crack as instructed, we’ll come to that in a while
2.	Download Patch 1.9 and its crack from here (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6516490/Crysis_2_v1.9_Cracked_PROPER-FLTDOX)
3.	Download DX11 package from here (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6511989/Crysis.2.v1.9.Update.incl.DirectX_11.Ultra.and.HiRes.Texture.Pac). I recommend skipping crack files and ‘Crysis2Patch1.9’ file in this package as we are not going to use them any way. Also if you are not going to use Hi-Res pack then it can also be skipped. (I skipped these two as I have Win7 32-bit and Hi-Res pack requires 64-Bit Windows)
4.	Unpack files downloaded in step 2(Patch 1.9 and its crack) using 7-Zip
5.	Run Patch 1.9 after completing Step 1. And ensure you have NOT copied crack to installation directory up till now. Running Patch 1.9 requires original Crysis2.exe to be in installation directory 
6.	After completing step 5, run DX11 package downloaded in step 3
7.	If you downloaded Hi-Res pack in step 3 then install it now, otherwise skip this step
8.	Go to ‘bin32’ directory within installation directory that you defined in step 1
9.	Rename Crysis2.exe to something like Crysis2_BAK.exe, just to keep a backup of it for any later reference
10.	Copy the contents of crack directory of step 4 to ‘bin32’ directory
11.	Run Crysis2 from start menu. It should work
I may have overdone it, but I tried to be simple, so that people may follow these steps and be able to successfully install and play this very exceptional game. It is a brilliant FPS that should be praised."

1. Download this torrent and follow the instructions to install BUT do not copy crack as instructed, we’ll come to that in a while
2. Download Patch 1.9 and its crack from here (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6516490/Crysis_2_v1.9_Cracked_PROPER-FLTDOX)
3. Download DX11 package from here (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6511989/Crysis.2.v1.9.Update.incl.DirectX_11.Ultra.and.HiRes.Texture.Pac). I recommend skipping crack files and ‘Crysis2Patch1.9’ file in this package as we are not going to use them any way. Also if you are not going to use Hi-Res pack then it can also be skipped. (I skipped these two as I have Win7 32-bit and Hi-Res pack requires 64-Bit Windows)
4. Unpack files downloaded in step 2(Patch 1.9 and its crack) using 7-Zip
5. Run Patch 1.9 after completing Step 1. And ensure you have NOT copied crack to installation directory up till now. Running Patch 1.9 requires original Crysis2.exe to be in installation directory
6. After completing step 5, run DX11 package downloaded in step 3
7. If you downloaded Hi-Res pack in step 3 then install it now, otherwise skip this step
8. Go to ‘bin32’ directory within installation directory that you defined in step 1
9. Rename Crysis2.exe to something like Crysis2_BAK.exe, just to keep a backup of it for any later reference
10. Copy the contents of crack directory of step 4 to ‘bin32’ directory
