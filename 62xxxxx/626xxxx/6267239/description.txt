    Jamie wants to see if a classical education - with         
    subjects that were once at the centre of a British        
    education, and taught by some of the most brilliant      
    people - can reach today's disillusioned kids.            
                                                               
    Top Cambridge Latin scholar Professor Mary Beard          
    attempts to excite the kids with a subject few state     
    school kids do any more, using David Beckham's tattoos    
    as an unusual Latin primer, but is met by a wall of        
    noise.                                                    
                                                             
    Former Poet Laureate Sir Andrew Motion at first fares     
    little better. But he has a radical plan that may help     
    to engage the kids with his subject.                      
                                                             
    Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's former spin doctor        
    (whose last politics class worked only too well and led    
    to a fight) returns to give it another go.                
                                                             
    And Jamie hopes that Grammy winner Jazzie B of Soul II    
    Soul can reach the creativity that he thinks may be a      
    key to engaging these underqualified kids.
