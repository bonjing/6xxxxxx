Jenny March has here created what is surely the definitive book on Greco-Roman mythology. The dictionary is incredibly thorough and well-written; but fiercely accurate without any romanticising gloss or faux-biblical style. The text is interpersed with sometimes haunting images from ancient art - such as the Athenian pottery painting showing Heracles journeying across dark oceans in the golden bowl belonging to Helios.
If you are into Greek and Roman mythology (actually it seems the Romans pinched most of their mythology from the Greeks), then here they are in all their primitive glory, local variant stories and all. I find this book especially good for re-reading, with many entries I have never even heard of.
