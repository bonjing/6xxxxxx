BUT

Great quality as always.  Just finished watching it, great race, VERY great quality, no hiccups.

Man, what I'm stuck on is whether I want to burn it to disc and lose a little video quality and gain the 6 channel sound, or just stick it on a USB and watch it in perfect quality but only 2.1 ""fake"" surround sound.   

I'll probably switch back and forth across the season :D

GREAT job jameshotwire, and the season, at least 4 races in, is already getting pretty competitive, these new points rules are really making 'em fight for standings.  "
