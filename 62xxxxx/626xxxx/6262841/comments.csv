,Mr.Lucifero,2011-12-05T21:58Z,"Mr. KickAss...Been a fan of yours for awhile...I downloaded GWTW, the African Queen, Bridge on the River Kwai, The Maltese Falcon, Casablanca & The Treasure of the Sierra Madre....All of it---FANTASTIC QUALITY!!!...But best of all is the reduced file sizes....NOBODY does this better than you, my man....However....This film is, probably, the only negative review you will ever hear from me....Don't get me wrong...It's a great upload...Very watchable....But the quality, is not quite up to the usual excellent KickAss standard.....In certain scenes, the quality seems kinda ""stretched out"".....Aaanyway, hope you don't take it the wrong way....KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK AND THANKS A BUNCH....BTW, any chance of uploading more Walt Disney Classics??....Snow White & especially Bambi was excellent... 8)"
,Mr.Lucifero,2011-12-17T17:05Z,"I would like to apologize to Mr. Kick-Ass for my previous rating of the quality of this upload....I must have been drunk or, at the very least, on heavy drugs, LOL.....This is an very good copy of this classic film....Way better than my 1.39 Gig, AVI version.....V/M=8/9....DVD quality equivalent....Thanx Kick-Ass & once again, my personal apology..... 8)"
,erPlay,2012-04-03T09:53Z,You really kick ass. Thanks!
