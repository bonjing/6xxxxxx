Storyline:

During the latter half of 1888 a notorious serial killer nicknamed Jack The Ripper terrorises the East End of London by murdering prostitutes in a terribly violent way. 
Public outrage follows. Inspector Frederick Abberline is assigned to the case but finds that it is not just a simple murder enquiry. Based on a real life event, this film 
claims to have had access to top secret Home Office files and believe that their ending is the correct solution to the age old mystery.

*I don't take requests because I don't have time and everyone will fill the comment section with them instead of commenting about quality and other tehnical specs of the movies or say thanks.Thank you for understanding!
*For best performance I suggest you use KMPlayer(find it with google) for playback
*These movies were made especially for PC and they don't play on a PS3.If you want to re-encode for PS3 or test for other devices be my guests.
*I'll ask everybody to stop with the "it doesn't work","it's out of sync" comments because I tested the movies before I uploaded them and they work fine.
