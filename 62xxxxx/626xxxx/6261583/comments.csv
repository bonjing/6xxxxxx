,popeye013,2011-10-31T18:11Z,"Well they folded to the pressure of people whom think that up-on hearing fuck on tv, will cause their kids to have a bad life, so MTV being even more spineless and NOT commissioning series 2 is no big surprise, should of gone to Showtime, HOB or AMC, channels like that, not shit like MTV!
Really pissed off to find this was bleeped, does anyone know where you can get an un-censored version of the series from?
