This is an English edition of Michael Bertiaux's "Monastery of the Seven Rays" three year course. Bertiaux is famous for authoring the "Voudon Gnostic Workbook", a classic synthesis of many different kinds of magick that, unfortunately is written in such a way that it's difficult to understand. However, the Monastery of the Seven Rays material goes over much of what's covered in the VGW in clear and coherent language. If you've looked at the Voudon Gnostic Workbook, but have wanted a more coherent explanation of the concepts, these files are for you. 

The synthesis is Voudon, Theosophy, Gnosticism, general Magick, some UFO occultism, and some Shinto and Hindu concepts thrown in there. Includes some things that are probably channeled material. Despite the seeming chaos of the eclecticism, the system as a whole is insightful and does work. It provides an interesting map of the magickal universe for those who want to explore it. Bertiaux is a serious magician.
