,imjustwow,2011-03-21T19:11Z,Is this movie more that 14 mins? I have another version which is 116mb..just don't want to consume my bandwidth limitation by downloading it again :(
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-21T19:51Z,"How to spell the name of the one you have. Then, I could answer. Duration of one you have mean nothing. BTW, .nfo is probably few seconds away, and screen shots are here too, so I really cannot see any problem in solving this huge mystery."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-21T19:59Z,"@himansu_007: It's very nice from you ""I can wait"", but that link have 100 seeds, it is good encode (I have it and at least dozen of my friends). It's good movie too, so, instead of waiting, I humbly suggest you to take that one. Who knows what could happen four weeks from now."
,froglog,2011-03-21T22:20Z,Thank you
,tylr,2011-03-22T06:23Z,"820p?
tHanks.."
,suryamukhi,2011-03-22T07:14Z,"will u be doing SKINS US S1 in single pack ?
it  may be still with you since it has only 10 parts."
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-22T07:19Z,"It's not 720p, but 820p. It's not the first time I encoded 820p. ""p"" stand for ""pixels"", nothing more - and, nothing is written in stone.

If I feel like - I can do 576p, 196p or 640p - in short, whatever I want. Other side (downloaders) decide - do they want it or not.

I am annoyed when people came to the site called The PIRATE BAY and voice out their strong feelings about obeying some rules, standards and ask for confirming to the law.

Well, that's called - stupid."

@suryamukhi: No, I haven't done single episode of Skins ever and I sometimes do season packs of series I already have encoded on weekly basis."

,ahmedv,2011-03-22T08:38Z,Thanks
,NagaPower,2011-03-22T17:29Z,"Hi there @twentyforty, first of, let me tell you that i really appreciate your work. I would be very grateful if you could upload the classic 1983 Oshin series if you have it. Thanks"
,YuiSnape,2011-03-24T08:57Z,"Actually, ""p"" means ""progressive"" as opposed to ""i"" which means interlaced. Progressive scanning is better than interlaced, as each frame uses every line of resolution where interlaced uses typically half the lines per frame. I note you always use progressive frames in your encodes ('cuz interlaced really only makes sense for some broadcast material, really)."
