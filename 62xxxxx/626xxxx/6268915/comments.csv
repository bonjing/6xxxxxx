,QborT,2011-03-25T02:10Z,"tonyray79 is a perfect example of an idiot speaking when he doesn't have a clue.

VIP skulls are higher ranked than Trusted.  

As far as this movie is concerned, it is the ASYLUM knockoff.  It is NOT Battle: Los Angeles, it is a cheap straight to video piece 'o' crap.

,Luisppk,2011-03-25T09:25Z,If this is not the movie and everybody knows...? why is it still available? It is not better to clean the torrents from it?
,QborT,2011-03-25T22:35Z,"Luisppk it is not the movie people are hoping it to be, but it is a real movie so why on earth would it be removed?

It is not TPB's responsibility to teach people how to read.  This is a site where media is freely distributed, just because you don't like the content doesn't mean it should be removed.  

FKN n00bs, learn or shut up."
