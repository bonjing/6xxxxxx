Actually youre a fuckin' arrogant parasite.You only upload stuff that already exists in the database.On the other hand you say:""If you would like to reserve a Request and have it actually get uploaded contact us @

Contact us??Wtf are u , a company??You do not deserve any respect my friend so cut this bullshit and upload something that IS NOT RELEASED ON TPB YET.

,aarque,2011-03-24T11:33Z,"People love your torrents because you are so consistent. Now it is time to share that love with your ""peers."" the other people that work so hard to bring delicious torrents to everyone.

Think, Mahekun, use that brain God gave you. Let's say 5 of us saw a sincere and convincing request for a software title. Five of us knew of five separate places to find that title so we each scurried off to load, rar and torrent the thing.

 jimstalk was first, he is very efficient. I decided that I worked so hard to find my torrent that the possibility of Jim leaving something out of his was great enough to justify posting mine. Soon after, Mahekun posted and then two more. Now we have five choices of the same torrent.

Well the poor little leecher fishies, they just don't know what to do. A few of them were already building Jim's torrent cloud and when they saw Mahekun who they love, several of them unplugged and went to Mahekun's torrent and one or two got lost along the way. Meanwhile I struggle along with my cloud. My bandwidth is low so I generally disconnect as soon as I get a few seeders, but it's not happening, maybe I'll just pull my torrent after a few days...You know where this is going, right? If you spread the leechers too thin, the torrent DIES. All of my torrents I have ever uploaded are still active because they each have at least one seeder and that should be the case with all quality torrents.

 If we spread out the leechers by being selfish and trying to be cool, the torrents die. If we support our peers and actually share existing torrents of software we would have posted ourselves, we avoid diluting the torrent cloud and likely help preserve TPB itself by reducing the load.

You do the math"

Firstly none loves your uploads.Idk who told you that we love your ""pre-existing"" torrents but personally i think that you do not deserve to be a ""pirate"" (active user with many uploads)...Youre one of the million users who downloads stuff and leaves a ""thanks"" behind.

guys i must admit that the FSX tag was one of the most active tags from 2006.There were users like komu or aarque who deserve our respect.Unfortunatelly the fsx tag on tpbis beginning to die.....Users like Simgameit,Catshit1 or even mahekun64 are responsible for this mess.I know that this sounds like a sad story but i want to make a final request....

please upload:

captainsim Weapon For Fsx

,ShockerStalin,2011-03-25T02:35Z,"I agree Jimstalk. I am pretty new here, and only have a few uploads but I think they have been decent ones and I never request more then I upload.

Pieces of shit like Mahekun64 just ruin the whole system."
,aarque,2011-03-25T09:03Z,"Give it hope, Jim. Look at Avsim where the majority of uploads is ALWAYS FS9, that should tell you something - and I consider those guys die hards. Meanwhile, I have not heard one peep about this revolutionary new MS Flight - sounds like a flop to me.

I have already decided FSX is my old man's ship in a bottle. I am currently customizing my local scenery to good effect and perhaps I will share it with you guys if I decide to sell it ;>

If I just upload it to Avsim I will tell you in a comment."
,Jimstalk,2011-03-25T10:02Z,"@aarque

I hope youre from greece.I dont know why but greece has one of the most beautiful sceneries all over the world but none has reclaimed that(except from aerosoft).Eleytherios Venizelos airport(athens international LGAV) is one of the newest and busiest airports in europe but for some reason none made a payware or EVEN A FREEWARE addon for this airport......It would be a good idea if you could send me a video or even instructions in order to give me a quick view of scenery modding.Im interested in making a scenery for LGAV, so please tell me what i need (i know its difficult but i already have some expierience with scenery modding).I can also provide aerial photos from the airport as long as im a pilot.If someone knows how to create scenery ill give him photos from the whole airport

,Jimstalk,2011-03-25T11:43Z,"Btw the upcoming MS flight will be garbage.It may have awesome graphics but the gameplay will be a mess.Here's why:

Firstly the ACES team (which successfully developed all the FS series) left microsoft.

The realism level will be reduced to 65% (the game will look like blazing angels)

As you've noticed it wont be a simulator anymore (Microsoft Flight and not Microsoft Flight simulator 11).We all know that the majority of customers who buy electronic games are kids thatswhy they decided to make a game which would attract more kids=more money.


FSX is a game with many bugs like the OOM issues or those annoying messages like ""a fatal error occurred"" etc. but on the other hand addons like FSUIPC ,AIRAC cycle and Real environment xtreme have made it AMAZING!!!"

,aarque,2011-03-28T12:36Z,"Jim,
 There is some excellent freeware Greece scenery, you should visit http://www.greekairportsproject.gr/. Currently their bandwidth is capped, but I have downloaded gigabytes from them. You want to carefully peruse the HAS section. It is described as FS2004 but if you read carefully, the scenery has been tested in both.
Angelo Tassoglou is the name you want to search at Avsim, he uploaded several gig's of photographic Athens. For a decent LGAV you want to search this guy: Moraitis Vaggelis.

,aarque,2011-03-28T12:41Z,"ok, my last comment was blocked with a database error, which means it has a word or URL from the TPB black list so I broke it down in pieces, the first above. Next piece:

I can walk you through photo scenery compiling, airport layout and some rudimentary building creation, but I won't put any direct contact at TPB so write your email or something...I can't believe you're Jason Voorhees btw. "
,aarque,2011-03-28T12:45Z,"ok, the last piece had cautions about posting internet mail addresses online and that was probably what got blocked. You have to remember to replace symbols like the ""at"" and the period with the words for them to hide the address from spambots. I also wrote to keep trying because I just checked this torrent on a whim - this kid is really full of himself making appeals to admins, got a lot to learn - anyway I may not come back here because the raw noobish is a little distressing to my jaded sensibilities. I will save and re-post this note if it looks like you didn't see it."
