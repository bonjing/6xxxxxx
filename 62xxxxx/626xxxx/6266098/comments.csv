,sarsapil,2011-03-23T23:10Z,"At least you have to concede that the crazy murderous bugger wrote everything he was going to do... and did it !!  Heil Bohemian corporal  Schickelgruber !  It's the krauts' fault that they believed it and did all they did without hesitation.
The paid dearly for it..."
[T],Valdo__PT,2011-03-23T23:10Z,Thumbs up @Tattybogle....
,ProjektFUbaR,2011-03-24T08:42Z,"Alright guys, save the trollish and argumentative comments.

Maybe there is a place to debate this sort of thing, but it's definitely not here!!
It's a book, calling it a murderer isn't going to make it go away. ;)"
,sarsapil,2011-03-24T16:38Z,"""If not for him, the jew would have destroyed Germany"" !!!! CRAZY 'logic'... BECAUSE of Hitler and what he did, Germany ended up in ruins... Are all of you people so blind to reality?"
,sarsapil,2011-03-25T05:25Z,"""You are OBVIOUSLY too stupid to understand the quote"", LOL, and you neonazis are SO IGNORANT that don't know Germany could get up after the war THROUGH ZILLIONS OF US MONEY (Marshall Plan), from the so-called country 'ruined' by jews... Keep on writing, it's like those who bait the village idiot to have fun at his expense, you are and your retarded comrades are so, so funny..."
,ProjektFUbaR,2011-05-02T04:53Z,"Wow, okay, this book has nothing to do with Germany getting up after the war.
90% of your guys' supposed logic has nothing to do with the download and are for the most part, inaccurate.
""from the so-called country 'ruined' by Jews"" Who said anything about Marshall Plan?

I can talk in random sentences too about past events in history that have nothing to do with the topic.

What is a ""neonazi""? Where does anyone get neo-Nazi from this download? Does anyone even know what the word neo-Nazi means? No?
What is the point of arguing over a download- and arguing about points that have nothing to do with the download, at that?"
,sarsapil,2011-05-06T21:05Z,".... Because an innocent download of a book because of its contents and the ignorance of many young ones of what it meant, can lead to apology of a murderous ideology some (very few) try to revive nowadays. So, some comments warn the reader of what the book conveys... Nothing wrong there."
,ProjektFUbaR,2011-06-24T14:44Z,"The book doesn't convey anything about murder or killing innocents, had you read it you would know that.

You know, a lot of people look at it and see that the author is Hitler and they say ""OMG it's about killing Jews!"" when in reality there is a very small portion of the book that even mentions Jews and religion in general. That is literally judging the book by it's cover."
