,BigDaddyDawg1899,2011-04-20T04:15Z,Play with VLC and use J and K to slow down or speed up the audio. That should fix it

Subtitles Translation:2
Movie:8

The worst subtitles and audio sync I have seen in a long time.  I spent the first 10 minutes just trying to get the audio to sync up properly.  Audio is a major player in creating an atmosphere for a scary movie.  One thump out of sequence and you lose the scare factor.  So after the audio sync was fixed -I then got bombarded with horrible Japanese-to-English translations.   At one point someone is asking one of the girls if she feels the presence of a spirit in the room, which got translated into â€œ-Do something Videsh?  Here, something to eat?â€  Endless mistakes in the translation makes for some confusing conversations between the characters.  For instance, when the sister is telling the brother not to have a video camera set up in her room, she says stuff like â€œDonâ€™t rent my room!  Promise me you wonâ€™t rent my room.â€
I feel like having to watch it with these horrible subs- that I cheated myself out of a good movie.  I felt it was a great movie in comparison to the other paranormal activities.  If you like the PA movies then you will definitely enjoy this movie.   As it has that scare vibe that only the Asians know how to pull off in a grand fashion.   So a Paranormal highbred if you will.
My advice is to wait for a better copy with better audio and subs.

Cheers."
