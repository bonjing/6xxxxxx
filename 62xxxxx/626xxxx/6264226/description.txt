Notes: First of this is the japanese sequel. They made 2 sequels. This is a totaly different movie. Because it is made in japan, the movie is in japanese ( duh ) but i managed to get a set of fan made subs and resynced/reworked them entirley. There not the best subs on the planet but its def more than watchable, lol. Best there is atm im afraid. I believe it was a set taken from a russian cam and translated to english.
