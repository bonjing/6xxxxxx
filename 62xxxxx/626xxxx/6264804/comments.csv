I stand by them and yet I apoligize for my tone and the distraction it may have caused from what I was trying to do. I believe very much ion what I posted on my Blog and I do not regret it, but my tone was not needed. But in something just recently I lost most support in seeding these and readers on the Blog shortly after a poster on Craig's list recommended to me that I do as my friend did and kill myself. I hope whatever turned people off, does not continue. What happened happened despite my continued difficulties with God. And I was merely trying to work through them on my my Blog. I should not have distracted things from Eddie though. Thank you for those who continue to seed these for me still."
