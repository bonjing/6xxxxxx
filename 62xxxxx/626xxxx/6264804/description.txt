Now then....I dreamt a few nights ago of playing a baby grand at the edge of the ocean on a wooden deck over looking the ocean.

Beware...I still do not know how to edit...there is a point about 2 min in or two points maybe when I attack a nat flying around my face and the keyboard and I strike the keys real hard....:)

I am getting much better now...but there are sections were I am just trying to work out some memories of how to play changing keys and the circle of fifths and such. I see at least someone seeding these still. Thank you.

And I like to play with dissonance and then trying to resolve that into the next chord and then back again. I am getting closer to working with that.
