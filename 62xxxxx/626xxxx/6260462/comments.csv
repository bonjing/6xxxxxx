,hazeleyedpowell,2011-03-27T01:05Z,illl seed if u seed since there are no seeders
,redneck_gamer,2011-03-28T02:11Z,"I've got all 8 of them downloading and will be seeding all of them, thanks for the uploads!"
,sgfreak37,2011-04-05T13:14Z,"I would seed, if I could download it in the first place."
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-04-05T13:50Z,"Your Welcome, I'm currently seeding everything I have, but I will put this at the top :)"
,g00ber510,2011-04-07T09:04Z,"You can have my axe!

Thanks man! Downloading all 8 and promise to seed like crazy."
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-04-09T04:39Z,"Seeding should work better for all of my torrents now, because until I get more seeders, I am leaving my PC on, and uTorrent automatically puts the torrent with the highest demand as the first priority. But please still seed, it will help...everyone out"
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-04-10T04:26Z,"If I get at least 6 seeders on each of the seasons, I will upload DVD quality of seasons 1-3, I also have DVD quality of 4-5, I will upload those, as soon as I get sufficient seeders for the first 3 DVD quality seasons."
,g00ber510,2011-04-13T02:22Z,"I am waiting to help seed.
Season 1 stuck at 4.75%
2 at 3.96%
3 at 8.9%
4 at 2.85%
5 at 3.49%
6 at 11.73%
7 at 10.51%
8 at 1.84%"
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-04-16T04:57Z,"Thanks for letting me know, I am trying my best, I still don't get why the only torrent everyone seeded on to start with was Halo 1"
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-04-16T04:59Z,Let me know when things change
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-05-13T03:55Z,"@ g00ber510

How are the downloads going now?
You should have seasons 1-5 completed, 6-8 I am getting re-seeded. Season 6 should be downloadable by tomorrow."
,vikingspirit,2011-05-18T00:39Z,"Can someone seed so we can get it all? stuck at 34,8%
I will seed so people don't get stuck"
,madhatter223,2011-05-19T23:08Z,Guys I will seed when it finishes downloading I will seed FOREVER!
,madhatter223,2011-05-19T23:11Z,and can anyone tell me what a leecher is?
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-05-22T08:45Z,"I am trying my best to seed this one, all the other seasons are completely downloadable. This one should be up soon. Sorry for the inconvenience.

@ madhatter223, a leecher is someone who doesn't seed, leeching is basically downloading something, and immediately quitting out, therefore not helping seed for other people, seeding keeps the download alive, and allows other people to get it. Leechers eventually ruin a torrent."
,lonelyisland1,2011-05-23T15:37Z,ill seed alot literally all day and night  
,SteampunkMD,2011-05-24T11:19Z,theres a repeat of ep1 about 56 mins in
,XRabie13,2011-05-26T00:28Z,"I'm new to the site, so how do you seed, there seems to be a need for seeding on everything, but how do you seed it. I'll be glad to seed if you explain how."
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-05-27T07:54Z,"@ XRabie13

To seed, just simply leave the download running after it reaches 100%, it automatically starts to seed"
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-05-27T07:54Z,"Finally all the series have been sufficiently seeded, I have uploaded Season 1 on DVD already, it is a complete DVD rip."
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-06-07T07:12Z,"@ steampunkMD, thanks for your input, I'm not being sarcastic, I couldn't figure out which season I uploaded had a repeat of episode 1, thanks for also pointing out that I missed episode 100 in season 5, kinda messed that one up. When I upload DvD quality of the seasons, the mistakes of quality, and random missing episodes or repeats will disappear.  "
,Russellonfire,2011-06-14T10:40Z,"Wtf? In mine there is no audio. Video is fine, but no sound whatsoever. It's not the speakers, cos I was just playing something through them."
,Noximillien,2011-07-10T17:50Z,"When internet gets up again back home Ill seed for around a week.
Yay RvB."
,xXBluRXx,2011-08-21T09:00Z,why the fuck does the first episode play again a little after an hour in?
,xXBluRXx,2011-08-21T09:03Z,I think maybe instead of putting the 11 episode in you put in the first one again
,xXBluRXx,2011-08-21T09:06Z,actually i think it's episode 12 thats missing
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-08-31T22:13Z,"@xXBluRXx.  Thankyou for that. If you want me to I will upload episode 11 and 12 individually. Then all you would have to do is download videopad, which is on my page, and replace the episode 1 with the correct video."
,sensory,2011-11-04T00:00Z,"Please, PLEASE don't put all the episodes into one MP4 and then package that into a rar. Unless I'm watching these back to back this is the worst way to watch something."
,Evardestroy,2011-11-26T02:22Z,"PleasePleasePleasePleasePleasePleasePleasePleasePleasePleasePleasePleasePleasePleasePleasePleasePlease upload season 9 Complete, you legend :)"
,RvBcder,2012-06-07T08:04Z,Currently downloading S 6-8 and when done I will seed 4 ever...cause i am the RvBcder
