Flairck is a Dutch musical ensemble formed in 1978 around guitar virtuoso Erik Visser.[1] The group has varying members dependent on the project. Their musical style is a blend of folk music, jazz and classical chamber music, with touches of blues. The music written by the members of the ensemble is often centred on an album theme and is played with a wide variety of acoustic instruments.

The name of the band is an original composition, coming from the English word 'flair' and the Dutch word 'vlerk', which means 'a nimble fingered hand' or 'wing', but also 'rowdy young man'.


After two years of preparation Flairck released its first album in 1978. "Variations on a Lady" went platinum in the Netherlands and received three awards including an Edison.
