             The Sims Medieval is a brand-new direction for the popular   
             single player Simulation game franchise, as the familiar     
             gameplay mechanics of The Sims are blended with light        
             Role-Playing (RPG) elements in a Medieval European setting.  
             In this new incarnation PC and Mac players must both assure  
             the happiness of their Sims on a day-to-day level, as well   
             as support the aims of the kingdom they build and engage in  
             all manner of quests which Sims can take on singularly and   
             in groups up to three. New features include: a wide range    
             of available Sims hero types associated with buildings       
             constructed, each with a fatal flaw to overcome;             
             a leveling system for characters based in replayable         
             quests; and an overall player-chosen goal for kingdoms.
