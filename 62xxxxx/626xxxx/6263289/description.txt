Hal,
 
I feel absolutely terrible telling you this so soon after you prepared the torrent, but earlier today a color problem was revealed in the opening titles. It is easy to miss because it occurs during the dark starfield pan, but when it is visible on certain displays, it is a mess!
 
I have already begun re-encoding all three versions of the movie (AVI, MKV and DVD). If you are still the only seeder, it might be prudent to cancel the torrent until I can upload a replacement. Otherwise, there\\\\\\\'s going to be a lot of confused and disappointed downloaders.
 
I am so sorry for this snag; and I am very appreciative of your efforts to share the work with the torrent community.

Sorry about this. I have deleted the torrent with the defective file, and ASAP will upload the corrected file torrent.
