Description: 
In the second of this series on the history of work, Kirsty 
Young looks at the years in which the post-war baby 
boom generation joined the workforce, from the buoyant 
optimism of the 60s to the union versus management 
conflicts of the 70s.The programme combines first hand 
recollection from workers with colourful comedy, drama 
and documentary archive from the period. While work 
was often divided between them and us, it was also a 
time when managers were getting sharper, women were 
given more responsibility and lots of people were making 
real money.
