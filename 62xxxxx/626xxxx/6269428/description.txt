This is a short, spur-of-the moment collaborative album between Bjork and The Dirty Projectors released in 2010. The songs were written by David Longstreth, the Dirty Projectors' lead singer, and inspired by Mount Wittenberg in California.

I think it deserves a wider audience, so I'm posting it. However, please consider that this was a benefit album for the National Geographic Society Oceans Initiatives. 100% of the profits from the album go to this fund.

I made a small donation and I encourage you to do the same if you download this. The purpose is to preserve vital habitats such as the coast off Mount Wittenberg, or, in Longstreth's words, "so the oceans don't wind up like a giant poisonous corpse hugging the continents."

Here is the link to donate:

There is a minimum of $5 (US). The band asks for $7 on the official site. I think this is reasonable.
