Although one of the most common mental disorders, depression can be an obscure illness. People keep their depression secret, doctors and patients have a hard time recognizing it, the cause is unknown, treatment is viewed with suspicion, and other conditions are given higher priority. However, once you know the right questions to ask and the correct manner in which to ask them, diagnosis and treatment is easy. An Atlas of Depression presents a thorough graphical review of the diagnosis, management, and treatment of affective or "mood" disorders. The book contains approximately 120 color illustrations, an appendix of useful links, bibliographical references, and an index.
