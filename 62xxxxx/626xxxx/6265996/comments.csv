,Marcel7,2011-03-23T20:44Z,dvdrip?? Cool
,fran0477,2011-03-23T20:47Z,This is a different movie than Battle Los Angeles.  Battle Los Angeles is the Hollywood release you're probably looking for.  This is a lower budget movie.
,boris1981,2011-03-23T20:54Z,"This is NOT the resent film from the cinema with Aaron Eckhart as the main lead (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1217613/ ) 

This is a b budget movie taken from the film."
,davenez,2011-03-23T20:57Z,not the movie thats at pics www.imdb.com/title/tt1758570/

,nick.nider,2011-03-24T00:41Z,"ATTENTION! This is the worst acting, effects and script i ever seen, even catastrophic for scifi production. Avoid this moive at all cost!!!!"

,QborT,2011-03-24T15:39Z,"Bwahahahah look at how many people didn't read the description and just downloaded this (literally thousands).  

Too fucking funny, stupid novice downloaders need to learn to read better."

,xBSAACHRIS434x,2011-03-24T15:54Z,"Holy shit this movie sucks it's been a while since I was so bored half way through a sci-fi film that I skipped to the end.... 

A10/V10/M1

Thanks for the up TvTeam but this movie is terrible."
,catamaranman,2011-03-26T22:37Z,"Yeah, it was released in February this year on SyFy.  Two days later the DVD was on the shelves.  No doubt trying to trick people into buying thinking it is the big-budget version.  I'll put this in the trash along with ""Transmorphers"", ""Snakes on a Train"", ""AVH:Alien vs. Hunter"" and ""The DiVinci Treasure""....all made by the same studio."
,edium,2011-03-26T23:10Z,"i loled. this is a great movie and it is not even good. there are people who burnt this to a disc without watching it and sold it today: wow.

this movie does have a really hot sex scene though. "
,stonelesscutter,2011-03-27T03:15Z,"It's an Asylum movie.
Those are always crap.
They pissed me off inmensely before when they tried to piggyback on the 2012 hype.
Apparently that's all they do.
Try to gain attention and profit from other peoples creations."
,NuSeble,2011-03-27T14:55Z,"Did you guys not see what TvTeam wrote for the Release Notes? 

"" Just for the Lolz Enjoy :D "" 

Read, its your own stupidity that thought this was the real thing. 

TvTeam, as always. Thank you for the Up"
,sahanpc,2011-03-27T15:25Z,don't download it. itz really baby movie.. yak. 
,mamayr,2011-03-27T21:49Z,Just realize that I should read comments before download anything.
,kukul,2011-03-28T00:55Z,"Hahahaha

I didn't know movies have cheap knock offs too.
This is some serious trolling."
,TheBoxNinja,2011-03-28T07:09Z,There are some movies you just have to download BECAUSE it got a 1.9 on imdb.
,born2b,2011-03-28T07:58Z,"Ååå... i thouth it was Battle Los Angelse... this is battle OF los angeles... A cheep ripoff!

,ILOVEFIGSNEWTONS,2011-03-29T09:33Z,"O...M....G

This MOVIE WAS SO BORING, I FEEL ASLEEP ON MYKEYBOARD"
,aspenk8,2011-03-29T15:01Z,"This is  FAKE! The fact that the uploader put ""2011"" means he is intentionally confusing people.

FAKE! FAKE! FAKE!"
,Dantheman420,2011-03-30T00:57Z,"@aspenk8 

YOUR a moron...
this movie may not be the one you think it is, but that dosen't change the fact that u are some form of mutant retard that dosen't know how to read but still manages to stumble and blunder his way around the NET.

this is a REAL movie, but not the big hollywood movie, but then again it never claims to be

REAL REAL REAL REAL REAL REAL REAL REAL REAL REAL REAL REAL REAL REAL REAL REAL"
,ConeBone,2011-03-30T07:23Z,"@Dantheman..

you made the classic internet rage error. getting all too excited to call somebody out you misspell while calling somebody a moron. It's ""you're a moron.. not ""your"". as in ""you are"". I usually don't play the role of grammar police but I see this all the time when somebody tries to call somebody else stupid.. at least spell it right when you're going to try and make fun of somebody else. "
,AshardAsNails,2011-03-31T01:56Z,"TvTeam yeah right! a bunch of transvestite wannabie hacks!!! Just goes to show 6000 users don't read the comments before downloading! FAKE! FAKE! FAKE! FAKE! FAKE!

,amfefe925,2011-03-31T08:23Z,this is shit whats the password?
,martin13564,2011-03-31T12:38Z,"hi, for all you idiots screaming out fake fake fake, if you had of taken the time to check out the imdb link you would have seen the movies description and i agree with conebone re all these idots that call ppl idiots when they blatantly show their own stupidity by not even being able to spell an insult correctly, learn to read and write first.

There is an old saying which goes like this......... better to shut your mouth and have the world think you are an idiot than to open your mouth and confirm it"
,aleckto1980,2011-03-31T13:14Z,"@Aspenk8

Both films were released in 2011

@Dantheman420

I totally agree

@conebone

I'm sorry if your grasp of English is so terrible you cant comprehend anything short of flawless punctuation and spelling. English is a bastardized language heavily reliant on colloquialism and slang. Almost every word we use is a shortened (and often misspelled) derivative of some other word.

P.S first word of a new sentence usually starts with a capital. =D

In short spelling Nazi's are the most fail form of troll imo"
,tmobas,2011-03-31T19:01Z,"ha ha ha why didn't anyone who dl'd this just check out the link in the download description, easy peasy. ah you make me laugh :o)"
,saifullahraza,2011-03-31T21:03Z,"haha damn you people

,thagerman,2011-04-01T02:09Z,"HA, I like how this is on the top 100 of video downloads... goes to show how few people even bother to read the comments before downloading."
,artur.codrean,2011-04-01T02:59Z,fk you with this move TVTeam very NOOBS
,The3vilM0nk3y,2011-04-01T19:16Z,Don't Bother with this. nothing but crap. Very disappointing TvTeam. Why share such a crap movie.

,di0166,2011-04-02T02:11Z,new to the art of downloading. Want to help with seeds etc ..... How do I go about it ???
,madeinwales,2011-04-02T07:50Z,"I think people get the message by now , its not the one we think it is . I was gonnna DL it but read the comments :)  The ' of ' punctuation twigged me"
[V],Horrorspoke,2011-04-02T09:49Z,"It even says 'Store Date 23/3/2011' for god's sake! Surely people aren't stupid enough to think 'Battle LA' was in stores then are they?

READ the info people.... Its Just like downloading '27 Hours' and then complaining because it's not '28 Days Later'!

Good torrent, does exactly what it says on the tin - The only thing I agree with, is that the movie it rubbish lol."
,Edzone,2011-04-02T16:58Z,"Dear all retards who are saying things such as ""This movie is so gay and boring"", that's because this is a shitty rip off of the real thing, it's like the pathetic attempts of desperate money grabbers Asylum, who make such god awful embarrassments like ""Snakes on a Train"", ""Paranormal Entity"" and ""Transmorphers"". You cunts are more stupid than they are. But I still love you."

READ THE TITLE! IT'S NOT THE BIG BUDGET FLICK! IT'S THE BACKYARD VERSION!

BATTLE OF LOS ANGELES- BACKYARDER

BATTLE: LOS ANGELES- HIGH BUDGET!

For those who do not know the definition of ""Backyarder"" it is a low budget film that looks like it was made in the directors back yard."
