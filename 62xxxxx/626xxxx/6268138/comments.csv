,aemalkawi,2011-04-04T19:58Z,"since I'm a kung fu practitioner I have an interest in buddhism, and I found many moralities within it

however, I never believe or even respect lowering your head down to anyone except God who created you not the one you created,,,,I think if you use your mind enough you will never worship anything or anyone that is created even if he/it is stronger or bigger or .........

matter of mind usage .....

And thanks for the links too. Any guidance on my journey is welcome. :)
