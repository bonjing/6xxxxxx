,HackMaggoT,2011-06-06T08:10Z,"I do feel bad that people died and i really do wish that japan didn't half to suffer through that but when you consider karma after what they did at pearl harbor and that there killing an exceeding amount of whales in the southern sea and claiming it as ""scientific research""! Consider how much bad luck they put upon themselves, its my personal opinion that perhaps its the world and maybe even mother nature that's telling them there going to far with what there doing here on this planet! You know what they say, ""what goes around comes around!"
,HackMaggoT,2011-06-06T08:18Z,"And No I Do Not Believe That It Was Funny or a ""Joke but as someone who sides with the Sea Shepherds in there attempt to protect some of the oldest beings on this planet i am not to fond of Japan or what it is that they are doing in Antarctica! So as every retoric post on every website on the internet, I intend to respond to japan and take a tactical media attack at the homefront in the heart of america! "
,HackMaggoT,2011-06-06T08:45Z,"Please be advised as I do not wish to start an argument or make in any way a consensus that Japan may or may not have gotten what they deserved. All I am doing is making a post in my personal beliefs on this website. As The Pirate Bay Website in this particular forum is where I am starting my quest to in some way affect or maybe even make a holding argument against Japan! Feeling that this movie is the perfect relation with the current feud going on in the Southern Sea! As once again a movie of this particular relevance suggests Japan is doing something that is morally wrong. In the current for-instance to this movie a small fiber glass ship named ""Gojira"" roughly translated is Godzilla is making its way to stop the Japanese Whaling Manufacturer Ship, the NISSHIN MARU. I consider the irony of that a strongly support it, as I am 100% behind the Sea Shepherds and hope they once and for all stop Japan from making yet another continuing incident and an even bigger impact in the history of this world. Thank You for listening to my views and no matter what reply is given i will not respond for my opinion will not change based on others. "
