Politically provocative talk show host Bill Maher skewers the current state of organized religion in this hot-button documentary that derives its title from a blend of the words "religion" and "ridiculous." Making stops in Jerusalem, the Vatican and other holy destinations, Maher travels the world to talk to believers from a variety of faiths to find out why they're so sure their religion is right -- and why they're so certain others are wrong.
