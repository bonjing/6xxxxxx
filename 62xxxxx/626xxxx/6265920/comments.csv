,morgaesin,2011-03-24T01:43Z,This is just a recode of the mp3 version. It has the same glitch in track 6 as all the other versions currently on here.

,elektrostatisk,2011-03-24T11:13Z,"What´s the point of upload up-scaled mp3´s? If it´s done by lacking knowledge (ie believe that lost information can be  re-created)... it´s just a waste of bandwith.

If it is done by purpose I understand less, just make other feel cheated?

I realise that people are as different on the net as IRL, but what´s the point of cheating if you do not gain anything except negative comments?

,Smokechatter,2011-03-24T23:03Z,I'm not gonna arque here but this is a real FLAC recording off a test pressing CD. So if there are glitches or other faults so be it. Let's hope that the CD you will buy dont have them.
