@ rasputinho, Rebecca St. James' music is Christian and she is a strong and beautiful Christian musician, actress, and woman.  What would you expect for lyrics considering the title of this cd is ""I Will Praise You"" and then looking at the titles of the songs.  I think you just posted that to try and upset Christians and thats just weak.  By the way... There is a difference between being a Christian and a religion... Big difference between fundamentalists and Christ followers.  May you open your heart and find peace in our awesome and loving Savior, Jesus Christ!"
