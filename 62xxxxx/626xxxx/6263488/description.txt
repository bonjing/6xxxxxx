With so much focus now on minimal, progressive, tech
house, low bpm or whatever, 'We Love Trance' is a
bold statement But with a line up of big hitters
presenting a collection of scorching floorfillers
like this it has to be said
Compiled by Massive (Davina, late of Sirius Isness)
one of the top female trance DJ's in the world, this
is a selection of the all new main room killers she
has been playing across the globe in her amazing DJ
sets this summer.

With tracks from established masters
Kromeangels/Deedrah, XSI, Shanti, Massive and Bamboo
Forest, new guns District 42 and Creactive, and
remixes of 1200 Mics and 220V, this is a collection
sure to find favor in the sets of both full on trance
DJ's and even the more adventurous hard housers.

We would like to take the
opportunity to point out that psytrance
needs YOUR SUPPORT. We only want to
give you a preview in psytrance,
ambient and electronic music and
in our opinion this is absolutely
NO alternative to buying

MP3 isnt the same as holding a
bought record in your hands

You need to feel the bass to go with the
flow ... and that's what mp3 just can't
give you. So better get it in high
quality, while it's still available
and not soldout

Please support the artists and
especially smaller labels that make
it possible to enjoy the music you
seem to love that much

Our releases are for scene internal use so
KEEP THEM OFF P2P AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES

So much for now
meet ya  the next party ... somewhere

MYCEL - sending lamers to /dev/null since 2003

We bow our heads to our old friends.

Deep respect to you

Also we would like to greet all of the

still alive quality scenegroups/sceners

Ascii done with love to my lil d3vil
