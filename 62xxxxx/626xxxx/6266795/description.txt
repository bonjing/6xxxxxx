Garfunkel & Oates
All Over Your Face (2011)


Hailed by the Wall Street Journal as "the female Flight of the Conchords," Garfunkel & Oates is a comedy duo comprised of actresses Kate Micucci and Riki Lindhome. The project took root in 2007, when the two began composing songs to accompany one of Lindhome's short films, Imaginary Larry. Both actresses proved to be fairly adept musicians -- Lindhome (aka "Garfunkel") played guitar, while Micucci (aka "Oates") had studied classical piano as a child -- and the resulting music was light, melodic, and humorous. The two continued writing songs after completing the Imaginary Larry project, touching upon such time-honored subjects as the arrogance of pregnant women and the mating habits of ducks in the process. Their visibility increased when "Fuck You" was featured in an episode of Scrubs (albeit with a revised, expletive-free refrain) in February 2009, and they issued their first recording, Music Songs, later that year.
