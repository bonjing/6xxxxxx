Polish act APTEKA was founded in Gdynia, Poland in 1983, on the initiative of Jedrzeja "Kodyma" Kodymowski (vocals, guitar) and Macieja Blasiaka (vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards, trumpet). Until 1987 the band was only active as a live unit, with various other musicians participating on concert duties.
In 1987 Maciej Wanat (drums) joined the outfit, but just one year later the band was reduced to a duo, with Kodymowski and Wanat the only remaining members.
At the end of 1988 they decided to record an album, and in 1990 the debut album Big Noise was issued.
At that point in time Apteka had expanded it's line-up as well, with Janusz Sokolowski (guitars) and Martin Ciempiel (bass( joining the outfit.
This new line-up quickly hit the recording studio, and in 1992 Narkotyli was issued. One year later the cassette only album Urojonecatemiasta was issued as well, which eventually would see an official CD release 10 years later now dubbed Psychedelic Underground.
Apteka looked to be on the course of forming a nice career at that point, with a record deal with SPV and a stable line-up in place. But in 1993 drummer Wanat dies in a car crash, and the outfit folds.
One year later Kodymowski decides to reform the band though, and joined by Olaf Deriglasoff (bass) and Jacek Stromski (drums) Apteka is reborn, with the albums Menda in 1995 and Spirala in 1996 following suit. Shortly after the release of the latter Deriglasoff is out of the band though, and when no permanent replacement can be found Apteka folds for a second time in 1998.
But as the years go by Kodymowski decided to give the band another go again, and in 2007 former members Martin Ciempiel (bass) and Arthur Hajdasz (drums) hooks up with him, resulting in the self-titled album Apteka issued the same year. This line-up folds shortly after the album is issued though, and when the band performs live later this year Kodymowski has brought in two new members - Janek Witaszek (bass) and Marcin Slominski (drums).
