,manjulh,2011-07-16T19:27Z,"Hi YIFI, by any chance can you pls do Midnight in Paris92011) please..."
,ItsNotPro,2011-07-24T07:45Z,"Quality is very pixelated. No wonder its 550 MB. Oh well, I'l download a different one."
,ptsk8fx,2011-08-02T20:52Z,"it feels like its been upscaled from DVD, very pixalated, its hard to compress HD to a 500 mb container?"
,fofo141,2011-08-19T04:23Z,Thank you so much YIFY
,Browse.Torrents,2011-10-27T19:51Z,Thanks...
,rikurakutaa,2011-11-25T16:27Z,"yeah, this is either an upscale or bad attempt to make small file size vid, but this looks horrible even on 19"" screen so I think this is too compressed.
Audio is great though."
,pracos,2011-12-23T19:09Z,tnx YIFY u r the man
,torrtruk,2011-12-24T23:22Z,"@YIFY you rock as usual! Thanks and wish you a very good new year ahead!
@xwusv while i can understand your suggestion, it'd be an ingratitude to strip off the credits section. After all, we're downloading a copyrighted movie. Not meant to be offensive, anyway."
,miracleminded,2012-03-26T11:02Z,"thanks!
Good copy - played well on wmp"
,okultus,2012-04-30T23:00Z,"@xwusv - I vote to keep the credits, I often like the reference information, especially in soundtrack use. 

Thanks for upload YIFY!"
