I enjoyed downloading from u when ur movies were less than 2 gig
lately i haven't been downloading ur movies because i get capped and seeding for a few days just isn't worth it for me anymore

I've always tried to keep loyal when I download and seed but more than 2 gig a movie is to much for me :("
