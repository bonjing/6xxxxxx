,sonaro,2011-03-22T16:14Z,"This show is so good!  Finally a Sci Fi series based on character development and not the ""alien of the week.""  I'm going to be so pissed when it ends abruptly after this season."

,K6FF9,2011-03-22T22:53Z,Tnx EZTV - you're easily the best and most dedicated uploader I've ever come across. I've been downloading your stuff for years now but never stopped to say thanks but you deserve it so - thank you very much man.

,pimpmobile,2011-04-07T05:46Z,I can't wait for this show to become canceled then maybe they will play something not retarded!  Why couldn't they make Atlantis 10 seasons like SG1!  As for those who enjoy this crap go watch days of our lives or some other soap leave the sci fi to the people who like good stuff!
,TorrentTimUK,2011-06-04T21:15Z,Thanks
