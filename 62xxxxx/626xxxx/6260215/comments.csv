,jh5637,2011-08-01T16:16Z,Ummm....so is this any good? I thought the point of these comments was to give opinion of quality of content not the ideals behind it.....
,Sanyi001,2011-08-18T19:55Z,"no political ideal is good when it is extreme. Not the extreme left of a North Korea, nor the extreme right of a Nazi Germany. 
But when people are suffering from the machinations of, let's say, the far right of Conservative America, you can only fight by going to other side. 
Che wasn't a politician who sought to be a dictator, he was a freedom fighter who sought to destroy oppressions. 
He succeeded somewhat; the aggressive US policy into South America of the 1950's+/- have long been reduced. The result: The United States itself has been forced to subjugate its own people instead and has become the Banana Republic that South America once was in terms of extreme inequality and plummeting wages/earnings for the middle and lower classes.
