Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life: Che Guevara was a dashing rebel whose epic dream was to end poverty and injustice in Latin America and the developing world through armed revolution. Jon Lee Anderson traces Che's extraordinary life from his comfortable Argentine upbringing to the battlefields of the Cuban revolution, from the halls of power in Castro's government to his failed campaign in the Congo and his assassination in the Bolivian jungle. Meticulously researched and full of exclusive information, this work illuminates as never before the mythic figure who embodied the high-water mark of revolutionary communism as a force in history.
