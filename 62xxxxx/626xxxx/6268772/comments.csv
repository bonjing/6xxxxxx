Being a long time!
i have a request...
if im not asking too much i want to try your [[experimental]].bat profile (would be nice if you put it into your Daily TV Pack )
i have being trying main@L3.0 and L4.1? just want to see what changes on your [[expiremental]] high@L4.1
main@L4.1 works perfectly on my HTC Desire.[thanks :)]
by any chances you have more [[experimental]] i would loved it

thanks
:)"
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-24T22:19Z,"@houruoha: It was experimental for few days only and after confirmations become - what you see now, as my mainline. So, do avinaptic on any newer encode and you will have ALL encoding parameters nicely lined-up, then just transcribe them in command line or profile of program you currently use for encoding."

[V],twentyforty,2011-03-25T10:35Z,"@houruoha: 
-""x264 [error]: can't open file '0'= error in command-line. 
1. Usually happens when some new x264 parameter (which is new to old revisions of x264) is in the command line and encoder do not know what to do about. My new .bat use few new parameters and old program now shit about those. New .bat implies use of new program in latest .rar I posted here for Melanie.
2. possibility is that you made plain typo in command-line OR have line wraps. Disable Word-wrap and re-check it.

-""Exiting...
Error importing Sample.1.mov.264: BitStream Not Compliant""""= ... well, of course it's invalid, it's shit (nothing) and muxer refuse to import Garbage, because in previous step video encoding errored out. "
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-25T11:08Z,"@houruoha: In TV pack today. Switch the brain in turbo mode, tough."

ok i ll give it a try
thanks
:)"
[V],twentyforty,2011-03-25T12:16Z,"""I'll give it try"" sounds like ""Your shuffled it down my throat and I decided that something you forced on me probably is bad, but I would see"". Forgetting that he - if he can help yourself wouldn't be asking for help anyway.

Nothing personal, but another stupid English phrase/double-talk 'par excellance' used by many people not thinking straight  and using language 'without thinking'. Errors they made keep surprising them, as came from nowhere - ""How to fuck that happened?"".

On any other language it is well placed insult, childishly masqueraded/wrapped - in fact a try to change the places of someone who asked for favor and the one who has been asked, and when is given, that way recipient regains some imaginary supreme position.

Funny. Sad. Stupid.

We choose the words. Or use it as plain as possible, simple structures, no phrasing at all."
