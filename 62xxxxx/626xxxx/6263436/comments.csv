,TythorZeth,2011-10-09T16:33Z,"Like it is shown in the title of the torrent, these are hardcoded subtitles. This means that they are burned into the video, thus making it impossible to remove them. If you do not want to watch these episodes with English subtitles, you should look for an alternative like http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5907112. Those Polish subtitles are not hardcoded and can therefore be turned off easily."
