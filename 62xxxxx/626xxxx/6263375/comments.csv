Video and audio are great except for one problem.

During the movie there were spots that had strange glitches. Almost like a repetition for a split second. I tried to reproduce some of the glitches after seeing them the first time. I was successful. 

I'm using the most up to date VLC so I don't think it's a codec problem."
