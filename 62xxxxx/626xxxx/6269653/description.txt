Theres several things here.

The generic video. There is also an edited soundtrack in MP3 form, 40 tracks, plus the unabridged audio from the video, track 41.

If you don't like the way I edited the soundtrack down, I encourage you to get audacity or garageband, or whatever the hell you want, and do it better yourself.

Cheers.
