CM8 Doing It Right The First Time 

Sources
Video: Russian avi
Audio: Imagines Line + bobwhiteÃ‚Â´s sync
thx

Encode: well was a lot of work, russian video still had some rest of interlace in it which i removed, corrected the aspect.
full video is there nothing is cut at the beginning. since there is russian "voice over" within that first 2 mins, which are not needed i did a audio looping in that time.
The 2 actual spoken sentences in that time is the actor saying "i got in this mess, i will tell you now the story how it happened". so nothing big its selfexplaining
added brightness,contrast,rgb,sharpen,denoise.
I took bobwhiteÃ‚Â´s synced line which fitted perfectly.
thx again bobwhite, couldnÃ‚Â´t have done it without you. (you did a nice video too btw. :=) )
enjoy a full nice version!
