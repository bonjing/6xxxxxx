,Zegunda,2011-03-22T19:15Z,@dncc - Download and use ConvertXtoDVD instead of whatever video converter you've been using.  You can find ConvertXtoDVD here on The Pirate Bay.
,1stWayne,2011-03-22T19:21Z,good quality
,cigaretteburns,2011-03-23T14:28Z,Thank the Gods for 1stWayne the ONLY person to make a genuine comment about the quality of this torrent (dncc has copy and pasted his comments on to ALL versions of this movie on TPB). PLEASE PEOPLE ONLY COMMENTS ON A/V QUALITY - NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOUR OPINION OF MOVIES!

,edudias,2011-04-10T01:50Z,"I really would like to understand what are the parameters that people are using to rate this as 9 or 9.5.

9-9.5 -> HD"
,zebedy212,2011-04-18T22:36Z,'edudias' why don't you rate it then instead of judging others!
,rastas959,2011-05-17T10:57Z,"@dncc

Do you know what file format ur dvdplayer supports?

and have you tried to convert the dl'd movies to that format?"
