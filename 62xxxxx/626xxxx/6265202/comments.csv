,vliegtuig,2011-03-26T01:54Z,"No ""crablouse"" in here?"
[T],locobot12,2011-03-26T13:01Z,"@vliegtuig

I thought the same thing when i saw the tracklist ! 

I even thought of adding crablouse track myself before sharing but later decided not to.

They should have included the track!"
,casan0vax,2011-03-26T21:30Z,"Nice upload! Loved the movie. 

Just to answer your question vliegtuig, the reason ""Crablouse"" isn't on the soundtrack is because it was used for the trailer, not the actual film - Snyder actually has no part in the trailer cuts, they're made by a separate company that specializes in the cutting and distribution of movie trailers, so it's not officially part of the Sucker Punch soundtrack. This is the same reason that ""Panic Switch"" by Silversun Pickups isn't on the soundtrack either (which is also an awesome song!)."
,Ulyssej,2011-03-27T00:58Z,This soundtrack is so badass 
,alicedowntherabbithole,2011-03-27T21:45Z,Thank you very much

,ZenRhino,2011-04-04T05:21Z,"Those other songs you mentioned are what's called the ""score"" of the movie... and this what Wikipedia lists as those songs:

Tyler Bates (who composed all of Snyder's previous live-action films) and Marius de Vries (who composed the score for the film Moulin Rouge!) wrote the score for Sucker Punch. The official trailers contain samples from the songs ""Prologue"" by Immediate Music, ""Crablouse"" by Lords of Acid, ""When the Levee Breaks"" by Led Zeppelin, ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" by The Beatles, ""And Your World Will Burn"" by Cliff Lin, and ""Panic Switch"" by the Silversun Pickups.
They'll probably be released soon as an official score of the film."

,Harkken,2011-04-19T13:18Z,I would recommend NOT downloading this or any of the sucker punch videos.  I had t reactivate my internet because it was banned temporarily for copyright infringement. 
,Richard71990,2011-05-08T21:56Z,"Torrent works fine, for extra songs check the comments..."

,erikjen1,2011-05-25T19:44Z,Thank You! Seeding......
,exodus67,2011-06-19T03:55Z,"listenherenow, You are a moron. If you bothered to watch the film you would see how the alternative version of Sweet Dreams works really well. The original is a classic though not suited here.
Nobody's ""got away"" with anything. It will all have been agreed with the artists, writers etc."
,Johnpfw,2011-06-21T20:47Z,"Thanks for up locobot.
Also, thanks for the info regarding the music from the trailer - that would have driven me crazy if you hadn't explained.
And thanks for 320kbps !!!
Why people bother to upload in 128kbps is beyond me!
Did I mention thanks?"
,gaaraisgod,2011-06-24T15:45Z,"This is the one thing about the movie that I have no complaints about.

Thank You!"
,Deznaj,2011-06-27T21:58Z,"@exodus67

He's a moron for having an opinion?

In that case, let me write my opinion about you: I think you are a dumb f*ck who is too lazy to look for an original name. What, where the other 66 ""exodus""es taken? Or are you born in 1967, which would make the name relevant but also very very sad since you are an old man who still trolls the internet.

Exodus outta here you twat! Now THAT is an opinion!"

,Lenny9,2011-07-04T00:03Z,"He's a moron for having a moronic opinion, for not being able to write without making a dozen mistakes, and for not making sense. So are you Denjeywhateverthefuck and anyone else defending such idiots.

Soundtrack is one of the best of all time for sure, big thanks to the uploader!"
