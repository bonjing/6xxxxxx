Screaming Bloody Murder, which opens up a second decade
for Sum 41 on Island Records, marks the first album to be
fully self-produced Sum 41's Deryck Whibley. The two-time
JUNO Award-winning Canadian band is: Deryck Whibley (lead
vocals, guitar, keyboard/piano), Tom Thacker (lead guitar,
vocals), Cone McCaslin (bass, vocals), and Steve Jocz
(drums, vocals).

Screaming Bloody Murder follows-up Underclass Hero,
released July 2007. In the interim, Sum 41 issued their
first career-spanning collection, All the Good Shit: 14
Solid Gold Hits 2000-2008. It compiled singles from their
debut mini-album Half Hour Of Power (2000), and all four
of their full-length studio albums: All Killer No Filler
(2001), Does This Look Infected? (2002), Chuck (2004), and
Underclass Hero (2007). Also featured on All the Good Shit
is one previously unreleased track ("Always"), and live
performances of two favorites, "The Hell Song" and
"Motivation," both also included in studio versions.
