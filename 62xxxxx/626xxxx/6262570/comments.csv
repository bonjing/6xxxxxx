,l2s_rg,2011-04-04T00:57Z,"the last disk says 5 to 6 on the dvd ,,thats the way it was ,,i did make 1 mistake..on roots next generation i had to rip episode 7 and will be uploaded tomorrow"
,iriecsson,2011-04-04T04:05Z,"Thank you for replying! Unfortunately though, disc 5-6 is not the end of the series, its missing an episode. I have tried a couple of the other ""disc 6 of 6"" torrents available, but no luck so far. So I'm hoping that another downloader has had the same issue before, and know's what torrent completes the series? Please! Im desperate, Been watching 7.5 hours and slavery is not abolished yet! :-)    "
,iriecsson,2011-04-04T09:40Z,"after the 3rd try i found it, this is the torrent to complete the series: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3928687/Roots_25th_Anniversary_Edition_Part6of6__D_

,argonunya,2011-05-01T09:30Z,"Thanks to the uploader.

@monday89 could you please kiss my fuckin' ass?!!!  goddamn whiner."
,LakersCentral,2011-07-23T16:51Z,"thanks for the rip & upload! much better quality than the other rips i found out there.

is there any chance we could get the same quality encode for episode 6? I see someone linked it to elsewhere, but its an avi. 

i'd love to have your quality rip of it in mkv  l2s_rg! thanks again."
