,Hazmop,2011-04-17T10:08Z,"@liiaaammmm94
Just follow the tutorial.. It is not hard to play.. But beware, this game is HIGHLY addictive!!"
,Hazmop,2011-04-17T10:13Z,"@liiaaammmm94
And to get it to work you need DAEMON tools (which mounts .iso images). 

You need need to mount the AOE III DISK 1 image then do the setup as a normal game would. 

When is asks you to launch DISK 2, replace the mounted DISK 1 with DISK 2. Do not make a new virtual drive!

Do the same with DISK 3 and then DISK 1 at the end. Once it has finished, You can go ahead and mount ASIAN DYNASTIES.. And then WAR CHIEFS (but WAR CHIEFS does not seem to work. It looks like, along with me, a lot of people are getting a '1158:' error).

Then just launch the game and have fun!!"

you can by pass the minimum by ignoring the message

i know this becuase my sound card and my graf card are old so hit ignore and lower the settings a bit you should be fine
then again im kinda using 30gigs of Vir memory right now that might help but im not a computer geek so i wouldnt know if that helps at all.

,mi6007,2011-06-14T07:10Z,i am not able to start game as it always demands insert disk 1 plz help needed this game badly
,scrotty,2011-06-15T00:02Z,"mi6007 do you even know what your doing? Not that hard to understand. You need a mounting program, the easiest I have found is PowerIso. Just mount AOE CD 1 on the virtual drive. Then open computer and double click the virtual drive it will ask you if you want to install this and you just click yes, then when the program starts click install. It will want to verify it so it will ask you for a product which is what ezelboy1000 has provided in this torrent. Simply enter that key for the game your installing then it will continue installing. During the installation it will ask for the next cd. Simply mount CD2 then on to CD3 then back to CD1 then your done. I'm assuming since you didn't know about that then you probably don't know how to make a desktop shortcut or run the program correctly.

To make a desktop shortcut go into the main drive(C:) and locate Microsoft Games then Age of Empires III then right click on the age3 and create shortcut and place it on the desktop.

To run the game you must ALWAYS have the same CD Zip mounted while your playing for AOE III in this case you must have AOE CD 1 mounted then double click age3(or whatever you rename it to if you do) shortcut or from the file folder then it will be done. Game runs same if your trying Asian Dynasties.

Okay, now to my problem. I tried running War Chiefs but it didn't work right. It ran and after I click install it says ""1158:"" and that's it. I'm going to check Aje's link to see if that fixes the problem. Also, Scanned with Kaspersky Antivirus, no viruses found."
,Schizoman,2011-06-22T03:17Z,"Does this have playable War Chiefs civilizations?  I've downloaded 7 different ""complete collection""'s or files just with all the expansions, but as soon as I load up The Asian Dynasties the Iqiquois, Aztecs and the other Indian civilization (not the ""Indians"" included with The Asian Dynasties) disappear and are no longer on the list to play as.

Can anyone tell me if this version allows you to play as them without having to load the game without The Asian Dynasties?"
,SteveO4,2011-07-06T19:08Z,All this game does when I try and open it is flash one time and close. Changes my 'color scheme' back to windows basic then back to normal. I cannot get this game to run... Did everything in instructions correctly and this is fairly self explanatory ...
