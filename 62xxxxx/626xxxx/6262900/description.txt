My first torrent.  Spent more than 20 hours remastering a nice clean 24bit, 96K file from original vinyl.  There is some LF hum which is actually on the orginal album, which I suspect is feedback from the bass direct box because when the bass player goes to electric bass is subsides.  It is much better than other copies by far so I really hope you enjoy this album!  Praise TPB because Columbia Records didn't release this on cd unless they could sell a million copies and there are only a limited amount of vinyl left around, so at least we can all enjoy the performance once more!
Please seed and leave comments!  Still working on other albums as well.
