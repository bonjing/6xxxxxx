"One Life to Lose"

a murder has been committed on the set of 
"Temptation Lane," one of New York's 
longest running soap operas. Sarah Cutler, 
the head writer on the soap, has been 
killed with a fire axe. Castle & Beckett 
quickly discover that the behind the scenes 
drama at "Temptation Lane" is just as 
scandalous as the fictitious storylines, 
and just about everyone would kill to get 
ahead. Ultimately, Castle's unique skill 
set as a writer leads to a discovery about 
the killer and the secret he or she would 
do anything to protect.

Enjoy :)
