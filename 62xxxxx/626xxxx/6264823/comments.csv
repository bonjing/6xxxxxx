,ultimagic,2011-03-23T11:31Z,"THANKS!!!!
so the film is fully widescreen. that's great!

hey dude, do you have any idea when is the release of Deathly Hallows?"
[V],GoodFilms,2011-03-23T12:16Z,Look on blu-ray.com or Amazon. Retail date is Apr 15 so the scene release will arrive sometime between now and then.
[V],GoodFilms,2011-03-23T12:19Z,"Btw BOZX, you torrents would get more recognition if you didn't APPEND YOUR NAME TO THE END OF THE TITLE."
[V],aoloffline,2011-03-23T13:14Z,"    What do u mean recognition?From where/who ?If u referr to those noobs who don't know that TPB is usually the 1st place to get the releases,and search for it instead at torrentz,or wherever ,are really gonna notice that stupid rating system,than i think you're wrong.
  If a movie is good and doesn't have dupes than it can be uploaded by Anonymous,it will have peers either way
   Or maybe we should add a ""1stuplaoded on ThePirateBay"" text file in the torrents :-)"
[V],GoodFilms,2011-03-23T13:52Z,"No, aoloffline. If you had uploaded this torrent it would have many more peers by now. Who the uploader is makes a surprising difference."
[V],GoodFilms,2011-03-23T13:54Z,"For BOZX, it's all about him and his ego. For (most of) the rest of us, it's about the torrents."
[V],GoodFilms,2011-03-23T13:55Z,And having torrents verified at torrentZ makes a big difference.
[V],BOZX,2011-03-23T15:11Z,"well chillax ""BadFilms"" its very easy to get all those 5 verifications at sily torrentz... just as the way u do--- manatain multiple a/c's and very fy ur torrents at randon so that one can not make guess of favourism from a perticular a/c

simply i dont have time to veryfy my torrents and if u deny u dont very ur torrents and give ur own torrents +1 every time u visit thn i have nothing to do....
i am not stopping u ... nor encouraging.... well just dont force me do the same.... i dont care abt those 5 verfications....
i am way faster thn others in pretimes...if ppl r wise they will download my copy or else w8 for those 1.5 gb rips....or whn one dupe me... 
:-P :-)"
,Rapier_Wit,2011-03-23T16:18Z,"I got a BD rip of a movie not officially released for weeks yet, in a format I want and a size that looks good on a 40"". That's all I personally care about. Thanks BOZX for making this available. Now everyone, chill the fuck out."
[V],GoodFilms,2011-03-23T16:30Z,"Actually, Torrentz verifies my torrents automatically, as it does with a number of other uploaders. I have only one account. They would probably consider verifying you too if you cared more about the torrents and less about your insignificant name."
,DriverAus,2011-03-23T16:43Z,"thx for upload!

[V],BOZX,2011-03-23T17:18Z,"in a desert after travelling for 24 hrs u r out of food and water and no source either...
there is one apple in ur bag ......
wt will u chose ur shit + piss or a fresh apple ....

u ur self verify ur torrents i told u they way to do so... now piss off.... and fuck ur ass"
[V],GoodFilms,2011-03-23T17:52Z,"chillout stinkybum. if i verified my own torrents, one negative vote against would unverify it. why don't you try it? ;) you're talking out your bottom.

egotistical and a complete prick. nice up tho :)"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-03-23T20:18Z,nice share.

You are so God Blessed. "
,gregersamsa,2011-03-24T09:56Z,"Stop dissin' Bozx!!! He's a great philanthropist whether he knows it, you know or not!

Sharing is f*cking caring and Bozx - he cares a LOT!!!

Thanks Bozx! Please ignore the petty voices of discontent."
,Zdk15,2011-03-26T00:45Z,"@GoodFilms
Who cares if he puts his name in the Torrent Title, it isn't hurting anyone, and we're still getting free movies. I thank both of you for uploading to Piratebay and I hope you both continue to do so. Let's put petty grievances behind us."
[V],GoodFilms,2011-03-26T02:37Z,I'm not being petty. I'm trying to help. Putting his name on the torrent has an adverse effect.
,john depp,2011-03-26T05:07Z,"Thank you BOZX for such a good film :)  Also I thank all the green and pink skullz above me as all my 3TB of movie & game collections are by you guys.  

Best wishes you piraters!"
,dacarlo,2011-03-26T09:29Z,Pukka movie and top notch A/V. Thanks for the up.

,sonofdog,2011-04-01T12:23Z,"Can someone upload ""The Lost Prince"" about Prince John ""Johnny"", the younger brother of George VI'. Preferably in HD? If you like 'The Kings Speech' you'll enjoy 'The lost Prince'. "
,Nicolas7,2011-04-01T18:53Z,Thx very much!
,Dragonite_9,2011-04-02T23:46Z,"Can I have your attention for just a minute please! Please read this for all ours sake! 

SO WE WILL NOT LOSE ANY MORE OF OUR GREAT TORRENT UP LOADERS!! THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kan jag fÃ¥ er uppmÃ¤rksamhet tack! Var vÃ¤nlig lÃ¤s detta fÃ¶r allas vÃ¥ran skull, sÃ¥ vi inte 

blir av med fler och fler torrent uppladdare! TACK FÃ–R ER UPPMÃ„RKSAMHET!!


===========================================================================================


Ville tacka speciellt dÃ¥ jag vet hur de Ã¤r nÃ¤r ingen tackar fÃ¶r ens uploads, som min 

torrent, har uploaded Ã¶ver 100gb, inga seeders kvar iaf, alla sticker direkt, och ingen 

sÃ¤ger tack..

Bara fÃ¶r att det Ã¤r ""gratis"" sÃ¥ behÃ¶ver man inte vara ofÃ¶rskÃ¤md, speciellt mot de som 

anstrÃ¤nger sig och ger er dessa saker gratis!
SÃ¥ tack!
Hoppas detta kan fÃ¥ flera att fÃ¶rstÃ¥ att ett litet tack kan gÃ¶ra sÃ¥ stor skillnad..

MVH.

Wanted to say thanks, especially when I know how it feels when no one appreciates our 

uploads, as my torrent, has uploaded over 100GB, and no seeders left anyway, everyone left 

immediately after they finished, and no one even bothered to say Thank you .. (thinking of 

stop seeding it soon, if it will not change..)

Just because it is ""free""  you do not need to be rude and such a douches, especially to 

those of us who give up our free time and put effort in to give you these things for free!
So thank you!

Hope this can get more people to understand that just a little THANK YOU! can make a big 

difference ..

Best regards!

PS: Feel free to copy and spread this to all torrents you download and upload, please!"

,Awesome0749,2011-04-12T02:31Z,"absolutely terrible, very jumpy and skippy. not worth the download."
[V],GoodFilms,2011-04-28T16:31Z,It does NOT skip and jump - you just need a better computer.
,mitsompithas,2011-05-12T19:12Z,"Thanks one more time mate, great job, I will keep seeding..!!!!"
,CBCS,2011-05-15T09:45Z,"I agree with Dragonite_9 bij 2011-04-02 23:46 CET: 
We have the same experience to people who walked away after they have downloaded our torrents. 
We will seed your movies as long as possible to help others to collect them too. Great stuff!
