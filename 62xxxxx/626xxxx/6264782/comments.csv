,Nergalsyn,2011-03-24T16:17Z,been waiting on this for a while. Thanks to pedro113 the uploader. I must say that this movie didn't disappoint. I expected it to be extra crap and believe me; it was. It was one of the best worst movies I've ever seen. A killer tire with telepathic powers?! This is a must watch for anyone who loves z list movies. If you're buzzing off of whatever e.g. sleep; caffine; 420; etc.  that's the time to peep this movie because you will laugh extra hard.
