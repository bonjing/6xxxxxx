,tapper101,2011-03-23T20:37Z,"Bwahahaha come on guys, you don't need to see the ratings. Just look at the cover, I mean just look at it. ""AGE OF THE DWAGONS"" with 5 dudes starring into nowhere in epic poses with some blue smoke covering their lower bodies, and don't forget the poorly designed dragon breathing fire behind the title. How innovative >.<

Not saying the cover says everything about all movies, there's been some ridiculously good movies with bad covers. But sometimes, they truly show how sucky the movie is.

Thanks for the upload though. Not your fault the movie suck."

,NitLions,2011-03-24T08:58Z,"btw, ima watch the shit outta this movie!! They hunting a big ass dragon with a sexy baby and Danny Glover!! I wonder if Martin Short is in this shit too!!! yeaaaaah boyiiieee!!! Its the #1 movie on TPB, that means this movie sucks enough that its AWESOME!!! U can't always just say a movie sucks, there's a point of awfulness at which a movie becomes good. Like a horror movie thats supposed to be serious that ends up being a comedy to everyone but the director and writers. I bet this movie is the balls!!!"

,kris0783,2011-03-24T22:35Z,"Everyone was so negative about this film, so I decided to watch the entire flick.

HOLLY CRAP!! It was horrible. Almost like watching a really bad play on a theater somewhere, only it was a film.

Recomended if youre a bunch og people and want something to laugh at when youre all drunk:)

THX for the upload though"
,kukul,2011-03-25T01:27Z,"Good video
Good audio

But that doesn't matter, the film is a steaming piece of crap.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not a snob,
I enjoy stupid and unambitious films, especially when stoned, but this is way too much. The Last Airbender is like Casablanca compared to this shit. In my stupidity I forgot to check IMDB page, because I thought ""It's a movie about dragons, it has to be fun, right?"" WRONG, fucking WRONG.  It's my second comment on this site and I've seen dozens of shitty movies from here, that's how bad it is. It's so boring you might die from a stroke, just because your brain decides to end it's suffering. It's worse than bubonic plague, worse than the holocaust. I think this film caused the earthquake in Japan. If I could go back in time I would kill myself before I started watching it.

If you don't hate yourself, don't watch this."
,Hlafordlaes,2011-03-25T03:19Z,"@kukul,

Well this is my first comment after years on the site, just to say I truly laughed out loud at your review. Rarely has a poor review stopped me from adventuring into some highly dubious content, but I think I will take your word on this one.

Hilarious!"
,ofogoding,2011-03-25T09:50Z,"Good god, for every movie Danny Glover is in.. His voice seem to get more and more bad. It's like someone put a fucking sock down his throat"

,pudelhund,2011-03-25T10:36Z,"I have always hated Danny Glower, and there is no way I'm watching this movie, but I really enjoyed my self reading all the loathing comments. Thanks guys! :D"
,DrtyLondry,2011-03-25T11:35Z,"Damn I was scarce to watch this movie after all of the negative comments about it, but it is actually a decent movie. If you have actually read Moby Dick, which most of you punks probably haven't, it is a good new fantastical version of that classic story. It wasn't like it was in theaters! It's pretty much like the best thing you've ever seen on the sci-fi channel...Not a bad movie. Worth watching. Not bad, and in some cases good, production and acting. There is a reason why it is being downloaded so much."
,Phatfish,2011-03-26T03:10Z,"A/V - Fine

If you want to know what this movie is all about, watch the first 10 and last 5 minutes of the movie, thats about all is worth watching, the rest of the movie struggled to even hold the storyline! "
