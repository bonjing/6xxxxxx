,mormandy3,2012-04-21T00:56Z,"Someone PLEASE....explain to me why one rips a Blu Ray down to 700 megs? This made sense years back when most everyone was limited to CD burning and when large flash drives and media servers weren't common, I get that. But this is freaking 2012 people! I like most don't burn ANY disks! If I wanted to, I could not only burn a DVD, but a High-cap Blu Ray with 50 gigs! I don't even use CDs anymore, for anything. I use a media server to my media players, or sometimes a flash drive stuck into a TV or Blu Ray player. Something like this should be ripped to at least a 5-6 gig file in MKV at 1080p. When you rip a movie down to 700 megs you get a awful picture in dark scenes, and the well lit scenes are pixelated and pathetic. Why, oh why are we still seeing this type of thing? "
,Hancock79,2012-04-29T11:06Z,"because there are people with lower standards than you, or want to fit it on a portable device, or want to watch it ASAP and want it downloaded fast.  there's high demand for these for many reasons.  i never download these either, unless it's the best I can get.  99% of the time that's not the case there's multiple versions online.

IMO you thinking something SHOULD be ripped at 5-6gb MKV file, is a very uncommon standard by far, and I mean that for any movie.  you see those kind of rips on the day of a release and they rapidly dwindle to single-digit seeds in a month or two unless it's a highly popular movie"
