,boring123,2011-03-23T02:53Z,Will this work with Boot Camp in mac osx? I just want to run one windows program so I'm looking for a quickie solution.
,some0neX,2011-03-23T08:25Z,"Yes, and even without! The included rEFIt bootloader is enough :) Ask at the official forum 7usb.tk if you have more questions"
,zoobdo,2011-03-26T19:23Z,can i install this in bootcamp? or do i have to have usb in at all times?  for mac
,some0neX,2011-03-27T20:48Z,"As mentioned before it doesn't require bootcamp! Visit the support forum, 7usb.tk , if you have any questions"
[T],grimreaper420,2011-04-03T09:36Z,I'm willing to bet that all those comments were written by you someOneX...very sad man. 
,some0neX,2011-04-05T12:23Z,Ask the moderators to compare the IP's if have a problem. And look at the official forum dedicated to this release and see for yourself how many people love it...
,xpitxbullx,2011-04-11T17:05Z,Had trouble with the x86 version so I swapped the vhd file in the 7z with the x86 version. Worked perfectly! Now I can boot on x86 or x64 machines instead of being limited to just x64.
,cooolsoon,2011-04-18T09:24Z,very best going
,some0neX,2011-04-27T10:58Z,"An update has been released!

,cesc84,2011-07-08T03:15Z,"there must be an easier way to do this?
picture looks so simple, but after unpacking, and copying and removing cupple of times, I just gave up.. 

im not saying this shit doesnt work, but its not worth the trubble.. "
,Mitch_Bainwol,2011-08-15T07:49Z,"Get this, then the update from iMortaluz's site. It's a one click install now.

Works great.  Torrent health: seed heavy, come and get it !"
[T],FightingBigBrother,2012-01-24T11:59Z,I have built about 7-8 of these installs using the Beta 4 and previous builds and they work great . Batch files or not the guy did what many have failed to achieve . Windows 7 full install and fully portable is a huge step forward.
