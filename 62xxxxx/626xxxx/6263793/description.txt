Experience the first fully portable edition of Windows 7 x64 EVER created! 

Install Windows 7 Ultimate to your USB drive/stick, take it with 
you - and run from any x64 computer (even Macs). Bring your entire 
operating system, desktop, programs, games, files, personal settings, and much 
more with you - everywhere! You can now carry your personal operating system in 
a pocket!  

This is not bartpe/winpe/livecd or anything similar! This is the first real and 
full version of Windows 7 Ultimate that can be run on any x64 computer from a USB drive! 

This is the 64 bit edition which allows you to get most out of a x64 processor. 
Check out the 32 bit edition, it runs on ANY computer and only requires 8GB disk 
space: http://ub3r.1337.cx/7  or   7usb.tk/7

Version 3.0 brings you the completely NEW cloning feature. You can now easily share Win7 USB Edition with your friends (or back it up)!

Installation is easy as 1 2 3!
Requirements: 
- at least 16GB high speed (15+ MB/s) USB drive or stick 
- .Net Framework 2 - http://ub3r.1337.cx/net 
[Tested on Windows 7/XP/Vista/2008 R2/2003] - can be installed from Mac/Linux as well, instructions are at http://ub3r.1337.cx/support 
If your are running XP, make sure that the \"don\'t format\" checkbox is selected! 

1. Extract the archive to a different location than your USB drive (e.g. desktop) 
2. Run \"INSTALL 7 USB Edition\" (You can use installer.bat, too.) 
3.a: Insert the USB drive into (any) computer [without any hubs!], (re)start it and press F8, F9, F11, F12, option or another key depending on your hardware. 
A menu should appear, choose your USB drive from it. You can also change the 
boot device order in the bios[press ctrl + s, F2, F10 etc.]. Read the motherboard 
manual or google it. (This method works on computers that can boot from USB.) 
-==OR==- 
3.b: Burn the bootloader to an empty CD [run \"burn bootloader.bat\"], insert the CD 
and the USB drive to (any) computer, (re)start it and choose \"USB\" from the menu. 
(This method will work on almost any computer.) 
-==FOR MAC==- 
3.c: Install the included rEFIt bootloader on your Mac, insert the drive and reboot. 

That\'s it; enjoy carrying a full copy of Windows 7 Ultimate x64 
in your pocket! 

[extra]: 7 Ultimate supports ANY language! In order to change it to your native 
language go to start, type update and press \"windows update\". Then click \"check for 
updates\", select the languages you want to install and wait. [I don\'t recommend 
installing any other updates as it may destroy the crack] Finally set the language 
by going to start - control panel - clock language and region - change display 
language. Enjoy using your portable windows in your native language! [Don\'t forget 
to install your network and display drivers first!] 

[Optional:] If your drive is bigger than 8GB you may want to increase the size 
of the virtual system drive of your 
new Windows in order to gain more disk space: 
1) browse to your USB drive and move the 7USBEditionByiMortaluz.vhd somewhere 
else (e.g. desktop) 
2) start VHDResizer.exe and select this file 
3) press \"save as\" and browse to you USB drive again. Call the file 
7USBEditionByiMortaluz [It won\'t work if you call it something else!] and press 
save 
4) Choose the size depending on the size of your USB drive and press resize. Get 
yourself a cup of coffee, it\'s going to take long time. 
5) When you boot your new portable windows for the first time - press start 
menu, type partition and hit enter. Right click 7USBEditionByiMortaluz and 
choose \"extend volume\". Keep pressing next. 
################################################*

Recovery: If your personal portable Windows does no longer boot, you can repair 
it with the included \"fix boot.bat\" tool. 
If it doesn\'t help, copy 7USBEditionByiMortaluz.vhd from your USB drive 
to your desktop, reinstall Win7 USB Edition, copy the 7USBEditionByiMortaluz.vhd 
file back to the USB drive (replace the existing file). No files will be lost! 

You can mount the virtual system partition from any other Windows 7 installation! 
Go to start, type partition, press \"create and format disk partitions\". Press 
action - attach VHD and browse to the 7USBEditionByiMortaluz.vhd file. You can 
then access (or recover) all your files.

Additional info: 
This is a fully functional and cracked copy of Windows 7 Ultimate x64. I don\'t 
recommend updating it with Windows Update, as this can destroy this system - do it

performance may suffer.
