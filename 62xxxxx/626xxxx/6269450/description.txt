â€œHe loves me. He loves me not.â€ Wouldnâ€™t it be great if there was a formula to get your partner to commit? Josie has been dating Curry for more than three years, and she says sheâ€™s ready to dump him if he doesnâ€™t pop the question soon. Curry says he loves his girlfriend, so why is he afraid to walk down the aisle? Will Josie hold out for a ring, or will she kick this commitment-phobe to the curb? Then, Melissa thought she had it all â€“- the ring, the dress and the man of her dreams â€“- until she discovered her wedding was a sham. She says her husband, John, lied about how many times heâ€™d been married, but the biggest tale of all is that heâ€™s still married to another woman! John admits that he lied about being divorced, but says Melissa wouldnâ€™t have stayed with him if he told her the truth. Will Melissa ever be able to trust him again â€¦ and should she? Plus, meet a couple who says their dream wedding turned into a nightmare when the wedding planner scammed them out of $30,000.
