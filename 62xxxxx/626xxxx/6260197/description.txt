CLIFTON CHENIER ZODICO BLUES & BOOGIE
Label Specialty 
Original  Year 1955
Format:Mp3@320



This set was assembled in 1992, five years after the death of Clifton Chenier, the proclaimed King of Zydeco and the man most responsible for the spread of the music\'s popularity. The twenty tracks date from 1955 and are some of his earliest national recordings. These were all recorded for the Los Angeles-based Specialty label, and came after previous records on regional based outfits in his Bayou homeland of Louisiana and Gulf Coast Texas. It\'s easy to see why there was interest in presenting him to a wider audience, as these largely blues-based songs are both invitingly friendly and irresistibly danceable. His band was well seasoned from constant road work and the recordings capture the warm and intuitive interplay. rhythmically dynamic, one of their secret weapons was the scrub board playing of Clifton\'s brother Cleveland.
