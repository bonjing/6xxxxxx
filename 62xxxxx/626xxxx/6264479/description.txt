Amy Rigby reminds me a lot of rock-tinged folkies like John Prine and 

Loudon Wainwright III with the major exception that she stays out of the 

political realm almost completely - except insofar as songs about 

male-female relations are sort of automatically politicized. Anyway, if you've 

been following her story, this is yet another collection of well-crafted, often 

humorous tunes detailing love, her love life, her love life, her love life, 

dancing with Joey Ramone, and the very politicized "Girls Got It Bad." I left 

out a few of the songs about her love life, too. The great thing about her 

though is that she doesn't sound self-indulgent with that stuff - her 

soul-searching and (often brutally) honest lyrics are things that I can't 

imagine anyone who's had experience with adult relationships failing to 

connect with. So if here she's less funny than she can be, she still delivers her 

usual spate of catchy, intelligent tunes and adds a few to the next greatest hits 

collection someone decides to make out of her catalog. I love the 

Beatles-isms of "So You Know Now," I love everything about "The Trouble 

With Jeanie," I think the sly humor of "I Don't Wanna Talk About Love No 

More" is as good as any set of lyrics she's written, I love that she has the 

nerve to drop Dustin Hoffman's name in a song just so she can have a 

rhyme (n.b.: "often"). In short, she's a great talent, and if this doesn't knock 

me out, it's still a worthy effort from my favorite relative-unknown out there.
