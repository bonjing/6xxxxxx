[V],rambam1776,2011-03-24T15:31Z,"""Is it boring?""

How does one even begin to answer such a deeply stupid question?

This is the filmed adaptation of a complex tale involving the emotions and travails of one man and his world during the inter-war years of 1918-1940. It is based on thought, dialog, and the changing nature of relationships and viewpoints over long periods of time. It lacks nudity, aliens, superheroes, and cartoon violence. I could be incorrect, but the mere fact that you would even POSE that question means that you are not yet ready for the film. Have you enjoyed film versions of other works of classic literature? If not, don't bother. I'm sure there is a link to Transformers Vs Tokyo Drift part III here somewhere."

if someone asks if boring it is probably over their head anyway.  don't be bothered by them.

btw, do you have the Class of Miss MacMichael? "
