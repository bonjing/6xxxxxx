In a Better World (2010)

Directed by Susanne Bier. 

Starring Mikael Persbrandt, Wil Johnson, Ulrich Thomsen. 

A good movie is a good movie. The photo, the locations, the casting, the music, the acting, a strong story and Susanne Biers touch of directing.

A strong story on many levels, a beautiful sadness from the Nordic country's, with a high recognize level for most people...

You really need to see this film, one of the best ones I have seen in years.
