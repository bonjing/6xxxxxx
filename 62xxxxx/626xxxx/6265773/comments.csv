,yashiv,2011-03-23T22:44Z,thanks a lot
,garak47,2011-03-24T01:53Z,"I think what zakimar1 is asking is if this is a limited series

The answer is no, zakimar1. The old Fantastic Four run ended with issue 588, following the death of Johnny Storm. This is the first issue in a whole new series, and a whole new chapter in the life of the FF. Spider-man joins the team (permanently), and they get whole new uniforms.

I'm not sure yet if FF is supposed to mean Fantastic Four, or First Family. Will have to RAFO, as they say....


Oh, and great sarcasm, mirrormaster82. :-p"
,garak47,2011-03-24T02:13Z,OK.... for those who are wondering... FF is not Fantastic Four. FF is Future Foundation.
,Lyxnman,2011-03-24T18:25Z,Basically it's a way to keep brand Recognition (FF) without saying they're the Fantastic Four (that's why Fantastic Five also works because it's still FF)
