,Rudelah,2011-04-08T21:30Z,How can i make the game faster on the DeSmuME emulator?
,iizmark,2011-04-23T20:08Z,"This torrent is not a lie, its a compressed file, and also, it turns out im missing 2 games from this: Heart Gold and Soul Silver. Im sure you can find those somewhere else, or ill upload them in a separate torrent. and to make desmume faster, the only way i can think of is to hold down the Tab button. itll go a little faster, but will look kinda laggy"
