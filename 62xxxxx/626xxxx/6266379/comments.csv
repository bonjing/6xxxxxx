,NanoEntity,2011-03-23T23:32Z,"seems the right size

Release is
LEGO.Star.Wars.III.The.Clone.Wars-SKIDROW
Size: 6.75 GB | 73F

Looks like a real deal."
,SD1000,2011-03-23T23:36Z,It may be the real thing... So Skidrow wasted their time with legos instead of Crysis 2 :(

,deathtrooper30,2011-03-23T23:58Z,"Crysis 2 has some very good protection which is why it might be awhile if ever!

I just bought it the day before it came out and I guess it's a good thing too, cause I would be having a cow like most people are now."

,jpmaximus,2011-03-28T07:00Z,"Ya so the game plays fine up till chapter 1 part 5 where you have to go to the weapons factory. You cant beat the level. Once you get the reactor down to about 1/3 its HP, it wont go down any further. SO i dont think the game is fully cracked yet. Any word on when another crack is comming?"
,Krysik,2011-04-09T09:29Z,"Jpmaximus:

It worked fine with me. 
Have you tried pulling all the levers? And have you activated both the droid panels? 
Then you should just be able to destroy the reactor. "
,onizuma13,2011-05-22T02:34Z,"So everything download and installed ok. It seemed to work perfectly. No problem but then I went to play a new game...

When I pressed start to play the prologue level (during the little intro writing it always does) my screen goes white and the game crashes. Says error report and such.

Anyone got a fix? or an answer? "
