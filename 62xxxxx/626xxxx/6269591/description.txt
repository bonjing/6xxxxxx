Cold War Kids
Mine Is Yours (2011)



Fullerton, CA's Cold War Kids make music with roots that go deep and wide, embracing influences as diverse as Bob Dylan, Billie Holiday, Jeff Buckley, and the Velvet Underground. Matt Aveiro, Matt Maust, Jonnie Russell, and Nathan Willett began crafting their soulful, blues-inflected take on indie rock as Cold War Kids in 2004, recording demos in Los Angeles soon after they formed. After signing to Monarchy Music, Cold War Kids released their debut EP, Mulberry Street, in spring 2005. The band's unique sound and impassioned live act generated a buzz -- particularly from bloggers -- that grew with each tour and release. Maust's clean but eye-catching designs for EPs like With Our Wallets Full and Up in Rags and the group's website also added to Cold War Kids' mystique. They spent much of 2006 on the road with Tapes 'n Tapes, Figurines, Sound Team, and Editors and appeared at that year's Lollapalooza. That summer, they signed to Downtown Records, also home to Art Brut and Gnarls Barkley. The band's full-length debut, Robbers & Cowards, arrived that fall. Loyalty to Loyalty, which moved in a slower, bluesier direction, was released in 2008. On Behave Yourself, an EP that had a digital release late in 2009 and was issued on CD early in 2010, Cold War Kids emphasized their soulful ballads. In 2010 the band went into the studio with Grammy-winning producer Jacquire King (Tom Waits, Kings of Leon). Their third album, Mine Is Yours, arrived in early 2011.

Some major retooling took place in Cold War Kids' world in the 12 months between the Behave Yourself EP and their third album, Mine Is Yours. Their last full-length, Loyalty to Loyalty, played like an unflattering caricature, all dragging tempos, grating vocals, and overdone attempts at â€œbluesiness.â€ Behave Yourself found the band on better behavior, with tighter songwriting and a sleeker approach, but just how much slicker Cold War Kids sound on Mine Is Yours is still kind of a shock. Where they used to sound like they wanted to play church basements and speakeasies, here they sound like theyâ€™re gearing up for stadiums Ã  la Kings of Leon. Aside from Nathan Willett's occasional vocal flourishes, the band puts aside any vestiges of its former rawness, coating everything in clean, glossy reverb that makes these modern rock songs go down easy. Theyâ€™re downright U2-ish on the title track, and â€œSkip the Charadesâ€ and â€œFlying Upside Downâ€ aspire to anthem status. Every now and then, Cold War Kids remember their roots on Mine Is Yours, as on the sexy â€œCold Toes on the Cold Floorâ€ and â€œRoyal Blue,â€ both of which conjure the slinky nighttime grooves that used to be their bread and butter. For better or worse, this album is polished and mature -- words that never would have described Cold War Kids' music before.
