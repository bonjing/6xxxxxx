,NitrogenUA,2011-03-24T16:54Z,"I was unable to patch this one to play on my 5.50 GEN-D3, so it is provided 'as is' - in an unpatched state.

The game actually contains THREE games, which are:
Final Fantasy IV
Final Fantasy IV -Interlude-
Final Fantasy IV: The After Years"
,Kyle999,2011-03-25T03:15Z,I have Prometheus add-on firmware 5.50 GEN-D. Play the latest and greatest 6.XX-required games without any difficulty—no ISO patching or nothing. This works for me thank's for the upload.
,galant360,2011-03-25T11:04Z,is this EUR or US?
,joshvil,2011-03-25T12:16Z, i think its EUR. 
,ghost5141,2011-03-25T13:16Z,"doesnt work on Gen D3 but work on 5.50_Prometheus.

Hang during intro movie but game play works ok so far."
,ghost5141,2011-03-25T13:17Z,Doesnt work on Gen D3 but ok on 5.50_Prometheus though a bit glitchy - hang during intro movie but game play is ok
,subverbo_16,2011-03-28T05:20Z,"how do you patch this iso? is there a specific youtube video/forum guide out there? can anyone give links? or if you could explain it here, the better.

I have a PSP 3000. 5.03 MHU. I loaded using a 5.03 Prometheus"

,ghost5141,2011-03-29T16:30Z,"Runnng with 5.50_Prometheus and WILL hang at screen after completed. Tried 3 times, hang 3 times. You have been warned! Suggest wait for patched version who using same or any lower CF."
,sylvanalex,2011-03-30T21:55Z,thx for the game nitro :) is there any chance u upload Legend of heroes : trails in the sky ???
,baphomatt,2011-04-02T07:12Z,"Got this one working by decrypting the eboot with isotools 1.97.  Didn't have to patch it with any of the prometheus files. 

I'm on a psp2000 cfw 5.0 m33-6."
,spainland,2011-04-03T06:14Z,hey how do i run this on a psp go?
,leslieianramos,2011-04-08T07:00Z,works fine using 6.20 TN-D perma patch (PSP 3001 3g) and prome4 PSP 2001. Thanks bro!
,SeedTillUBleed,2011-04-09T19:11Z,Baphomatt  TY!!! decrypt with isotools worked like a charm! Confirmed working on GEN-D3 psp 1000 with isotools 1.97 decrypt.
,Gotejjeken,2011-04-16T19:55Z,"Having an issue with a black screen freeze when encountering Leviathan (decrypted eboot with isotools 1.97, working fine up until here)...anyone else experience this? If so, care to share how to fix it?  "
,neoXtacy,2011-04-18T01:08Z,Same issue. It freezes at Leviathan screen. The intro movie hangs as well but you can skip he intro movie by pressing start. I do not believe there is a way to skip the leviathan screen. I had to patch using Isotools just to get the game to work. Im gonna but the US version the day it hits shelves...
,Trucifenix,2011-04-18T20:12Z,"I got this working with 5.00 M33-6/prome-4 by using ISO tool 1971. 

First, patch prometheus with “ME631″, after finish patching, patch again with “05″. and it should be good (sofar good for me anyways)

got this info off the jap torrent"
,Ashenden,2011-04-18T21:03Z,"I appreciate the instructions, Trucifenix. Game is working with no crashes and saving works. One problem I'm having is slowdown when I reach screens with translucent overlays like the Mist Caverns. Anyone else getting this? I'm using a PSP-1000 with 5.50 Gen-D Prometheus."
,Trucifenix,2011-04-19T06:48Z,"@Ashenden

did u try using 333MHz CPU clock for game mode? other than that, i dunno. maybe the phat psp's are slower in some games? I haven't gotten that far since I don't own the game yet."
,Trucifenix,2011-04-19T06:55Z,"also, I hear the above patching methods fix the leviathan issues. so if anyone is having issues, try them
"
,Ashenden,2011-04-19T07:27Z,"Oh nice, setting CPU Speed to 333 did the trick for the area I was noticing it in last. You've been a big help twice, I appreciate it!"
,Nic888,2011-04-21T15:01Z,This is my favourite...but i have got 5.50 gen d2  :( 
,Atma84,2011-04-22T02:54Z,"@Trucifenix I tried using ISO tool 1971 and patching as you suggested.

On The After Years I get an error saying Data cannot be found when attempting to choose a story.

Using PSP-1000 5.50 Prome-4"
,neoXtacy,2011-04-22T09:16Z,Thanks Trucifenix. The Prometheus 05 and me65 patch from iso tools took care of the problem. Flawless now. 
,gnetix,2011-04-24T01:16Z,"Can anyone upload a patched version with the low CF fix? I have 5.50 gen-d and I can't use the isotool because my screen is broken. I have to use remotejoylite and it will crash when trying to use apps like that.

I found another version that plays but movies don't play and the game crashed at Leviathan. "
,maestro13,2011-04-25T01:58Z,"I just bought a modded PSP-1000 that had 5.50 GEN-D3. I upgraded to Prom-4 because I read newer games would work, but FFIVcc freezes at the opening cutscene. 

Don't know if I did anything wrong because I'm a PSP noob. Haven't even tested it on older games since my connection sucks."
,gnetix,2011-04-25T17:27Z,"@ maestro13, I have 5.50 Gen-D and every game I have will run great except Dante's Inferno. Just that one needs Gen-D3 for some reason. There is another version that will work on mine but none of the movies will play and it finally locked up on one part. 

You can try that one or wait till a patched version gets uploaded :(

Actually, this torrent didn't even start for me, but the other did."
,shadowbind,2011-05-02T18:40Z,"Dear Sir, Is there anyway for me to play this series in my 2000 5.50 Gen D3?

Have you found a solution?"
,peligro0,2011-05-06T19:50Z,changing game mode to 333 will enable cut scene in the beginning and seems to run better over all
,kronickelly,2011-05-07T05:12Z,"hello :) this didnt work 'as is' for me: it was 'corrupt data' at first. 

im using 5.00 M33-4, so i tried isotools, which the latest version is 'corrupt data' on my system so i tried prometheus 5.00, installed it, and bam! it played... but- i cannot save! it says 'there is no data, error 80110327' and 'save data failed to load'

 - is it even possible to play new games with 5.00 M33-4 custom firmware anymore or am i stuck :("
,xmesca,2011-05-17T07:05Z,I haven't played through the game yet but works on my PSP 2000 Slim with CFW 5.50 Prome-4 and CPU Speed at 333mhz.
,xmesca,2011-05-17T20:23Z,"xmesca at 2011-05-17 07:05 CET: ""I haven't played through the game yet but works on my PSP 2000 Slim with CFW 5.50 Prome-4 and CPU Speed at 333mhz.""

To expand, after playing a bit. I cannot do the data install and it gives me an error when trying to do the game data save (even though the game data save does exist in the saved data utility). But you can in fact save within Final Fantasy 4. So no real problem, just some error messages that have to be navigated every time you save."
,NitrogenUA,2011-05-28T09:59Z,"As far as i've read freezing cutscenes is a known issue for all versions out there. Though, as Trucifenix pointed out, patching the game using ISO Tool might be worth a try.
""First, patch prometheus with “ME631″, after finish patching, patch again with “05″. and it should be good""
If someone can confirm this method helps to pass notorious Leviathan, i'd upload a patched version."
,juicean,2011-06-01T19:49Z,@NitrogenUA:  The method DOES indeed help in passing Leviathan.
,rokas1997,2011-06-09T18:52Z,"@NitrogenUA, IT REALLY WORKED! (PUT IT IN TORRENT DESCRIPTION!)  "
,Wackachotin,2011-06-28T06:00Z,"i have 6.20 PRO-B7 and i havent had any problems on any psx or psp games,every game has worked fine.Maybe you guys should upgrade to 6.20 PRO B7 its flawless!!"
,schokoxx,2011-07-03T14:59Z,Works greatly! Thanks!
,ethan.badass,2011-07-16T06:21Z,"Please answer:

Does it work on PSP GO? And does iso's work on a new psp go or do i have to mod it first or something..?

Im a psp noob, i just am starting to use one..."
,unopepito06,2011-07-17T03:29Z,"I tried this yesterday on my PSP-2000 5.00 M33-6, patched with isotool ME631 and 05 as suggested, it worked, but I discovered today the save was corrupted. 
I have since upgraded to 6.39 PRO-B8 CFW, and the unpatched game runs fine, and saves as well. When you choose to save, it will say something about not finding data, but do it anyway and it works fine. Thanks for your help, guys!"
,tapoq2,2011-07-18T22:18Z,"works like a charm :) cheers,
im on psp1000 (PHAT) 6.39 Pro-B8 fyi
