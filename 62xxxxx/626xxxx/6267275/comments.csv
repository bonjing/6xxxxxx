,1tpblover,2011-04-26T12:54Z,Great Work Slickinator. Thank u very much. It worked very well for me. Keep Sharing..
,skywalker311,2011-04-29T21:49Z,Don't install SP1 or you'll get a watermark on bottom right of the screen plus sp1 dont really do anything. This is a great copy you can download all update's just don't do sp ones.

,Anonym099,2011-05-07T00:44Z,How much disk space do I need on my hard drive in order to upgrade?
,Anonym099,2011-05-07T00:44Z,"If I can run Windows 7 in Oracle Virtualbox, then I should be able to upgrade. Right?"
[V],Slickinator,2011-05-07T11:35Z,this copy is not recommended to be upgraded as its required to format for better response so i would back up what you need there use it
,hahahehe2,2011-05-09T05:13Z,Does anyone know why it takes so long to start up. Im using boot camp btw
,KikoSonje,2011-05-11T18:06Z,"@Slickinator

,mclarenx989,2011-07-14T01:35Z,"Ok so I just wanted to provide an update as of today, July 13, 2011, this torrent is working perfectly. Installed its on a Mac OS X 10.6.8 via VMWare Fusion 3.1.3. All drivers and updates are good. 

My copy of VMWare Fusion was taken from here: 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6444050/VMware_Fusion_3.1.3_MacOSX_incl._keygen

I will continue seeding for 30days. 

Much appreciation goes out to Slickinator and TPB community. "
,Dragix,2011-07-25T01:35Z,"As of July 24, 2011... Upgraded Windows Vista Premium x32. Worked fine. The only problem is that the upgrade hangs at a certain percentage for about 2 hours, but JUST WAIT and it will work itself out. The Upgrade installation took a few hours and did okay.

Do NOT update to Service Pack 1. It will catch you with Windows Genuine Advantage, which checks if this is a genuine copy of Windows.

DO use RemoveWat, as Slickinator advised. I neglected to do this at first because it was tagged by Lavasoft Ad-Aware as malware. The tag was just a false positive. Use RemoveWat to get rid of Genuine Advantage. 

A serial number is included, but I never used it."
,overtext2,2011-08-07T21:10Z,"thanks bud...it worked perfectly on my 6 year old amd quad core, 4gb ram system. "
