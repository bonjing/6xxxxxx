STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN SEATTLE JAMMIN
Year Of Release: 1985
Format: Flac 
Total Time: 01:10:07


This recording was made at Parkers Arena ,Seattle in 1985.
Includes songs from Soul to Soul album. The main highlight is the final song, Texas Flood, with Bonnie Raitt. She adds tasteful licks on the slide at all the right places. She's been a friend of SRV's since his days back in Austin before he even really got a following
They say it's a soundboard recording but it appears it may be an FM broadcast of a SB recording. Anyway, the quality is quite good.
