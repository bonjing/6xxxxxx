,Ghostryx,2011-04-02T02:21Z,"I had Gen 5.50 d3, and updated to 5.50 prometheus 4, and it worked. Prometheus lets you play 6.20 and latest games versions without updating to later versions :P

,Ghostryx,2011-04-02T23:29Z,"Vakura, i was testing the game in 5.50 prome 4 and actually the game starts up, but it freezes when you start a mission, or select a tutorial, it crashes when you try certain stuff. So its not 5.50 prome 4 compatible i guess. Any way it works on 6.20. Waiting for some fix i guess"
,gunavat,2011-04-16T08:20Z,"hmm... this game doesnt work for me :/ im using 5.03 gen C on psp-3000, i patched the game with ISO- tools and got it to start and play fine, however, when i reach the part where u start the mission, the game freezes immediatly :O also, when creating a new character, i noticed that when u try to play the sound ""step"", the game freezes and crash :O"
