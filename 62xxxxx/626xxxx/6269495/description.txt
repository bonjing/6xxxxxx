This is a mash-up album by the Boston-based electronic artist djbc. He cuts up Philip Glass songs and then lays down the vocals from well-known hip hop tracks. The results are quite unique.

Shortly after its release in 2006, he was forced to take this album off the market due to copyright issues. But we don't take kindly to those around here, now do we! Hurrah!

Please note that this is also available as part of "The Philip Glass Torrent". But that torrent contains a completely overwhelming amount of other material (43 albums!) so I wanted to make this accessible on its own.
