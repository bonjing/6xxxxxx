,qhdsagjuj,2011-04-01T15:29Z,"I found out this game forces you into updates so delete all of the contents of C:/Program Files (x86)/Electronic Arts/Crytek/Crysis 2/bin32/EAcore. After you do this there no longer will be any more forced update. When you start the game it takes a bit longer, but it still loads! Just leave the EAcore folder there empty! "
