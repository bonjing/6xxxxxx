This is the REAL full discography. The last one I put up was missing the Art of Drowning due to my relative incompetence as a file selector. Anyway, this is the real deal. Everyone that loves AFI, or wants to love them should download this shit and make their lives 1000 times better. Please enjoy and seed.
