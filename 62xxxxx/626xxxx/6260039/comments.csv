,Dheerajr,2011-03-23T19:45Z,"No, mine was successfully downloaded, just download nothing happens, cheers ;)
Enjoy..."
,Dheerajr,2011-03-23T19:48Z,"If that shows ignore that and install, I installed it successfully without any pain..:)"
,Loers,2011-03-25T11:24Z,hi
,Loers,2011-03-26T15:08Z,"dude I installed it and everything went okay
buh whenever I tried to calculate any function it gives me an error saying Access Denied error()"
,Loers,2011-03-26T15:09Z,"and it posts out a link
is there a solution :("
,Pramodsk,2011-03-27T13:01Z,how to get the activation key? Pls help!
,chuse2510,2011-04-03T01:15Z,"The keygen is for mathematica 7, and the system has changed, now is needed an activation key"
,LenaIsAPirate,2011-04-05T23:21Z,So why is this torrent file missing? :(
,zomirp,2011-04-08T15:37Z,It works perfectly. Thanks.
,ace9star9,2011-04-09T04:44Z,"First working mathematica 8 torrent I've found. The keygen takes a few tries though.
Thanks much."
,Badskill,2011-04-13T00:48Z,@Stamatina It's because it detected the keygen.
,kujirasan,2011-04-13T11:23Z,"Hi any idea how to get an activation key?  I have tried everything, without it , is not possible to install it ."
,tunitg6,2011-04-14T05:54Z,"Hit Generate, Copy License to ""activation key"", copy password to ""password"".

Don't worry that the activation key is not the same format as it tells you."
,vheflin,2011-04-14T16:40Z,"The instructions are not very clear but I figured out how to make this work after about an hour. 

This is for macintosh only. 

After files are downloaded:
   1. Open Mathematica_8.0.0_OSX_MachineSpecific.dmg.
   2. After it mounts, drag Mathematica to the applications folder. 
   3. Open Mathematica, in the activation window and look for the Math ID. 
   4. This is the number you will type in the keygen.exe to obtain a password. 
   5. I opened the keygen.exe file using Windows XP running under Parallels on the mac. I'm sure this can be done on any windows machine as well. 
   6. Type in the Math ID number and click generate to get a password. 
   7. Go back to the activation page in Mathematica and insert the license number (Lxxxx-xxxx) and the password that was generated in the keygen. It worked perfectly. 

Hope this helps those who were having difficulty installing."
,kujirasan,2011-04-17T05:09Z,"Hi there, it installs, but does not work, at first click of the keyboard a message pops and tells something is not been enable and have to contact the Wofram website.
The person t hat has been able to successfully run it, can enlighten us further, on how to overcome this obstacle. Thanking you all."
,kujirasan,2011-04-17T08:13Z,"After a successful Installation, when a key is presses this turns up:
""You are running in a mode which does not allow editing""
Any one has work out how to get around it?  Or any suggestion?"
,Ehab12,2011-04-17T17:22Z,"if the activation isn't working install Mathematica 7 and then uninstall it and install Mathematica 8, it will automatically be activated."
,de_wight,2011-04-17T20:49Z,"I suggest caution with this new edition.
I've noticed that some codes written on M7 doesn't work on M8.
Has anyone had that kind of problem?"
,kujirasan,2011-04-18T08:55Z,"I managed to install it on Windows7, 64 bit, it works like a charm, I used the version 8,  key_gen , it is red coloured one looks the same as the Mathematica logo, just input the Id number and click, all goes well, It has problem with XP, so better go for windows 7, 32 bit or 64 bit."
,humanji,2011-04-19T03:51Z,Please can anyone seed this torrent? Thanks very much!
,humanji,2011-04-19T03:53Z,Please can anyone seed this torrent? Thanks very much!
,humanji,2011-04-19T03:55Z,Please can anyone seed this torrent? Thanks very much!  
,boxplox,2011-04-29T15:26Z,"Keygen and installer worked properly for me.

However, if I try to make a free-form input or a wolfram-alpha input, it says my request is denied by the server."
,tpbjah,2011-05-11T13:54Z,"AVG says that the keygen has a trojan:
Trojan horse Dwonloader.Generic9.AHLW

Can anybody provide a non-infected keygen?"
,rezor664,2011-05-13T07:34Z,"Yeah I'm getting the same error of not being able to access the wolfram server. This is a great application, but is very limited if you can't get passed that error."
,cloudmandan,2011-05-22T01:07Z,I too am getting the same server error.  Anyone got a work around?
,PlanetT,2011-05-22T19:22Z,"Hi, it works fine. As it was pointed out by someone else: copy License to ""activation key"", copy password to ""password"".
DON'T WORRY THAT THE ACTIVATION KEY IS NOT THE SAME FORMAT AS IT TELLS YOU. It will accept it."
,fignose,2011-05-23T20:02Z,PlanetT's got it right. It's a little confusing but in the manually activate section you copy the licence number then the keygen 4-3-3 digit string
,bobmagic,2011-05-31T12:24Z,"This torrent installs well if the directions are followed. The Keygen does contain a tame Trojan horse so the drive should be disinfected after installation. The sad part is that the Keygen is for Mathematica 7, the license numbers generated will install version 8 BUT the none of the features of Mathematic 8 can be used so you might just as well stay with Version 7"
,tehmadcap,2011-06-13T08:45Z,Activation works but it says request denied by Wolfram Server (3004) when I try to evaluate anything.. How do you get around this?
,lsfx,2011-06-26T07:17Z,"i had a one-semester license fr mathematica, but now it asks me to re-register, and prompts me for my activation key.  how am i supposed to find my mathID, because i seem to need it to generate a key with the keygen"
,Seto89,2011-08-05T02:13Z,"For those having trouble with the keygen - don't forget that the value on the bottom left of the keygen window is the license key, while the longer value on the bottom right is the password. Don't worry that the length doesn't match - it works."
,max_velocity,2011-08-07T09:31Z,"The keygen is infected, as the previous poster said. Do NOT run the keygen"
,Funkybeatzzzz,2011-09-08T04:38Z,"I concur with bobmagic... Downloaded and activated without a problem. But the keygen is for Mathematica 7 so you get none of the Mathematica 8 features like the smart inputting, which is the whole reason I wanted this. Waste of time to download! Just go to www.wolframalpha.com and it does the same thing... FOR FREE!!! "
,bbutton1,2011-10-09T22:36Z,"keygen isn't infected, it's just false alarm, newbs!"
,2sbsb,2011-10-23T12:50Z,Works totally fine! I had already installed Mathematica 7 so I did not need any keygen.
,R4W3N,2011-10-30T13:12Z,"I have a solution for the free-form input error: ""Request denied by Wolfram|Alpha server (3004)"".
You have to download another version of this torrent by AGAiN. The link is down below:

http://www.kickasstorrents.com/wolfram-research-mathematica-v8-0-0-0-incl-keymaker-again-t4842985.html


After you've downloaded, installed and activated Mathematica 8 follow the instructions below:

Mathematica 8 free-form input activation:
1. Open Mathematica 8 AGAiN keygen.
2. Enter your MathID, Computer Name and Username (They are all located in Help > About Mathematica... > System 

Information > Kernel). Please note that your MathID is actually Machine ID in System Information.
3. Press Save mathpass and it will generate a file named ""mathpass"" in folder where the keygen is.
4. Copy that ""mathpass"" file and paste it in the following folder: ""C:\Users\Your Username\AppData\Roaming\Mathematica\Licensing\"".
5. Run Mathematica 8 and try that awesome free-form input feature."
,ejay8400,2011-11-02T18:12Z,is it just me or is the keygen folder empty? atleast it is for me. would be brilliant if someone could help with that
,n0ha,2011-11-22T16:49Z,"works fine,thx"
,kosmaverik,2011-11-26T18:56Z,I get Startup Error :( Has anyone solved it?
,nirgoen,2011-12-14T00:05Z,Many Thanks...works like a charm on win 7 x64 ultimate.
,xs87,2011-12-18T07:05Z,"the keygen folder might be empty because it was removed to the virus vault by the security scanner. 
at least that was what i found.

does anyone know what program is used to open the keygen??"
,queue2,2011-12-26T09:05Z,"can anyone please upload the keygen(zip file) for this software.....i downloaded the software with great difficulty and my antivirus automatically deleted the keygen....now i dont want to download the whole software again for keygen....so i request anyone who could upload the keygen in zip format please....

thanks in advance"
,zorn1,2012-01-03T12:19Z,"I'm copying my MathID and pasting it into the keygen and when I press generate, it tells me ""Invalid MathID"". What can I do / need to do?"
,zorn1,2012-01-03T12:43Z,"OK, figured how the keygen works. There's still one problem. It doesn't generate the activation key in the proper xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxx format. Instead, I get numbers in the format: xxxx-xxx-xxx

,astrocharles,2012-03-25T08:37Z,Alright. 
,uLoaded,2012-04-14T23:02Z,"ok, whenever i request a complex integration question from their servers, it does not show me the answer. Just a blank strip. Whenever I click on ""link"" from the ""+"" sign, it goes to the wolfram webpage, tries to integrate my function, and then stops and says :

Computation timed out. (PRO) Try again with more time 


Isn't the whole point of cracking this program to get past this error???"
,aorta0x,2012-06-09T02:19Z,"Please follow the link for newest version of it http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6901023/Wolfram_Mathematica_8.0.4.
This Keygen is excellent and working with version 8.0.0.1801269 as well. Go By activation by other ways. Choose Manual. Note Down the MathID and type in to the relevant place at keygen. It will generate Activation Key and Password. Please enter into the open window of Mathematica 8.0.0 or 8.0.4. and activate. I have not checked it for other versions. But many many thanks to fiekert. Here it is requested to block mathematica from accessing internet. You can do it by firewall or through preferences of Mathematica. Uncheck ""Allow Mathematica to access internet under internet connectivity. It works. I haven't installed extras."
