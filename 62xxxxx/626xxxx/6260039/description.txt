1. On a windows machine or in a VM or Crossover (it's on the site too), run the included keygen.

2. It will give you a License ID (That's the string that looks like Lxxxx-xxx), and when you run Mathematica for the first time, it will give you a MathID, a long sequence of characters. Input that in to the keygen and press generate, which will make a password. Put that in, and it will license and then you are SET.

3. Enjoy!

No need to block with Little Snitch. Also, if you already have a working Mathematica 7 install, you can just install over it and skip the keygen.
