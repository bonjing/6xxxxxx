,azitromax,2011-03-24T06:53Z,"There are 7 seeders as I write. When you upload a torrent, it takes a while before the number of seeders will show. So, for the first hours the torrent will say it has 0 seeders. 

Also sometimes (because of a bug in the system or something) a torrent will show 0 seeders. "
