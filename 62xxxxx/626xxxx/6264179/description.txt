-------------- Encoding Note ----------------
Shock Waves was filmed using Super 16mm and then 
transfered to 35mm, while looking superior to other 
earlier DVD releases of the film, this version still 
displays speckling & excessive grain. 
With that said, this version of Shock Waves will 
never look better than what is displayed. 
The film stock used, was taken from the Director's 
private vault collection.
