I was wondering if you might have Episodes 4 thru 6 of 'The Chicago Code' that aired on Fox, and if so, could you please upload them for me to download?  My Tivo messed up during the airing of those episodes, and I would be greatful if I could get them!!
Thanks So Much!!"

One episode had weather advisory crap plastered in the middle of the screen, then another weather induced failure, and one human error. I know their other cappers that released those ones i missed, and will do my best to not miss anymore but recording over the air broadcast from around 80 miles out is not something i can guarantee."

(I am actually Happy, my Tivo did not mess up on Last Monday's Episode #7)!! Yay!! 
So Thanks So Much For Helping Me Out!! "
