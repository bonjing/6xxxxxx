The.Windmill.Movie.2008.DVDRip.XviD-FiCO
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1276996/
Subtitles: EN SP
Date: 2011.03

Director: Alexander Olch
Genre: Docu
Plot: Filmmaker Richard P. Rogers tried for twenty years to make a 
documentary about his own life. He died in 2001, leaving the project 
unfinished, until his widow, acclaimed photographer Susan Meiselas, 
commissioned his former student Alexander Olch to make a film out of 
the pieces. Starting in the Hamptons, in the town of Wainscott, the 
film weaves Rogers' footage into a journey through childhood memories, 
a less than encouraging mother, a family background of privilege, and 
Rogers' persistent, dogged attempts to document his own life. Rogers' 
friend, actor and writer Wallace Shawn, joins in the process, as the 
film investigates the differences between documentary and fiction, 
and tells the tragic story of Rogers' life.
