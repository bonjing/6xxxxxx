,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-04-10T04:32Z,"I am currently leaving my PC seeding all day, until I get more seeders. If I get at least 6 seeders on each of the seasons, I will upload DVD quality of seasons 1-3, I also have DVD quality of 4-5, I will upload those, as soon as I get sufficient seeders for the first 3 DVD quality seasons."

,xefermix,2011-05-08T09:33Z,"this rip sucks bars all around in a zip for no apparent reason, do better!"
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-05-13T03:14Z,"I have DVD quality of season 2 that I can upload if you like, but as I said in my first upload, I received this season from a friend, after season 3 are done myself. It's also in a rar file, because my first uploads were never seeded by anyone, so I reuploaded them. But like I said, I will upload the dvd quality of the seasons. Sorry if the quality was less than satisfactory for you, thanks for the feedback, it helps me improve uploads for next time, I'll let you know when I have the dvd quality uploaded. If it's not immediately seeded, I'll also let you know when it is downloadable. "
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-05-27T07:18Z,"@xefermix, the reason it is a zip file, is that I had a lack of seeders on my original uploads, and since I couldn't re-upload the same exact file, I put it in a zip, so I had both up for a while, then deleted the lesser seeded ones, leaving me with only the .rar file versions. Sorry if it's an inconvenience to you."
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-05-27T07:18Z,"Season 1 on DVD is currently up, please seed if you can download it, it is fairly new, so it might take a bit to download. But it is completely ripped off the dvd."
,hybr1dgamerx,2011-05-31T00:07Z,this is a damn fine torrent.xefermix is just bitchin for no reason.
,MiKaiiEL,2012-06-09T22:36Z,I'll try to help you seed for all of the ones I'm downloading. But it takes forever to upload it completely onece
