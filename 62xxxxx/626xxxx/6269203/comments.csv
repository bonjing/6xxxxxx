[V],Masterzilla,2011-03-25T01:47Z,"Thanx mate. I converted one episode to avi just to see what I end up with. And it looks the same as original. And quality is even better than S1 was. I used almost same settings as for flv stuff you upload. If you wonder what I used, it was alltoavi, free program. Get info on flv with media info (also free prog) and use those exact settings for converting. Or I might do it when S2 is over.
Anyways, just keep them coming man, and thank you :D"

[V],mirogster,2011-03-25T06:38Z,"@Masterzilla What about sound quality, is it any better? What is in those in flv's, regularly pisses me off!"

,Fast Glass,2011-03-28T19:19Z,Thanks for the upload.
[V],Masterzilla,2011-03-31T11:34Z,"Quality is pretty much the same as on flv. You can't get much better than the original whit any settings. But it's playable on all dvd player in avi format. That's main reason I wanted it converted. At least we have something, better than nothing ;) And I'm looking foreward to ep 12. Cheers mate"
