BFD2
     
     an acoustic drum production environment for your computer with
     unprecedented power and flexibility. Extreme realism and sound
     quality, fast and easy set up, total plug-in integration to your
     digital audio workstation.
     
     Customized 10, 18 or 32 piece kits are at your fingertips, with full
     control over tuning, damping, ambience levels, velocity response and
     more. Layer parts of the kit for powerful hybrid sounds perfect for
     modern productions and flick through preset kit-piece profiles for
     quick access to dry, damped and other useful settings. BFD2 lets you
     configure your sounds like a real drum kit instead of pushing buttons
     on a sampler.
     
     You can even import your own stereo sample-sets with multiple velocity
     layers so you can mix and layer your own sounds with BFD2\'s for
     experimental kits and \'drum-replacement\' production tricks.
