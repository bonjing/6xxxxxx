[V],globeplus,2011-03-23T15:23Z,"To khalifa1942 : you have to check always the compatibility of the games before use them to get the correct idea about inconveniences or not on the playability and to check if they are playable too , sometimes can happen the same game have 2 different versions for example European and American and for more strange that it looks on the emulator the European be ok and the American donÂ´t or vice-versa , so looking at the compatibility Ã§ost before start playing a game it is not a bad idea :
