,TM85,2011-06-11T08:01Z,"= = ATTENTION = = EPISODE ORDER ERRORS = =

Swap 2 & 3 / Swap 6 & 7 / Swap 10 & 11

You must watch this series in the correct order, or the story gets screwed up...

The episode Titles are at the begining of each episode about 10 to 15 seconds from the start... You can find numerous episode guides on the web... Good one here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Spartacus:_Blood_and_Sand_episodes

Otherwise... This is THE BEST SET OF SEASON 1 ON THE WEB... Audio and Video are both Solid 10s

,Damien74,2011-07-26T13:18Z,"kn5150: this is not an advertising war on best release.
Yours is lower quality and with a more complex codec that requires specific codecs and can not be played with some movie player boxes or in the putor (without the codec of course).
The files is bigger but better and a lot more players can handle them."
