Above & Beyondâ€™s annual Anjunabeats party has become a Miami institution. This year, the UKâ€™s most popular DJs are hosting their biggest Miami event to date with many more artists to be announced, to the two-room extravaganza at Ice Palace on Thursday, March 24th, 2011.

Last yearâ€™s Anjunabeats party at Karu & Y was so successful that the event has moved to the larger Ice Palace. And with Above & Beyondâ€™s L.A. Palladium show selling out in a record 24 hours, tickets for the 2011 Miami event are a hot property.
