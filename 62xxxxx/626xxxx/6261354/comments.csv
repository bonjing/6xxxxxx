,Failseeders,2011-03-22T10:41Z,"For all you idiots that are complaining about the slow download speeds: instead of complaining, go out and buy it or just wait for the download to finish. The download speed isn't downloading fast at all because there are a small fraction of seeders compared to all the people downloading from them seeeders. 

Put it this way: 

For every seeder in this download, there's 62 people downloading off that seeder, and there's only a certain amount of bandwidth said seeder can give to each downloader thus resulting in slower download speeds. This will be like this for a few days until there are more seeders. Now, be a good pirate and seed if you want faster downloads you ungreatful hooligans."

Go to preferences and then to the Bandwidth category(if you are using Bittorrent. It may be different for other clients), and change Global Max connections to 500 and Max number of connection per torrent to 500(these are under # of connections in Bandwidth section), and also change your bandwidth allocation to High for the torrent you are downloading, and that should bump up your speed a bit. But as for this torrent, just go ahead and start the download and wait a bit. It will take a while for your speed to go up, as there are about 14x's as many leechers as there are seeders."

Once you have the game installed and its in your Programs in the folder Entertainment Arts (or whatever) then you can copy it over, but before you copy it over....

Open of the imaged CD by going to your ( in some cases E drive) or what ever drive is your CD rom. Go inside the CD files and look for a folder named "" Crack "" Go inside it and there will be a file named.....TSM.ex_..... ( without the dots.) Right click it and rename it to TSM.exe.  Delete the _ and add a (e). After that copy the two cracks into Entertainment arts -> Game -> Bin. ( or all of files in the folder. ) and then it will ask to replace you press replace and copy and Tadah. If you already copied it over to the folder, then just find the crack in the folder and rename it and make a shortcut of it on your desktop...

NEW CRACK FOR V1.1 ... IT FIXES CRASHES !!!!

Not a fake crack, just this one is ment for V1.1 which is the update you download when you start up sims. This will fix most if not all crashes you get in the game. Seriously, try this. This fixed all my problems... time to go be a monarch...

Be sure to use the 1.1 version of the crack or the game will crash. Once I changed to that crack and re-routed my desktop shortcut to the .exe and not the launcher, the game runs fantastic. Nice, interesting twist on the sims games. I have had every single sims game, and I plan on continuing that trend and this one is a nice addition to the collection. Will upload to filesonic if requested, just drop me a message or e-mail."

Add the Sims Medieval folder into the exceptions list of your anti-virus(or where ever you're putting the file). A lot of cracks and keygens get labelled as virus'/spyware. If you don't trust it, find another crack, but it's most likely a false positive.

It's not working because your anti-virus is disabling the crack from functioning properly. It will continue not to work properly until you add it to the exceptions. "

Here is the solutions!

You will need to install the game first. You won't be able to open the keygen since it can't open in Mac, so you will need to find a serial. I found mine on tpb comment section.

Then update your game to 1.1. You can do that by opening the Sims Medieval and let it auto update.

After that, download a 1.1 crack. Copy and replace the content here: The Sims Medieval -> Show Package Contents -> Contents -> Resources -> transgaming -> c_drive -> Program Files -> Electronic Arts -> The Sims Medieval -> Game -> bin

- Go to your sims medieval folder
- Right click on the Sims.app en select ""show package contents""
- Double-click on Info.plist and open with TextEditor
- Search for SMLauncher.exe and change it to TSM.exe
- Save it and close.
- no go to your Application folder and start sims normally (sims.app)"

Install the game first.
then copy the RELOADED crack over to your folder ( Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims Medieval\Game\Bin ).

After that, download a 1.1 crack. this one (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6261577/The_Sims_Medieval-RELOADED_CRACK_ONLY_DiBYA)

open up the crack folder and open up the .rar file (I use UnRarX its free also) take all the files that were un .rar-ed (accept the Readme@DiBYA.txt) and Replace the content here: The Sims Medieval -> Show Package Contents -> Contents -> Resources -> transgaming -> c_drive -> Program Files -> Electronic Arts -> The Sims Medieval -> Game -> bin

just drag those three files over and  Finder will ask do you want to replace these files? and say ok.

close all unnecessary windows and

- Go to your sims medieval folder again (in your applications folder)
- Right click on the The Simsâ„¢ Medieval.app en select ""show package contents""
-open the contents folder
- Double-click on Info.plist and open with TextEditor
- Search for SMLauncher.exe and change it to TSM.ex_ (its in the middle of the length of text one of the longer sentences)
- Save it and close.
- now close everything that you have open and play the The Simsâ„¢ Medieval.app!

Did you actually MOUNT the iso or did you just extract it? You need to mount the iso or it's gonna tell you the disc thing"

,scarfacegr,2011-05-25T08:07Z,GUYS help here! does anyone know if this game works perfectly? because i downloaded one of the other(that which has 3000+ seeders) and i couldnt save my game's progress. does anyone know if save works perfectly? answer to me if u know and u have played the game. dont tell me bullshit. if u r completely sure and u had saved your game and after u found it and u could load it answer me plzzzzzzzzz :/
,scarfacegr,2011-05-25T08:11Z,@Bassel2 r u a fucking idiot or is this a joke? if it works perfectly why should i buy it and not to download it like u? r u stupid?
,Horseband,2011-05-26T22:40Z,"@scarfacegr

There have been 9 fucking pages of people saying it works perfectly.  There is a dude on the SAME page as your comment that states ""100% working."" 

No one is going to even try to help you if you can't even spend 10 seconds reading."
,scarfacegr,2011-05-27T10:31Z,"@Horseband sure man but the other torrent has also many people who say that it works 100% but it doesnt work. in addition it has +54 and and 3000+ seeders but it doent work not only for me but also for many other people. if u also spend 10 sec to read he comments there u will se that im wright. people see that game works and they write immediatly that it is a good torrent and it is working 100% and when they see that is doesnt they just delete it without write any comments. thats why im asking for clear answers which will say that "" yes im playing this game and everything is alright, just like saving"" is it so difficult?"

I have changed the file TSM.ex_ to a .exe and replaced it. i have also tried changing the crack that the game has and made it start up using the crack files and nothing is working. is this a NO CD/DVD crack? or should i burn a disk and try it that way?
