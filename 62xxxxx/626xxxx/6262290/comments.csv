,elpapacito,2011-04-10T03:29Z,"According to Spybot Search and Destroy, the keygen file is infected by the Virtumonde trojan"
,5iTH,2011-04-19T19:21Z,"The patch and license work perfectly fine and the program is complete. However, the installation process has to be carried out in Japanese. Make of this what you will, it posed no real problem to me."
,Deezelous,2011-04-20T09:09Z,"This doesn't work for me. Using Windows Vista, after downloading and installing everything I opened the keygen and saved the .ja.lic file. Then, when I hit Patch it says ""access denied"" and closes... maybe it's something to do with my own settings but there you go... Will update my comment if I get it fixed."
,Deezelous,2011-04-20T09:20Z,"Yes, it was my own system's error, when I selected the keygen, right clicked on it, and chose ""run as administrator"" the program patched and worked perfectly. Thanks!!!"
,akhnaten,2011-04-24T23:02Z,Works perfectly for Windows 7 64bit.  Just remember to right click on the serial generator and run as admin.  It will successfully path.  The instructions say to turn off the updates...do you mean the license renewal?  Thanks uploader!
,akhnaten,2011-04-24T23:03Z,"nevermind, I see it just popped up to turn it off after selecting 'new project'.  Also hit close when it asks to update."

Para conseguir ler o aplicativo em ingles,quem tem windows xp em portugues,deve achar esses arquivos e renomear o final deles ex:

C:\Arquivos de programas\Pegasys Inc\TMPGEnc Video Mastering Works 5

TMPGEncVMW5.NL para TMPGEncVMW5.PT
TMPGEncVMW5Encoder.NL para TMPGEncVMW5Encoder.PT
TMPGEncVMW5Batch.NL para TMPGEncVMW5Batch.PT

C:\Arquivos de programas\Pegasys Inc\TMPGEnc Video Mastering Works 5\Information

pegasysinfo_tvmw5.NL para pegasysinfo_tvmw5.PT

Fazendo isso a traduĂÂ§ao de japones para ingles ira funcionar..."
,basha04,2011-05-12T15:11Z,is there a chance for 5.0.6.38?
,elite_fascism,2011-05-17T20:20Z,"Thanks!  Great upload!  

I just bought software called TimeCode Pro from InData.  I would love it if you could crack their shit so that they can't charge me to use their software that I bought from them."
,dubblie,2011-06-01T05:37Z,"!!!! NOTEE !!!! Change ALL .RU extensions to .EN !!!!! DO NOT use .ES that is a typo. .EN is the extension for english not .ES

That is all."
,blahblah1,2011-07-08T04:41Z,"1 .- Install the program, do not start it.
2 .- Run the Keygen and click ""Patch"", then ""Generate""
3 .- Go to the folder ""C: \ Program Files \ Pegasys Inc \ TMPGEnc Video Mastering Works 5"" (where you installed the program)
     And rename the following files:

1. TMPGEncVMW5.RU?> TMPGEncVMW5.ES

2. TMPGEncVMW5Batch.RU?> TMPGEncVMW5Batch.ES

3. TMPGEncVMW5Encoder.RU?> TMPGEncVMW5Encoder.ES

4. Information \ pegasysinfo_tvmw5.RU?> Information \ pegasysinfo_tvmw5.ES

Success!!

,popie543,2011-07-08T16:26Z,"This version does install on Windows 7 64 bits, but even after running all the patches half of the menus is in japanese..... so better look for another version :("
,popie543,2011-07-12T19:25Z,"Comment on my previous comment: When you have a non english Windows XP/7, you need to rename 
TMPGEncVMW5.EN
TMPGEncVMW5Encoder.EN
TMPGEncVMW5Batch.EN
pegasysinfo_tvmw5.EN

into xxxxxx.CC, whet CC is country code
NL = Dutch
FR = France
PL = Polish
etc

After doing this, it works excellent!!!"
,jayef,2011-08-06T02:24Z,"hey popie .. thanks so much, after changing it to .DE it switched perfectly so i can read it in english, thanks"
,truthy,2012-01-10T16:11Z,"NOTE: even after installing, patching/cracking and applying the english language patch you still have to rename the 3 files in the programm folder to your locale to fully change the language. eg. if you'r using a english windows .EN will be fine - german .DE spanish .ES and so on! then it will be english and not japanese anymore."
,truthy,2012-02-10T11:10Z,"IMPORTANT NOTE:

if you like me mainly want to use this software to create custom dvd menus you'r out of luck as this feature is not available - you'll have to use authoring works for that."
,dsguardian,2012-03-20T23:45Z,"So has anyone been able to get the new TMPGEnc Authoring Works 5?  (The full retail version, not the trial version.)  Would someone be able to post that please?"
