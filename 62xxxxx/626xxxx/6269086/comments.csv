,jazchill,2011-09-07T08:23Z,"Worked perfectly. I didn't use any of the supplied serials here. Instead, I used the keygen from the Windows version (run it on separate Windows laptop) and it worked. After installing successfully, I went to Help>Check for Updates and downloaded version 11.0v4 (about 204MB), installed it successfully. Thanks for Sharing, Cyberpiraten. "
,jazchill,2011-09-07T08:28Z,"BTW, I installed it on Lion OS X version 10.7. Also, I didn't try to register and will never as it is not needed to run the program. "
