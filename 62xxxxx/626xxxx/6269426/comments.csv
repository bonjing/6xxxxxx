,sh0tgunfacelift,2011-04-07T04:51Z,I could not agree more this band is trash.
,starpilotstarpilot,2011-04-10T06:28Z,then why upload a torrent of it? what a waste.
,kingpin78,2011-04-13T17:14Z,What are people talking about Otep rocks.
,sh0tgunfacelift,2011-04-22T20:41Z,"kingpin78 I really did like Oteps old stuff then she started getting more whiney and started to sound like shit then she put communist politics in the mix and ruined the band for good.

starpilotstarpilot so others can hear it unlike you I'm not pc I don't bash things just because someone disagrees with me. PS Your Band Still Sucks."
,artsyLez,2011-04-25T11:54Z,"guess what: she's doing her thing & winning ... y'all are whining about an artist?
WTF: maybe y'all should try to do more than jerk off.
sh0tgunfacelift I'm nor PC either, I'm not cruel either. But you, however, are an ass!
Now stop moaning & ""make something"" or fo&d!"
,artsyLez,2011-04-25T11:57Z,"and yes:
I'm a muscian & artist, I'm ""making"" it, my music's even torrentable ... & I've never given a straight f* whether others like it or not.
If you don't like it or get it: its not for you - *its _about_ you*!"
