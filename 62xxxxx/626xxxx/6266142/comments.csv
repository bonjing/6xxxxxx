,Ramsay21,2011-03-27T08:31Z,does the dlc works with this release?
,escarabajo_demolition,2011-03-28T16:25Z,"Ramsay21:
Yes, works"
,Ramsay21,2011-03-29T05:35Z,"ok
thanks for the info

by the way why, this torrent is not coming if searched on the piratebay?

I see that you have written ""assasin's creed brotherhood"" which is a wrong spelling of the game.

Can you edit the title again to ""Assassin's Creed brotherhood"", so that other people can also enjoy this ripped version of yours; and more seeders jump into it.

Thanks"

PLEASE  give me a solution..........."

256VGA?
google's search : Can you run it?
"
,randolljames,2011-04-14T18:17Z,"the minimum vga is 256...   that doesn't mean the game won't work with 256vga.....   anyway,  I will uninstall vista and reinstall XP...   because vista gives more problems than xp....  you know what I mean..   too much requirements for vista ;)"

,Coolboy52,2011-05-03T21:45Z,"Okay, game is working fine now. But when I walk or do something else, it goes really slow. Looks like I'm constantly playing in slow-mo. Would the update fix that. And if I already played the game and install the update now, will everything so far be lost?"
,beau75,2011-05-07T01:42Z,"@Coolboy52
Does your computer meet the requirements for the game? (google Can You Run It? and find the game) If you update the game to a newer version it shouldn't delete any saved games."
,paok1993,2011-05-22T13:27Z,"Can someone help me!!!
I can play the game, but there isn't save.
If a stop play, the next time a can't continue and i always begin to play from the begin. Why there isn't the save?????  "
,Vecerina,2011-05-30T11:03Z,@ paok1993 You have to find the ACBSP file in the install folder and run it as administrator. At least that helped me in win 7.

,Nsquirrel,2012-01-26T20:36Z,"What's ripped away from the original game, cuz it's almost half the size it's normally found on other torrents, please explain

Also People don't be stupid it's not the same to have a 2gb Vram Radeon 6400 than a  1gb Vram Radeon 6850, Vram is not the most important thing on a video card if such was the case there would be no need for a GPU to work apart of a CPU  also the minimum requirement is a Nvidia 9500  or a Radeon 4550 both of which are pretty cheap cards unless you are some kind of money less asshole who must get their anus penetrated by niggers in order to get some money to buy crack cocaine from said niggers
