- Install SP2 with SW2011-SP2.0-x64-Updates\ SolidWorks\ SolidWorks Core Update\ sw2011-0.0-2.0-x.msp
- Crack using the SP2 crack

@mrcad
I had the same problem: I could not mount the ISO. So I opened the ISO file with Winrar and extracted it. At that point I was able to install SP0.

Every time I open SW I get the 30 days warning poping up, and the count down keep going event if I reapply the crack. Any info on a way to solve that problem?"

,splitzzz,2011-05-30T22:45Z,"Well, you guys are pretty pathetic. 
To use this, you don't need any previous installations. Stop asking.

Here are some overly detailed installation instructions:

Mount the file SW2011_sp0_x64_SSQ (the large file) to Deamonn Tools or burn it to a dvd-rw. Open the disc through the program or using a dvd drive. The installer will come up. You'll be on the ""welcome"" tab, click next a few times. On the serial number tab, the first serial number will already be filled in. Click next. You'll get a warning, click next anyway. You'll get a system check, when it's done click next. You'll be on summary. In big red text it will say ""background downloader is on."" To the right of that text, click the ""Change"" button. Uncheck the box and click ""Back to Summary."" Click next. The installation begins. 
Copy cracks from SW2011_sp0.rar (fnp_act_installer, swactwiz_libFNP, swactwiz and swlmwiz) to /setup/i386. If this asks you if you want to overwrite the files, click Yes. Now run the overwritten swactwiz.exe (the one you just put in the /setup/i386 folder). You're done.

For anyone competent, the quick summary provided in the torrent description is enough. If you needed this explanation, feel ashamed."
,mtbhrd,2011-06-03T04:07Z,"...SW2011-SP2-x64-CRACK\SolidWorks is where the serials are located, and a description of what to do.  I think people are getting confused because these serials are in the SP2 folder instead of the SP0."

,mdbliss,2011-06-17T04:07Z,"After installation, I try copy all of the files to /setup/i386 and then run the program swactwiz.exe.  I get the error message: 
Error: Can not initialize library (%d, %d, %d).  How do I get past this error?  Help!"
,maxiddd,2011-06-17T16:48Z,Thanks! Works Great!!
,mdbliss,2011-06-19T07:52Z,"Here are the full and easy instructions on how to install it.  Great work done by SolidSquad!


=================================================
This crack activates SW2011 64bit Premium Edition
=================================================

How it works: after every reboot of computer and start SW crack checks if activation has expired or not and reactivate SW if needed automatically

==================
1. SW installation
==================

1.1. ATTENTION!  Keep in mind that this crack needs original files of SW, so if you have got SW2010 cracked with previous SW2010 SSQ's cracks (with patched sldappu.dll & sldanimateu.dll for SW2010 32bit and patched sldutu.dll for SW2010 64bit) you need to restore original DLL's

	If you did not save original files of SW2010 before patching you need to reinstall you SW2010

1.2 Install SW2010-2011 64bit with this serial number:

		0000 0000 0000 3486 Q5HF FG98

	At SW2010-2011 Setup DO NOT INPUT serials for SW Motion, SW Simulation or SW Flow Simulation!

	To be sure that there are no COSMOS serials in Windows Registry check Registry partitions

	Run ""REGEDIT"" and open to the folders:
		[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\SolidWorks\Licenses\Serial Numbers]
		[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\SolidWorks\Licenses\Serial Numbers]

	and delete (if exist) strings like
		COSMOSMotion
		COSMOSWorks
		COSMOSFloWorks

===================
2. Applying a crack
===================

2.1.  Copy folder ""setup"" from crack to SW2011 program directory and overwrite original one

2.2.  REBOOT you computer!

2.3.  Run SW2011. If all is OK activation will be proceeded automaticaly and SW start to work

	If on some 64bit computes at SW start you will get a warning

	"" Error: Can not initialize library (%d, %d, %d)"" or "" Error: Can not open handle (%d, %d, %d)""

	you need to run \setup\i386\x64_fix\ServiceInst.exe, REBOOT computer and start SW again


==========
3. Remarks
==========

3.1.  If for some reasons you are changing System time of computer be sure to REBOOT computer befor next SW starting

3.2.  If you get problems with automatic reactivation of SW after reboot you can do it manually. To do this, run:

	""\setup\i386\swactwiz.exe"" or ""Start > All Programs > SolidWorks 2011 (2010) > SolidWorks Tools > SolidNetWork License Manager""

3.2.  If on some Vista/Win7 computers you will get problems with activation eDrawings 2011 32bit\64bit to Professional Edition you can use local crack for eDrawins2011. With this crack you can use eDrawings both as Stand Alone (without SW installation) and Embelled (with SW installation)"
,wulwa,2011-06-23T00:43Z,"Hmm! well this is the first comment I'm writing.

It's really cool to find this working nice and smooth. I love this software.

My problem is that I installed clean and followed all the instructions in the readme file and the comments here. Only issue is it starts as standard version of service pack 0.0, instead of pro version of sp 2. Now how on earth do I do it.

Also, in any case could there be sp 4 available."
,wulwa,2011-06-23T04:38Z,"My oh my!!! I got it all as clear as the crystal itself.

Well ignore the previous comment of mine as I bow in honor to the original crackers and turbolog and all others who did real good effort in the comment sections.

Guys this thing works as smooth as a walk on butter.

Every fucking thing in the pack works. Remember one may consider reapplying the cracks after patching as patches reset the cracks to originals.

Love you all.

,comnir,2011-09-11T16:42Z,"If only the splash screen appears and the message of ""thank you for yousing SolidSquad..."", than I think it means your 30 days of trial are over. 

However, if you run swactwiz.exe (like you should have done when you first installed it and it made it work than) again, it will reset the trial time and the SW will load again. 

About SP2, it needs the ORIGINAL installation files of SW to install. If you applied the trial reset and changed the files, I think it won't work - but I didn't try it at all and left with SP0."
