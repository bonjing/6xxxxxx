1. Burn the DVD images on DOUBLE-LAYER DVD+R or mount via Alcohol 120% or Daemon Tools.
2. Point to X:/sldim/sldim.exe, where X is your DVD letter
3. Install and use the enclosed serial
4. Copy cracks from SolidSQUAD.rar to <SW installation dir>/setup/i386 and run and run the overwritten swactwiz.exe
5.Enjoy!


ATTENTION!
Keep in mind that SP2 crack needs original files of SW, so if you have got SW2010 cracked with previous SW2010 SSQ's cracks (with patched sldappu.dll & sldanimateu.dll for SW2010 32bit and patched sldutu.dll for SW2010 64bit) you need to restore original DLL's
If you did not save original files of SW2010 befor patching you need to reinstall you SW2010
