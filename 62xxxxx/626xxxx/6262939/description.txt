The first blood libel of the 21st century that legitimized targeting children with terror.

Prior to Mohamed Al Dura Israeli children where not generally made the targets of terror attacks. After the Mohamed Al Dura incident we saw the bombing at the Dolphinarium Discotheque which killed 21 children http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphinarium_discotheque_suicide_bombing , missiles aimed at kindergartens etc. etc. etc...

This is a 2 hour documentary regarding the staged death of Mohamed Al Dura, the subsequent coverup, the medias disregard for truth and lack of journalistic integrity, the court case of Philippe Karsenty who proved the fraud committed by France2, and the Israeli public reaction which till today is largely ignorant of the facts of this case.

This documentary is in German, French, Arabic, English and Hebrew with hardcoded Hebrew subs where appropriate. A volunteer to create a English translation is needed.
