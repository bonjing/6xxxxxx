Fledermaus Professional is a powerful 3D data visualization
system that uses the same core technologies as Fledermaus
Standard, plus adds a sophisticated Area Based Editing
module, cable and route planning, and real-time tracking of
objects. Fledermaus Professional is used in a variety of
applications such as swath bathymetry editing and quality
control, marine construction, military applications, and
coastal zone mapping.

Featuring the same intuitive data display as Fledermaus
Standard, Fledermaus Professional is capable of visualizing
large volumes of data of numerous types in a single 3D
scene with the powerful ShiftScapeTM rendering engine. Data
display can be controlled with the Bat, an intuitive 6
degree of freedom input device.

A wide variety of industry standard formats are supported
for direct import of data to the 3D scene, and Fledermaus
also allows data from remotely operated vehicles, ships or
other entities, to be visualized in real-time. Due to its
flexible object oriented software design, Fledermaus can be
easily tailored to support many additional visualization
modules.
