Title: War Games / Cool Out


Red Math lays down his first release of 2011 in the shape of dance floor smashers War Zone and Cool Out.

A hard hitting barrage of Drum & Bass and Dubstep layered with growling bass lines and dangerously heavy beats set against an ominous sci-fi vista in true Red Math style.
