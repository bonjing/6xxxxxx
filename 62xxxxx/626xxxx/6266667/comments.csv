the movie without a doubt is not as funny as its predecessors. but i don't think it warranted the 9% rating on RT. i mean.. 9% should be an unwatchable and utterly horrid film. i thought this was completely watchable. just not as many laughs and jessica alba's character is annoying as fuck."

Movie is lame, Stiller and Polo are just too old to pull off the ""father in law"" gags anymore. Alba was very entertaining, too bad she didn't have a leading part though."

Included in the email was the original correspondence from NBC which looked just like the attachment zeb00 posted on page 3 of the comments. I don't have Comcast, and you will only receive the email through your account with your ISP. I suggest you run this through Tor proxy servers if your gonna pull this one in.
