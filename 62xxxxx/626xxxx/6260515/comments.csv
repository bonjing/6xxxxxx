,bitrot23,2011-04-23T23:45Z,"Transmission says: ""Made.In.Hungary.2009.720p.BluRay.x264-FLHD.6260515.TPB-2.torrent"" is not a valid torrent file."
,bitrot23,2011-04-24T02:03Z,"Looks like the Korean spam files included in this torrent are to blame. The magnet link fails for the same reason. 

Transmission requires that the torrent adhere to the specifications, which are UTF8 encoded characters only.

I have never had any other torrent of yours fail. Sorry for the hassle. Would you be so kind as to remove this junk from the torrent? "
,ohyesiwill,2011-05-06T23:55Z,"ÂľTorrent works, but after several days the torrent seems dead. There are not any seeders on all the time, just sporadic, and only a few peers as well. I guess because of the invalid errors with most clients. Too bad this wasn't done properly so it could survive. If I can manage to get it all, I will re-up a proper torrent and seed the fucking thing - minus the spam shit "
