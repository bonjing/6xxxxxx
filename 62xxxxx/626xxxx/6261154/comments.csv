You are making yourself look dumb. I  like that you are trying to be smart by listing what you think are facts and then spamming every recent movie listing. 

Here is a bit of information that will help you figure what quality the movies will be, jackass.

TELESYNC (TS)

A telesync is the same as a CAM except it uses an external audio source (most likely an audio jack in the chair for the hearing impaired). A direct audio source does not ensure a good quality audio source, as a lot of background noise can interfere. A lot of the times a telesync is filmed in an empty cinema or from the projection booth with a professional camera, giving a better picture quality. Quality ranges drastically, check the sample before downloading the full release. A high percentage of Telesyncs are CAMs that have been mislabeled.

TELECINE (TC)

A telecine machine copies the film digitally from the reels. Sound and picture should be very good, but due to the equipment involved and cost telecines are fairly uncommon. Generally the film will be in correct aspect ratio, although 4:3 telecines have existed. TC should not be confused with TimeCode , which is a visible counter on screen throughout the film. Most R5 releases are Telecines.

Stick to looking for R5s and for the love of god quit making dumb posts.

Thanks."
