,Arse_Done_69,2011-04-01T09:13Z,How do I seed if I cannot even download the whole torrent???
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-04-05T13:51Z,"Sorry about that, it's because of Leechers, I will start to seed this again"
,g00ber510,2011-04-07T09:08Z,"Maybe make your settings to seed to two people per redvblue torrent, that way it'll eventually flow downhill and fill up everyone."
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-04-10T04:05Z,"I started to leave Utorrent running, literally all day, I will continue to do this until I have sufficient seeders, but please seed after download completes, it will help...everyone out."
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-04-10T04:27Z,"I am currently leaving my PC on all day, until I get more seeders."
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-04-10T04:27Z,"If I get at least 6 seeders on each of the seasons, I will upload DVD quality of seasons 1-3, I also have DVD quality of 4-5, I will upload those, as soon as I get sufficient seeders for the first 3 DVD quality seasons."
,sith447,2011-05-06T21:28Z,come on seed it's suck at 11.9%!
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-05-13T03:00Z,"I'm trying man, I've almost seeded it two times as much as the other one's so far, I'll keep seeding until I get more seeders."

,Orbitalcortex,2011-05-13T13:26Z,suck at 99.6..
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-05-27T07:52Z,"Finally all the series have been sufficiently seeded, I have uploaded Season 1 on DVD already, it is a complete DVD rip."
,usa3004,2011-07-06T02:55Z,Ive downloaded your seasons of Rd vs Blue to put onto a portable hardrive and connect to my PS3 to watch it like all my other movies but it shows up unsupported data! why?! help me please.
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-08-31T21:55Z,@usa3004. The videos I uploaded are in mp4 format. You're device may not recognize it. If it's a different format then just download a video conversion software. There are a lot of them out there. If that's not you're problem then comment back.
,usa3004,2011-09-24T04:57Z,I did it!!!=) THANK YOU. Keep uploading and doing what your doing.
,EternalHidan,2011-10-11T12:34Z,"Hi there, I was wondering why its one big file? Just wondering if its like one big movie with all the episodes in it, i'm used to getting episodes as seperate files so im curious."
,Omar3rd,2012-02-05T22:38Z,People should appreciate what you're doing here more. Instead of being all frustrated and mad at you when you don't HAVE to do this.
