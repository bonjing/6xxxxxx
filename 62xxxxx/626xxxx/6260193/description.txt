Memphis Slim Every Day I Have The Blues 
Label: Prism
Released: January 2009
Format: Flac


Memphis Slim bridged the gap between rural juke joint barrelhouse piano and the emerging uptown blues styles of the late 1940s. This fine collection of 78s, recorded between 1940 and 1948 on a variety of small labels, illustrates what a fine singer and writer he was, in addition to showcasing his piano skills. The stately title track was written and recorded by Slim originally in 1948, under the title \"Nobody Loves Me.\" Lowell Fulson covered it a few years later, changing its title to \"Every Day I Have the Blues,\" and both B.B. King and Joe Williams had hits with it under that title in 1955. , along with the joyful \"Old Taylor\" and \"Blues at Midnight,\" which features the great Jazz Gillum on harmonica.
