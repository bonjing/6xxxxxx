Someone has been recording some tv-show and put on their own homemade sounds and edited around the show to a mess.
Fucking mongoloid!"

A/9 
V/9 
Synopsis: The film offers a unique insight into the world of Gigerâ€˜s creation and his private life. In addition to the interview with the artist himself, a considerable part of the documentary is formed by interviews with personalities such as Ernst Fuchs, Stanislav Grof and Debbie Harry. Though the authors do not avoid particular developmental periods of Gigerâ€˜s work, the main purpose was not to create the artistâ€˜s biography. In this case, it is more likely considered to be an authentic perspective on the peculiar world of this Swiss surrealist artist.          
Good documentary about H.R.Gigerâ€˜s work (Like the artwork for the movie Alien) 
Many Thanx to JETSET for the Great rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a quick download...:)"
