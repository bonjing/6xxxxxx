It obviously is a good scanner if it picked it up. I'm not computer illiterate "
,anarchist9027,2011-03-24T07:04Z,I understand false positives but why would a trojan unpack from an unmodified kaspersky exe and not from the crack it self??
[V],scene4all,2011-03-24T09:26Z,"LOL the only thing that i can think of is, Microsoft doesn't want you do use Kaspersky that's it."
,phx87,2011-03-25T06:03Z,"Found 1 suspicious file after extracting with Winrar..

The Pure itself has been named into PURE91~1.EXE

And the suspicious file was REG~1.EXE

And found by my Kaspersky Internet Security as win32.trojan.win32.diple.hum

What are you doing skull ?? by placing this suspicious file without letting the user know what it does ??"
,lmnmst,2011-03-25T07:29Z,"same like phx87, My KIS detecting pure9.1.0.124.exe as win32.trojan.win32.diple.hum.
please confirm us.."
[V],scene4all,2011-03-25T10:21Z,"Guys if there was a torjan in the pure installer i wouldn't have installed it my self, the only thing that may detect as a torjan is the fltlib.dll but that is a false positive any ways if u don't trust me then go to the kaspersky site and download the installer from there."
,.piper.,2011-03-25T10:40Z,"ya same here..i just wanted to test the program but my kis caught win32.trojan.win32.diple.hum in the exe itself and asked for restart after that kis deletes the .exe file.
No offence to the uploader as he is trusted and i assume its just a false notification. :)"
,whys0seri0us,2011-03-30T02:57Z,The key no longer works even with the Universal  Shield option.
,treacherous_hawk,2011-03-31T05:28Z,"i was able to install it per instructions, it did not update as was getting error. restarted computer, now would not even open...any suggestion?"
,vivekrko,2011-04-05T04:32Z,"I agree with @treacherous_hawk. I installed the patch accordingly but after installation the Kaspersky application doesn't start up automatically or even after I double-click the PURE icon! Also, trojans are not the problem here. You just get 3 warnings which you have to ignore. That's it! @scene4all, Plz find a key ASAP coz my PURE key (the 30-day trial key) is going to expire tomorrow (6th April, 2011)"
,H_0_o_d,2011-04-06T02:28Z,Is there any legit way to tell if something is a virus besides the False-Ps that AVs give?
,peegee23,2011-04-18T02:34Z,the .exe file should be always clean. if the file flagged by your AV is the patch file (fltlib.dll) then it's just a false positive because of it's hacking capability. 
,teddy0209,2011-04-28T13:04Z,"Guys, you don't have to use the installer provided by the uploader. You can download the original from kaspersky. Or, just remove the trojan... =)"
,ryder1954,2011-04-29T06:59Z,Virus infected piece of shit
,Oechikr,2011-06-01T09:26Z,this shit fucked up my computer and gave me a bluescreen... had to fucking reinstall os
