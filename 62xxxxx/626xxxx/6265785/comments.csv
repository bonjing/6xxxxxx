I've been looking into getting all the extant issues of Orc Stain, among other series.  Do you by chance have them all or know where they can be found?  Sorry if this is an inappropriate means of contact, but I'm new to Pirate Bay and I'm not sure what the best way is.  Any help would be immensely appreciated."
