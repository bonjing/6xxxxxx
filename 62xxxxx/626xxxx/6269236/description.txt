Deep Purple - Masters from the Vaults (2003)





Description:



Rare Deep Purple performing for the TV cameras in Europe during the early seventies.
Included here are the songs that propelled the band to greatness.
Also featured are the earliest known recordings of the classic Mark II line up of Blackmore, Lord, Paice, Gillan and Glover.
This is Deep Purple putting new material through it's paces that would ultimately surface on the legendary first album,
'Deep Purple in Rock', including the earliest versions of the all time classics 'Speed King' and 'Child in Time'.
A unique feature of the material is the time and space allocated to Ritchie Blackmore to stretch out
and demonstrate the amazing virtuoso technique.

Deep Purple's Masters from the Vaults contains material from three different sources:

1)Live Performance from Granada Television Studios in England from 1970,
2)Live Performances on German TV from 1971 and/or 72,
3)Live Concert Performance of the Ian Gillan Band from 1989.
The Granada footage is the same as Deep Purple Doing Their Thing.
There is no additional footage from Doing Their Thing, however, the sound/picture quality is much better than the old videotape that I have.
There are 4 songs from this show: Speed King, Child in Time, Wring That Neck, and Mandrake Root. Good Points:
The band is scintilating! Ritchie tears it up!!! No doubt about it. Everyone else is so good. To me,
this is the best Video material of old Deep Purple excluding Smoke On The Water from the Machine Head DVD that was taken from
a 1973 TV special. When is the rest of that concert going to come out? Bad Points: Excluding Child in Time,
all the songs were cut down in order to fit into a 30 minute TV program about Deep Purple.
It's just too bad that the rest of the songs weren't preserved for future release.
The German TV material is the Deep Purple Special Edition EP.
The 3 songs are No No No, Highway Star and Hallelujah. No No No is the best.
Singing and playing are right on, with Ritchie wearing his Witches hat and looking like a possessed Warlock.
Highway Star is pretty good, a song that hadn't been fully conceived yet. No Bach arpeggios from Ritchie here.
Hallelujah is lipsynced but is fantastic. The Ian Gillan Band material is much better than I thought it would be.
