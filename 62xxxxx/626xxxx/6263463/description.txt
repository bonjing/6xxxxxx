Finally, you have a long-awaited possibility to
experience unique material. The second release of
Sonic Chakras Records, debut album by Already Maged
'Liber Scientia'. Come and enter into a nine part
ritual of this magic voyage to learn the free
doctrine.

We would like to take the
opportunity to point out that psytrance
needs YOUR SUPPORT. We only want to
give you a preview in psytrance,
ambient and electronic music and
in our opinion this is absolutely
NO alternative to buying

MP3 isnt the same as holding a
bought record in your hands

You need to feel the bass to go with the
flow ... and that's what mp3 just can't
give you. So better get it in high
quality, while it's still available
and not soldout

Please support the artists and
especially smaller labels that make
it possible to enjoy the music you
seem to love that much

Our releases are for scene internal use so
KEEP THEM OFF P2P AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES

So much for now
meet ya  the next party ... somewhere

MYCEL - sending lamers to /dev/null since 2003

We bow our heads to our old friends.

Deep respect to you

Also we would like to greet all of the

still alive quality scenegroups/sceners

Ascii done with love to my lil d3vil
