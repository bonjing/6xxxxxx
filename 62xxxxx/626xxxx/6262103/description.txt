Keating has gathered a host of talented players together for her fourth album combining a great mix of instrumentation the albums includes contributions from Trina Hamlin and Bo Ramsey, the result is her strongest album to date and I highly recommend itâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦but dï»¿onâ€™t just take my word on it Keating has being championed by Bob Harris and appeared on his Thursday night show in 2008, thereâ€™s not a dud or filler track to be found on this album â€“ hereâ€™s the first and the last track, the in-between is just as good.
