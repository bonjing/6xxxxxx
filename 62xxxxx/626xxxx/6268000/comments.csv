there is nothing in quran about preventing woman from driving car, IT IS ALLOWED IN ISLAM, it is only prevented in Saudi Arabia which at no way represent islam, you know some of  their princes drink alcohol and no one punish even islam prohibit that , but they only prevent normal people, so don't judge by them

but  if you mean islam has'nt covered  that point then you are wrong, it is actually comprehensive, but it does'nt have to take every case individually,  Muhammed _peace upon him_ said : (( what ever is not forbidden is allowed)), by this word you can look for something and if it is not forbiden then it is allowed, that is how islam is comprehensive.

about smoking.......it is not mentioned directly, but in quran in Surat Al-Baqarah ayah195 : (((do not throw [yourselves] with your [own] hands into destruction))), and Muhammed _peace Upon him_ has said much about prohibiting anything that bring harm to you......and since smoking is harmfull for health then it should be avoided,,


and let me talk to those who talk about no freedom in islam,,,,,   actually it give a full freedom , BUT BUT BUT BUT BUT BUT
this freedom is restricted when it start to harm others or even youreslf, so what  freedom your community provide?????? stealing, illegal sex, gays, eating and  drinking bad food that affect your health negatively????? do you think that when a drunk drive a car and kill people this is a freedom??? what the hell is a freedom that make all the others unsafe from robbery or raped ?? or what a freedom that make you harm your self then others by smoking or drinking"
