"Critical Film Studies"

Capitalizing on Abed's (Danny Pudi) love 
of cinema and pop culture, Jeff (Joel 
Mchale) plans a very special Pulp Fiction
style surprise party for Abed's birthday. 
The tables turn, however, and while the 
study group awaits their arrival at a 
restaurant, Abed stages another dinner 
with an unsuspecting Jeff at another 
restaurant.

Enjoy :)
