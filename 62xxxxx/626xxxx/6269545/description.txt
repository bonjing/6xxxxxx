Game Notes
~~~~~~~~~~
Engage the enemy in a series of all-new WWII missions in this Expansion Pack for Medal of Honor
Allied Assault. Drop behind enemy lines on D-Day, escort a supply truck to safety, and locate top-
secret documents in Berlin before the Russians lay siege to the city. Your tour of duty continues now.
A few hours after escorting the supply truck to your fellow soldiers, youre all finally sitting
around enjoying some of the hard-fought spoils of combat. In a flash, the scene turns to chaos. A
barrage of enemy shells shatters the nighttime quiet, and youre in the midst of an all-out firefight.
With German infantry and tanks storming across the open field, youll need to think fast. From picking
off the enemy one at a time with your sniper rifle, to mowing them down with a mounted machine-gun, to
taking out Tiger tanks with a bazooka, use whatever it takes to stop the advance.

Game Notes
~~~~~~~~~~
Take to the skies in Medal of Honor Airborne, where youll drop into grueling ground attacks in a bid
to turn the tide of WWII. Begin each mission in the air above Axis controlled battlefields, then make
your mark in the largest airborne operations in history. Starting with your jump from a C-47 transport
plane, every choice you make can seal your fate. In the air, control your parachute to select a landing
spot that brings you the greatest strategic advantage. Follow the green smoke to recommended landing
areas where Allied forces will be waiting, or go it alone by landing on rooftops or balconies. But
craft your strategy carefully: every move you make-from your choice of landing spot to the enemies you
engage on the ground-will determine your success in the mission, and whether or not you are truly one
of the Airborne elite.

Game Notes
~~~~~~~~~~
When the mission must not fail, the National Command Authority calls in the Tier 1 Operators. And we
re not talking about those guys who sell candles and wicker chairs. We re talking "Tier" 1 with a
"T." They are the best of the best the elite-est of the elite. To give you an idea of just how elite
they are, more than 2 million Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines serve in our armed forces. Out of
those 2 million, about 50,000 fall under the direct control of Special Operations Command. Although
their exact numbers are classified, only a few hundred out of those 50,000 make the cut as a Tier 1
Operator. They are living, breathing, precision instruments of war. They are experts in the application
of violence. And out of those few hundred, only one, namely you, will step into the boots of one of
these elite warriors in the hostile, unforgiving battlefield conditions in present-day Afghanistan. Do
you think you have what it takes to confront a new enemy who improvises mercilessly in a new kind of
war? Do you think you have what it takes to be Tier 1? We dare you.
