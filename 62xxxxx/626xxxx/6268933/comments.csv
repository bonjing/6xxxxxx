,mjyumping2,2011-03-27T03:19Z,"Don't want a trouble updating the game from the launcher?
Don't want a trouble pasting again and again a crack everytime you update the game?
THEN USE THE ""MINI IMAGE""
Just mount it in Daemon Tools Lite then play the game! YOU CAN FREELY UPDATE THE GAME EVERYTIME! AND NO NECESSARY CRACKS NEEDED EITHER! USE MINI IMAGE!

,Renateb,2011-03-29T17:05Z,Could someone help me please? I downloaded and unrarred but how do install the game? Because the update says I have to install it first but where is the image to mount?

,Renateb,2011-03-30T15:16Z,"Well i'm very sorry if my question is stupid, but i just can't figure it out."
,Skadegladje,2011-03-30T21:53Z,"@Renateb: This is just an update, not the full Sims Medieval game, that's why you can't install it."
,Drama2,2011-03-30T23:51Z,So where can the game be downloaded if this is just an update?
,Drama2,2011-03-30T23:52Z,And why the hell did it take so long to download if its an update?
,cdays_01,2011-03-31T04:56Z,It took me 8 minutes to install with SLOW internet out in the country. The actual game took me 2 days nonstop.
,cdays_01,2011-03-31T04:58Z,"Oh, thank you for the upload Chris!"
,Callofjono,2011-04-03T20:06Z,Great torrent literally downloaded in like a 1 min

Here is the game -

But remember to install this update after you installed the game.

Kudos to you. While that link is dead, you did let me know there is a newer update around."
,rulerdude,2011-05-26T05:53Z,"Works! Thanks! Note: There are like 20 .rar files in the torrent. You only need one of them, because they all are the same thing. IDK why there are so many files of the same thing..."
,Banzay27,2011-06-02T17:56Z,"Good upload, I got it easily.
But I'll point out there's at least a version 1.3.13 out there."
