Statistics show that 2,000 teens get pregnant every day. Moms and dads: Watch this show with your teenagers, because it can impact their lives and yours! Two families face off over who should raise 2-month-old Miley. Paige, 17, and her boyfriend, Jordan, 18, live with Jordanâ€™s dad, Chris, and are determined to raise their child. But Paigeâ€™s stepmom, Nikki, thinks she and her husband should raise Miley, because they can better provide for her. Nikki also thinks Paige should break up with Jordan, and that heâ€™s brainwashing her into doing whatever he wants. The teen dad says that he has stepped up to take care of his girlfriend and baby and that Nikki is the one whoâ€™s controlling. But do his actions show otherwise? See what Dr. Phil says they must do to ensure Miley grows up in a healthy environment. Will the families come to an agreement? Plus, 10 things teens want their parents to know about teen sex, and the biggest mistakes parents donâ€™t know theyâ€™re making!
