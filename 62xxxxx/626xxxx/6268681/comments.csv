These two discs are containing the orchestral works i was searching for (same recordings) and because a lot of people have been stumped with the previous torrent until now, i created this new one.
In addition you get two amazing highlights of Mussorgsky and Stravinsky, whose musical styles fit in very well here.

I'm not a classic fan in general, so please don't ask for the complete edition. Maybe i'll upload some more classics sporadically. 
ATM, I dont't know."
