Boxing legend Mike Tyson always has loved pigeons. They've been a part of his life since childhood. In fact, Mike threw his first punch when a neighborhood bully killed one of his beloved pigeons and threw it in his face. In TAKING ON TYSON, Mike goes beyond raising pigeons to racing them for the first time, and entering the highly competitive subculture of pigeon racing. The stakes are high in a sport that has just as much machismo as boxing.

THIS EPISODE?? Mike Tyson challenges three of the most prestigious pigeon clubs in New York to a high profile charity race to benefit kids from deprived neighborhoods."
