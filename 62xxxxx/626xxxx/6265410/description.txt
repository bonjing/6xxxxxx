PLOT:
In December of 1989, the government of Romanian dictator Nicolai Ceaucescu was in deep trouble. Massive demonstrations have rocked the capital of Bucharest and the ruling Communist Party cannot control the mobs. Naturally, violence breaks out between the secret police and the citizens, resulting in an amplifying of tensions. With his power dissipating, Ceaucescu flees, and the people take over. They raid Party headquarters, and confront the State run TV station. They want to broadcast immediately, hoping to get the military on their side. There are calls for free elections, the releasing of political dissidents, and the need for unity, not infighting. Of course, there are still factions loyal to Ceaucescu attempting the thwart the overthrow, but it is far too little too late.

Eventually, the people succeed. The dictator is caught, tried and executed, and a country that's lived in darkness for decades finally sees the lovely light of freedom. In fact, the majority of that magical glow comes from televisions around the country. Broadcasting for nearly 120 hours straight, poets and pundits, individuals striving to change the political dynamic of Romania have been showing material, some of it captured by amateurs with their own cameras, to illustrate the revolutionary changes first hand. Thanks to directors Harun Farocki and Andrej Ujica, we have a chance to witness many of the most important of these Videograms of a Revolution, to see firsthand how Romanians fought for, and achieved, their independence.
