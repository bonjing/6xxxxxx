,lalilu333,2011-03-22T12:08Z,of course -.-
,Aledd,2011-03-22T17:13Z,Does this go with your RELOADED 'The Sims Medieval' or has that got crack with it?
,LenaIsAPirate,2011-03-26T14:55Z,I'm guessing this isn't the update 1.1 crack... just guessing... sigh.
,mjyumping2,2011-03-27T03:19Z,"Don't want a trouble updating the game from the launcher?
Don't want a trouble pasting again and again a crack everytime you update the game?
THEN USE THE ""MINI IMAGE""
Just mount it in Daemon Tools Lite then play the game! YOU CAN FREELY UPDATE THE GAME EVERYTIME! AND NO NECESSARY CRACKS NEEDED EITHER! USE MINI IMAGE!

For those with MACS

Here is the solutions!

when your done downloading this mount the disk in the The.Sims.Medieval-RELOADED folder 

You will need to install the game first. (You won't be able to open the keygen since it can't open in Mac, so you will need to find a serial. I found mine on tpb comment section.) try one of these 
YAF7-QJKH-MNEP-LMNY-SRLD
BP2S-NQSX-8DBW-48DG-ZRLD
JYDM-2WXX-V7E3-RV72-7RLD

Then update your game.  You can do that by opening the Sims Medieval (the actual app its in a folder in your applications!)  and let it auto update. when it asks would you like to update click ok. let it do its thing.

After that, download a 1.1 crack. this one (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6261577/The_Sims_Medieval-RELOADED_CRACK_ONLY_DiBYA)

open up the crack folder and open up the .rar file (I use UnRarX its free also) take all the files that were un .rar-ed (accept the Readme@DiBYA.txt) and Replace the content here: The Sims Medieval -> Show Package Contents -> Contents -> Resources -> transgaming -> c_drive -> Program Files -> Electronic Arts -> The Sims Medieval -> Game -> bin

just drag those three files over and  Finder will ask do you want to replace these files? and say ok.

close all unnecessary windows and

- Go to your sims medieval folder again (in your applications folder)
- Right click on the The Simsâ„¢ Medieval.app en select ""show package contents""
-open the contents folder
- Double-click on Info.plist and open with TextEditor
- Search for SMLauncher.exe and change it to TSM.ex_ (its in the middle of the length of text one of the longer sentences)
- Save it and close.
- now close everything that you have open and play the The Simsâ„¢ Medieval.app! 


its should work!"
,blirny,2011-04-04T01:53Z,All I want is for it to bypass the internet check.  I have a legal copy but if my internet goes down I tend to want to play my single player games.   I want to still be able to patch and whatnot  I just want to bypass the internet check for when I'm not on the internet.  Will this allow that?

Thanks a lot man!! nice work! It worked just fine."
,Nfvgamer,2011-04-26T07:55Z,"How the hell can i change that file from ex_ to exe??? It's not name to change it, it's freaking file. If you know how why didn't you change it before you uploaded this???"
,ahem1156,2011-05-15T08:44Z,"If you are having problems with the latest patch accepting your keygen, simply go to C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims Medieval\Game\Bin and delete the .ini file called GL.

Seriously, it worked for me 100%. No need for silly programs that don't work! "
,gotdatbobbybrown,2011-05-17T22:19Z,"I'm using this on a mac, and have had some issues.  The game itself is working fine, except that it won't let me quit (I have to force quit), the options screen won't come up, and my game won't save.  It saves my sims, custom patterns, etc., but when I start the game it has me start a new game every time.  Any ideas?"
,scarfacegr,2011-05-25T08:16Z,"GUYS i dont want to ask for the crack, i know it works perfectly since i used it, but i have another problem. the sims medieval game that i have downloaded has a problem. i cant save my games progress and lots of other people had the same problem. if anyone is sure, no bullshit, can give a link to a 100% working download? i mean he has already used it and he could save and load again his game. PLZ HELP!"
,DeeToxicKisses,2011-06-08T22:15Z,Ok so heres my problem. when i frist started out trying to carck it i had forgotten how and so i did a whole bunch of stuff that didnt work till i remeber the right way to do it. so i uninstalled everything and re installed copied over all the cracked content and changed the tsm.ex_ file to TSM.ex but i still get the disc authorization failure. im using a normal computer with windows xp so its not a mac and im am just soo completely lost i made an account just so i could ask for help. is there anybody who can maybe walk me through this so i can figure out what it is im doing wrong?

,Sleeves88,2011-11-02T21:55Z,"Okay, so i've downloaded, cracked and I played. And it was great. Now my problem is that after a few days, I went to play again, and once its loaded, I get the No CD error. I have mounted every possible app image to play and its still not working.. I don't want to have to re-install this :("
