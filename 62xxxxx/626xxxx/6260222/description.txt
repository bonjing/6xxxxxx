In this book, you will develop a better understanding of the
effects of your attitude. Equally important, it will help you see
more clearly how a positive attitude influences not only your
performance but also results achieved by others around you.
Building a positive attitude begins with having confidence
in yourself. Confidence reinforces ability, doubles energy, buttresses
mental faculties, and increases power. Your thoughts will
prompt the force of your conviction, the weight of your decision,
and the power of your confidence.
