This musical production follows the life of Heathcliff (Cliff Richard), the brooding character from Emily Bronte's classic novel WUTHERING HEIGHTS. When young Heathcliff becomes a man, he falls for the troubled Cathy, leading to tragedy on the Yorkshire moors. Richard's turn as Heathcliff was a huge stage success, aided by the lyrics of Tim Rice and music composed by John Farrar.
