,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-04-10T04:33Z,"I am currently leaving my PC seeding all day, until I get more seeders. If I get at least 6 seeders on each of the seasons, I will upload DVD quality of seasons 1-3, I also have DVD quality of 4-5, I will upload those, as soon as I get sufficient seeders for the first 3 DVD quality seasons."
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-04-17T03:52Z,Thankyou everyone for seeding.
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-04-17T03:59Z,How does everyone like it?
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-04-17T04:03Z,"If everyone really wants me to, I could get individual episodes, really all you have to do though, to get them that way, is to download videopad, and split the video, where the episode ends. I have videopad uploaded if you want to check it out"
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-05-27T07:14Z,"Season 1 on DVD is currently up, please seed if you can download it, it is fairly new, so it might take a bit to download. But it is completely ripped off the dvd."
,hybr1dgamerx,2011-05-31T00:08Z,i really like how this is one big video for season 1 and not separate videos.
,hybr1dgamerx,2011-05-31T00:09Z,i`l see if i can seed tonight
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-06-07T06:35Z,"Thanks for that, how's the download coming?"
,MalFusiOn,2011-08-19T23:36Z,Thanks for the upload :) ill be seeding till 1.00 (perhaps more)
