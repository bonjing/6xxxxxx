            Icon , the 4-track big brother to the single-disc    
            Icon, expertly chronicles the Scorpions from their     
            late-'70s and early-'80s heydays through their 010    
            farewell release, Sting in the Tail. Stocked with all  
            of the classic rock radio hits ( â€œRock You Like A      
            Hurricane,â€ â€œNo One Like You,â€ â€œBig City Nightsâ€) and  
            arena ballads ( â€œStill Loving You,â€ â€œWind of           
            Changeâ€), the anthology offers up a near-perfect       
            snapshot of the groupsâ€™ long career.
