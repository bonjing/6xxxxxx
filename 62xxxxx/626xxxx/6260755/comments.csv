,xBigChillinx,2011-03-27T18:36Z,Everyone's all surprised. ALL of his albums have only had one good song on them...
,jaystott,2011-03-28T06:08Z,"Amid bad reviews, Wiz Khalifa is amazing. Downloading now, trusted up-loader so 99.9% sure its not come dirty-ass virus. Thanks Dirty Spy."
,miniditka5,2011-03-28T20:22Z,"xBigChillinx - why are you commenting on this torrent if you don't like Wiz? he's only had a few CDs and mixtapes, that means you only like 4-5 of his songs. you're an idiot. he's definitely gotten mainstream and you could hear it happening in kush & orange juice.  i like this CD better actually, but this isn't old Wiz. it's not the same stuff that got him famous.

great torrent DL in 2min, sounds great, thanks."

,trrevor,2011-03-29T15:26Z,"I am about to download, thanks for posting!

@Jermish: Selling out is deciding to make an album every few mixtapes? Everybody changes their style and the goal is to be successful and make as many people happy as possible. Thanks for posting a worthless comment trying to justify why you wont pay for the album."
,ptynor,2011-03-29T20:17Z,got a shitload of trojans popping up!
,lbomber7,2011-03-30T05:07Z,"Why do people call Wiz a sell out? Does anybody even know the definition of the term? This has always been his style, a bunch of raw simple tracks, many of which barely have a beat or rhythm , and 1 or 2 poppy songs to put on the radio... ""Sell-out""? Am I seriously the only one who remembers SAY YEAH? ... And remembers 3 radio stations playing it at the same time?..."
,flyyyyjay93,2011-03-31T02:40Z,Wiz Is Awfully Overrated! GOOD Music Runs This Bitch!
