Release notes:
enjoy! eXtaCY release has interlacing around the character figures in many 
frames. Also, there is some weird lines that come and go. You can see this
in the boy's face in the png included (as well as the interlacing). eXtaCY
overcropped the right and left sides a little bit too it seems.
