THE STORY OF FILM: AN ODYSSEY. CHAPTER 4.

The arrival of sound in the 1930s changed everything for cinema. This episode revisits the birth of new types of film: screwball comedies, gangster pictures, horror films, westerns and musicals, and discovers the master of most of them, Howard Hawks.

Far away from Hollywood, in England Alfred Hitchcock hits his stride, and French directors become masters of mood.

And the programme reveals what three of the great films of 1939 - The Wizard of Oz, Gone with the Wind and Ninotchka - have in common.
