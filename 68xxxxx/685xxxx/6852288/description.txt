Here we are right now :

In exclusivity to TPB now bringing to you now the very newest and one of the first builds of :
vlc media player 1.3.0-git dated from today : November 29 :)
Beware : Win32 version only for this torrent !!!
What a surprise,insn't it ?
...
No,you are not dreaming anymore,it is not a fake,it is absolutely true anyway.
as usual,this is not an official version and it is a fresh new beta version in develoment by videolan.org with experimental new options and more again aswell.
Btw,the x64 version is also available now but unfortunately crash while its own installation.
That's why i prefer wait a bit again before bringing you also this new one.
Bug has been already sent so we should get a new build soon then.
So please,be patient.
But vlc 1.2.0-pre 2-git seems still continuing to be developed as a new version is also available again from today then...

Will post changelog or release note asap...
Btw,be sure that vlc play quite fine most of mkv movies anyway.

Enjoy and regards
