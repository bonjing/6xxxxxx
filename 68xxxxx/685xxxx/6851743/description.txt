Why are humans so different from every other species on Earth? Did we evolve from ape--or is our intelligence the result of contact with an otherworldly source? Could unexplained advances in human evolution be the work of interstellar beings? 10,000-year-old petroglyphs link our ancient ancestors with star beings. Might evidence of alien contact help unlock the mystery of the Creation of Man?

Release Notes:
There was NO high-definition broadcast of this episode.
Even on the HD channel it was broadcasted in standard definition.
This is as good as it will get and to me it looks pretty damn decent - huge improvement over the previous XviD release.
If/when History HD re-airs the episode in true HD you can count on those wonderful scene guys to release something proper for your viewing enjoyment.
