Why are humans so different from every other species on Earth? Did we evolve from ape--or is our intelligence the result of contact with an otherworldly source? Could unexplained advances in human evolution be the work of interstellar beings? 10,000-year-old petroglyphs link our ancient ancestors with star beings. Might evidence of alien contact help unlock the mystery of the Creation of Man?

Release Notes:
Brand new release. Not a remake of anything that was already available.
This is ripped directly from a legit true HD source if you care to replace your previous SD sourced version.
Enjoy.
 
Also note that tNe is not a team; it's a 1-person operation.
