[T],trialNerror,2011-12-07T06:48Z,"I found out why there is no BRrip of Season 2: there is no blu-ray release of Season 2.  As in you won't even find it at any local retailer.  Physically does not exist. At all. The 720p collection is as good as it's gonna get (for now - until who knows when).

Did a little web searching and apparently there's an issue with blu-ray rights and licensing with A&E/History.
