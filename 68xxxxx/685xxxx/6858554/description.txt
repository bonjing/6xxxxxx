Susan Murphy (a.k.a. Ginormica) and the Monsters are now working with the US government as
special ops. So when an alien presence is detected in Susan's hometown of Modesto, California
-- right before Halloween -- the team is dispatched to investigate. Everything appears normal,
right down to the jack-o-lanterns peering out from every doorstep and windowsill. But when
Halloween arrives, those innocent-looking carved pumpkins reveal themselves for what they
really are mutant aliens. The altered pumpkins then start to implement their fiendish plan to
take over Earth. The Monsters are there to combat the mutant gourds and try to smash their
