Backstreet Boys - Helpless When She Smiles LYRICS

She keeps the secrets in her eyes 
She wraps the truth inside her lies 
And just when I can't take what she's done to me 
She comes to me 
And leads me back to paradise 

She's so hard to hold 
But I can't let go 

I'm a house of cards in a hurricane 
A reckless ride in the pouring rain 
She cuts me and the pain is all I wanna feel 
She dances away just like a child 
She drives me crazy, drives me wild 
But I'm helpless when she smiles (oh when she smiles.. she smiles..)

Maybe I'd fight it if I could (Maybe I'd fight it if I could)
It hurts so bad, but feels so good 
She opens up just like a rose to me 
When she's close to me 
Anything she asked me to, I would 

It's out of control 
But I can't let go 

I'm a house of cards in a hurricane 
A reckless ride in the pouring rain 
She cuts me and the pain is all I wanna feel 
She dances away just like a child 
She drives me crazy, drives me wild 
But I'm helpless when she smiles (oh no.. when she smiles..)

When she looks at me (When she looks at me) 
I get so weak

I'm a house of cards in a hurricane 
A reckless ride in the pouring rain 
She cuts me and the pain is all I wanna feel 
She dances away just like a child 
She drives me crazy, drives me wild 
But I'm helpless when she smiles (oh when she smiles... when she smiles.. she smiles.....)
