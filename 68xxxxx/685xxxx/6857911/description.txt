The More than Complete DC-Now More Completerer!

This forty-eighth alphabetical installment is: DC from To-U

What's This?
     It's a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and M.C. Gaines among others.
       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those "Pre-DC" comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC super-heroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heroes are Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and among many others. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will be some "Post DC" comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c.875-885gb in total. It will take as long as it takes, but it's nearly done I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.

=================================

Projected remaining torrents start and stop letters (and therefore sizes) have been revised, which I'm sure will cause you great concern and upset your plans for the next six months.

Several of these still have significant work needed and the size could go up or down. I'm betting on down for the last 3, though they continue to grow for now. All the cutting will occur when I sort through them after #53.

	Today the list of comics failed to inspire me, so I will entertain you instead  with this panel from a Golden Age Superman story which shows that Superman in his old days was much less of a "boy scout" than he often seems to be today.  sites that don't display in line images can see it at the link provided.
	The banker is here is not the bad guy, or mean, stingy or even stupid. He's a totally innocent man who turned down a requested  business  loan of $5000 (lots more in today's dollars) to a guy ( a logger), whom Superman wanted to help. The businessman was not a good risk, the man apparently had, or at least offered no collateral. The banker was just doing his job, in the best interests of the bank and it's customers. The loan was needed to meet the loggers payroll - not exactly the sort of thing you want to see in a business that wants to borrow from your bank.
	 Superman might have pledged his personal backing for the business as he was planning on using his super powers to protect the logger's business from the actual villain in the piece and help harvest the timber if needed. If that didn't tip the scales (not tangible after all) he could have brought in a big lump of gold or something for collateral. Or maybe he could have found a rich man who owed him a favor to cosign or just loan the guy the money. He might have had time to earn the money by doing super tasks for some business, like digging a mine shaft, moving a hill, delivering huge objects. You know "Powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men?"
	But no. Supermans acts like a freaken mobster running a protection racket!

	So was he just having a bad day? No. In his way Superman was more of a baddass in those day than any Dark knight you care to name. So much so that he goes way beyond "tough guy you might not entirely approve of but respect". Sure today, the "big blue boy scout" disapproves of some of Batman's tactics even though he's a friend, but back then it would have been the pot and the kettle. Batman doesn't exactly respect suspect's constitutional rights, or even those of fairly innocent witnesses. Wether it's breaking and entering to look for evidence or roughing someone up to get him to talk, or maybe just because Batman figures he deserves it, Batman is does what he wants, law or no law. Golden Age Superman makes him look like a piker.  
	He did the tough stuff to crooks, I'll be getting to that, but he also did some lesser stuff that was just acting like a jerk, at best. Ok there's the small things like scanning entire neighborhoods with his x-ray vision (which he never quit to this day). The cops and everyone else are too afraid even to open their mouths about it.  I look inside one little bedroom window and the cops are all over me. I mean if she didn't want to be looked at why didn't she close the curtains? It's a complement really. Women should be flattered, right? Gee they can be unreasonable. So he's a big time peeping Tom, which would get you or me in jail and on a sex offender list. Oh sure it's in a good cause - that makes it ok. But ask all the people who live there. See if all the women are fine with it. He spies on his friends with the x-rays too, not just when hunting for crooks. Of course he also eaves-drops on them.
	BTW did you ever stop to think that vision works by detecting the light reflected back by objects? How much x-rays do you think are reflected back? Not sure if projecting x-rays like a flash light would work at all but that's another topic.
	Breaking and entering? Batman is typically discreet and stealthy and does it to fight some pretty bad guys that may be untouchable by the police. Superman may do that, but when he wants to come in to see you or doesn't care who knows - he does it just for the hell of it.  Superman at times doesn't seem to know how to even use a door. In one story he needs to visit  a radio station.  He flies there, naturally. Does he land outside and walk in? Come through an open window uninvited? ( a very rude thing to do at best, especially to strangers) Oh no. Not dramatic enough I guess. He crashes thought the freaking wall! Huge hole, debris everywhere, heart attacks from the staff all round. Oh but he fixed it later, right? Well.... no. Later that day, just as workmen are finishing off the hurried and costly repairs - he crashes through he same wall again! This still cracks me up, but of course it's a totally dick move. He wants their help, but this is how he treats them. But who would dare to say no after that little demonstration of power and the willingness to use it?  The cost, the disruption, the emotional distress ? Not his problem.  The complete callous indifference to others is staggering.
	Ant his was how he treated the GOOD GUYS! If he thinks' you're in the wrong and he wants you to talk, he doesn't just threaten. His favorite tactic in those days was torture by terror. He'd toss you up in the air a few thousand feet or so and then catch you just in time. Of course he was always saying how next time he might miss, or get bored and wander off. They talked. Some were tougher than others, but they ALL talked. He had other fun stunts too. Smashing a fist though a brick wall an inch from your face, dangling you above a volcano, throwing you horizontal toward a mountain, oh he had lots of imaginative ideas. And when he was done? Like as not he'd leave you on some building's tiny ledge hundreds of feet above the street or perched on a radio tower, always with no way to get down. I recall he once dumped a guy and his car off on a roof - not so bad except the guy really hadn't done anything much and now his car was stuck on a roof. 
	Of course there's the killing. Yes killing.  Sometimes passive (sort of) - It was not uncommon in the early days for him to fight crooks in an airplane, and after disabling the plane, stand by and watch them crash. So they attacked him first right? Sure and even though it was not self defense since they could not have hurt him at all, they had to be stopped, and sometimes hostages rescued. So maybe you figure it's like shooting an intruder in your home, except if the intruder could not possibly harm you and you could easily restrain him for the police. But you shoot him, just on general principals. I won't argue the point. But would you then sit down and have a beer and laugh while watching him bleed to death or would you call the cops who would take him to the hospital? Do you know how much work it's going to be to clean up all that blood? Seriously! Your carpet may be just ru-wined! (Stewie voice). Ru-wined! Worse you might have to strip and redo those fancy hard wood floors, if you are blessed with those. Of course I've raised 4 kids, so it would blend right in with all the other stains and damage. MIght as well get some cherry pie with cool-hwip (stewie).
	But there were the active ones. Sometimes Superman would be in a hurry or just bored with fighting airborne crooks the slow way, giving them some chance to surrender. Maybe that was the point. Somedays he just felt like judge, jury and executioner, and I guess his "code of honor" (ha!) wouldn't let him kill them if they actually surrendered for arrest. Like shooting sitting ducks or taking candy from a baby -  that sort of thing. It's just not done in proper vigilante circles.  So he'd deliberately cause it to crash, or just toss the plane into a mountain. He wasn't so big on letting bad guys drown but I think he did it at least once. I may be imagining that.
	In the silver age this behavior bored him I guess, and all he had left was general jerk behavior. He mostly made do with repeatedly pulling dirty tricks on his friends to "teach them a lesson". Because you know, he always knows what's best for others and has every right to interfere in their lives, sometimes in pretty drastic ways. If he pulled even ONE of the things he was alway doing to Lois, Jimmy, Perry, Lana and others, that would be the end of the friendship fro me. But he probably crushed a stapler or two in one hand, or commented on how far down the ground was from their office and "what a shame it would be if they fell" So they "forgave him".

Today's offering: DC from To-U

Enjoy!

This next does not really belong here using the legal title from the Indica, but I duplicated it from the correct spot because it is so often thought of as just "Trinity", being the wrapper books for the "Trinity Saga" crossover event. This does cause a title collision with the unrelated 52 issue Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman series named "Trinity", which itself might be confused with the Superman-Batman-Wonder Woman-Trinity mini-series which is not named simply "Trinity", but gets called that and sometimes may be listed as v1, and the actual Trinity series v2. But thats horribly wrong.

Tor - Yee old typical caveman-dinosaur story. Old in setting, old in conception (before I was born), old as in outdated ideas (because most people know that that never happened). Not that that matters in the comic book world. I wonder if young earth creationists encourage their kids to read these kinds of stories as there beliefs force them to put humans and dinosaurs together in time, or reject the fossils utterly as deceptions of Satan rather than bones of real animals (rather out of vogue but taught by some once upon a time)
