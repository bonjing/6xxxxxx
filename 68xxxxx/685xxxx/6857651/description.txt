     The young country of Estonia is dancing to the jazzy tune of    
     the 1920's when on December 1, 1924, the capital Tallinn is     
     overrun by members of the Comintern in an attempt to stage a    
     a Communist coup.

       Looking for secure sites all the time. Any nice .eu site     
      would be a great gift for Ltu.                                 
                                                                    
    Also looking for DVDR 2011+ suppliers since DVDR scene is     
      fucked up and only 10% of groups can follow the rules.

       Our releases are made for private viewing only. If you do    
       like this movie, then go and buy a disc, support the film    
       industry. Its always better to hold a copy of original disc  
       in your hands than some digital low-quality crap with poor   
       video and audio qualities.                                   
                                                                    
       Original BDR &gt; 1080p &gt; 720p &gt; BDRip.XviD - isn't same.       
       Original DVD &gt; DVDR &gt; DVDRip.XviD - isn't same.              
       Original audio like DTS or AC3 &gt; MP3 - isn't same neither.   
                                                                    
       Yes, nowdays, half of the industry produces not movies but a 
       crap. Sometimes we pre also a crap stuff, but who knows?     
       Someone might like it. Please, go and buy at least couple    
       of movies in a year, like we do, we do that for you to make  
       you life easier and we do that for ourselves, because we     
       enjoy it and its fun. If you can't get/afford latest DVDs    
       and Blurays, then go buy tickets and go to premieres in      
       theatres.                                                    
                                                                    
       And one more thing. Keep our stuff away from piss2piss and   
       pay2lick. Those lower-life forms didn't deserve shit.
