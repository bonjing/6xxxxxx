[/b][/color] At 23 years old, Jimmy Chance is going nowhere in life.
He skims pools for a living, parties every night and still lives at home with his family, including his parents and his cousin, Mike.


Jimmy's life takes a drastic turn when a chance romantic encounter with Lucy goes awry once he discovers she is a wanted felon.
Months later, when Jimmy pays a visit to the local prison, he discovers Lucy gave birth to their baby, who he is now charged with raising.
