Here's my WP collection. Each is a separate RAR cuz its over 42,000 images and TPB didn't like that. I can't guarantee every image is exactly where its supposed to be and I'm sure there are a few duplicates with different names but hey, you wouldn't expect me to collect over 42,000 wallpapers sober, right? There are certain times of day this will be off so don't freak out if the speed drops to 0kb/s. That just means I'm interneting and need my bandwidth. Anyway, enjoy and leave feedback.
