Plot:
Lisa becomes disheartened when she learns the shocking truth behind the Â“tween litÂ” industry and her beloved fantasy novel characters, but Homer decides to cash in on the craze and forms a team to group-write the next Â“tween litÂ” hit, with the king of fantasy, Neil Gaiman (guest-voicing as himself), lending his expertise to the effort. After catching the eye of a slick industry publisher (guest voice Andy Garcia) at the Springfield Book Fair, the team gets an advanced copy of their work and discovers that the corporate lit business is a bigger operation than they imagined.
