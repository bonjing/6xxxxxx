Amy Klein, former member of Titus Andronicus said ""Del Rey has conquered America with plastic surgery, video games, a regression to nostalgia, and an appeal to the sex drive of every male music critic on the planet"". If you have seen a photo of Amy Klein, you'll quickly understand why she is so pissed! She has a face only a mother could love! If I know one thing about women, it's that much of their self worth is related to how they see themselves in relation to beauty! This is the reality in the world! Amy Klein may be talented, but she will never be as popular as Elizabeth Grant! We live in a society that values image and style and many will say this is unjust! When has the world ever been fair and just! Never! Peace, Phantazm79"
