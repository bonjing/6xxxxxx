Science Documentary hosted by Sir Patrick Moore, published by BBC broadcasted as part of BBC The Sky at Night series in 2006 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

July 1969 saw one of mankind's greatest technological achievements - the first landing on the moon. Unearthing rare archival footage from the BBC, this two-hour documentary compiles the sights, sounds, and electrifying drama of humanity's first footsteps on the moon. Astronomer Sir Patrick Moore and veteran newsmen cover events as they happened from the launchpad in Cape Kennedy, mission control in Houston, and the BBC desk in London.
Follow Apollo 11 astronauts from their preflight breakfast on July 16, 1969, to their splashdown in the Pacific eight days later. Share the suspense of countdown, the thunder of blastoff, the epic 218,096-mile flight--and, of course, Neil Armstrong's "one giant leap for mankind." Interspersed with this live coverage, BBC reporter James Burke provides helpful--and sometimes hilarious--demonstrations of spaceflight technology, including donning a space suit, touring the Apollo capsule, and experiencing zero gravity.
Originally broadcast as part of BBC4's 'Moon Night' on February 27, 2006.
