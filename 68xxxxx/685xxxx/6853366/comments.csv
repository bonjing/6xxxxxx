I must admit, I have no idea about who are scousers etc. I am an Australian. So, I guess it would be similar to a cast of 8 Meryl Streep's in their best ""A dingo ate my baby"" fake Aussie accents! I only upload the shit! You decide!!! Don't be afraid to say what you think about this show here! I encourage you to speak, Gaz :)"
