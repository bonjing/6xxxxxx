Man.Up.S01E07.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 85MB]

[/b][/color] Will's Grandfather fought in WWII.
Will's Father fought in Vietnam.
Will plays Call of Duty on his PlayStation 3.
So what happened to all the real men? They're still here - they just smell like pomegranate body wash now.
Meet Will.
His evolved, sensitive nature is why his awesome wife Theresa married him.
But Will and his friends find themselves wondering what does it really mean to be a guy anymore? Will is more interested in finding the perfect gift for his son Nathan's 13th birthday than in doing his job selling insurance, sensitive soul Craig still pines for his college ex Lisa, and Kenny clamps down on his anger when his ex Brenda starts seeing a guy who is everything he's not.
And though it may not come naturally, each new day brings these lovable beta males another opportunity to Man Up and be like their forefathers
