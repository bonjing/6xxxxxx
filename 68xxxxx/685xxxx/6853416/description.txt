It began with the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939. By the time it came to an end on V-J Day--August 14, 1945--it had involved every major power and become global in its reach. In the final accounting, it would turn out to be, in both human terms and material resources, the costliest war in history, taking the lives of forty million people. 


In this complete serie of the war, World War 2: The Complete History weaves together political, military, diplomatic, and civilian elements to provide a lobal perspective on the war, creating a work that is both a treasure trove of information and a dramatic narrative.
