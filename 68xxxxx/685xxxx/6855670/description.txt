Wild Wax produces rockabilly music the way most rockers like it best. Authentic, but with enough originality to make a difference, all recorded with a high amount of energy the way a live recording would sound. The guitar breaks are all outstanding, backed by a steady slapping bass line and hard hitting drums. What more can I say? With Wild Wax Combo, you can't go wrong! Another 5 stars well deserved.
