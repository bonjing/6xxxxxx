Hercules is a 1983 Italian adventure film written and directed by Luigi Cozzi. The film follows the exploits of Hercules.

Part of the adventure finds Hercules battling giant robots brought to life by stop motion animation. The musical score was provided by Pino Donaggio.

Despite not being a critical or box office hit, the film has become something of a cult favorite. A sequel called The Adventures of Hercules (also starring Ferrigno and written and directed by Cozzi) was released in 1985.
