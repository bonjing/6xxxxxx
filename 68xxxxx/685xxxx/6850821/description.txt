London-based band Kinky Machine, formed in 1990 by vocalist/guitarist Louis Elliot, guitarist John Bull, bassist Malcolm Pardon and drummer Julian Fenton. 
They were inspired by glam rock and released two albums on MCA, including their self-titled debut â€˜Kinky Machineâ€™ in 1993, and â€˜Bentâ€™ in 1995, which featured new bassist Nick Powell.

They split in 1995, and a new band Rialto formed in their ashes headed by Louis Elliott. John Bull has since written songs for Lily Allenâ€™s album â€˜Alright, Stillâ€™.
