The Zoobombs' "biography" on the sleeve of Welcome Back, Zoobombs describes the band's music as "amazing, real rock." Vague as that may be, it's pretty much true: this Japanese quartet combines noisy garage guitars, hard-driving organs, and blues/rock staples with the sort of recklessness one might expect from the Boredoms. The difference is that while the Boredoms concentrate on deconstructing music into ridiculousness, Zoobombs plow through intense rock songs with a serious Bo Diddley influence. The result is something like the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion's best work -- old-fashioned rock is revved up and taken to its extremes to produce a wholly modern sound. Welcome Back, Zoobombs throws this together with hip-hop beats, organ-driven rock-outs, and production that captures the raw intensity of the band -- and the result is pretty difficult not to like.
