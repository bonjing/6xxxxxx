,mobitzoo,2012-01-05T04:08Z,Thanks. I will try touchwiz.
wake-up alarm and phone ring tone. Who TF uses those stock tones for a ringer or wake-up alarm?

I do :) (Twinkling bell and Good Morning)

Thank you for thise but i think you shoud left:
SamsungWidget_ProgramMonitor.apk
SamsungWidget_StockClock.apk
in the rom. They are usefull and i use it.
Also i really like Touchwiz over any other launcher (with or without themes-modifications)

Thank you thise will come handy"
