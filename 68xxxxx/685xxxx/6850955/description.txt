FSX EiresimLutonUltimate Rip 

Eiresim Scenery Design announces the release of 'Luton Ultimate' for FSX and FS2004. Made to the highest level of detail and accuracy, Luton Ultimate is the most realistic release to date from the Eiresim Team and indeed our first scenery for the United Kingdom.

20cm/pixel aerial imagery is used throughout that captures Luton Airport in all its glory.

Attention to detail has been the key behind developing Luton Airport and all airport structures have been included with the scenery, including the famous underpass.


Have fun Guys :+)
