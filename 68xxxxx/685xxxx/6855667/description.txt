Wild Wax Combo is a four- piece rockabilly band from Copenhagen Denmark. The band was formed in December 1996 after the split of another rockabilly band, The Candymen. Mikael en Paulo (quited the band in 2003 and then Andre took his place) wanted to continue playing rockabilly music, so they invited Rene, the bass player of Taggy Tones to join them. Two years later they recorded their first demo tape and ever since the band have been touring extensively throughout Europe and the USA. They have played twice at Viva Las Vegas Festival (in 2000 and 2001) and Shake the Shack Rockabilly Ball in Seattle (in 2003 and as headliner in 2004). In 2005 they were invited to play at the biggest Rock n roll event in the World - Rockin' 50's Fest in Greenbay, USA.
During ten years they released four albums. All of them are very successful! (rockabillybash.com)
