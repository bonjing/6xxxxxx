This is the latest version of the Fedora Linux operating system's Desktop Edition. It's everything you need to try out Fedora â€” you don't have to erase anything on your current system to try it out, and it won't put your files at risk. Take Fedora for a test drive, and if you like it, you can install Fedora directly to your hard drive straight from the Live Media desktop if you like.
