 Sameer and Anand are childhood friends. Right 
 from their school days and even in college,   
 they studied together. Both were ahead in     
 studies as well as in sports. They were also  
 the champions when it came to girl-chasing.   
 In fact, they used to bet amongst themselves  
 as to who will bed the best girl, but it never
 led to any fighting between them. For them the
 meaning of love was sex. Then came two girls  
 into their life - Anjali and Kiran. Sam and   
 Andy both tried to flirt with them but the    
 girls were smart. They told the guys that both
 are virgins and will offer their virginity to 
 their husbands as a gift. Sam and Andy have to
 marry the girls under pressure. After the     
 marriage the girls reveal that they knew about
 the guys' college activates and now Sam and
