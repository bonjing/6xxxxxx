RELEASE NOTES

How healthy is your hard drive?

The hard drive is one of the most important components of your
computer. Even if a hard drive works flawlessly, it should still
be regularly checked and maintained. This way an imminent hard
drive failure can be detected early and might be prevented. If
suddenly major problems occur or if your hard drive even
completely fails, data loss might be the result.

Make sure you are prepared for such a situation. Ashampoo HDD
Control 2 can notify you early so that your valuable data wont
become the victim of a hardware crash.

Now Ashampoo HDD Control 2 offers even more functions to check
the status of your hard drive(s).

Use for example the S.M.A.R.T self-test or adjust the noise level
and power management of your hard drive(s) (if supported).
Furthermore you can restore accidentally deleted files and
folders with Ashampoo HDD Control 2.

Get to know the all-rounder for monitoring, maintenance and
defragmentation, and check the health status and performance of
your hard drive(s) today.

Software Highlights:
Constant monitoring of your hard drive(s) (also for multi-user
systems)
Extended user interface with extensive hints and information on
health, performance and temperature of the hard drive(s)
Significantly extended support for external USB hard drives and
solid state drives (SSDs)
Support of S.M.A.R.T self-test (if supported by the hard drive)
Adjustment of the noise level and power management of your hard
drive(s) (if supported by the hard drive)
Data recovery  recovering deleted files and folders
Fully automatic, proactive defragmentation of the hard
drive(s)
Online retrieval of achieved benchmark results of your hard
drive model(s)

Complete Monitoring:

Ashampoo HDD Control 2 provides complete monitoring of your hard
drive(s). The software supports not only all common IDE and
serial ATA hard drive(s), but also provides improved support for
external USB hard drives and solid state drives (SSDs).

The extended user interface gives an overview of the status of
your hard drives health, performance and temperature. It also
offers lots of technical information on supported features and
their current status. Furthermore the software supports the
S.M.A.R.T self-test to check for electric and mechanic problems
of hard drives as well as adjustment of the noise level and the
power management (if supported by the hard drive).

Constant monitoring enables the software to recognize a hard
drive failure early. Let Ashampoo HDD Control 2 notify you of a
possible failure, for example via e-mail, if you are not near
your computer.

Benchmark
The benchmark function checks the performance of your hard
drive(s) and provides a clear, graphic overview of the
performance evaluation and information on data transfer rates and
access times. In order to get more information on the performance
of your hard drive(s) you can compare your benchmark results with
those of other users with the same hard drive model. Therefore a
database retrieves online information on the on average achieved
benchmark results of your hard drive model(s).

Monitoring at a glance:
Monitoring of all common IDE and serial ATA hard drive(s)
Improved support of chip sets in external USB hard drives and
solid state drives (SSDs)
Permanent real-time monitoring (also for multi-user systems)
Support of S.M.A.R.T self-test (if supported by the hard drive)
and evaluation of S.M.A.R.T log sectors (for analysis by the
hard drive manufacturer)
Adjustment of the automatic acoustic management (if supported
by the hard drive)
Adjustment of the advanced power management (if supported by
the hard drive)
Graphic analysis to check for flawed sectors on your hard
drive(s)
Detailed technical information on your hard drive(s) and its
features, for example ATA and SATA features etc.
Extended user interface with improved overview of health,
performance and temperature status of your hard drive(s)
Analysis shows information on disk utilization of hard
drives(s) including space usage of different file formats
Automatic detection of new, external devices
Benchmark function for performance evaluation and online
comparison

Careful Maintenance:

Dont you find it annoying to clean up your hard drive(s)
regularly and to delete temporary or unused files in order to
gain more disc space?

From now on Ashampoo HDD Control 2 will automatically do this job
for you. You wont have to spend time on going through all your
folders. With just a few clicks the software finds unused files
and Internet traces on your hard drive(s). Those will then
displayed in a list and can be erased, if necessary.

Instead of transferring files and folders into the computers
recycle bin you can select and delete them directly in Ashampoo
HDD Control 2. If you want to delete files and folders
irretrievably, dragging them into the recycle bin will not be
enough. Ashampoo HDD Control 2 now offers different erasing
methods, to delete files and folders irretrievably from your hard
drive(s).

Maintenance at a glance
Deletion of unnecessary files with the Drive Cleaner and
Internet Cleaner
Creation of an exceptions list for files and cookies that
shouldnt be erased
Option to add own file filters
Deletion of Internet traces
Data destruction of files and folders with different erasing
methods (e.g. with several overwrite processes)

Fully Automatic Defragmentation:

A defragmentation is a way to rearrange the data on a hard drive
to increase performance. If an element, for example a file on the
hard drive, is erased, an empty space will occur there.

This empty space is filled again when a new element is saved on
the hard drive. If the space isnt big enough, the new element is
broken up into fragments. These will then be placed into
different places on the hard drive to fill empty spaces.

After some time the PC will need longer to read files, because,
first of all, it has to assemble all fragments. Therefore it is
very important to do a defragmentation regularly, in order to to
maintain the hard drives performance.

Among the common methods Ashampoo HDD Control 2 uses the
so-called "proactive" defragmentation, which makes use of your
work breaks to analyze the level of disk fragmentation and do a
fully automatic defragmentation, if necessary.

Data recovery for emergencies:

Its very annoying, if important data are deleted by mistake.
With Ashampoo HDD Control 2 these files might not be lost
forever.

The software offers to recover deleted files and folders with the
integrated data recovery. Just select the relevant files and
restore them with Ashampoo HDD Control 2.
