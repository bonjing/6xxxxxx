May your enemies die slow, mercilessly painful deaths, haunted by visions of your eminence, and haunted with the knowledge that their final thoughts in this sole fleeting glimpse of consciousness will be of you, not giving a rat's ass.

I've always struggled to express gratitude appropriately, but I think you get my drift."
