The System Folder of a Mac 9.2.2 for Classic implementation in Mac OSX. You don't need to install the entire Mac OS. 

Don't try to use a Installer CD's system folder, it won't work. That's why I've uploaded this folder.

Note: Remember that Classic only works on Mac OSX up to the last version of 10.4 Tiger on PPC.
