           Aka. "Heroes and Villains" but in the United States this show is
           aired called "Warriors" as we previously happened to go with.. 
           
           Richard the Lionheart.
           During the Third Crusade, the crusaders arrive in Jaffa and find
           it destroyed. Uneasiness in the ranks and an attack that leaves
           one of his close friend's dead, Richard hopes to marry off his
           sister to Al Adil and create an alliance. However, Al Adil will
           not agree and the crusaders begin to suffer from a lack of
           supplies. Finally, Richard decides not to attack Jerusalem
           and the coalition falls apart. Eventually he must face the
           decision of protecting his kingdom from his brother or completing
           his oath to God. In the end, Richard plans to return home but
           when Jaffa is assaulted, he returns to rescue his men.
