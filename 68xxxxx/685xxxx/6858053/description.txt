This is a full copy of Mac OS X Lion (10.7.1) and includes the Server portion of the software, which is normally a $49.00 download from the Mac App Store. This software has been verified to work in virtual machines, and was specifically tested in VMWare Fusion on a Mac mini server model.

Why would we post this you may ask? Apple's SLA provides for virtualization rights for Mac OS X Lion Server on any Mac computer installed with Lion front he start, HOWEVER they do not provide access to the software (more specifically the server portion of the software) from the existing installers. Our torrent provides both the Mac OS X Lion installer as well as the Lion Server software, so that no one need pay for software they already have a right to virtualize!

Software is packaged in *.dmg format. Anything else is a fake and you should not open it!
