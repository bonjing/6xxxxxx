Synopsis: (snippets from Wikipedia)
An Unreasonable Man is a 2006 documentary film that traces the life and career of political activist Ralph Nader, the founder of modern consumer protection in America. The film examines Nader\\\\\\\'s advocacy for auto safety features, such as seat belts and air bags, as well as the formation of independent advocacy groups.

The second half of the film traces Nader\\\\\\\'s shift to a grassroots form of organizing focused on citizen power, including his eventual disillusionment with the two-party system following the rise of Reaganism.

The film takes its name from the George Bernard Shaw quote, \\\\\\\"The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.\\\\\\\"
