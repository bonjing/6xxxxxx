AMAZON REVIEW:

Awesome! this album is insanely good, its so alive. The beats are off the chain never heard anyone rap so fast its as if he and the beat are moving at the same pace.Very good knowledge of scripture.The music is very catchy,it has a flow and grove that is out of this world.christian rap is the best.No cursing or any thing like that and it still grabs your attention. if you don't know dwayne tryumf your missing out.If you don't know christ he'll make you glad you found out.Great metaphors, quality,outstanding.
