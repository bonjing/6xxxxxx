An assortment of texts from Fritz Leiber, one of the most original voices in early 20th century fantastic literature. 

Note: these are not just some shoddy calibre conversions of the pdfs that have been out there for a while. I completely reformatted the 'Best of' and 'Black Gondolier' books so the text flows correctly, as well as added AToCs to the books.
