Give your unborn baby a head start on a lifetime of good health

What you eat during pregnancy has a strong influence on your baby's health at birth. But did you know that it also can have a lifelong impact on your child's health? The latest scientific research indicates that good nutrition begins in the womb, and healthy eating habits during pregnancy can actually help lower your child's risk of obesity, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and a host of other problems later in life.

One of Harvard Medical School's top experts in pediatrics and nutrition, Dr. W. Alan Walker draws upon the latest research and his more than two decades of clinical experience to explain, in plain English, the science of prenatal nutrition. More important, he gives you:
