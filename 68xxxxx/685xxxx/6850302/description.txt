Recording details :

Track 02 : \\\\\\\"Just Can\\\\\\\'t Wait\\\\\\\" was first released as an instrumental on Eric Carr\\\\\\\'s \\\\\\\"Rockology\\\\\\\" album. Originally this very arranged song from 1987 was never finished with vocals. This song has been remastered using Eric Carr and Bruce Kulick\\\\\\\'s drum and guitar tracks. In addition Ted Poley (of Danger Danger) adds his vocals using lyrics written in 2006. Music written and performed by Eric Carr, Bruce Kulick and Adam Mitchell.
Lyrics written by Nick Clements; Lead vocals by Ted Poley; 
Background vocals by Ted Poley and Mike Lodusma.

Track 03 : \\\\\\\"Troubles Inside You\\\\\\\" : This is a complete demo taken from the original cassette tape (1987), featuring Mitch Weismann (Kiss co-writer, Beatlemania) on lead vocals. Mitch jokes about how he and Eric were at Gene Simmons house \\\\\\\"just fooling around.\\\\\\\" Mitch wanted to try something different, so he sat inside a closet with his microphone and belted out this easy flowing song. In the meantime, Eric Carr programmed the drum machine, played some guitars, and added some background vocals. Written and performed by Eric Carr and Mitch Weissman.

Track 05 : \\\\\\\"No One\\\\\\\'s Messin\\\\\\\' With You\\\\\\\" : This song was discovered on an old DAT recording owned and made by Eric Carr in 1989. This alternative version of \\\\\\\"Little Caesar\\\\\\\", from the 1989 Kiss, album \\\\\\\"Hot in the Shade\\\\\\\" has an entirely different set of lyrics and vocal melody. Eric Carr handles the gritty vocals and bass guitar while Bruce Kulick fills it out with some rock-in\\\\\\\'riffs. Since was an early demo this song contains no lead guitar tracks. Written and performed by Eric Carr and Bruce Kulick.

Track 06 : \\\\\\\"Carr Jam 1981\\\\\\\" : remake / cover version of the Eric Carr song, by ZO2 members Benny Doro (guitars and bass) and Joey Cassata (drums).

Track 08 : \\\\\\\"Shandi\\\\\\\" : In 2006 Eric Carr\\\\\\\'s \\\\\\\"1980 KISS audition tape\\\\\\\" surfaced.
The tape featured an unknown Paul Caravello (Eric Carr) singing \\\\\\\"Shandi\\\\\\\".
Eric Carr\\\\\\\'s vocals were lifted from the tape and combined with a refreshing new musical
arrangement, make this update soar. Joining Eric Carr are some very talented artists whose contributions range from classical guitar rhythms to seductive background vocals.

Track 11 : \\\\\\\"Elephant Man\\\\\\\" : Eric Carr\\\\\\\'s last known composition. Carr wrote the lyrics for the song early 1991. Due to his untimely death, he would never complete it.

Track 13 : \\\\\\\"Midnite Stranger\\\\\\\" : Ex- KISS guitarist Mark St. John contacted Eric Carr\\\\\\\'s family in 2006. Eric had given Mark a cassette tape containing a demo of a song that Eric Carr wrote called \\\\\\\"Midnite Stranger\\\\\\\". When Mark heard that there was a new Eric Carr CD in the works, he was eager to be part of it. Weeks before Mark\\\\\\\'s death he was in the process of creating some heavy guitar parts for the song. Sadly, Mark St. John pasted away in 2007, before he could complete them. This heavy rocker comes from that original 25 year old cassette tape (1986). Written and performed by Eric Carr.
