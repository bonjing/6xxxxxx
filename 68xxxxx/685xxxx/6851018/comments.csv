Here's the easy way to do it when your 60 day period is up. With Regedit, navigate to HKCU > Software > Actual Tools > Actual Window Manager. Delete the value ""EvalDate6"" (or perhaps EvalDate with some other number.) Then run the installer again. You're good to go for another 60 days. It's a hassle, but it's worth it."
