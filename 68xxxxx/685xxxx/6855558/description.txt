About the Author
Frank Hampson was perhaps best known as the creator and original artist for Dan Dare, but he also illustrated a number of children's books for Ladybird. Dan Dare was first published in the British comic The Eagle in April 1950, and was last published as an ongoing series in 1996 - although Dan had undergone more than a few changes by then.
