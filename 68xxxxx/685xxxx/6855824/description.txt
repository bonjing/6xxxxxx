"Between the world we see, and the things we fear... there are doors. When they are opened... nightmares becomes reality". That's according to the introduction of this series which dramatizes the "true" stories of people who have been haunted.


In this docudrama, the actual people who have experienced the paranormal recount their stories on-camera, as the frightening events of their stories are re-enacted. (Fearing ridicule, some of the witnesses are shown only in silhouette.) Filmed in a very cinematic style, "A Haunting" sets out to frighten, providing a few genuine chills in most episodes. 


Many of the stories contain common elements (moving into an old house where people have died, spirits attaching themselves to young children) and a predictable ending (spirit possession, or as often as not, the staging of an exorcism.)
"A Haunting" began as two specials ("Connecticut" and "Georgia") before being turned into a series.
