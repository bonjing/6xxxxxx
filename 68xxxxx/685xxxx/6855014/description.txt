Little Fish Eat Big Fish[/B] aka LFEBF is a Kolkata based group of no-budget film makers. The first venture of the group is the 5 no-budget short films produced in 2009-10. They opted for a direct to DVD release in the last Kolkata Book Fair. Details for the five short films in the DVD are provided below.

[B]1) The Sandbook --- A short fiction by Snigdhendu Bhattacharya. The film is an adoption of a short story by Jorge Luis Borges. The story moves with the landing of an amazing book in the hand of a scholer, who tries to understand \\\"the internal ties in events occuring\\\" in and around the book in order to go through it. The film is a melodramatic interpretation of the story within a very limited budget.

2) Jean-Luc Godard Had No Script -- A no-budget fiction by Anamitra Roy. The film approaches the larger history of politically conscious films in a mimetic way. The title of the film is a bit exploitative as it is neither a spoof and has been made with a very tight script.

3) ...Or A Horror film -- A short film by Souva Chattopadhyay. The film is an improvisation of a short story by Daniil Kharms, a little known Russian poet and short story writer.The film is about the paranoia inherent in the urban mindscape that prohibits oneself from fulfilling his/her desire.

4) A Hiding -- A typical Arupratan Ghosh short film. A little fiction, a little non-fiction, a hint of an incomplete romance, a bit reflection of social reality --- all of it punched with an uncanny voiceover, that\\\'s what \\\'A Hiding\\\' is.

5) Long Live (all) the Revolution -- A short film about a young writers struggle in the power-craving world of ideology and disbelief. In this short fiction you will find a fake-magician, and you will be haunted by a prolonged and bizarre nightmare. This film is basically a fantasy of telling the (un)truth. Written and Directed by Sankhasubhra Ganguly.
