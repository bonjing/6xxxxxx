,rlduke,2011-12-01T06:08Z,"I looked a little closer at the ""fc10"" in my filename and I believe that signified Fedora Core 10 (but don't quote me on that).  Anyway, the .RPM files that became my .DEB files found in this torrent came from this ""fc10_x86_64"" torrent found here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4613240/Ni_Labview_8.2_for_fc10_x86_64_%2864bit%29

That might clear up a little confusion (or make it easier for someone to find the .RPM version if needed)."
