It would be ever so nice if you could share a link to an HD documentary torrent programme with this alternative view.  The best documentaries, in my opinion are those that perform new research and also include verifiable citations to authority."
of all these great civilizations that they conquered, islam got to look good for a while. As a thief looks good in his ""new"" jacket he just stole. So they call this the ""golden age"", for as soon as all these tribes and people moved, converted to islam or died out, so did this ""golden age"" with them. 

And since then, it's been lights out down there. "
