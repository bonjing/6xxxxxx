Some links I want to share with you:
Don't Forget To Say Thank You!

From now on all my encodes will be mkv. This allows me to add more than 1 audio source
and more subtitles. Mkv is now very supported by almost any new dvd players and it's 
the best container by far. Remember, if you watch this on your computer or use it to 
stream, please use CCCP (combined community codec pack)to decode my encodes. CCCP is
the best codec pack on the internet.
If you have any requests, please leave a comment.
