NOTE: In Sweden most of Mel Brooks films were titled "Det vÃ¥ras fÃ¶r ..." which means "It's springtime for ..." This emanates from the song "Springtime for Hitler" that was sung in the film "The Producers".

Example:
Det vÃ¥ras fÃ¶r Hitler (It's springtime for Hitler) - The Producers
Det vÃ¥ras fÃ¶r galningarna (It's springtime for the maniacs) - High Anxiety
Det vÃ¥ras fÃ¶r sheriffen (It's springtime for the sheriff) - Blazing Saddles
Det vÃ¥ras fÃ¶r stumfilmen (It's springtime for the silent movie) - Silent Movie

This maybe makes it understandable why the set were this film is included is named "Det vÃ¥ras fÃ¶r Mel Brooks" (It's springtime for Mel Brooks).
