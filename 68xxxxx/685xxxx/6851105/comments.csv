Audio and video quality are very good (720p video with surround sound)! (Only the applause sounds muffled, but that's also the case in the original recordings.)
For those who don't know: Joe Hisaishi is one of the great classical composers of our time. A virtuoso who writes very moving and touching music. He composed the music for most Studio Ghilbli anime movies."
