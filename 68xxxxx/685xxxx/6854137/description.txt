Here is the first of two sources.
My first time seeing Guns 'N Roses... quite an experience. You can say a lot of things about Axl but he's certainly an energetic showman. It was wonderful to hear November Rain... one of my favorite tracks of all time.

I also filmed the complete show from the pit. Almost killed me but I got it done.
