                                =====================




Through cutting-edge CGI, this National Geographic documentary explores the potential effects of sea level rise on our civilization over the next few centuries. 


Earth Under Water explains the science behind the prediction of sea level rise and shows what will happen if the levels rise with increasing speed. Then, we fast forward to the twenty-third century to see how resourceful humans fight back and adapt using hyper engineering, vast dams, and even the construction of floating cities to cope with the after-effects of sea level rise.
