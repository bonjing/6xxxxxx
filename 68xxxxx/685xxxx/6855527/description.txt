Note : First off, lets start by saying the source DVD5 had some serious issues. The interlacing was so bad, that even after using a deinterlace filter, i had to use a second one in addition to remove
the interlace lines that were still covering the entire screen. The second deinterlace filter pretty much took care of that. Did a whole bunch of other work, and considering the source i think
this turned out pretty nice! As far as DVDSCR tags/watermarks, it has 'For Your Consideration' on the bottom of the screen pop on and off throughout, but no b/w scenes or anything else.
