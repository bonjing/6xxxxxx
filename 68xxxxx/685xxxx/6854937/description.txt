::Plot::
Original Sin is set in the late 19th century Cuba,and flashes back and forth a few times from the scene of a woman awaiting her execution by garrote while telling her story to a priest, to the actual events of that story.Luis Vargas (Antonio Banderas), a wealthy Cuban businessman, sends for American Julia Russell (Angelina Jolie) to sail to his country to be his bride. Julia departs from the ship, looking nothing like the photos she's sent prior to her voyage. Julia explains she wants more than a man who is interested in a pretty face, and that's why she's been deceptive - substituting a plain-looking woman in place of her own picture. Luis also admits to deception; he's been misleading her into believing he's a poor working man, instead of the rich owner of a coffee company.
