On Liberty by Sir John Stuart Mill is, I submit, the greatest piece
of literature ever written in any language - it is needless to say in
the most brilliant English by the greatest philosopher of all time 
- Sir John Stuart Mill

In it he argues that we must act to prevent evil to others by
accordingly limiting the freedoms of those who would otherwise 
cause such harm to others - while being respectful of everyone's
rights otherwise to be free from molestation by the state as it were.

Everyone should have read or have heard read this document in order to be
a competent civic duty capable human being - to the fullest extent possible
I submit


This is an unabridged reading of the entire book with different readers
employed for the purpose - the first several chapters by the very most 
competent ones used (they are from the free librivox series of offerings) -
although they alas didn't have as good a performance by the yet other readers
selected by librivox for the last two chapters for their version of offering
- and so we have here substituted readings for those two chapters by Gildart
Jackson instead although we had to pay for the download to accomplish this - 
and yet find the quality falls short clearly - of he great readings in the 
earlier chapters here by David Barnes and Carl Manchester - theirs is worth 
paying for certainly! (yet it is them that offer for free - where is the BBC 
here when its needed - equally!) enjoy!
