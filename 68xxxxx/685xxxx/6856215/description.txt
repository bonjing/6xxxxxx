One Small Step-
Part one of a two-part series on the subject of man in space, NOVA examines the history of NASAâ€”from the origin of the space race through the triumph of the Apollo programs. By tracing the history of three key programsâ€”Mercury, Gemini, Apolloâ€”we show how the basic challenges surrounding space flight were answered: rendezvous and docking, life support, weightlessness, space sickness, equipment reliability and so on.
Original broadcast date: 01/25/78


The Final Frontier-
Part 2 (not part of this torrent)NOVA looks ahead to the future, post-Apollo and the role that man in space will play, including the possibility of space colonizationâ€”huge orbiting space stations where people live and work in an earth atmosphere under artificial gravity.
