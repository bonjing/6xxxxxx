Bhaá¹…gá¹›Ä (Punjabi: à¨­à©°à¨—à©œà¨¾ (Gurmukhi), Ø¨Ú¾Ù†Ú¯Ú‘Ø§ (Shahmukhi), à¤­à¤¾à¤‚à¤—à¤¡à¤¼à¤¾ (Devanagari); pronounced [pÉ™Ì€Å‹É¡É½aË]) is a form of music and dance that originated in the Punjab region of India and Pakistan.[1] Bhangra dance began as a folk dance conducted by Punjabi farmers to celebrate the coming of Vaisakhi, a Punjabi festival. The specific moves of Bhangra reflect the manner in which villagers farmed their land. This musical art further became synthesized after the partition of India, when refugees from different parts of the Punjab shared their folk dances with individuals who resided in the regions they settled in. This hybrid dance became Bhangra. The folk dance has been popularised in the Western World by South Asian communities and is seen in the West as an expression of Indian and Pakistani culture as a whole.[2] Today, Bhangra dance survives in different forms and styles all over the globe â€“ including pop music, film soundtracks, collegiate competitions and even talent shows.............................
