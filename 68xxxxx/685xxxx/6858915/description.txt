3 Quadrophenia torrents in one day? Shucks, it must be Christmas! This is a rip of the Classic Records 200g vinyl by a fella calls himself Dr. Robert. This is the 16-bit/44.1-kHz version. This is the much-coveted original mix. Sounds really good to me. But does it sounds better than the MFSL CD? Don't make me choose! Well, sounds a little cleaner than the MFSL CD, if you know what I mean. Less grungy. Compare versions of "The Punk Meets the Godfather," and you'll see what I mean. This version features less bass and more top end, that's for sure. I think I prefer this mastering, though I may change my mind. Decide for yourself.
