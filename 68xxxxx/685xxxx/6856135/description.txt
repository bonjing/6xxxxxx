"The adventures of the vice squad detectives of the Miami Police Department."

Stubble-faced detective Crockett lived in a sailboat guarded by his alligator Elvis. His partner Tubbs was a black New York cop looking for his brother's killer. Together they took on the Florida drug world. The show influenced men's fashions toward Italo-casual and interior decor toward the Memphis look. Very trendy music and unusual guest performers.

Stars: Don Johnson, Philip Michael Thomas and Saundra Santiago
