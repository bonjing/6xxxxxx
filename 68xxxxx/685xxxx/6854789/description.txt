There is a food revolution sweeping the nation, changing the way Americans think and eat, and meat is at the heart of it. The butcher has reemerged in American culture as an essential guide in avoiding the evils of industrial meatâ€”which not only tastes bad, but is also bad for oneâ€™s health and for the environment. Joshua and Jessica Applestone, a former vegan and vegetarian, are trailblazers in this arena. They run Fleisherâ€™s, an old-school butcher shop with a modern-day missionâ€”sourcing and selling only grass-fed and organic meat. The Applestonesâ€™ return to the nearly lost tradition of the buying and nose-to-tail carving of whole animalsâ€”all humanely raised close to their shop in New Yorkâ€™s Hudson Valleyâ€”has helped to make them rising stars in the food world.
           
The Butcherâ€™s Guide to Well-Raised Meat is a compendium of their firsthand knowledge. This unique bookâ€”a guide, memoir, manifesto, and reference in oneâ€”shares everything one needs to know about well-raised meat, including why pastured meats are so much better than conventional ones and how to perfectly butcher and cook them at home. Readers will learn which cut of steak to look for as an alternative to the popular hanger (of which each steer has only one), how to host a driveway pig roast, and even how to break down an entire lamb (or just butterfly the shoulder)â€”all with accompanying step-by-step photographs. Differences among breeds and ideal cooking methods for various cuts and offal are covered, and the Applestonesâ€™ decoding of misleading industry terminology and practices will help consumers make smarter, healthier purchases that can also help change whatâ€™s wrong with meat in America today.
           
Complete with color and black-and-white photographs, illustrations, and more than a dozen recipes, The Butcherâ€™s Guide to Well-Raised Meat is the definitive guide to eating great meatâ€”responsibly.
