goes to the town and decides to trade the place for a herd. He has to go to another city. The only stagecoach is one being 
hired for a special trip paid by Faver and his wife Audra. As there are several seats others join the stagecoach making 
seven very different passengers in all. During the journey they are robbed. With the leadership of John Russell they

*I don't take requests because I don't have time and everyone will fill the comment section with them instead of commenting about quality and other tehnical specs of the movies or say thanks.Thank you for understanding!
*For best performance I suggest you use KMPlayer(find it with google) for playback
*These movies were made especially for PC and they don't play on a PS3.If you want to re-encode for PS3 or test for other devices be my guests.
*I'll ask everybody to stop with the "it doesn't work","it's out of sync" comments because I tested the movies before I uploaded them and they work fine.
