                           DESCRiPTiON 

 The story of the Russian `honey trap' spy who never was, asking how an MP's  
 former assistant came to be wrongly accused by MI5 of being a threat to British 
 national security. Katia Zatuliveter tells Panorama's Peter Taylor how she 
 became the centre of a diplomatic row over her relationship with a Liberal 
 Democrat MP. The 26-year-old Russian graduate reacts to being cleared of the 
 charge - made by government lawyers - that she exploited her position as Mike 
 Hancock's assistant and mistress to pass information to Moscow. The film also 
 interviews Hancock, who sat on the Commons Defence Select Committee and chaired 
 its all-party Russia Group, and speaks to former Russian and British 
 intelligence officers, who warn of possible new security tensions with Moscow.  
                     
                                 Enjoy!
