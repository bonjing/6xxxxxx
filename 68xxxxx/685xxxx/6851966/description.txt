THE STORY OF FILM: AN ODYSSEY. CHAPTER 5.

This episode reveals how the trauma of war made cinema more daring. The story starts in Italy, and moves to Hollywood, from Orson Welles to the darkening of American film and the drama of the McCarthy era.

Screenwriters Paul Schrader and Robert Towne discuss the era, while Stanley Donen, who directed Singin' in the Rain, talks exclusively about his career.

The programme also reveals how British films such as The Third Man best sum up these extraordinary years.
