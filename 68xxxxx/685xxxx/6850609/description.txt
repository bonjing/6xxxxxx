Jack and Jill 2011 TS READNFO XviD - FYA

Ok READNFO is for the first 20 mins or
so as camera was a little messed up but
after that is very nice quality
So we included 2 samples of the good and bad


Ran some filters and played with color's
cropped, rotated, resized, and a few
other tweaks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Audio is very nice line to complete
the release which was then muxed to the
encode

JACK AND JILL WENT UP THE HILL
TO FETCH 100 RE ENCODES
JACK FELL DOWN AND CRASHED HIS
VDUB AND JILL CAME TUMBLING AFTER
