The Cure frontman Robert Smith said of the reasoning behind the album's release: "We had such a great time in the Isle Of Wight at Bestival that we wanted to release this show as a way of thanking fans and islanders alike." All profits from sales of this live album will be donated to the Isle Of Wight Youth Trust, a charitable, independent and professional organization which offers counseling, advice, information and support services to young people aged 25 and under on the Isle of Wight.
