As one who has written extensively about the interior life, meditation, and psychotherapy, Ken Wilberâ€”the leading theorist in the field of integral psychologyâ€”naturally arouses the curiosity of his numerous readers. In response to this curiosity, this one-year diary not only offers an unprecedented entrÃ©e into his private world, but offers an introduction to his essential thought. "If there is a theme to this journal," Wilber writes, "it is that body, mind, and the luminosities of the soulâ€”all are perfect expressions of the Radiant Spirit that alone inhabits the universe, sublime gestures of that Great Perfection that alone outshines the world." 

Wilber's personal writings include: 

   â€¢  Details of his own spiritual practice 
   â€¢  Advice to spiritual seekers 
   â€¢  Reflections on his work and that of other prominent theorists in the field of integral psychology 
   â€¢  His day-to-day personal experiences 
   â€¢  Dozens of his short theoretical essays on topics from art to feminism to spirituality to psychotherapy
