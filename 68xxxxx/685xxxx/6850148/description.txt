Thanks to IMMERSE for the original source file, however MKV files do not natively play on the PS3, and a lot of people are loathe to use PS3 Media Server so this has been given the SM10 touch so it can be played normally. Converted to MPEG2, audio has been tweaked to stay in sync to accommodate that change and some filters configured to maximise colour on bigger TV's. This will be a regular upload of mine, so feel free to revisit, subsequent weeks.
