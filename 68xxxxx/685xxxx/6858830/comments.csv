I did take the scans from your torrent the same scans you took from some blog site. lmao

When I made a statement about one of your torrents it was when you copied the album I posted up here that wasn't out yet it was simple It was well seeded all you did was take away from people getting it faster. Now if you added something to it then there would of been no issue. aether way its no longer relevant .

Ive posted up some much better shit like the new 
The Empire Shall Fall Album
