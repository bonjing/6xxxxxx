I immediately noticed something was wrong but I suppose some people might not, unless they had another copy to compare it against.  The difference is night and day when I compare it to even a 700MB XviD copy I have of this movie, which sadly blows this 4GB copy away.  This torrent gets the job done, but I wouldn't recommend it."
