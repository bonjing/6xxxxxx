Battlestar Galactica is in enkele jaren tijd uitgegroeid tot een waar fenomeen. 
Deze meeslepende blik achter de schermen van het originele conflict tussen de mensheid en de Cylons is extra fascinerend omdat Caprica 
heel veel weg heeft van onze eigen wereld.


Achtenvijftig jaar voor de eerste Battlestar de ruimte in trekt, 
zien twee machtige families - de Graystones en de Adamas - hun lot onherroepelijk met elkaar verbonden na een verwoestende explosie. 
Terwijl de twee clans worstelen met het bepalen van de grens tussen mens-zijn en kunstmatige intelligentie - de Cylons - 
drijven ze hun onderlinge conflicten op de spits. 
Bedrijfscomplotten, moord, seksuele intriges en zwartmakerij zijn aan de orde van de dag op Caprica.

Original Air Dateâ€”26 February 2010

Tamara Adama is still trying to make sense of her "life" in her new world. She doesn't understand where she is or why she's there. 
She does begin to realize that she is not a pure game creation nor is she a human who has entered the game via a holoband. 
Or at least not a conscious human, which is one of the suggestions put to her to explain how she fits in. 
She's become friendly with a young man who spends most of his life in the cyberworld preferring it to "real" life. She asks him to contact her father. 
Joseph Adama meanwhile realizes that unless he can put his wife and Tamara's death behind him, 
his son William will take a path in life that will no doubt lead to a life of crime.
