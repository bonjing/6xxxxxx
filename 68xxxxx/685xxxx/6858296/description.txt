But when they get to the near-empty roadside cafâ€š, bullets blast apart what was supposed to be a simple transaction. It could be a huge, bloody misunderstanding but it might also be a deadly double-cross. Shea Whigham ("Boardwalk Empire") and Academy Awardr nominee Brad Dourif (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) co-star in this intense crime thriller with a killer twist.

* What is DXVA?
DXVA, or DirectX Video Accelleration, is a system built into Windows operating systems
since Windows XP that allows programs, if they support it, to offload the decoding of
certain media codecs to the GPU. Doing so reduces the strain on the CPU and allows for
even High Definition content to be played on a relatively weak system.
