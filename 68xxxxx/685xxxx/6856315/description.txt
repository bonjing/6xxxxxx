"Lost Traveler" 

A Romani child disappears on his way home from 
school. Benson and Amaro interview the distraught 
parents, who are distrustful of the police. The 
initial investigation leads Fin and Rollins to 
the powerful leader of the Romani community, but 
he denies any involvement. The family remains 
hopeful their boy will be found, especially when 
they discover his cell phone is still active. 
With the help of their TARU tech and a meddling 
newspaper reporter, the detectives narrow the 
perpetrators to a mentally challenged neighbor, 
throwing the tight-knit Romani community into 
turmoil.
