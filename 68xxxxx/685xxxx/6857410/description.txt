"Does a Good God Exist?"
Christopher Hitchens owns Dr. William Dembski in a debate in the Christian Theologian's school. 

The video is in 3 parts, all as AVI's. Converted from f4v's. This is my first TBP torrent, so let me know if I utterly fucked it up.

This video was on YouTube, but the organization (specified in video) removed it. Probably because Dembski got assraped.
