i got this file from TPB and took out all the useless crap.
a lot of people say there stuff genuine. all there doing is using the silent activation tool(FAXCOOL) the WAT remover. if you use this. your windows is not
" GENUINE".
i found the hidden file and i will tell you how to fix it and you can have all the genuine stuff you want. i'm using it now. even went to M$ and downloaded windows xp virtual mode. so not im running xp inside windows 7 at the same time.

STEP 1: use img burn and rip the iso file to disc
STEP 2: restart your computer and boot from disc.
STEP 3: follow the steps.
STEP 4: after install is complete open the file that says (how to remove the WAT file).follow the steps
 
STEP 5: use the bootloader and install. restart your computer.

your windows 7 OS should be "THE REAL THING"
do a windows update. go to M$ and download xp mode.
it all works.
i have done 7 of my computers and 4 laptops.

in this file is the 
windows 7 ISO
IMG burn
7 zip
boot loader
file on how to find and restore the WAT.
