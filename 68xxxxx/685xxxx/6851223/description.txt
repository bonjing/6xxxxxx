The Books of Acts - Acted Out - NIV

 Acts    Chapters 1:0-8:4 
Walk with the risen Lord. Bear witness as He is taken up into heaven.
Experience the transforming power of Pentecost. Catch fire, as the passionate eloquence of Peter (James Brolin) and John (AndrÃ© Jacobs) sends the flame of faith racing through Jerusalem!
As Luke's powerful narrative brings the New International Version of Acts to vivid life, gain new insight into the compassionate love that unites the fellowship of believers. Touch the wellspring of faith that gives them the courage to withstand the rage of the Sanhedrin. When the martyrdom of gentle Stephen (Francesco Quinn) marks the beginning of a great persecution, flee with the disciples as the infant church scatters from Jerusalem ... to embrace the world! 
Join with the physician Luke (Dean Jones), as he tells the enthralling story of danger, struggles and triumph that marks the birth of the Christian church. Sail with the  physician Luke (Dean Jones), as his powerful story unfolds. Share the adventure, as the seeds of the new church are scattered throughout the land.  Miraculous healings, mysterious escapes from prison and angelic encounters. Experience them all with Peter (James Brolin), Philip (David Clatworthy), John (AndrÃ© Jacobs) and the others. Watch as the infant church struggles and grows.  Then, on the road to Damascus with the Pharisee Saul, witness the unfolding of a greater purpose that will change the world forever. Share the shattering encounter with Jesus that transforms the young faith's greatest enemy into its boldest voice ... as the reborn Paul (Henry O. Arnold) discovers his destiny as "a light for the Gentiles."
As angry waters toss and tumble our stubborn little ship, the physician Luke (Dean Jones) draws us ever deeper into his astonishing story. And we plunge into the tempestuous years of conflict, danger and turmoil, as the young Christian church opens its arms to the Gentile world. Journey with Paul (Henry O. Arnold), Barnabas (Wilson Dunster), Silas (Chris Truter) and Timothy (Thomas Hall) as they teach and baptize, establish churches and plant the seeds of faith throughout Greece and Macedonia. Witness the conversion of the influential Lydia of Philippi (Jennifer O'Neill), that throws open the door for the young church to step boldly into Europe. 
As our battered little ship seeks port, Luke spins out the triumphant conclusion of Acts. And we return with Paul to Jerusalem, as he ignores repeated warnings of personal danger, to follow the call of the Holy Spirit. Walk with Paul through the streets of his beloved city. Stand with him in the Temple as he is brought before the Sanhedrin, where his vigorous denunciation of their hypocrisy triggers a riot. Then, as he is rescued by imperial soldiers and imprisoned, witness the pivotal events that will carry the flame of faith from dusty Judea to the heart of the Roman empire.  Living quietly amid the splendour of imperial Rome, Paul continues to teach and baptize, strive for harmony between Jewish tradition and Christian belief and plant the seeds of change at the heart of the civilized world.

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.


RAPtURE (My transportation outta here).

The Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe That The Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)

In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed..

"And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.

"Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...

May Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed Long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.
