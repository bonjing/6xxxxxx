READNFO: 

for the first 20 mins or 
so as camera was a little messed up but
after that is very nice quality   
So we included 2 samples of the good and bad
  

Ran some filters and played with color's
cropped, rotated, resized, and a few
other tweaks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Audio is very nice line to complete
the release which was then muxed to the 
encode
