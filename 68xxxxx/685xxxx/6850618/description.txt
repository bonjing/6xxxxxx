TOP TOPHAM ASCENSION HEIGHTS
Label: Blue Horizon
Released:1969
Format: Flac

At the age of 15, Surrey-born Anthony \'Top\' Topham stepped onto stage in May 1963 at the Eel Pie Island Club in Twickenham with his new blues-wailing band - The Yardbirds. A few months later he was replaced with Eric Clapton and after that a certain Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page also joined that volatile crew. When you consider what a staggering influence Cream, Beck and Led Zeppelin have had on everything in rock then and now - it\'s a damn shame that Top Topham got musically lost in the mix somehow and has never been given the catalyst credit he so deserves
