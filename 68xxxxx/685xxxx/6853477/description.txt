USB Loader GX. 2.3 rev1123 (Work on any wii, from 3.3 to 4.3)
All In One Package, once put in your Sd Card:
Merge the following files:
-Apps with apps on your SD card
-config INSTEAD of your config file
-Wad INSTEAD of your wad file.
Then install the channel/forwarder from the homebrew of your choice (Wad manager, or my favorite, pimp my wii)

I do not owe these files, nor that i modded them, i brought them to you just as i downloaded them, the same goes for wii backup manager.
They are sane, virusless, and 100% working.
questions will be answered if possible.
SEED!!		

Ps: Sorry for the previous deleted release, everything's fine now, hakuna matata
