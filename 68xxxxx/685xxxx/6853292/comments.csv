Yes, I have a confession to make. Though he was once a dear friend, I started ignoring him, and during the few times I actually remembered him I expected the world of him and expected him to carry around my own dead weight. He gave me wonderful insights, kept my mind sharp when few others even noticed me, and never once complained. My excuse for what I was doing was one that had served me well before, though it was completely empty. I said that â€˜lifeâ€™ was catching up with me, while the truth was that my own bad decisions were what was catching up to me. I could have spared five minutes here and an hour there to pay attention to him, to feed him, to tell him that I was willing to give him what he needed to keep on going rather than expecting him to keep on running on empty, with me fighting him, actually.
You see, I was told that there were many ways to gain lucidity, to bring myself to life in my dreams. Repeat a phrase here, look at my hands there, and maybe even try to stay awake while falling asleep. It is only now that I realize that, while those may hold truth, there was another, more powerful ally I had, off of whom many of those techniques were based. I knew all this on some level, but I was too busy hitting the bed way too late and getting up way too early to notice him. I came home from work Friday, walking like a dead man, and when I woke up yesterday, having gotten a tiny bit of sleep into me, I found him laying there, where he had always stayed, waiting on me to acknowledge him even if I wouldnâ€™t feed him.
So please join me in dedicating a moment of silence to the one I lost. The funny thing is that I can still almost see him, waiting right there for me to accept him as he always had. Rest in peace, awareness. You will be missed.
