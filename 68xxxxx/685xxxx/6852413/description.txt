This is converted from a DVD we purchased on-line from Sweden.

This movie tells the sad story of a family caught up in the cruelties
of a famine that is similar to what a afflicted the folks in Ireland
and with similar dire consequences for all too many that ended up in
Australia too from England.

A way has to be found to ensure that no family that has care to give and
is of merited spirit should ever be in these circumstances again - no matter
what the cost to the rest of the planet.
