Here we have the 8th updated version for this funny game. Hereâ€™s the change logs. Enjoy

Minecraft has become a complete phenomenon this generation and weâ€™ve seen a few copy cats or games of a similar nature pop up due to the sudden popularity of the game. With a premise like that of Minecraftâ€™s it must be hard for developers to come up with similar games that arenâ€™t complete copy cats, much like the XBLA game Fortresscraft has been viewed as. The premise of gathering resources and building things isnâ€™t one that necessarily hasnâ€™t been done in the past, but Minecraftâ€™s style and sheer addicting levels of fun is what has made it the mega hit that it is.
