Wii Backup Manager.
Very useful tool that allows you to transfer your wii games to your hard drive, with it being either ntfs/fat32 file format. 
It just creates a wbfs file where all your games will be put on.
Then us a loader (USB Loader GX is my favorite, clic on my nick to get it in the list of my up's.) to play games on your softmodded wii.
