ks alot xsaltire.

I was going to say ""I hate to complain but the pages are so small, its hard to read"".

But if you're using CDisplay right click on the page, click ""Configure"", then check the box ""Fit Width"".

This lessens the quality a little but atleast I can read it that way.

I don't mean to bitch.. The upload is very much appreciated. I've heard good things about it."
