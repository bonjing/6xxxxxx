RUSH RUSH RALLY RACING for DREAMCAST.



Extract the .cue and .img file to a folder using Winrar or something similar.

Run the .cue file with ImgBurn v2.4.4.0 (do not use any other version, otherwise the copy protection will kick in after level 2 !!!).

If the game doesn't work, try a different CD/DVD burner. I'd never had issues burning DC games until this one. Used a different burner & VOILA!!
