This is my first huge torrent file that I actually made.
It's called, "Windows 7 Professional Max Android Edition"
This file is very huge, It's a 5.6 gigabytes file because I added lots of program files and the Android Skin Pack for Windows 7.
I also added some Microsft Security Updates. 
So please make sure that you install this on a big computer or laptop that has a lot of free space and memory, or else you can't install it.
Burn this on a DVD and a 8GB USB Stick. (Don't use a CD.)
Remember, this is a bootable iso. For a USB Stick, use a program called, "Wintoflash"
For a DVD, download my recommended program, "PowerISO or Nero"
I hope you enjoy my first huge file that I actually made.
(Note: Don't DELETE any files on the iso file! It will corrupt your installation!)
So, enjoy and seed for a very long time. Comment me if you have any problems with this ISO file. Thanks!
(Also, some games have trial so please activate them.)
