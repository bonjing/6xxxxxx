Jennifer Trynin had earned considerable attention with an independent release, so Cockamamie received deserved critical consideration. Trynin is a gifted songstress, not unlike Liz Phair or fellow Boston native Aimee Mann (who contributes backing vocals to \\\\\\\"Snow\\\\\\\" and, like them, the pitfalls of romance occupy such of Trynin\\\\\\\'s lyrical concern. \\\\\\\"Everything\\\\\\\'s Different Now\\\\\\\" is a grungy, funky workout that reflects on the attraction to saving people and \\\\\\\"One Year Down\\\\\\\" is a melodic, garage pop gem. She mixes things up, though. \\\\\\\"Snow\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Better Than Nothing\\\\\\\" are two slacker anthems that succeed because of their unselfconscious tone. The former is a smoldering, mid-tempo number with creamy harmony vocals, while the latter is a delicious, upbeat racket, packing a triple-espresso shot. \\\\\\\"If I Had Anything to Say (Don\\\\\\\'t You Think I Would Have Said It All?)\\\\\\\" is a wickedly wonderful, sonic whiplash. Cockamamie is an impressive release that deserved a wider audience.
