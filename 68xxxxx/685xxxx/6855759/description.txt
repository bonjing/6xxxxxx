Note: the keygen is kind of unstable - just keep reopening it until it remains (took me over 10 reopens)

TotalFinder is just a better Finder


TotalFinder works like the original Finder but adds tabs, dual panel, folders on top and other useful features.
My goal is to improve Finder in areas where it is lacking but keep the overall design which is good in my opinion.
TotalFinder works in OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard). Some features are also available in OSX 10.7 (Lion).

TotalFinder is a plugin for Finder

TotalFinder is an add-on which gets loaded into the Finder when you launch TotalFinder.app. It does not modify your Finder files on the disk. It modifies the current instance of Finder running in memory. It works similar to SIMBL plugins which you may know from other programs. However, TotalFinder is a standalone application and is not dependent on SIMBL and should work reliably alongside other SIMBL applications.

Tabbed Browsing

Add tabs on top of Finder. The same tabs as seen in Google Chrome.


Dual Mode


Display two Finder windows side-by-side in dual mode.


Folders on Top


Don't make me think. Folders should always go first in list view.


Show System Files


Show me all files on the disk. I'm not afraid to see the cruft.


Visor


Convenient system-wide Finder always one key-press away.


Cut & Paste


Use keyboard shortcuts to move files around. Faster than drag & drop.


System Requirements:

Intel Mac, OS x.6 and above (Lion ready)
