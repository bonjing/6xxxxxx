This is a movie about chivalry and who is best styled at it and indeed
most truly sincerely caring in their own respective ways to see justice done
for all concerned.


A great movie from 1942 - should have long been into the Public domain
- some folks just can never get enough of money no matter how petty
the effort it seems!

enjoy!
