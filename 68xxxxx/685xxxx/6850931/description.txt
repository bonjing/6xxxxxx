                           DESCRiPTiON 

 John Ware investigates Private Finance Initiatives, where companies build new 
 schools and hospitals and lease them back to the Government. He uncovers      
 evidence that their value for money to taxpayers may have been misrepresented 
 and asks why the coalition has signed so many PFI deals when David Cameron and
 Nick Clegg questioned the practice while in opposition.
