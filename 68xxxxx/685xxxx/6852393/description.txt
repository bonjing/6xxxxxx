INSTALL NOTES


1. Run acrevelations1.01eu.exe
2. Install
3. Copy the cracked content from the SKIDROW folder to the main install
folder and overwrite
4. Play the game (read additional notes below, before starting it)
5. Support the companies, which software you actually enjoy

ADDITIONAL NOTES

We had to use an additional way to crack this, because if you went back
to \"return to animus island\", trying to play Desmond\'s memory missions,
with version 1.00 crack, the game would crash.

This is all fixed now with this v1.01 release

1. Start game and you will be presented with the Ubisoft login screen
2. Username is of course SKIDROW, leave it like that
3. Type anything as password and put a mark in \"remember me\"
4. Hit the Play button
5. That\'s it, and you can still continue from your previous save from
our v1.00 crack )

GREETINGS
