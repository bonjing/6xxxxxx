After Bernard Butlers departure from the band, Suede expanded to a 5 piece with a new (and very young) guitarist and a keyboard player. Lead singer Brett Anderson decided to make a straight up pop record too in complete contrast to the dark concept album of Dog Man Star. 
Not many albums can compete with Coming Up when it comes to the sheer quality and weight of the singles. Trash, Beautiful Ones, Saturday Night, Filmstar and, to a slightly lesser extent, Lazy are all bonafide classics, perfectly integrated to the collective memory of everyone who lived through the mid-90s. The britpop period was an era of great singles but no other album spewed out so many of such high quality as Coming Up did. There's no denying that these are all sheer gold, marvellous little rock hit packages of fantastic hooks and youthful attitude.
