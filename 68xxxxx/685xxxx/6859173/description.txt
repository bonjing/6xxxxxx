It's the closing night at the last drive-in theater
in America and Cecil B. Kaufman has planned the
ultimate marathon of lost film prints to unleash
upon his faithful cinephile patrons. Four films
so rare that they have never been exhibited publicly
on American soil until this very night
With titles like Wadzilla, I Was A Teenage Werebear,
The Diary of Anne Frankenstein, and Zom-B-Movie,
Chillerama not only celebrates the golden age
of drive-in B horror shlock but also spans over
four decades of cinema with something for every bad taste
