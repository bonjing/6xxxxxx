Allmusic Review:
This disc contains another dozen seasonal sides from the novelty singing group, the Chipmunks. Like its predecessor, Christmas With the Chipmunks, Vol. 2 (1963) has become a year-end institution. This is thanks in part to the initial success of multimedia mastermind Ross Bagdasarian's hit 45" "Chipmunk Christmas Song," which spent four weeks atop the singles chart. The Chipmunks actually debuted on Bagdasarian's first number one, "Witch Doctor". The sped-up voices of Alvin, Simon and Theodore were all performed by Bagdasarian with character names inspired by Liberty Records bosses: Al Bennett (Alvin), Si Waronker (Simon), and sound engineer Ted Keep (Theodore). The concept even spawned a prime-time animated television program called the Alvin Show, which aired from October 14, 1961 through September 12, 1962 on CBS-TV. A glance at the tune-stack lists familiar favorites such as " Deck the Halls," "Hang Up Your Stockin'," "Jingle Bell Rock," and "All I Want for Christmas (Is My Two Front Teeth)," as well as the Bagdasarian original composition "Wonderful Day". Those looking for the "Chipmunk Christmas Song" should note that it is included on the first volume as well as several of the holiday compilations derived from both Christmas With the Chipmunks platters. Among them are Chipmunk's Greatest Christmas Hits (1999) and A Very Merry Chipmunk (2000).
