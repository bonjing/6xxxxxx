	This is the first issue introducing a new openly gay Kevin Keller.  Kevin is a handsome senior high school student who moves to Riverdale with his parents Colonel and Mrs. Thomas Keller.  There he meets the familiar gang, Archie, Veronica, Betty and Jughead and they become instant friends.  Veronica, of course, immediately falls for him and tries working her magic charms to get Kevin to ask her out on a date.  Kevin is openly gay - and everyone knows but Veronica!  Hilarity ensues and great fun is had by all. 

This is the time a major comic house has introduced an openly gay character in a wholesome comic magazine.  The hard copy publication is no longer available having sold out soon after its release but it is available, along with three other issues electronically for your iPad or reading device.  You can purchase each comic separately or subscribe and automatically download all the issues. 

A BIG issue is coming up in January.  Kevin has joined the Army to follow in his father's footsteps, meets a handsome soldier and they get married!  Everyone will attend and it will be the wedding of the year!

It is well written and beautifully drawn with vivid colors.  This one's a keeper! ;-)
