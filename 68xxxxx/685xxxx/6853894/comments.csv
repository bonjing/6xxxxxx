Geez, I wish they would fix that! 

Kevin gets his own comic and there are currently three issued, the forth is the wedding issue to be released in mid-December.  Kevin appears in two of Veronica's issues, Number 202 ""Meet Kevin Keller"" and ""Kevin Returns"" Number 205.  I have them all and will upload them as time permits.  Look for them!  Enjoy!"
