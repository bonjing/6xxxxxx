MythBusters.S04E16.Crimes.And.Myth-Demeanors.2.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 265MB]

[/b][/color] So exactly how hard is it to find a needle in a haystack, anyway? And can water dripping on your forehead really drive you nuts? Those are the kinds of questions, myths and urban legends that are put to the test in this humorous series to find out which ones hold water (and keep it from dripping on your forehead and driving you insane).
