              Plot.................: Years ago, Ken Min failed to stop his friend from killing
 a young couple, leaving their infant son orphaned. After his friend is sent to prison for the
 crime, Ken spends his life running away from his shame. Seeking redemption, he teaches mixed
 Martial Arts out of a community youth center. But Ken is ultimately forced to face his past
 when the orphaned boy finds his way into Ken's life, and Ken's murderous friend is released
 from prison. When he discovers that these two events are not a coincidence, Ken must choose
 between a heroic act of self-sacrifice or the self-preservation of running away.
