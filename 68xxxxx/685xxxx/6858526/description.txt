Type: Patch

Description: Out of the Park Baseball ("OOTP") is the most sophisticated and best-selling baseball simulation game on the planet. Since its inception, OOTP has won numerous awards, including multiple "Sports Game of the Year" awards, en route to becoming the most immersive, realistic, and customizable baseball experience a fan can ask for!

Instructions: As of today (Dec 1, 2011) this patch will work for every version of OOTP12. Unless something changes it will work for all future releases of OOTP12 as well. Just update the game as you normally would and re-patch the new version. The program will create a backup of the exe automatically. If you have any problems please post them in the comment section for this torrent on Piratebay. I think that's all you need to know, this sort of crack is new for me so thanks for giving it a shot.

Notes: "It has always seemed strange to me... the things we admire in men, kindness and generosity, openness, honesty, understanding and feeling, are the concomitants of failure in our system. And those traits we detest, sharpness, greed, acquisitiveness, meanness, egotism and self-interest, are the traits of success. And while men admire the quality of the first they love the produce of the second." - Steinbeck
