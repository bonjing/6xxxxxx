"Disciplining The Keens"

After they find out that Nathan's 
allergic, the whole family goes on a 
gluten free diet, which leads to a 
weird competition between Will and 
Theresa to see who can keep the diet 
up longer, and for Brenda, who's 
trying to convince health-conscious 
Grant she can live without it. Problem 
is, they're all cheating. Meanwhile, 
it's all fast food, all the time for 
Craig and Kenny as they romance two 
ladies who work at Big Burger. 

18/Slower
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
