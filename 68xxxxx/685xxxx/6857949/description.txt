I get emails from many friends about office 2010 plus that it asks for activation after a month or too, so i found a solution for them that's EZ Activator or Toolkit that will activate your Office 2010,2007,2003 all versions :)  .
Now thats GuD . Download and Extract Using WinRar and then Open the Office 2010 Toolkit 2.0.1 and then click EZ-Activator and wait for a minute or few and then click Activation tab and then click Activate and wait for few mins and then to check activation status, click Check and see the log , if it says Status:Activated then it means its Activated.

may ALLAAH bless you all
