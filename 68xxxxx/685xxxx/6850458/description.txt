this is 4000 series ttl data sheets, downloaded and sorted from 5 different data sheet sights, alldatasheet.com, datasheet archive, data sheet catalog, and a few obscure others. i spent 3 hours compiling these and it is as complete as i could possibly make it along with a list detailing what they all do and what number they are. if anybody else has something to add to it then be my guest, and notify me so i can update my own records. i hope you all benefit from them as i do, thanks and enjoy!!
