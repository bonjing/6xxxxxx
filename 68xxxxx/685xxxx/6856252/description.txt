"Head Games"

Harry and Adam argue on behalf of parents 
whose son died after receiving a 
concussive blow while playing on his high 
school football team. During the case, 
Harry examines the danger that football-
related injuries pose to young athletes. 
Meanwhile, Tommy represents a struggling 
single mother who resorted to robbing a 
bank in order to pay her mounting bills. 
With Cassie's help, they put the 
government on trial by arguing a rarely 
used defense.
