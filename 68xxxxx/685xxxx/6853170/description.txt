Here we are right now :
For this time also in exclusivity to TPB now :
vlc media player 1.3.0-git for Mac OSX Intel
Mac osx Intel 10.6.8 or later is required for this new version anyway.
However i dunno if it is the x32 or x64 version,may be it will work on each edition.
untouched and clean and delivered such "as is".
Build is dated from today : 2011,november 29
not official anyway and beta version aswell.
Seed a bit,please and let me know your opinion about this new one.
Btw : fast peers,please,don't give so much up speed !!!
30-50 ko/s is largely suffisant.
Don't forget slow peers,please,you are not alone...
Note : old utorrent users must use minimum utorrent 1.9 to get full udp tracker support-compatibility.

ty for understanding
Enjoy and have fun
best regards
