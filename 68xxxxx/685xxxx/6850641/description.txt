Have you ever heard the phrase \"God has a wonderful plan for your life\"? Do you think it\'s biblical? Before you answer, consider this -- What would you say if you were able to preach to 1,000 people in Tower One of the World Trade Center, the day before it collapsed and killed them? Could you tell them that God had a \"wonderful plan\" for their lives, knowing that they would die the very next in such a horrible way? This episode not only exposes this popular yet unbiblical presentation, but it shows how it actually limits the Gospel to a certain segment of the world, and how it has the potential to fill the Church with false converts.
