These low-quality .avi (XVID) files are ripped on the fly from the 8-DVD set I recently uploaded here at The Pirate Bay, using the free version of DVDx 4.0.  They're for people who want the :20 Minute Workout episodes that are on the DVD set but lack the time or bandwidth to download a full 28 GB torrent.  The files are best for either a small screen or a quick (ahem) "fix".  On a regular screen the quality will be passable but not stellar.

BUT...

I am currently using DVD Decrypter and Auto Gordion Knot to create much better quality .avi files.  They should be ready for upload by tomorrow afternoon.  They will also be XVID and have the original AC3 audio.  Each file will be about 350 MB, or double the average size of the files in this torrent, so expect a 10 GB torrent from that.  You'll need the appropriate appropriate codecs.  As always, it's best to go to the official sources for that sort of thing, so here are the links:

XVID - http://www.xvid.org
AC3 - http://ac3filter.net/wiki/Projects/ac3filter

Both links are from www.videohelp.com, a trusted all-in-one video reference site.  Once you've downloaded and installed both codecs, you should have no trouble playing the XVID files I'll be uploading tomorrow.
