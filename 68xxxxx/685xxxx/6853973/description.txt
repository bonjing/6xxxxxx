Outtakes, jams and other weirdness from the Aoxomoxoa sessions in 1968 and 1969. Also included in this torrent is a vinyl rip of the album's original mix which was consigned to oblivion by Jerry & Phil when they remixed the album in the 1970s. I cleaned up the sessions files for listenability and padded out these bootleg tracks with jams appended to the 2001 CD reissue of the official album. The 12 "sessions" tracks fit nicely onto one CD. Enoy!
