Furry Lewis  Presenting The Country Blues
Recorded: July 21, 1968 at Ardent Studios, Memphis
Released: 1969
Label: Blue Horizon
Format: Mp3@320

Bridging the gap between the early acoustic blues of the Mississippi Delta of the 1920s and the rediscovery of so-called "folk" or country blues by white audiences in the '60s, Furry Lewis was both a unique stylist and a throwback to the sound of an earlier era. Equally capable of playing guitar with an original fingerpicked style as well as delivering a mean slide-guitar sound, Lewis was a charismatic storyteller and a flamboyant showman that performed naturally with skill and humor.
