BUDDY HOLLY
SOMETHING SPECIAL FROM BUDDY HOLLY
aka The Bobby Peeples Tapes
Remastered Edition
RMW 794



32-bit declicked, denoised, pitch, phase and levels corrected from the 1986 UK LP on Roller Coaster ROLL 2013.

These are what is known as Buddy Holly's "garage tapes." It's a quite rare album of the complete "Bobby Peeples Tapes" - or all that survives and is usable from them, as the tape was of poor quality and was irreparably damaged in spots. These recordings are on the Vigotone Holly set, but they don't sound as good as they do here. Norman Petty had several of these tracks overdubbed and released on two different albums. Here, they are undubbed.

ffp file and artwork are included.
