Games Description:

One man pushes the free world to the brink as Modern Warfare crashes the borders of the most powerful nations on Earth. This campaign is not about flushing out terrorists in far-away locales. It's a desperate fight to survive, right on the homefront. Take up arms to defend England, Germany, France, and the United States in urban settings where freedom is on the line. Multiplayer retains its key features and adds a few choice upgrades, while the action takes a furious new turn with the addition of Survival Mode. Team up with a friend and see how long you can withstand a continuous onslaught of enemy fire. 

Modern Warfare is back. The best-selling first person action series of all-time returns with the epic sequel to multiple Game of the Year award winner, Call of Dutyâ”¬Â«: Modern Warfare 2.
