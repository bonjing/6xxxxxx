Most seem to think the 1982 version was the original but the concept of the movies to me came from this movie or of course the book it basically made from.

Storyline

Scientist at an Arctic research station discover a spacecraft buried in the ice. Upon closer examination, they discover the frozen pilot. All hell breaks loose when they take him back to their station and he is accidentally thawed out!
