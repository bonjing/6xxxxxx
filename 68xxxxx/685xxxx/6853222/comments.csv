When you install you will get an error, click on ""ignore"" several times, after that installation will work fine. After you finish instalation download ""kbl55.ttf"" (search on google). Copy the font from instalation folder, after that go to ""C:\Program Files\Foxy Games\Elementary My Dear Majesty\Data\Fonts"" and move it there."
