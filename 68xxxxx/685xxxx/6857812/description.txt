THE VOICE OF ANGELS

Angels is a vocal group consisting of 17 highly talented children aged 11 to 14. They all have one thing in common - to have been blessed with truly angelic voices. The Angels are all members of the internationally acclaimed Tygerberg Children's Choir, one of the Western Cape's proudest export products and real ambassadors in harmony. This choir, under the exceptional leadership of world-renowned choir leader Hendrik D. Loock, is widely regarded as one of the very best children's choirs in the world today. Thanks to Hendrik D. Loock's infinite attention to quality of sound and unsurpassed musicality, the Tygerberg Children's Choir has won every major international choir competition since it was formed 36 years ago, in 1972. It is due to this very solid musical background that the Tygerberg Children's Choir was the obvious choice for the Voice of Angels project.

Their first CD, The Voice of Angels, has taken the country by storm since its release in July 2008,
