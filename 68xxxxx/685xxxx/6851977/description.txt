::Plot::
Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) is a disgruntled programmer at Initech, a software company plagued by bureaucracy and excessive management. He spends his days "staring at his desk" instead of reprogramming bank software to be Y2K-compliant. His co-workers include Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu), who is annoyed by the fact that nobody can pronounce his last name correctly; Michael Bolton (David Herman), who loathes having the same name as the famous singer, whom he hates; and Milton Waddams (Stephen Root), a meek, fixated collator who constantly mumbles to himself (most notably about his workmates' borrowing his favorite red Swingline stapler and about his plan or threat to set the workplace on fire). Milton had been laid off years earlier, but due to a payroll computer glitch, was never informed, and therefore has received regular paychecks. All four are repeatedly bullied and harassed by management, especially Initech's smarmy, callous vice president, Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole). The staff are further agitated by the arrival of two consultants, Bob Slydell (John C. McGinley) and Bob Porter (Paul Willson), who are brought in to help with cutting expenses, mainly through downsizing.
