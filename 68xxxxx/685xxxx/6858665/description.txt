My personal favorite death metal band, Decapitated. They are superbly talented! Another impressive thing about this band is that they all were under age 16 when they started to record music that was already better than most bands today. I even decided to add the album Carnival Is Forever even though i don't like it because well,,, its a discography. I dont like it because 3/4ths of the original band members left the band or died (RIP Vitek) and in the album Carnival Is Forever, they sound like Meshuggah... Not what i wanted.. I encourage you to buy their albums and support this MAGICAL band.
