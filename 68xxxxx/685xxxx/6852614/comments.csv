An important NOTE:    

I will seed all my torrents for a week each, after that u have to seed it to keep it alive.....as i have the other torrents to upload as well. Well....if anyone doesn't get enough speed in any torrent, then they can comment n inform me, I will try my best to re-seed the torrent(s).

Regards....PirateBoyTPB :)"
