"The Male in the Mail"

Dismembered remains are discovered in 
several mailing boxes at a dead 
letter office, and the Jeffersonian 
team identifies the victim as an 
employee of a local Ship 'n' Print, 
where the staff recently split the 
winnings of a lottery prize. The team 
uncovers a complicated love triangle 
between two married employees and the 
victim, and while motive points to 
the husband, a critical clue leads 
them to solve the crime definitively. 
Meanwhile, Booth's grandfather breaks 
some unexpected news, and Special 
Agent Genny Shaw learns the 
importance of teamwork.

Enjoy :)
