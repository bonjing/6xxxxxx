,reaperking666,2012-04-03T23:21Z,Go to the Skyrim Nexus and you will find many mods... I never understood this way of modding...
laythroughs.

These mods are originally published on SkyRim Nexus, and his mod pack is 100% guaranteed to be out of date.  This is the idiots way of modifying.  

How about giving credit to the authors of the mods,  or telling people where the mods came from and that they can go to the Nexus and actually input what they want, and get the up to date versions.  The best mods are releasing updates at least once a week.  This mod pack for people who can't do things for themselves, go to skyrimnexus dot com and stay up to date."
