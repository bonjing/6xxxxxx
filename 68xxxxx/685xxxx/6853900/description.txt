"Bro-gurt"

When the National Invention Convention 
Extravaganza comes to town, Virginia 
encourages the family to submit their own 
inventions that could bring home a large 
cash prize. Burt teams with the family's 
neighbor Andrew (guest star Ethan Suplee) 
and invents unusually flavored yogurts, 
while Jimmy partners with Sabrina to develop 
a new baby mop. When convention day arrives 
the competition between each team escalates 
as they pitch their inventions to Andrew 
Dice Clay. During the competition, the 
family ends up realizing family and friends 
are what matter the most.
