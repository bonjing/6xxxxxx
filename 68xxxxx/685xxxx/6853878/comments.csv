t access.  Had no idea WHAT email address I used and finally had a moderator come to my rescue.  

And, of course, there's been the harassment from various ISPs who have closed my account or blocked my access to TPB.  I wasn't sure if the inability to log on was my password or the ISP playing tricks.

Now I'm using a service that makes me anonymous online.  To hell with the ISP.  "
