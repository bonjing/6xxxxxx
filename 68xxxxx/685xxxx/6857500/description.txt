Fate of the World is a 2011 global warming game developed and published by 

Red Redemption. It features several scenarios, based on actual scientific 

research, in which the player is put in charge of a fictional international 

organization managing social, technological and environmental policies. The 

goals of the scenarios range from improving living conditions in Africa, to 

preventing catastrophic climate change, to exacerbating it[1][2].

America

Fate of the World is a turn-based game, with each turn representing five 

years. The starting date is typically 2020, while the final date depends on 

the scenario. In the core interface the player chooses policies to fund in 

each game turn, represented by "cards". These need to be distributed and 

balanced between twelve world regions, and many, such as a transition to 

electric cars, take several turns to implement locking up funds for the 

duration. The player also needs to manage public opinion with the risk of 

being banned from individual regions if public approval drops too low. Each 

scenario specifies a set of win and lose conditions, such as the amount of 

warming in Celsius, human development index, and how many regions the 

player is active in.
