ABOUT (from their website):

The What Cheer? Brigade is a 19-piece brass band from Providence, RI, USA. Our sound is an aggressive mix of Bollywood, The Balkans, New Orleans, Samba and Hip-Hop, played with the intensity of metal. Requiring no amplification, we prove that great parties need no electricity. Our live shows defy boundaries, appealing equally to punks and farmers, old and young.

â€œThrillingly competent, with undimmable energyâ€¦an explosion of good cheer.â€
-The New York Times

â€œThey never actually took a stage, but Providence, RIâ€™s What Cheer? dominated the Newport Folk Fest like a headliner.â€
 -SPIN


Since 2005, the band has been as likely to appear at community benefits as at all-night parties, playing bars, clubs, streets, libraries, cemeteries, weddings, bus stops, and playgrounds. In 2010, we joined Anchor Brain Records to re-release our second CD, We Blow, You Suck. Weâ€™ve played with Dan Deacon, Man Man, Japanther, Dengue Fever, Okkervil River, Lightning Bolt, Ninjasonik, Mika Miko, Wolf Parade, Matt and Kim, Slavic Soul Party, Javelin, Sage Francis, and Chain and the Gang. Weâ€™ve appeared at Lollapalooza, Sziget (Hungary), and Guca (Serbia), offering mobile, intense moments of outdoor revelry.
