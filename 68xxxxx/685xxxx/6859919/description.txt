A brilliant comedy from Roberto Benigni with some truly sad moments
of coming to terms with inane cruelty to the human spirit generally

This movie does show the greatest spirit of the kind peoples of Italy and asks
why anyone would want to call the nicest kid on the block "inferior" 
as did Hitler! Go figure!
