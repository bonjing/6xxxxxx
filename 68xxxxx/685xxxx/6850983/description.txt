"The authors went to great lengths to take a close-up look at a wide array of treatment options and they realized a nearly impossible task of streamlining the bulk of currently available evidence on chronic low back pain. For each treatment, five different sections were created to allow clinicians, patients, third-party payers and other stakeholders to make informed decisions; namely: description, theory, efficacy, safety and costs. This intelligent design was implemented identically for each treatment."
