"[...]There is a story that Furtwangler once attended a performance of Mahlerâ€™s Fifth Symphony conducted by Kubelik and after congratulating him backstage nevertheless wondered if it was all worth the effort. Kubelik certainly believed Mahler was worth the effort as this recording from early in his career and at what must have been near the time when Furtwangler heard him proves. As a performance this is the best of Kubelikâ€™s three available recordings. An archive recording all Mahlerites should own for the young Kubelik and for the old Concertgebouw. The fact that it is in mono should be noted but, on this occasion, I am not letting that fact get in the way of including it as a main recommendation."

"An outstanding, live 1951 performance, with Concertgebouw orchestra. If you haven't heard this one, you haven't heard Mahler's fifth in its very best interpretation".
