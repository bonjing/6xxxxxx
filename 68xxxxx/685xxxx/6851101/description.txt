Slackware 13.37 brings many updates and enhancements, among which 
you'll find two of the most advanced desktop environments available 
today: Xfce 4.6.2, a fast and lightweight but visually appealing and 
easy to use desktop environment, and KDE 4.5.5, a recent stable release 
of the 4.5.x series of the award-winning KDE desktop environment.  
We continue to make use of HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) and udev, 
which allow the system administrator to grant use of various hardware 
devices according to users' group membership so that they will be able 
to use items such as USB flash sticks, USB cameras that appear like USB 
storage, portable hard drives, CD and DVD media, MP3 players, and more, 
all without requiring sudo, the mount or umount command.  Just plug and 
play.  Properly set up, Slackware's desktop should be suitable for any 
level of Linux experience.  New to the desktop framework are ConsoleKit 
and PolicyKit.  ConsoleKit handles "seats", things like dealing with 
devices when switching from one user to another.  PolicyKit is a system 
for fine-grained access control, allowing a non-root user to run certain 
tasks with elevated privilege, but more securely than if the entire task 
were simply run as root.

    Slackware uses the 2.6.37.6 kernel bringing you advanced performance 
features such as journaling filesystems, SCSI and ATA RAID volume 
support, SATA support, Software RAID, LVM (the Logical Volume Manager), 
and encrypted filesystems.  Kernel support for X DRI (the Direct 
Rendering Interface) brings high-speed hardware accelerated 3D graphics 
to Linux.
