Although never very popular in their native Britain, Bennet's debut LP, Super Natural, is a fine exercise in catchy punk-pop. Lead singer Jason Aplin, sounding like a dead ringer for Menswear vocalist Johnny Dean, adds a bit of a biting sarcasm to each of the 16 tracks. While not particularly hook-filled apart from the four singles, the songs are first rate aggressive singalongs that recall the glory days of Brit-pop that, at this point, were nearly two years in the past. "Mum's Gone to Iceland" was an appealing slice of punchy power-pop that became a U.K. Top 40 hit and is one of the highlights on this disc, along with "If You Met Me Then You'd Like Me." For a Brit-pop fan, this is a very memorable release that, for the most part, received little acknowledgment.
