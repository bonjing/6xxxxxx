NOTES: I'm considering re-encoding this release to approximately 1/3 - 1/4th of its size. I tested it out and the picture quality would still be fairly\some would say very good. With the sound mixed down from DD5.1 to AAC Stereo Doly Pro Logic II with variabel bitrate 160kbps. I tested this out as well, and I would say it's still a very good quality and you save a lot of space whilst also it being easier to maintain good seeds on TPB.
It also tested flawlessly on PS3 after re-encode. Not sure on Xbox, but I would guess work good onHour and other media centers.

Let me know in the comments if you want me to do that or not. 


Until then, enjoy this new season, and let's hope for another one!
