,amar2202,2012-01-25T20:37Z,@DZRev i have the same specs and im running on 40 fps there is a trick making the fps higher(without any hacks or cracks)
yes, i got more then 30 fps after plying this but wtf is all with the slow-mo thing? until there's a normal non-slow-mo-providing fix consider this as a no help at all"
