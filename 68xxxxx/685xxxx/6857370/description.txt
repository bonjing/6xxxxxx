 Okay PC gamers, here is something special for you today. By now, most of you probably know that the PC version of L.A. Noire is locked at 30fps. Well, not anymore. Rage3Dâ€™s user â€˜jackfusteâ€™, the man behind the FPS workarounds for both Star Wars: The Force Unleashed 1 & 2 just released a 30FPS removal for Rockstarâ€™s adventure game. Moreover, this modified crack also removes the black bars on 4:3, 5:4 and 16:10 resolutions, which is a big plus. To put it simple; this is how L.A. Noire should have been in the first place. 


Make sure though that you have updated your game to the latest version, "Jackfuste" made this fix to work with v1.0.2396. 


Instructions: 
in this archive you will find 2 folders, 1 for 30FPS with removed black bars, another for 60FPS with removed black bars, each contains crack files for each aspect ratio, pick 1 then copy the contents of it and overwrite the game files.
