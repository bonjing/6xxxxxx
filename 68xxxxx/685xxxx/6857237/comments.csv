Do not take me wrong, but this release has very low bit rate for a 40"" screen (I've seen a lot of artifacts in many scenes). Can you please think about the possibility to make another release of this movie but with a higher bit rate (higher than 3500 for instance)? I know I'm asking a lot, but since you got access to BlueRay source I would like to ask...

Anyway, thank you very much."
