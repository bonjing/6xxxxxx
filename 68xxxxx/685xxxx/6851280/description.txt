Green Lantern is the name of several fictional characters, 
superheroes appearing in comic books published by DC Comics. 

Each Green Lantern possesses a power ring and power lantern that gives the user great control over the physical world as long as the wielder has sufficient willpower and strength to wield it. The ring is one of the most powerful weapons in the universe, and can be very dangerous. While the ring of the Golden Age Green Lantern (Alan Scott) was magically powered, the rings worn by all subsequent Lanterns were technological creations of the Guardians of the Universe, who granted such rings to worthy candidates. These individuals made up the intergalactic police force known as the Green Lantern Corps. (Source: Wikipeida)

Ace test pilot Hal Jordan, who leads a secret life as Earth's guardian Green Lantern, is called back to Oa. Searching for the culprits behind a series of Green Lantern deaths in "Frontier Space", Hal and his gruff fellow Green Lantern Kilowog â€œcommandeerâ€ The Interceptor, a prototype spaceship powered by pure Green Lantern energy and an advanced artificial intelligence system that Hal names Aya. Hal and Kilowog later discover that a group of Red Lanterns, including the conflicted Razer and the vile Zilius Zox have been targeting and eliminating Green Lanterns in Frontier Space. Along with the help from a surviving Frontier Space Green Lantern Shyir Rev, Hal and Kilowog must stop the Red Lantern leader Atrocitus from destroying Shyir's home planet of Colony 12. In the end, Shyir sacrifices himself to allow Kilowog to save the inhabitants of his world, who are resettled on a new world named Rev, while a repentant Razer, who has come to realise what he has truly done, is captured by Jordan while attempting 'Suicide by Lantern', to force Hal to kill him as his form of atonement. With Aya's drive system damaged and requiring 9 months to self repair, Kilowog and Jordan set out to stop the Red Lanterns themselves, while debating what to do with the captive Razer.
