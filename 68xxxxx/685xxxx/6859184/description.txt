Notes from the back cover:
This collection was mastered from the original monaural 30 and 15 ips master tapes at the MCA studios. The recordings have neither been artificially enhanced nor re-channeled for stereo effect. Disc transfer was accomplished using Studer tape machines and a computer-controlled Neumann lathe with a helium-cooled cutting head. Throughout the project, utmost care was used to preserve the remarkable quality of the tapes. Whenever possible, false starts and studio conversation have been left in. To enjoy the spirit of the original performances, we suggest you play this record at high volume.

Classic rock & roll from Memphis. The original LP that these guys made for Coral in 1956 goes for big $$$ if you can find one in decent shape. This 1978 issue has most of those tracks, plus a few single releases and alternate takes. I've seen this with a yellow cover, but I think the black cover came first. This was one of the first remasters that featured false starts and studio chatter. Obviously Jeff Beck and the Yardbirds were listening to these guys, as they covered "Train Kept A-Rollin'", and it was covered more famously later by Aerosmith.
