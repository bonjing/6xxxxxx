"Perils of Paranoia"

A prosecutor suffers from what he 
believes to be cardiac arrest during 
an interrogation at the witness 
stand. The team's preliminary 
diagnosis is hyper-anxiety, but when 
Adams and Park investigate the 
patient's home and find a hidden 
arsenal of firearms, they uncover a 
more alarming and deep-seated 
psychological disorder. Also, Wilson 
becomes obsessed with proving that 
House is hiding something in his 
home, Park slowly comes out of her 
social shell and Foreman's lack of 
romantic relationships piques the 
interest of Taub and Chase.
