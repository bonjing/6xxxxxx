[V],joshua13,2011-12-01T20:10Z,I doubt it. I didn't grow up a marvel fan it's true but that's not the reason This is such a time consuming thing to do and with Marvel I'd have to do a lot more research as I know so little about Marvel comics and the characters origin. Actually I mostly read Golden Age comics and that was before Marvel took a different direction than DC in the 60s I plan on reading my 1940s Timely and Atlas (marvel ancestor companies)
