The Gospel Bill Show by Willie George Ministries

When I was a kid I watched \"The Gospel Bill Show\" followed by \"Superbook\" and \"The Flying House\" every Saturday.

Must have if you are a parent. This teaches responsibility, and how to deal with life\'s challenges using God\'s Word.

I hope to someday buy and upload the \"Covenant Rider\" Trilogy and make that available.

Enjoy and God Bless!
