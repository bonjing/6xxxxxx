LEADBELLY SINGS FOLK SONGS
Recorded 1989
Label Smithsonian Folkways Recordings
Format:Mp3@320


One of 17 Huddie Ledbetter albums on the Smithsonian Folkways label, Sings Folk Songs is a superb collection of classic recordings of traditional tunes, most of which were arranged (and some written) by the man himself. Joined by friends (including Woody Guthrie) on backing vocals and harmonica, Leadbelly's resonant 12-string guitar and warm, enthusiastic singing charge through numbers like "There's A Man Going Round Taking Names" and "Corn Bread Rough."

The greatest delight of the album is the unhindered spirit of freedom and improvisation that pervades: gradually quickening tempos, shouts and hollers, minor flubs, and extemporaneous lyrics-- such as the duet with Woody Guthrie on "We Shall Be Free" and the chop-licking explication of all the pancakes available in heaven in "Good, Good, Good." Moreover, it is easy to see how these songs became and have remained so popular
