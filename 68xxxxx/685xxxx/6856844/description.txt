We love our mobile phones and the selection between different models has never been 
bigger.
 But the production of phones has a dark, bloody side.
 The main part of minerals used to produce phones is coming from the mines in the
 Eastern DR Congo.
 The Western World is buying these so-called conflict minerals and thereby finances
 a civil war that, according to human rights organisations,
 has been the bloodiest conflict 
since World War II: During the last 15 years the conflict has cost the lives 
of more
than 5 million people and 300,000 women have been raped.
 The war will continue as long as armed groups can finance their warfare
 by selling minerals.
 The Documentary Blood in the Mobile shows the connection between our phones 
and the civil war in the Congo.
 Director Frank Poulsen travels to DR Congo to see the illegal mine industry 
with his own eyes.
 He gets access to Congo s largest tin-mine, which is being controlled by different 
armed groups,
 and where children work for days in narrow mine tunnels to dig out the minerals
 that end up in our phones.
