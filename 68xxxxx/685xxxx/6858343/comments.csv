But this ain't Friday Smackdown is it.

I just went and checked the file on XWT, this is the Live Smackdown fron Tuesday, ye actually have that as air date as well 29/11/11.

Nice of you to ip it and all that.

But some who will already have downed the live show from Tuesday and seeing this torrent titled Friday Smackdown, will down this unnecessarily and be disappointed and have to dowmnload the actual FNS when released. Wasting their time and diappointing them. Not good, ay.

Please title shows correctly, you up the shows, it's up to you to get things right.

Not everybody is observant or checks, they trust you to get things correct. But ye haven't in this instance.

It's the release groups fault, who made the error, but ye could have corrected it as reupping from source.

No offence.

mateys!

If ye've already seen last Tuesdays' Live Smackdown, don't download this thinking it's last nights KYR airing of FNS, as per air date in torrent decription, it isn't, it's the Live show from Tuesday but titled Friday.Night.Smackdown.

Peace. : )"
