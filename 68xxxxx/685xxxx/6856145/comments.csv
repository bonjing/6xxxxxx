I really don't understand why anyone would use the very worst of the 3 mp3 formats, when they obviously realise that the bit rate is important, surely the method of encoding should be equally important.
Joint stereo is not 2 different left and right channels.
Sounds OK though and after all it's free so shouldn't complain really.
Look for a FLAC version soon........."
