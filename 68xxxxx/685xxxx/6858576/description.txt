Sikhs consider the Granth to be a spiritual guide for mankind, and it plays a central role in \\\"guiding\\\" the Sikhs\\\' way of life. Its place in Sikh devotional life is based on two fundamental principles: that the text is divine revelation,[7] and that all answers regarding religion and morality can be discovered within it. Its hymns and teachings are called Gurbani or \\\"Word of the guru\\\" and sometimes Guru ki bani or \\\"Word of God\\\". Thus, in Sikh theology, the revealed divine word is written by the past Gurus.[8] The numerous holy men other than the Sikh Gurus whose writing were included in the Adi Granth are collectively referred to as Bhagats, \\\"devotees\\\", and their writings are referred to as Bhagat bani, \\\"Word of Devotees\\\". These saints belonged to different social and religious backgrounds, including Hindus and Muslims, cobblers and untouchables. Guru Granth Sahib is said to be the sole and final successor of the line of gurus.
