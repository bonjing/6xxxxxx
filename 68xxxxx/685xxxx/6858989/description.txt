Revolver (stylized as rEVOLVEr) is the fourth studio album by American R&B; recording artist T-Pain, released through his own label Nappy Boy Entertainment, Konvict Muzik, and RCA Records. Recording sessions for the album have taken place from 2009 to 2011. T-Pain stated that the two R's in the word, RevolveÐ¯ have been capitalized so that in the middle, it says "evolve", indicating that T-Pain has evolved as an artist, and as a person in the period from Thr33 Ringz up till RevolveÐ¯. He later stated that the R's were put to show how people can be deceived, and precept incorrectly without looking at the inside of things, and he then said that this will be the scheme of the album.
