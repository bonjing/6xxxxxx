This western Canadian singer/songwriter is brutally introspective, yet outgoing. After all, she's hosted the Juno Awards (Canada's version of the Grammys). She writes and sings beguilingly on this strong debut about temptation, salvation, jealousy, and loneliness. Former John Mellencamp drummer Kenny Aronoff helps to ground the album's seamless sound, and Jackson Browne drops in for "Unloved."
