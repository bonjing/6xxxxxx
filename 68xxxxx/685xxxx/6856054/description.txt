
 The Vault is kind of a contemporary Pandora's Box story. It's about a team of treasure hunters lead by two serious archaeologists that are searching for a rumored lost treasure. (And there are still lots of them left out there by the way.) They're equipped with all the latest in high tech equipment, from imaging gear to robotics to deep sea,mechanical dive suits, they have it all. Not to mention, the means to fend off pirates or rival treasure hunters if the need arises. The search however, leads them to uncover something that they didn't expect at all and leaves them with a dilemma. Do they put it back and leave it alone? Or do they keep it and open it up?
