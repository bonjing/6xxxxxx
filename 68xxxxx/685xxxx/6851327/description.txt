The first episode takes Michael to Camp Bastion hospital in Afghanistan to find out how medics have achieved the highest survival rate in the history of warfare. And in A&E departments in the USA, he looks at the latest medical advances that could save thousands of lives both on and off the battlefield.

The survival rate in Afghanistan is the highest in the history of combat - but this means people are surviving with dreadful injuries.
