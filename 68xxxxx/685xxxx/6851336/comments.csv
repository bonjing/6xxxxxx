No one here understands proper video compression, i would expect a 1080p bluray rip of this episode to be *CLOSE* to 1 GB, but that's only IF you use the right container and the right compression method. This however is NOT HD, it's actually lower quality than SDTV. 624x352 should be around 100-150MB in size, so once again, i am disappoint. "
