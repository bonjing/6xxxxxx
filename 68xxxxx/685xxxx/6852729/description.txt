Coming from one of the more unfortunately overlooked British bands, Warm Jets' debut album, Future Signs, is an impressive disc of post-alternative rock. Since the demise of Brit-pop, most British bands have become decreasingly commercial, and while Warm Jets are no exception, they manage to combine the best of Brit-pop with the best of post-rock. The songs aren't overproduced and the sound is a bit lazy (think of a young, British Pavement), but the pop appeal is definitely present, especially in the stellar singles "Hurricane," "Autopia" and the title track. There is only a minimal amount of filler, and the understated musicianship presented creates a truly unique sound for this debut LP. Future Signs is a very assured debut and the work of a band who is poised to create some very memorable music.
