The episode starts with Panthro scoping out the lizard army. He is worried that that the cats cannot defeat them with the small number of people they have. Meanwhile, Lion-O and Tygra are searching for the stone in the astral plane. Tygra threatens to keep the stone if he finds it. Mumm-Ra is seen in the background, hoping that the brothers' rivalry will lead to their deaths. It then cuts back to Panthro explaining that Grune lost his tooth fighting a giant spider to WilyKit and WilyKat. Back in the astral plane, Lion-O and Tygra come across a scene from their childhood where Tygra dared Lion-O to cross a log over a deep pit. Lion-O figures out that Tygra broke the log on purpose while Lion-O was crossing, and had previously thought it snapped on its own. Outside the astral plane, Grune suggests to Slithe that they go against Mumm-Ra's orders. Back in the plane, Tygra gets a copy of the sword of omens and begins to fight Lion-O over the position of king and getting Cheetara. Meanwhile, Cheetara holds off the lizards from entering the astral plane while Panthro fights one-on-one with Grune. Tygra then knocks Lion-O back into the pit. He then remembers that he ran and got help after Lion-O fell in the pit when they were children, and swears that he will never betray Lion-O and helps him out of the pit. Back at the village, the elephants finally decide to help fight off the lizards and manage to drive most of them away. Lion-O and Tygra are shown battling Mumm-Ra in the astral plane when Lion-O discovers that the stone is what holds the astral plane together and puts it in his gauntlet. They defeat Mumm-Ra, but the astral plane slowly begins to deteriorate. Panthro, still fighting Grune, forces Grune into the closing gateway to the astral plane. Grune is sucked into the gate, but so are most of Panthro's arms. Later, they hold a celebration at the village, where Panthro is shown recovering. Anet tells Lion-O that Tygra has yet to betray him because the evening bell has yet to ring. Outside the celebration, Cheetara confesses her feelings to Tygra, and they passionately kiss. unbeknownst to them, Lion-O sees them and is devastated.
