If you're the type of person that believes Santa is a scientifically proven persona, you'll probably believe what the author has to say.

If you're like me, this book is a good read if you need to relight your flame and have a good laugh.

Anyone claiming to feel rejuvenation the instant a food-source enters the mouth is a Donald Duck.

Go vegan."
