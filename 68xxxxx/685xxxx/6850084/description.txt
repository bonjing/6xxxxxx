Big Brother and the Holding Company - Cheap Thrills 1968 

Big Brother and the Holding Company is an American rock band that formed in San Francisco in 1965 as part of the same psychedelic music scene that produced the Grateful Dead, Quicksilver Messenger Service and Jefferson Airplane. They are best known as the band that featured Janis Joplin as their lead singer. Their 1968 album Cheap Thrills is considered one of the masterpieces of the psychedelic sound of San Francisco it reached number one on the Billboard charts, and was ranked number 338 in Rolling Stones the 500 greatest albums of all time.

Cheap Thrills is the second album by the Big Brother and the Holding Company and their last album with Janis Joplin. The album was very successful, having sold more than one million records in its first year, mostly because of the performance at Monterey Pop Festival, which made them gain a lot of attention.

The cover was drawn by underground cartoonist Robert Crumb after the bands original cover idea, a picture of the group naked in bed together, was dropped by the record company. Crumb had originally intended his art for the LP back cover, with a portrait of Joplin to grace the front. But Joplinâ€”an avid fan of underground comics, especially the work of Crumbâ€”so loved the Cheap Thrills illustration that she demanded it to be placed on the front cover. It is number nine on Rolling Stones list of one hundred greatest album covers.

Initially, the album was to be called Sex, Dope and Cheap Thrills, but the title was not received well by the record company either, so it was shortened to just Cheap Thrills.
