All't best bits from series 1 to 3 where we all look youngerer apart from Fearne who's always looked like an old lady (only joking she's super F.A.F). Travel back in time to when it first started with appearances from John Bishop, Emma Bunton, Dermot Oâ€™Leary, Davina McCall, Paddy McGuiness and my 2 Irish offspring Jedward POTATO! With 'nuff unseen stuff that was never aired cos I said things I shouldn't,
