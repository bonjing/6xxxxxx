    * The mysterious Uluru (Ayers Rock) in Red Center that has awed people for thousands of years
    * Where to spot all kinds of wildlife, including kangaroos, platypuses, wallabies, Tasmanian devils, wombats, marsupials, and man-eating crocodiles

    * All kinds of activities, from boomerang- and spear-throwing instruction to hiking to snorkeling over dazzling reefs, fishing for coral trout, or discovering Australiaâ€™s best wines
    * Great accommodations, ranging from luxury hotels to an African-style safari camp with air-conditioned tents to a motel with underground rooms reached by a maze of tunnels dug out of the rock
