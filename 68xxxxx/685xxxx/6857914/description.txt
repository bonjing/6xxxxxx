Sea Rex: Journey to a Prehistoric World


Join Julie, an imaginative young woman, as she travels from a modern-day aquarium to the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Explore an amazing underwater universe inhabited by larger-than-life creatures - including the powerful Liopleurodon, long-necked Elasmosaurus and gigantic Shonisaurus - which were ruling the seas before dinosaurs conquered the earth. Thanks to state-of-the-art ultra-photorealistic imagery, see science come alive in a unique and entertaining manner. Immerse yourself in a lost age, 200 million years back in time, and get ready for a face-to-face encounter with the T-Rex of the seas
Embark on an unforgettable journey through the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods and swim with creatures that have been extinct for millions of years in this film that explores our past in ways we've never imagined. Long before the Tyrannosaurus Rex roamed the land, enormous sea creatures like the Shonisaurus called the ocean their home. Now, thanks to computer-generated imagery and IMAX technology, we can swim alongside these majestic beasts and experience sights that no human has ever witnessed.
