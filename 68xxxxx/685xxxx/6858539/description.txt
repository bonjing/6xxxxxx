         What if I told you the government had proof of alien life     
         but was actively covering it up? Millions of Americans        
         believe in UFOs, but the government vehemently denies any     
         alien encounters, from the infamous Roswell incident to the   
         ultra-secretive military base known as Area 51. Finally,      
         members of top military and aviation organizations break      
         their silence to reveal exactly what the government knows     
         about alien life, and what they stand to gain by lying        
          about it.
