y at finding a good version of Breaking Dawn, the last one was kind of dark and filmed in a theatre with the noice that comes with that, hehe. But hey - I'm HAPPY anyways!!!
This one though was better! Better light,  the part on Isle Esme where Edward talks to a woman was translated! And the end scene with Aro & co. is in this version, but not in the last film I watched - And better quality too! This will do perfectly til' I buy the DVD in the spring or something! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! =)=)=)"
