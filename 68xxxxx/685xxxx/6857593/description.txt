I couldn't find the exact sort of Christmas CD I was looking for, so I made it. Lots of Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Dean Martin, plus loads of other classic Christmas songs. Will fit on 1 CD (provided you reduce the standard 2 second pause between tracks to 1 second or less, that is).

Merry Christmas!
