A one hour crossover episode between Ben 10: Ultimate Alien and Generator Rex in which Ben Tennyson accidentally travels to Generator Rex's dimension. At first, Ben 10 and Rex don't get along but they end up joining forces in order to defeat the evil Alpha Nanite that was created by Caesar Salazar, Rex's brother, years ago before the Nanine accident and prevent mankind facing Armageddon.

We learn at the end after the defeat of the Alpha Nanite with the assistance of Ben that the Alpha Nanite controls mechanical objects especially nanites while the Omega Nanite produces nanites. Rex owns the Omega Nanite but it was stolen by the Alpha Nanite and absorbed into his new body in this episode in order to stabilize his form during the middle of this episode.
