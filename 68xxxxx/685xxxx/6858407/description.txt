Michel Legrand - I love Paris

mp3, variable 


There have been successful albums of instrumental music along the times, but this work contains a basic element. It is made with the best French Romantic themes of the City Light, includes between the members a prominent musician; a trumpeter named Miles Davis and it is conducted by this hyper talented General musician: Michel Legrand, who reached with this work the apex of his lifelong career. 

I think this is the best album of Instrumental music ever recorded, despite the fact, more than fifty years have elapsed.
