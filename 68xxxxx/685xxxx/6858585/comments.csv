,atrophyandroid,2012-05-16T19:52Z,"I'm having this issue where right after I defeat the penguin's henchmen the very first time, like at the very beginning of the game, the game becomes stuck and doesn't progress at all. I don't get the bit where he talks so I can smack the penguin and go up the ladder to try to talk to alfred. Is anyone else having this problem? Is it because I'm running Windows 64-bit?"
