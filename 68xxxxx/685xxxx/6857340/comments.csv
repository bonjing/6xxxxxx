,i.me.myself,2012-04-12T05:18Z,"I have downloaded it and tried playing with my nvidia 3d shutter glasses. So here is my experience:

1) This is not a SBS version
2) Able to play with Frame Sequential Mode
3) Playing with Frame Sequential is like skipping one frame after another giving very bad experience
4) Better to watch in 2d version as 3d ver gives u experience like somebody badly converted it.

My request is please stop sharing such videos which are not really 3d. I will appreciate if you be transparent with TPB and tell us the truth that is just another 2d video converted in 3d just the namesake :( "
