    A beautiful American doctor imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp      
    uses her skill to save the life of an SS officer, who falls in love      
    with her. However, a sadistic female SS officer considers him her        
    personal property, and has no compunction about using her riding crop    
    to whip, beat and torture to make sure it stays that way.
