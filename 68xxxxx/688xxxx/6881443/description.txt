All the codecs you need for Windows 7 to play AVIs, DVDs and more!

It does not contain a media player and it does not associate file-types. With the 
Windows 7 codec package installed you will be able to use any media player, limited 
only by the players' capabilities, to play all movies and video clips. Streaming video 
is supported in several formats in all popular web browsers. Users of the Windows 7 
media center codecs have the ability to choose what is installed and where to install 
it using the public redistributable. After installation you can select to remove 
specific portions without removing the entire package. You can also re-add the removed 
items at any time.
