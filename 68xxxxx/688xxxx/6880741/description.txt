This collection comes from Issaquah's torrent here: 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3895750/Webshots_Wide_Screen_Photo_Collections

The wide screen pictures are absolutely stunning, professional photos from SuperStock and the like. It's a shame that torrent has low seeders. Perhaps that is because of webshots' proprietary format that makes it not very practical for many peoples. 

So I have extracted the collection to JPGs using Ultimate Webshots Converter. Despite its name, UWB actually only extracts the jpg from webshots' proprietary format which is basically collections of jpg files that that have their header modified, thus preserving the original quality of the pictures. I kept the picture's title as filename during extraction, so that information is not lost and also organized them under folder structure that match the original Webshot categories. I have also removed 500+ duplicates using Duplicates Cleaner and was able to save like 200+ MB of space.

To replace webshots I recommend Johnâ€™s Background Switcher as your wallpaper manager that you can download here: http://johnsadventures.com/software/backgroundswitcher/ a much more capable manager than webshots, or you can use your own favorite app.

I hope you guys be patient with me as my upload speed is low, so it may take a few days/weeks to finish seeding.
