                           DESCRiPTiON 

 One-off special following the Irish travelling community during the festive   
 season, featuring their yuletide preparations for 2010, as well as two        
 typically extravagant weddings and a First Communion ceremony. Celebrity Big  
 Brother winner Paddy Doherty and his wife Roseanne also invite the cameras    
 into their Salford home on Christmas Day, and the film introduces new families
 to the viewers, who reveal how travellers manage to hide presents from their  
 children when they live in a trailer and how many people can fit in a caravan 
 for a sit-down feast.                                                         
                                 Enjoy!
