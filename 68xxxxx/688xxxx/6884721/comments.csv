process cannot access the file because it's being used by another file

or something like that, and it's NOT always on the same file set, like, it could be on this file, or it could be on 130 to 135, or 10-15, so what DOES that mean? any ideas? i REALLY want to get all of these, can you help me?  or any one else?"
