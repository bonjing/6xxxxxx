Bearcats! 100 Powderkeg (16 Apr 1971)

In the early years of the 20th Century, in what remains of the American Wild West, two ex-army adventurers hire themselves out as troubleshooters, along with their new-fangled horseless carriage, a Stutz Bearcat. In this movie-length pilot, a Mexican bandit is to be executed in the United States, so his brother takes over a train and holds the passengers hostage until his brother is freed. The desperate railroad president calls on Hank and Johnny for help.
