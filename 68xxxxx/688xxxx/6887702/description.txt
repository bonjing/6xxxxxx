Death in Paradise - Series 01 - TVrip - Xvid

It's sun, sea and murder for DI Poole as he begins his investigation...

A cracking culture-clash crime caper to brighten up the wintry evenings. 

Set on the fictional Caribbean island of Saint-Marie, Death in Paradise follows the travails of quintessentially English DI Richard Poole (Ben Miller), who is sent to investigate the murder of the island's much-loved chief of police (Hugo Speer). 

Who shot the sheriff? 

It's up to Richard and his team of Dwayne (Red Dwarf's Danny John-Jules), 
Fidel (Gary Carr) and Lily (Lenora Crichlow) to find out. 

He might hate the sun, sea and sand, but Richard could also have found his home. Feelgood, fish-out-of-water fun, with a fabulous soundtrack...
