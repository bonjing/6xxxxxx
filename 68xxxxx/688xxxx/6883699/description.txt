Another fresh new beta build of vlc media player 1.3.0-git from today :
December 13,2011
This is the latest stable build of the day anyway.
Perfect to watch most of my BDRip upped here to TPB.
Will up Mac OSx intel also as well as the Win64 version and others for personal testing purpose only.
Use at your own risk so.
Note :
incompatible with very newest version of KMP 3.1.0.0+ Beta due to serious conflict
with their respective DTS plugin so.
However previous version of KMP is ok and does not have this specific problem so.

Enjoy and regards
