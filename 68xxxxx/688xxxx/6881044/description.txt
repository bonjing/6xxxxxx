"Holidays of Future Passed"

Its the most wonderful time of the year, 
and the Simpsons flash forward thirty years 
and find themselves in a tech-savvy, 
futuristic Springfield. Bart and Lisa have 
children of their own and decide to spend 
the holidays as one big family at Homer and 
Marges house. Lisa and Bart turn to Homer 
and Marge for parenting advice and begin to 
realize that the apple doesnt fall far 
from the tree.

18/Slower
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
