Web rip from http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/republican-debate-iowa-2011-15127106 using FlvRipper. Converted from .flv to .mkv using Xilisoft Video Converter Ultimate.

A/V is \"ok\" but realize it did come from the web. There are a few spots where the video goes black. This corresponds to locations of web advertisements and you\'re not missing anything.

If you have feedback, I\'m happy to hear it.
