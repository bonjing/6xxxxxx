Colin Murray reviews the day's Premier League action, featuring Stoke City v Tottenham Hotspur at the Britannia Stadium 
and Sunderland v Blackburn Rovers at the Stadium of Light. Spurs were looking to extend their winning run in the league 
against Stoke to four matches, but had already lost at the Potters in the League Cup this season, while Blackburn were aiming 
to end a sequence of four matches against the Black Cats without a victory.
