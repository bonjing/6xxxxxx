Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

Alex talks with former trader Max Keiser about MF Global and how the dubious congressional testimony of John Corzine about the missing $1.2 billion of client funds may ultimately land him in jail. 

Alex also talks with Gunter Spens, a former member of the East German army, and member of Texas Oathkeepers, who says that the Berlin Wall fell due to the fact the East German military refused to follow government orders. 

Alex covers the latest breaking news on the faltering economy, Syria, and Iran's renewed warning that it will shut down all traffic in the Strait of Hormuz if it is attacked.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
