This is all the tests and answers that I have been able to amass from the various sources that I have downloaded from.

It includes tests 7 and 9-58 with the answer sheets. It also includes the Kaplan answers for tests 1-56.

I have also included the book "Conquering LSAT Logic Games" and the BCG Law School Guide. 

Finally it includes the book "LSAT Logic Games Grouped by Type"

Hope this helps those trying to study for the LSAT.
