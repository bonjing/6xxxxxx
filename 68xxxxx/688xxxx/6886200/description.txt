This Christmas, Emily Merkle (call her Mrs. Miracle!) is working in the toy department 
at Finleys, the last family-owned department store in New York City. And her boss is 
none other thanJake Finley, the owners son. For Jake, holiday memories of brightly 
wrapped gifts, decorated trees and family were destroyed in a Christmas Eve tragedy 
years before. Now Christmas means just one thing to himand to his father. Profit. 
Because they need a Christmas miracle to keep the business afloat. Holly Larson needs 
a miracle, too. She wants to give her eight-year-old nephew, Gabe, the holiday he 
deserves. Hollys widowed brother is in the army and wont be home for Christmas, 
but at least she can get Gabe that toy robot from Finleys, the one gift he desperately 
wants. If she can figure out how to afford it Fortunately, its Mrs. Miracle to the 
rescue. Next to making children happy, she likes nothing better than helping othersand 
that includes doing a bit of matchmaking! This Christmas will be different. For all of them.
