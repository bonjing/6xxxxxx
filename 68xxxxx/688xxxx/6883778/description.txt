High Voltage (1976 album)

High Voltage is the first internationally-released album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC. It contains tracks from their first two Australia-only issued albums, High Voltage and T.N.T. (both from 1975). Originally released on Atlantic Records, this edition of High Voltage has proven popular, selling three million units in the US alone. However, initially the album was panned by some critics upon its release, including a review by Rolling Stone magazine's Billy Altman that called it an "all-time low" for the hard rock genre.[1] It was re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC remasters series.
