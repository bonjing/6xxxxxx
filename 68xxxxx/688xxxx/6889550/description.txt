Vegetable Oils in Food Technology focuses on the major sources of lipids and the micronutrients that they contain. The book provides accessible, concentrated information on the composition, properties, and uses of the vegetable oils commonly found in the food industry. It includes modifications of these oils that are commercially available by means of partial hydrogenation, fractionation, and seed breeding. The major food uses are linked, wherever possible, to the composition and properties of the oils.
