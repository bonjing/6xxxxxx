InSecurity.S02E10.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 90MB]

[/b][/color] Keeping the nation safe ...ish.

InSecurity is an action comedy about the men and women of the National Intelligence and Security Agency (NISA). Each week special agent Alex Cranston and her team of espionage misfits take on a mission vital to national security.
They go where others can't go.
They do what others won't do.
And they screw up in ways that can only be described as world class.
But like all great spy heroes, Alex and her NISA team get the bad guys and make Canada a safer place.
Just not always on purpose.
