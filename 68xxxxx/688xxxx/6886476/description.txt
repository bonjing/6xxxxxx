FLV files downloaded from Cookie Jar Entertainment's Jaroo.com, created
from the original CINAR production company masters.

There has never been a public release of the original unedited episodes.
So unless a DVD comes out these are the best (or at least among the best)
available copies, hopefully preserved here for posterity.


The video has been transcoded from VP6F to XviD for greater compatibility,
with some minor cropping done to remove dithering and edge artifacts.
The untouched audio (low quality to begin with) was then remuxed.

480x360 before cropping. Had an 8px bar of blur at the bottom and 6px of 
fade and artifacts running up and down the left side.


Resulting file info:

474x352 (4:3)
XviD @ 1025kbps, 23.976 FPS
MP3 @ CBR 48kbps TS, 22kHz


Originally airing over the course of a year, 52 episodes straight, I have
divided the series by story arc (previously released - heavily edited -
as movies), which roughly follow their respective book.

A1 - The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (episodes 1 to 17)
A2 - The Marvelous Land of Oz (episodes 18 to 30)
A3 - Ozma of Oz (episodes 31 to 41)
A4 - The Emerald City of Oz (episodes 42 to 52)

Naming uses Arc # (A1-A4), and then series Episode # (E01-E52), since,
conventionally, they are all S01, or a mini-series. Hopefully this isn't
overly confusing for anyone.


Note: I am no expert but I am pleased with the quality maintained here.
The video quality is virtually the same between the FLV and XviD files.
I tried the conversion from FLV to XviD a number of ways with different
programs; this was my best result, and also has proper filesizing. If
there is anyone who is knowledgeable about proper encoding/transcoding,
filtering and restoration techniques for cartoons and would like to try,
please contact me and I will provide the original FLVs.


Cheers!
