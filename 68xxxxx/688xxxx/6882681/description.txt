"Go Out and Get it Done: Winner Announced 
                             (Atlanta, Ga, USA)"

The final three teams race to the finish line in 
Atlanta, where one of them claims the $1 million 
prize.

(Rules are unclear if a show such as this would
be 'reality' or 'competitive reality'. Due to
this being a literal race involving lots of
running and high motion we went with 
'competitive'.

22/Slower
Evolve...or die.
