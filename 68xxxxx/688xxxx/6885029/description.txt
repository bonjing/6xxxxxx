The Odds' aptly titled third album is a bit uneven: some tracks are slick, shrewd pop songs, while others slip into banality. The band has a definite knack for tongue-in-cheek humor, and the weirder the better: the perfectly dark and hilarious "Last Drink" is among the group's best songs, with somber lyrics such as "you were never big on conversation and that hasn't changed since your cremation." Other standouts include the guilt-ridden "Oh Sorrow Oh Shame" (the guilt associated with cross-dressing), the breezy and sunny "Radios of Heaven" and "Truth Untold," a song reminiscent of the jangly and pleasant "Sweetness and Love" (from their second album, Bedbugs). The band segues into various moods with complete ease, but it seems like lyrics are a bit more important than music in this album -- some of the hooks and rhythms are too mundane to hold your attention. Overall, though, the hits on Good Weird Feeling are worth the misses.
