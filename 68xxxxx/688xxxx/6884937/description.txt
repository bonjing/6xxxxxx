     In February 1992, Guns N' Roses played three sold out shows at the arena Tokyo Dome  - (baseball stadium located in Bunkyo Ward of Tokyo) during their "Use Your Illusion Tour", one of which was released as a 2-part DVD. 
    "The Use Your Illusion Tour" was a concert tour by Guns N' Roses which ran from January 20, 1991 to July 17, 1993. It was not only the band's longest tour, but one of the longest concert tours in rock history, consisting of 194 shows in 27 countries.
    Nearly 18 years later, with their new line-up, on December 19, 2009, during their Chinese Democracy Tour, they played their longest show in their career, at 3 hours and 37 minutes and longest concert held at the arena.
