It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine.
Noting how predictions from a wide array of ancient civilizations appear to be coming true with eerie accuracy, the investigators attempt to determine if December 21, 2012, is indeed doomsday and what it exactly means for mankind.
 
In some ways this episode could very well be just a scare tactic for fanatics.
Just my opinion, though.
A bit of humorous irony while watching this show was their discussions about the possible loss of all electronic devices and computers yet during the commercial breaks there were numerous advertisements for vehicles with hundreds of processors making them the "smartest cars" and more commercials for mobile phones and service plans.
