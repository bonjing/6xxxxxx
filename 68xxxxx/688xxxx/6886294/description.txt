Description:
This Christmas, Emily Merkle (call her Mrs. Miracle!) is working in the toy department 
at Finleyâ€™s, the last family-owned department store in New York City. And her boss is 
none other thanâ€¦Jake Finley, the ownerâ€™s son. For Jake, holiday memories of brightly 
wrapped gifts, decorated trees and family were destroyed in a Christmas Eve tragedy 
years before. Now Christmas means just one thing to himâ€”and to his father. Profit. 
Because they need a Christmas miracle to keep the business afloat. Holly Larson needs 
a miracle, too. She wants to give her eight-year-old nephew, Gabe, the holiday he 
deserves. Hollyâ€™s widowed brother is in the army and wonâ€™t be home for Christmas, 
but at least she can get Gabe that toy robot from Finleyâ€™s, the one gift he desperately 
wants. If she can figure out how to afford itâ€¦ Fortunately, itâ€™s Mrs. Miracle to the 
rescue. Next to making children happy, she likes nothing better than helping othersâ€”and 
that includes doing a bit of matchmaking! This Christmas will be different. For all of them.
