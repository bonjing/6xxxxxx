Movie Days er a comedy set in the early sixties and based on Fridrik Thor Fridrikssons own childhood memories, a time when Icelandic society underwent a period of great turbulence and change. At the same time, American movies and television gave the period a special atmosphere, filled with enchantment and romance that distracted many people from the drabness of their everyday existence. Thomas is submerged in and fascinated by the imaginary world of the cinema, but eventually has to come with terms with his own culture and reality. Movie Days is among with Children Of Nature (1991) and Angels of the Universe (2000) a great sample of the good co working between Fridrik Thor and the writer Einar MÃ¡r Gudmundsson.
