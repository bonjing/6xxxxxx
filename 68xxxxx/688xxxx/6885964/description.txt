Plot: Some say that all houses have memories. For one man, his home is the place he would kill to forget. A family unknowingly moves into a home everywhere several grisly murders were committedâ€¦only to find themselves the killerâ€™s next target. Successful publisher Will Atenton (Craig) quit a job in New York City to relocate his wife, Libby (Weisz), and two girls to a quaint New England town. But as they settle into their new life, they learn their perfect home was the murder scene of a mother and her children. And the entire city believes it was at the hands of the husband who survived. When Will investigates the tragedy, his only lead comes from Ann Paterson (Watts), a neighbor who was close to the family that died. As Will and Ann piece together the disturbing puzzle, they learn that the report of the last man to leave Willâ€™s dream house will be just as horrifying to the one who came next.
