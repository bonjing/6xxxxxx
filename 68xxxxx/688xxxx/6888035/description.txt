â€œEveryone's favourite reluctant traveller is back in the departure lounge. But this time Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant are sending Karl Pilkington around the world with a list of the ultimate things to do before you die.

Armed with this definitive bucket list, Karl will be dispatched to far flung corners of the world to swim with dolphins, travel Route 66 and stay on a desert island, in an attempt to prove whether these so called 'things to do before you die' really are what they're cracked up to be.â€
