1. Mansion on the Hill [Single Version]
2. Mansion on the Hill [Album Version]
3. Don't Spook the Horse

This C.D./ E.P. is a must have for Dewar and all other Neil Young fans. You'll be downloading for one song , "Don't Spook the Horse" which runs seven and half minutes long. The other two tracks are "Mansion on the Hill", single version and album version. "Don't Spook the Horse" sounds like it was recorded in a barn, not in a poor quality way though, it's an inspired jam with classic lyrics. You can hear the horse clopping away on this track as Crazy Horse delivers a loose yet in the pocket rendition of this song. This track could have been on Ragged Glory but it probably didn't make the cut because of it's barnyard, to close to home feel.
