In 2006, the drug trade is booming. The Malaysian Intelligence and Anti-Narcotic Department are called upon for assistance by their Indian counterparts. The Indian team is headed by DCP D'Silva (Boman Irani), who wants to break the drug operations of a drug lord named Singhania. Helping him along the way is Malik (Om Puri). He believes that capturing Singania's most dangerous and elusive lieutenant, Don, (Shahrukh Khan), will be the most effective way of accomplishing this. Don's gang consists of Anita (Ishaa Koppikar), his girlfriend, and Narang (Pawan Malhotra). Soon, Roma (Priyanka Chopra) joins them, but she has other plans - kill Don; Don was responsible for killing her brother Ramesh, as well as his fiancee, Kamini (Kareena Kapoor in a special appearance).
