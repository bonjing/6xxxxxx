Anderson Cooper has a new daytime talk show and it is a stunning hit. To kick off one of his first shows he interviews his own reclusive and unbelievably rich mother, Gloria Vanderbilt (Cooper). 

The woman has had an incredible life with a cadre of famous lovers and ultimately falling in love and marrying a famous writer who dies an early death leaving her with two boys, Carter and Anderson. Sadly, Carter committed suicide by dropping off the balcony of their penthouse apartment. Get out your hankies because this show will break your heart - but it will also make you laugh loud and often. 

Gloria is a hoarder of fine art, antiques and all things nice, keeping her decades of treasures stashed throughout NY in rented storage spaces. She is an amazing painter and artist. Anderson takes us on a tour of her absolutely fabulous penthouse apartment and we learn all about their lives together. This show is a keeper. She is joined by her best friends Diane Von Furstenberg, Judy Collins who sings and the unflappable Kathy Griffin of whom Gloria considers her daughter. It is a wonderful show. BTW, Gloria is now 87 years old and fabulous!
