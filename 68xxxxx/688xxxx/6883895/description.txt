This is a collection of various art tutorials aimed at aspiring artists. 
Most of the content is furry based, however may be useful to anyone learning anime as well. The tutorials offer anatomy help, digital and traditional art style help, as well as multiple other things I found useful. They are NOT just limited to construction, though - there are a few explanations on "Colour Theory", as well as some photomanipulation tricks.

DISCLAIMER:
I did not make all the art in this resource folder. Granted, some of it is mine, but the majority was by other artists who originally uploaded this content to public sites - WITH THE INTENTION of helping others; aka, yes, I can reuse this as I have not removed watermarks.

Here are a few screenshots:
All the sub-folders (sometimes there are folders within folders, like in the Animals case)A little peak into the "Tutorials GENERAL" folderAnd finally, a look at some of the "Anthros & Humans" folder
