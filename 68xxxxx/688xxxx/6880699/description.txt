   ViTE, one of the oldest groups in divx scene, living on the  
   verge of encoding technologies, we were one of the first       
   pregroups to adopt SBC, as well as bring you rips using the    
      XViD codecs. Our constant development and innovation brings   
       us to require new talents. If you are interested in joining    
       a group that knows what they are doing, contact us. We'd be      
        especially interested in you if:                                 
           - you can supply pre store retail DVD movies (from factory,     
             distributor, wholesale, etc)                                  
         - you get regular DVD screeners                                 
         - you get academy DVD screeners early, and you have             
           60kb/s  upload                                                
         - you think you can provide us with something of exceptional    
           talent?                                                       
       And please, don't email us asking for missing disks, or           
       tutorials for ripping/playing our releases, because we won't      
       reply! If you want the movie so bad and can't find it, buy the    
       dvd, just the way we did.
