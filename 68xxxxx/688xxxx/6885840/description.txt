AMIGA CD32 GAMES COLLECTION

TOSEC COLLECTION REPACK BY OURANOGRAMMI


Info 

Instead of Cuesheets refering to wave audio for audio tracks this repack uses cuesheets that refer to mp3 files. Then everything compressed using 7zip. This way 40GB of CD-Images of CD32 Games are now reduced to 5.29GB

This is a repack of this collection:

Notes
* Not all cd-imaging software that supports cuesheet file format (.cue or .toc files) supports using mp3 audio to emulate audio tracks. 
* It is highly recommended to use winUAE that supports it. Using winUAE you can even directly load the .7z file! 
* If you wish to use other emulation software you can create a .bin file using IMGburn or other software that can read cuesheet files with references to mp3 audio.
