To help pass time while posing in a holiday nativity scene, Cleveland tells his family his own version of one of his favorite holiday stories, â€œDie Hardâ€. In Clevelandâ€™s version, when Waterman Cable Company is taken hostage on Christmas Eve by a group of terrorists, including Tim the Bear, Lester, Federline & Kendra, a barefoot Cleveland â€“ wearing a tank-top much like the one Bruce Willis wore in the movie â€“ must endure window-shattering shoot-outs and fist fights with his friends to save his wig-wearing wife, Donna, in a parody of the greatest holiday-themed blockbuster movie ever told.
