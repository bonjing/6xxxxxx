,TORCUTT,2012-03-05T12:21Z,"okay it works but now iget rendering issues :/ like the game is playable for instance,level 1(thats all iknow it by) when im chooseing my load out,all isee is blinding white an alil bit of my face mask,and my selection bar,ithought it was poor design at first. then igot my load out an im ready to go,apprently im on a ship controlling a turret,too bad the ship is white and ""smears"" all over the screen leaving trails of white and distorting the picture giving it an almost.. ""dimension tearing effect "" lol thats the best way ican decribe it
