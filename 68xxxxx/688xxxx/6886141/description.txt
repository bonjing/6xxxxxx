"It's a Hopeful Life"

In a nod to the holiday classic "It's a 
Wonderful Life," the Chances go to the 
movies and are surprised when they discover 
that the film they're watching is strikingly 
similar to their own family life. Meanwhile, 
Jimmy is transported into a cinematic 
dreamlike state and experiences the world as 
though he never met Hope's serial killer mom 
Lucy. But when he returns to reality, he 
soon realizes that life without Hope would 
not be nearly as sweet.

18/Slower
Evolve...or die.

Enjoy :)
