This movie is about taking chances against insane odds and in fact
with little doubt of any other outcome than sheer disaster of complete
proportions!

It is about negating reason with stubbornness that defies logic
on any account whatsoever. its about trying to see a self fulfilling
prophesy come about by egging on disaster and courting it all the way
there.

In some respect it speaks to the madness of a lack of care and abandonment
of reason by those seeking some kind of an outcome that will see could have
seen an end to humankind on the earth, if we continue to experiment in this
reckless manner.

Ms. Huppert is rather than just naive, perhaps more likely actually simply
more reckless in daring the dangers against her own sense of existence on this
earth and those that rely on her judgment too. I do hope we can bring everyone back from the abyss or the edge thereof as the case may better be. The character
of Manuel in this movie needs close examination as to just what makes him tick -
into joining with those who are seeking to destroy for their own benefit in what
is the conflicting and competing race for existence on this earth as depicted in
the movie between the forces typically shown as perennially at odds as it were.

If you have fortitude in your sensibilities, you should take in this movie
with a bottle of Napoleon brandy handy for a couple of gulps all the way through!
