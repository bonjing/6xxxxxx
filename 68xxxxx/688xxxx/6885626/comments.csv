,highlander777,2011-12-26T12:30Z,It goes progressively out of sync during the last third of the movie!
ins are basically unwatchable, i also tried that sync option in VLC player but the thing is, that works if the sync is fixed till end of the movie for certain period of time, in THIS movie sync CHANGES every few seconds, so basically, it starts with couple of seconds out of sync and at end of the movie is nearly 45 secs out of sync, big FUCK YOU uploader."
