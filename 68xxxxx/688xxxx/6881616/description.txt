Rachael Yamagata has built a reputation on well-crafted songs, a stirring voice, and an Indie attitude toward making music.  Even when working with a major label throughout much of the last decade, Yamagata has always managed to do things her way.  Yamagata has come full circle.  2011 finds Yamagata shaking off the yoke of major labels and making her way under her own imprint, Frankenfish Records.  The first album under this new flag is Chesapeake, an inspired 11-song collection born of creating and recording the album at producer John Alagiaâ€™s Chesapeake Bay home.
