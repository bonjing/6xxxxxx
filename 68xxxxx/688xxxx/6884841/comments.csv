Most torrent clients have help sections whatever one you choose to use.   2nd you need something to upload. 3rd you direct the torrent client to the location of the file on your hard drive and last you should be running  24x7. Hope this helps also try (http://suprbay.org/). Stick with it and you will learn with patience and practice.
