Long May You Run is an album released in September 1976 by The Stills-Young Band, a collaboration between Stephen Stills and Neil Young. The album peaked at #26 on the Billboard 200, was certified gold in the U.S. by the RIAA and remains the sole studio release by The Stills-Young Band.

The Stills-Young Band recorded the album and began a tour in 1976 prior to the album's release but Young dropped out of the tour when he grew bored with the project, forcing Stills to complete the concert tour solo. The band was together from July through October 1976. Outside of Stills and Young, the other members of the group came from Stills' solo band.

The album stemmed from a desire by both Young and Stills to pick up where they left off with their Buffalo Springfield-era guitar explorations. After a while, David Crosby and Graham Nash became involved with the project, and Long May You Run briefly became a CSNY album. However, Crosby and Nash eventually departed the project to focus on the material for what would become the duo's 1976 album, Whistling Down the Wire, and Young and Stills would remove Crosby and Nash's vocal harmonies and other contributions from the master tapes.[1]

The title track, the album's first single which peaked at #71 on the UK singles chart,[2] was an elegy for Neil Young's first car, a 1948 Buick Roadmaster hearse. The single "Midnight on the Bay" bubbled under the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at #105.

Delighted by the success of "Cinnamon Girl", Young released "Ocean Girl" which was more directly inspired by the experience he had cruising on David Crosby's yacht.
