,doctor_roxo,2012-04-18T17:06Z,here's a group that tracks indie bundles for people that keep missing them http://steamcommunity.com/groups/IndieBundleTracker
s a shame because i would have gladly donated to get the games, including the bonus ones. you can sign up to be notified via email of future releases at their website; http://www.humblebundle.com/"
