Setting out in search of Vilcabamba, a hidden jungle city built in one of the more remote and inaccessible regions of the Inca Empire, Hiram Bingham stumbled upon one of the greatest archaeological discoveries of the century-the magnificent ruins of Macchu Picchu which opened up the glories of the Inca civilization to the entire world.


The spectacular Incan city of Machu Picchu, high in the Andes Mountains, was long thought to be legendary. Then in 1911, the intrepid explorer Hiram Bingham stumbled upon its remains. But while the walls and chambers have been extensively studied in the years since, the purpose of this ancient site remains unclear. Go to the top of the world to unravel the mysteries of this enigmatic place. 


See incredible footage of the earliest expeditions to Machu Picchu, and meet the men and women who have dedicated their lives to unearthing its secrets. Wander through the incredible ruins and feel the eerie presence of the past and the timeless secrets that are locked somewhere within. Was it a pleasure palace, an observatory, a fortress or something else entirely? The answers await just below the clouds in LOST CITY OF THE INCAS.
