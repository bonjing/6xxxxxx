Ripped and encoded from an actual US-market Blu-ray Disc (Uncut, PG-13 version of film)

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT PICTURE SIZE: The Blu-ray is open-matte (1.33:1) with pillarboxes (black bars on the side of the 4:3 image). However, the film was composed (the action was drawn) so that it could be matted/cropped for a 16:9 widescreen presentation. When this film was released for a second time on DVD (as the \"Original, Uncut Version,\" in 2002) it was presented in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio. This encode preserves that 16:9 presentation by cropping the 1440x960 image to 1440x810, then resizing to 1280x720.

I\'m a film snob - well, as much a grown man who still watches \'cartoons\' can be  :D - and I would never simply crop a film if that wasn\'t the creators\' intent. (You can scour the web for info about the intended aspect ratio of this film).

All that said, this is my first torrent upload here and I wanted to keep it smallish & simple. If I get the hang of this, I *might* upload a non-cropped 1080p file for those interested.

I realize this film is 10+ years old but I haven\'t come across an HD version on torrents and, since the BD is horrid 4:3, I wanted to share a 16:9 version.

PLAYBACK:
I\'m an Apple fanboy and this was encoded and tagged for import into iTunes. It will also play on any iDevice - including both versions of the AppleTV - that can do HD. 

If you\'ve got another device that can do AVC/h.264 encoded video but doesn\'t like the .m4v extension, you should be able to remux the streams into a more appropriate container (MP4, MKV) without the need to re-encode.
