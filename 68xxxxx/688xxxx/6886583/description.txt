Itâ€™s resonating deep beneath city streets, lurking in the darkened shadows, and hijacking sound systems across the planet. There is no escaping the two-step bass drop madness which is DUBSTEP!

Ministry of Sound are back, and main-lining the bottom heavy sound of the underground once again, with their highly anticipated reprise SOUND OF DUBSTEP 2. Following on from their initial offering of all things dub, SOUND OF DUBSTEP 2 cages up 49 of the most straight up and assaultive drumstep, dubstep and bass music weapons across two discs of misguided musical misogyny.

Eccentric dubstep dandy High Rankin pillages the first disc. An uncontested champion of the UK scene, with releases across Herveâ€™s Cheap Thrills and Jay Cunningâ€™s Sub Slayers labels, as well as his own Suicide Dub imprint, High Rankinâ€™s disc brims with character and personality. Forcefully detaining the unsuspecting within a sonic slaughterhouse of riotous dub, sound-tracked by the likes of Nero, Skrillex, Document One, Professor Green, Mord Fustang and Borgore .

Disposing the second disc of dub is local getup Haters. Infamous for pushing their virulent strains of dubstep and filthy bass music, their disc showcases of their own electronic retardation mashed against the most ethereal, euphoric and forebodingly jagged dubstep tracks aborted from studios across the world. Rusko, Excision & Datsik, Flux Pavillion, Knife Party and BAR9, all bring their aurally offensive creations and remixes to the party, for a sweat inducing rave-up set to rewrite the rules for the local dubstep scene.

Prepare yourself. SOUND OF DUBSTEP 2.
