                                     Description

       The serial included in FOSI's release is now blacklisted.

       So what that means is this program will randomly check online
       the registration details and because the FOSI release only
       included 1 serial ALL people using it will end up having their
       program disabled. Which is where this torrent comes in..
       The only real difference between this and the FOSI release
       is this includes a new cracked / patched "IconWorkshop.exe"
       This will prevent the program from forcing a registration dialog
       on the user.

                                    Release Notes

       Serial / Key + Installer used in this release is "borrowed" from
       "Axialis.IconWorkshop.v6.62.Professional.Edition.retail-FOSI"

       The only thing patched in this, is the program dialog / window
       Warning: The actual online check is still intact in the program.
       There is a variety of different legit reasons why this program
       could go online, just don't click on check for updates to be safe.

       Comments

       If anyone has found where the trial info is stored please do tell
       Its possible there could be a false positive on some security software
       because the program was packed with UPX. Doing this cut 5mb in size.
       Instead of sharing a file that is 12.1mb it is now 7.09mb
