The first great horn soloist in jazz history to appear on records, soprano saxophonist and clarinetist Sidney Bechet was one of the giants of New Orleans jazz. He was such a dominant force on soprano, that he preferred to play lead rather than the trumpeter and few other musicians played soprano during his lifetime.
Born in 1897, Bechet was playing with top New Orleans bands while still a child. In 1917 he moved up North to Chicago, touring Europe with Will Marion Cook's orchestra in 1919. He first appeared on records in 1923, spent 1925-29 overseas, and struggled during the Depression. At one point he had a tailor shop that was most notable for its backroom jam sessions. In 1938, Bechet had a hit recording of â€œSummertimeâ€ and it resulted in him recording a dazzling series of records during the next few years. His performance at the Salle Pleye Jazz Festival in Paris in 1949 caused a sensation. Bechet moved to France where he was a major celebrity during the years before his 1959 death.
Blues in Thirds has 24 selections that Bechet recorded during 1940-41. With such musicians as Louis Armstrong, cornetists Muggsy Spanier (for a date in which the two horns were accompanied by guitar and bass) and Rex Stewart, trumpeters Sidney DeParis, Red Allen and Charlie Shavers, trombonists J.C. Higginbotham and Vic Dickenson, pianists Earl Hines and Willie â€œThe Lionâ€ Smith, and drummer Baby Dodds being in the supporting cast, Bechet is heard throughout at the height of his powers.
