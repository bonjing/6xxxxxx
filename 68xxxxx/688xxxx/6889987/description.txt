AMG Biography

Compared to fellow Halifax [Nova Scotia, Canada] bands Sloan and the Super Friendz, Thrush Hermit is the only one that could be called a hard rock band. Their heavy guitar sound, wailing and pouty vocals, and obvious love for '70s album rock and punk sets them apart from the others - who are known for their melodies and wistful musings, not their aggression and raw energy.

Thrush Hermit was formed in 1992 by Joel Plaskett (vocals/guitar), Rob Benvie (guitar/keyboards/vocals), Ian McGettigan (bass/vocals), and Cliff Gibb (drums). After releasing several cassettes (Nobody Famous, John Boomer) and a single (Ammo), the band signed to Murderecords (Sloan, Super Friendz, Eric's Trip) and the Smart Bomb EP was released in 1994. Their second EP, The Great Pacific Ocean, followed in 1995, and the group appeared on the Mallrats soundtrack as well. Their first full-length, Sweet Homewrecker, was issued by Elektra in 1997, but the label dropped the band soon after the single "North Dakota" was released.

By 1999, Gibb had left and been replaced by Benn Ross. Thrush Hermit had signed to the Hamilton, Ontario, label Sonic Unyon, and Clayton Park was issued in February of that year. on September 21, 1999, the band announced its amicable split, but toured with the Flashing Lights and the Local Rabbits in the fall before they broke up permanently. -- Gina Boldman/Allmusic.com
