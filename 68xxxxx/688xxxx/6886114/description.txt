Mitch Albom (Bradley Whitford) has a pretty great life. He lives in Detroit and is happily married, heâ€™s an award-winning sportswriter, a must-read newspaper columnist, a screenwriter, a radio and television broadcaster. Then two men come into his life, and he realizes somethingâ€™s missing. Rabbi Albert Lewis (Martin Landau) presides over a thriving synagogue in a comfortable New Jersey suburb, and pastor Henry Covington (Laurence Fishburne), a recovering drug user and dealer, preaches to the poor and homeless in a crumbling Detroit inner-city church. Moving between their worlds â€“ Christian and Jewish, African-American and white, impoverished and privileged â€“ Albom witnesses first-hand how these two very different men not only live life, but celebrate it. What else do these two have in common? They believe thereâ€™s divine spark in all of us â€“ and that a single person can make a big difference in othersâ€™ lives, as long as they have a little faith.
