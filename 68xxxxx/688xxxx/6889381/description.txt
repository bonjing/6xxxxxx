    This documentary, produced for the DVD release of Evil Dead II,          
    provides film fans with an in-depth, behind-the-scenes look at the       
    making of the horror comedy about a man who must lead a medieval army    
    to victory against a horde of undead in order to return to his own       
    time. Includes interviews with star Bruce Cambell, director Sam Raimi    
    and other members of the cast and crew, who discuss what it was like     
    to be a part of the making of this cult classic.
