"I'm Liz Parker and five days ago I died. After that, things got really weird." So begins a new life for Liz and her friend Maria after they discover that three of their classmates at Roswell High aren't exactly from "around here". To be more exact, Max, Isabel and Michael are from "up there". Having grown up quietly within the community, their alien identities are suddenly jeopardized after Max uses his powers to save Liz's life. Now the alien trio must learn to trust their human friends even as they struggle to discover their own true identities.

Note: this is standard DVDRip's. Source of them - Restored HQDVDRip release.
These DVDRip's were made in almost one-click tool called Xvid4PSP. By myself I'm NOT guru in encoding, so do NOT judge me.
Everyone were given a right to do these DVDRip's almost half a year ago, but no one hadn't. And still, everyone have a right to make a PROPER encode for hardware players.

These files contains only one English audiotrack: Original TV Music version of Roswell.
This is exclusive release: Roswell's DVDRip with Original TV Music version - music that was cutted by creators 'cause of frigging licenses and fees when official DVD was release.
Source of TV version audiotrack - my own captures from Sky Italia/Cyfrowy Polsat/NTV+ Roswell repeats on Italian "AXN Sci-Fi"/Polish "FOX Polska"/Russian "Syfy Universal" channels accordingly in 2011 year.

DVDRip's are originally calculated to fit 2xDVDR per season. Standard DVDRip with 160k MP3 audio. Checked playback on my 6 years old's buddy Pioneer DVR-540H, plays perfectly.

Regards: I just wanna say much thanks to primordial on Demonoid, who was uploaded his rare VHS tape rips and inspired me to do all that stuff. Without him I'm probably didn't see a lot portion of Roswell with this just an amazing, truly magic soundtrack, that I've started share with the others with my Russian HQDVDRip release. That's was some long time ago, before one wonderful thought has jump into my mind and I've started hunting European satellite channells for Roswell repeats hoping that some of them could be possibly contain TV Music version on secondary audiostream, which is English. Some more long time passed before I'd found that channel - Italian "AXN Sci-Fi". I've turned my satellite dish out to the Europe and bought Sky Italia cardsharing package here in Russia just in the last moment before second Roswell repeats are airs on that channel. Unfortunately, this channel has far from good broadcasting manners like cutting few scenes from three episodes, each at the season. Also it has mono audio on first six episodes of Second Season. But fortunate I've got another two channels with Original Broadcasted TV Music version of Roswell: Polish "FOX" and Russian "Syfy Universal" as my backup. FOX's audio were used for first six episodes of S02 and Syfy to fill up the blanks in those episodes where scenes has cutted on AXN Sci-Fi. So now I have this full and complete exclusive stereo audio for all 61 Roswell episodes and made this exclusive DVD's - just for you all, fellow Roswellians! Enjoy. ;-)
