Tabu Ley sang in six different formations between 1961-77!â€”while keeping the focus on this remarkable and visionary vocalist. Tabu Ley was decidedly a modernizer, the first Congolese singer to use a trap drum kit, to develop a choreographed stage show, and to perform at Parisâ€™s prestigious Oympia Theatre (1970). These 29 tracks are selected from hundreds Tabu Ley recorded during his first 16 years. As Braun points out, Tabu Leyâ€™s penchant for modernity sometimes led him in unfortunate directions, particularly after this period. The work this singer is best known for internationally is a mixed bag. This well chosen selection is a pot of gold by comparison, and really clarifies exactly why he remains such a towering figure in Congo music.
