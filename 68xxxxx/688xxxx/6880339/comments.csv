For personal use, I download large size videos and redue the size to 4.2Gb max, just by changing the bitrate using XMedia Recode and I get 1080P video with DTS @1.5Mbps mindblowing sound.
More than 4Gb size for 720P video with DTS @755Kbps audio seems too much.
Anyways...... thanks for the up."
 use I sometimes download big file sized videos with DTS audio and just change video bitrate. I end up reducing the size to 4 to 4.20Gb, 1080P DTS 1.5Mbps for an approx 2hr video.
Just a suggestion. Thanx very much for the up."
