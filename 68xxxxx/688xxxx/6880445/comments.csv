,babybluetits24,2011-12-12T02:21Z,One of the worst movie I saw in my entire life. In the Middle East they make better movies with a lower budget. There is no story Acting is very bad actually it's hopeless case . Even children between 5 and eight can act better in a movie. I was shocked to see a movie this bad in 2011 . The production is bad the music is terrible the special effects is very very bad . I have no idea how they came up with this idea to make a movie this bad. If they give awards for bad movies I think this movie should get the first prize. Even Michael Madsen who was a good actor in the past of course in my opinion he should be ashamed of himself to act in movies this bad. I saw a few movies lately by Madsen he really sucks . So in my opinion stay away from watching this movie because you are going to waste an hour or so from your precious life
