Huddersfield singer-songwriter Belinda O'Hooley has been performing music all her life, but only recently began writing songs after buying her first piano. Her startlingly original, deeply moving stories combine haunting lyrics with rich piano soundscapes. An accomplished musician in both folk and jazz, Belinda draws from these and other influences to create music described as 'heart wrenchingly beautiful'. Her album is a bold departure for Belinda from her previous claim to fame...winning Stars In Their Eyes as Eurythmics diva Annie Lennox! As part of her nationwide tour, Belinda and her band will be performing songs from her critically acclaimed debut album 'Music Is My Silence', voted Album Of The Month in the Irish Press.
