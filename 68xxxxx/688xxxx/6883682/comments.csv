 uk potheads

but another docu and research by aussies has shown

pot affects memory and causes hots in the brain

but the worse killers are alcohol and cigs

except alcohol was ok in small amounts.. it was the fact red win and other chemicals in drinks
counteracted the badness of it.. 

i always like the research showing 1 glass of red wine but no more then that a day can reduce heart attacks and strokes by as much as 50 percent"
