Intimacy reigns supreme on Sharon Van Ettenâ€™s debut, which finds the folksinger crooning her melodies over beds of acoustic guitar, keyboard, and overdubbed harmonies. Her lyrics are the stuff of heartbreak and uncertainty -- â€œI wish I knew what to do with youâ€ she laments during the first track, and later refers to herself as a loverâ€™s â€œconsolation prizeâ€ -- but her performances are confident, both simple in their delivery and subtle in their emotional punch. Because I Was in Love isnâ€™t a bare-boned folk album; rather, itâ€™s the sort of record that unfolds its layers with repeated listens, and the arrangements are often gorgeously lush without threatening to overpower Van Ettenâ€™s alto.
