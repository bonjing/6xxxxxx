Your not contributing to this other than clogging the site with duplicates. Would have been far better by you commenting on the original upload allowing people to gain confidence that the initial upload is genuine and ok.

All you do is to pretend to be a brilliant guy with inside connections - when in fact your a fake living off others work. - Get a life by doing something by your own for a change.

Anyone could have selected the individual episodes from the original rip (in case they didn't want the whole thing)

Really poor attitude and does not do anything but ticking the original uploader where he might conclude - fuck this - where no one (including you) wont see the last 4 eposides

shame on you "
