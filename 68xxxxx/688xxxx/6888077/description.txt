Wednesday's Opie and Anthony Show from SiriusXM.

Jimmy's back and Penthouse Pet of the Year, Jenna Rose in studio today.

To all you Pests out there.  I'll be trying to keep posting for awhile, depending on my work schedule, but the Shit Hour is definitely a goner, unless there's really something worth listening to on it.  Have some new editing software I'm trying that should vastly improve the audio quality without making file size enormous.  Let me know what you think.

Oh and thanks for the understanding and encouraging comments.
