This album is a must have for anyone who loves good music. It has an ethereal fusion of South Asian ragas with western guitar and drums and various other instruments from around the world like, Brazilian Surdu, Senagalese Djembe alongside Indian tabla and harmonium as well as bass, keyboards and Michael Brook's 'infinite guitar'.

The first two songs have vocals while the others are beautiful ragas by Nusrat. 

It was released in 1990 and was considered among the best 100 albums of the 90's.
