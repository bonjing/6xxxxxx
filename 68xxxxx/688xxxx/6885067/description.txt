Harvester came from America's great Northwest, but that is about all they have in common with other better-known bands from that area. "Me Climb Mountain" sounds more like a cross between roots-rockers Blue Mountain and Canada's Waltons. Standout tracks include "Great Springwaters Of America", "My Buffalo Song" and "It's Been A Long Day". Also, don't miss the bonus track hidden at the end of the CD.
