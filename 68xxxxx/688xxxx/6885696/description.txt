In the slum of CapÃ£o Redondo in SÃ£o Paulo, the twenty-third anniversary of Marco
AurÃ©lio a.k.a. Macu will be celebrated with a "feijoada" (a typical Brazilian dish
of black beans and pork) and beers promoted by his mother Dona SÃ´nia and their
closest friends. Among the guests are Macu's childhood best friends Jaiminho, who
plays soccer in Spain and is waiting to be summoned by the coach to the national
team, and Pibe, who has a baby and is living with Macu's former girlfriend Claudia.
Macu owes money to the dangerous criminal SerjÃ£o and NapÃ£o and will host a boy that
will be kidnapped by the delinquents in order to pay for his debts.
