Synopsis
Kouga Saejima travels to a new city after receiving orders from the Eastern Watch Dog to hunt down the Horror Karma, an ancient female horror who is one of the infamous Apostle Horrors. By that time, Karma's followers, Kurusu and Shion set up a gothic club named Crime to satisfy their mistress's appetite by bringing her various girls and lure them into her realm with false promises of making their dreams a reality. As Kouga arrives to the city where Karma has based herself in, a pair of Makai Priests named Akaza and Shiguto just rescued a baby from a Horror posing as a mother before the fiend is dispatched by a Makai Priestess named Rekka. Kouga arrives, revealing the "baby" to be a cannibalistic Horror that Zaruba identifies as an Apostle Horror named Bebyl. Though Rekka meddles in the fight, Kouga managed to kept her aside, dons his armor and slays Bebyl. As he leaves, Kouga is approached by the priests as they introduce themselves to him and Zaruba, who reveals his mission to find and destroy Karma. Rekka has a personal vendetta against Karma for killing her father Kengi, an old mentor of Kouga's, refusing to allow anyone to rob her of her revenge...
