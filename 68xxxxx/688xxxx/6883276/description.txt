The More than Complete DC-Now More Completerer!

This fiftiy-first alphabetical installment is:  DC from Wona-Wonz i.e -  Wonder Girl. Wonder Woman

What's This?
     It's a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh! Â®Â©)â„¢, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and M.C. Gaines among others.
       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those "Pre-DC" comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC super-heroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heroes are Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and among many others. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will be some "Post DC" comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c. 925gb in total. It will take as long as it takes, but it's nearly done. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.

=================================

Projected remaining torrents start and stop letters and approximate size

 14GB          	52 Woo-Wz              down 2 gb since last time
 12GB	          53 X-Z                       down 4 gb since last time
 20GB	          54 Fill Torent a-c    up 1 gb since last time    
 18GB	          55 Fill Torent d-j     up 1 gb since last time 
 20GB          	56 Fill Torent k-z     up 3 gb since last time 

Net change is down one gigabyte since the last report.
I know you probably don't care but I love numbers. Numbers are never mean to me.
=================================

Hey everybody nice I'm probably post the Z' this week, the final fills are coming soon. I'd really like to know if you know of ANYTHING I forgot, skipped, screwed up, or omitted with malicious intent. 

	Yeah you heard right. Malicious intent -  deliberate, calculated to make you cry, vengeful malice. Because yes, I WOULD do that to you. I'm just that  kinda guy. It's not that I'm uncaring, It's that I care about hurting you. You, and the whole world. I was the kid who got picked last for the team. I was the kid who got beat up for being different. I'm the guy who as an adult watched everyone at work learn all about tolerance and celebrating diversity. Which they did. They learned and changed how hey thought and acted. (ok how they acted when someone was watching).  
	I learned the meaning of hope, except...I found out my diversity wasn't of the right kind, not listed in the handbook of acceptable diversity. I'm so frick'n diverse I'm the only one of my kind they ever saw, and thus need to be pressed into the mold -  to learn to be like "regular people". Or if I refuse - completely deserve to be a marginalized outcast, laughed at, despised. Bitter? Bitter is for amateurs. Bitter is for people who have hope that someday they might have hope. I'm so far past bitter my tongue only tastes sweet salt and sour. Will I go postal someday? What is this, the 90s? I'll go twitter on them all. 140 "characters" distributed nicely around the office from my "iPhone" A nice all metal "iPhone" in case you're not catching on. This is what my "followers" deserve. Bunch of stupid sheep anyway.

Ha Ha. Just kidding. I don't even own an "iPhone". I could get a couple if I wanted to though.

So do you think just maybe you know something I should have included, that any idiot with a gnat's brain would have included? Perhaps something you wish upon a star I'd included, something you hope exists because if it does you'd like to see it? Is there stuff you know is scanned but apparently I don't, anything tenuously connected to anything ever even glanced at by someone who worked for DC for five minutes? 

I beg of you on bended elbows (cause I'm lying in bed) make your request known unto me!  Don't just wish, don't hope, don't even pray. God's a nice guy, but he's not your messenger boy. Besides if I start hearing God's voice telling me what comics to include, my psychiatrist is not going to be easy to convince that I really am getting torrent advice from the most high Lord and Creator of all that is, that was, that ever will be, multiverse without end. She will want me to take some new drugs. And have more frequent sessions. That could be expensive.  She might even want me to take a little vacation at a very special "resort". Probably nothing involuntary you understand, as long as I keep quite about the "text messages" I'm thinking of sending to everyone at work from my "iPhone". She might not think that was as funny as I do.

So tell me yourself, you timid, lazy fool!

Do you have stuff that you could, if you thought about it,  scan - even if you can't edit, don't feel like editing, are too lazy to edit, just won't edit, or have religious objections to editing? Even if you don't have a scanner,  you could probably scan at a nearby college computer lab, library or friends. Scanners are fairly cheap too. Seriously if you know someone who scans buy them lunch at McDonalds and they'll scan it for you. Those people are cheap.

SPEAK SOON, or forever hold your peace. When I up the last fill, which will be part 56 or  maybe 57. Your chance will have expired.  If there's any comic that I can share, let me do it now, for I may never torrent this way again. Sniff.
