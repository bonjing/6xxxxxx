 know babyblue and although I think it is a valid point, I disapprove of his/her message because of the tone and wording.

The Pirate Bay even has its own feature for an IMDb link when you are sharing a movie. I don't think it's so difficult to share that link. I'm sorry but sharepixon is not a widely accepted movie or information database and I don't know on what grounds you are defending it.

And the message is not directly for UltraTorrents, it is addressed to whomever reads it. If the uploader does not want to bother with sharing the IMDb link, babyblue requests that other users share this link. I don't know why you are getting all hostile about this, because I think it's a valid point.

Besides, you are not the only person sharing here. We have been uploading for years now and we do not find it very difficult to just paste the IMDb link. So please do not threaten about quitting. We would be sorry if you quit, but we would survive."
