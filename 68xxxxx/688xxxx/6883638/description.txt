Create powerful Windows applications from Flash! 
 swf kit shows you a brand-new software developing solution 


 SWFKit is the leading SWF to EXE tool. SWFKit can build professional Windows desktop applications, screen savers from SWF
 movies created by Flash Authoring tools such as Macromedia Flash, Flex, Swish Max, etc. It can also create installers. SWFKit is fully compatible with Flash 3, 4, 5, MX, MX 2004, 8 and 9. It's the most powerful rapid Windows application developing tool for Flash. The current version of SWFKit series does not support Mac OS yet, however, we are developing a plug-in for SWFKit Express to produce Mac OS executable files. And in the future we will make the plug-in support the features of SWFKit and SWFKit Pro.

 The SWFKit series contains three editions: SWFKit Pro, SWFKit and SWFKit Express.
