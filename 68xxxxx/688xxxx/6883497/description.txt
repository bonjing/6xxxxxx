Several epidemiological studies have revealed that people who consume nuts regularly are less likely to suffer from coronary heart disease. Clinical trials have found that consumption of various nuts such as almonds and walnuts can lower serum LDL cholesterol concentrations. Although nuts contain various substances thought to possess cardioprotective effects, scientists believe that their Omega 3 fatty acid profile is at least in part responsible for the hypolipidemic response observed in clinical trials. This book presents current research in the study of nut properties, consumption and nutrition.
