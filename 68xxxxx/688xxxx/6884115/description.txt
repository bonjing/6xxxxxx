The darker side of The American Dream is explored in the fascinating film noir Pitfall. Dick Powell stars as John Forbes, a successful insurance man with a trophy wife named Sue (Jane Wyatt) and a model child named Tommy (Jimmy Hunt). Despite all that he's achieved in life, Forbes feels somehow unfulfilled. Thus it is that when his glamorous client Mona Stevens (Lizabeth Scott) "comes on" to him, Forbes falls for her like a ton of bricks. After a brief affair, Forbes suffers the pangs of guilt, a fact immediately capitalized upon by Mona's ex-lover, seedy private eye Macdonald (Raymond Burr). If adultery has always been committed, can murder be far behind? Many individual scenes in Pitfall are standouts, notably a brief moment wherein Forbes' son Tommy suffers a horrible nightmare-in almost exactly the same manner that child actor Jimmy Hunt would endure a similar bad dream in 1953's Invaders from Mars! Like many of the best noir efforts of the 1940s, Pitfall (based on a novel by Jay Dratler) is told in flashback, as John Forbes spills his guts to his disillusioned spouse. -- Hal Erickson
