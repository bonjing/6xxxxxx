One of the UKâ€™s most exciting new prospects - Benjamin Francis Leftwichis set to release his stunning debut album 'Last Smoke Before TheSnowstorm' on July 4th.

At just 21 years of age, Benâ€™s songwriting has a complex quizzicalinnocence while the songs themselves inspired by a childhood listening
to Rolling Stones, Nina Simone and Bob Dylan, echo the enchantingwordplay of Feist and the delicate elegance of Elliott Smith.
Work on Benâ€™s debut album â€˜Last Smoke Before The Snowstormâ€™ startedwhen he was just a teenager and taught himself to play the guitar. Likethe previous EPs the album is produced by Ian Grimble (Mumford & Sons,Manic Street Preachers). Itâ€™s an understated ten track masterpiece that
showcases the fragile elegance of Benâ€™s voice, combined with simple,inviting guitar lines, delicate melodies and poetic lyrics withgraceful charm.
The album follows on from the success of 2010â€˜s â€˜A Million Miles Outâ€™EP and this yearâ€™s â€˜Picturesâ€™ EP, which have placed him as one of themost exciting upcoming talents in the UK. The success of the â€˜A Million Miles Outâ€™ EP led Jo Whiley to invite Ben to play at her â€˜Little NoiseSessionâ€™ gig at the Union Chapel as well as making the lead trackâ€˜Atlas Handsâ€™ one of her tracks of 2010. Ben was also invited to perform on Dermot Oâ€™Learyâ€™s Live Sessions and his cover of Arcade Fireâ€™s â€˜Rebellionâ€™ from the session has now been downloaded over 30,000 times. His online success also includes over 400,000 video views to date on YouTube. â€˜Picturesâ€™, the lead track from the 2nd EP, led to
backing from Radio 1 and XFM with the title track awarded Zane Loweâ€™s Hottest Record In The World and Greg Jamesâ€™s ROTW.
Ben recently completed his first UK headline tour in early 2011 with 10 sold out dates including shows Manchester, Bristol, Brighton and London and has supported Noah & The Whale on their April UK tour. This success has also led to a series of confirmed forthcoming festival appearances including Camden Crawl, Dot-To-Dot, Bestival, Boardmasters, Green Man
and Glastonbury along with a new headline UK tour in June.
