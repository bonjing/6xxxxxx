1. Run the update and make sure you point it to your game

installation folder.

2. Copy the cracked contents inside the FiGHTCLUB folder

to your game installation folder, overwrite if prompted.

3. Same as before: if the game tries to connect to internet block

it in firewall and use an local profile for Games For Windows

Live.



Ps. Official update installer has issues - even for legit users -

so we decided to replace it with custom installer.
