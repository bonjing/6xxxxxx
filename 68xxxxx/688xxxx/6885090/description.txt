It's crunchy jangle time for this particular soundtrack -- the film itself is a teen angst piece that underwent some heavy editing (a subplot involving Angus' gay father was removed completely.) The album includes entries from Green Day, Ash, Weezer, Smoking Popes and the Muffs amongst its twelve tracks. As a cross-section of the current state of pop, it's not too bad; highlights include the Muffs cut that's much better as a single entry amidst a bunch of other bands, the charmingly bent-sounding "Funny Face." The downside -- it's aimed at college radio with all the subtlety of Captain Cat's cannon.
