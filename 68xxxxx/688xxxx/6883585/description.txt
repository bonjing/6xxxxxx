                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Jimmy Doherty goes behind the large operation to put food on every family's   
 table at Christmas, as workers in UK pudding factories, sprout fields and     
 turkey farms go into overdrive to meet supermarkets' demand. He compares this 
 mass production to the days when everything was home-grown, making his own    
 fizzy booze and Stilton, growing purple carrots and heritage potatoes and     
 rearing rare-breed birds. Finally, he tests which offers the best quality by  
 asking best friend Jamie Oliver to cook two identical Christmas menus, one    
 using mass-produced ingredients, the other home-grown.
                        
                                 Enjoy!
