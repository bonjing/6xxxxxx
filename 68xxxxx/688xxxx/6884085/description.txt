Flick of the Switch

Flick of the Switch is the ninth Australian and eighth international studio album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, recorded shortly after their European Tour at the beginning of 1983. The album was originally released in the US on 15 August 1983. The album was self-produced by AC/DC and reached #4 in UK and #15 in the US, and has been certified platinum by the RIAA.[2]

On the recorded commentary on the album for the Live at Donington DVD, the band states the album was an attempt to make the band raw again, and while they were happy with the result, the album became known as one of their biggest flops, however Malcolm and Angus still consider the album an achievement and still stand by it.[3]

After having problems with rhythm guitarist Malcolm Young, drummer Phil Rudd was fired midway through the album's recording sessions, although he had completed his drum parts. Former Procol Harum drummer B.J. Wilson was hired to help complete the recording if needed, but his contributions were not used. The drum position was eventually filled by future Dio drummer Simon Wright. Wright appeared in the videos for "Flick of the Switch", "Nervous Shakedown",[4] and "Guns For Hire". He also toured for the album, and is seen in the pro-shot video recordings from that period. Rudd returned to the band in 1994.

The album was re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC remasters series.
