(1997) Random - A Tribute to Gary Numan [2CD] - MP3 320k CBR

This is a very good compliation of quality 1990\'s bands.  I really like the Gravity Kills and Republica songs.  Good stuff ;)

This is my own personal rip.  I also have this available in FLAC format.  If interested emailed me and I\'ll consider uploading it.
