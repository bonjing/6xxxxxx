THE STORY OF FILM: AN ODYSSEY. CHAPTER 15.

In the final episode, movies come full circle. They get more serious after 9/11, and Romanian movies come to the fore. Meanwhile, David Lynch's Mulholland Drive becomes one of the most complex dream films ever made and Inception turns film into a game.

In Moscow, master director Alexander Sokurov talks exclusively about his innovative films, and the programme goes beyond the present, to look at film in the future.
