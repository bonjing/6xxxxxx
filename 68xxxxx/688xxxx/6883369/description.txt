Patagonian Silver 2011 DVDRiP XviD-SKiTFiSKE

PLOT:
Rio Gallegos in Patagonia offers some of the world's best sea trout fishing. 
Using Las Buitreras Fishing Lodge as our base, we set off for an exciting 
adventure along the river. We struggle to get our flies out in the wind, which 
sometimes reaches speeds of 100 km an hour. And when the trout takes, it feels as 
if time is standing still, and even the wind ceases to exist.
