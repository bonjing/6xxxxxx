few words about Madhwacharya...


Madhwacharya (1238â€“1317) was the chief proponent of TattvavÄda "Philosophy of Reality", popularly known as the Dvaita (dualism) school of Hindu philosophy. 

It is one of the three most influential VedÄnta philosophies. 

MadhvÄcÄrya was one of the important philosophers during the Bhakti movement. 

He was a pioneer in many ways, going against standard conventions and norms. 

According to tradition, MadhvÄcÄrya is believed to be the third incarnation of VÄyu.

The main icon (vigraha) in Udupi of Lord Krishna was established by Madhvacharya. 

The 8 monasteries (ashta mathas) of Udupi have been following his philosophy since then. 

The Eight monasteries (Ashta Mathas) are Krishnapura, Pejavara, Puttige, Sodhe (Sondhe), Kaniyooru, Adamaru, Shirur and Palimaru. 

He submitted some vigrahas to those mathas. They are as follows:

1.)Palimaru matha -Sri Rama
2.)Adamaru matha -Sri Krishna
3.)Krishnapura matha -Sri Krishna
4.)Puttige matha -Sri Vitthala
5.)Shirur matha -Sri Vitthala
6.)Sodhe matha -Sri Varaha
