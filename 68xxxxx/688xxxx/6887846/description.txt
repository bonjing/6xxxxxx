Criticism of the Bible - Collection 17 (The Septuagint):

The Septuagint (called LXX) is the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, and it is a collection of translations that constitutes the largest corpus of Jewish writings from the Greco-Roman period. The Hebrew Pentateuch was first translated into Greek in the third century BCE to meet the needs of the Greek speaking Jewish community in Alexandria. That was followed by the translation of other parts of the Hebrew Scriptures in the second and first centuries BCE.

The texts of the books of the Greek Bible constitute mosaics of translations and/or revisions of translations of diverse origins. Even the text of a given biblical book in a particular codex may represent a collation.

Some variations in the early Greek translations reflect the fact that the text of the Hebrew and Aramaic Bible itself was not fixed in the pre-Christian era and in the first century CE.

The critical study of the texts of the Greek Jewish Scriptures in general and of the Septuagint in particular is very important for Christianity because the Greek rather than the Hebrew and Aramaic Bible were the Scriptures of the church that created the New Testament.
