"Die Semi-Hard"

To help pass time while posing in a holiday 
nativity scene, Cleveland tells his family his own 
version of one of his favorite holiday stories, 
Die Hard. In Clevelands version, when Waterman 
Cable Company is taken hostage on Christmas Eve by 
a group of terrorists, including Tim the Bear, 
Lester, Federline & Kendra, a barefoot Cleveland 
wearing a tank-top much like the one Bruce Willis 
wore in the movie  must endure window-shattering 
shoot-outs and fist fights with his friends to 
save his wig-wearing wife, Donna, in a parody of 
the greatest holiday-themed blockbuster movie ever 
told.

Evolve...or die.

Enjoy :)
