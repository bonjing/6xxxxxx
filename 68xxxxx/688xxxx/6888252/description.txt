"The Ron Paul Trap?"

Assuming the rigged polling machines, the smear campaigns and the assassination threats donâ€™t win out, Ron Paul stands a good chance of winning the Republican presidential nomination and even the presidency itself. However, Paul supporters have become accustomed to being sidelined, ignored and written out of the picture for so long, they might not be prepared to win. What if Paul is being set up for a fall? Find out more on tonightâ€™s broadcast as we parse the news and take your calls.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
