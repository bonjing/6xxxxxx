[/b][/color] CSI: Crime Scene Investigation took television by storm in 2000 with its innovative and cutting-edge updating of a standard series concept  in this case, the cop show.
Suddenly, instead of simply whodunit, solving crimes was a matter of howdunit, and with what size shoe, and whether anyone left behind traces of evidence that the blue ALS light could pick up.
 Now that gritty approach to crime known as forensic science makes its way from Las Vegas to the streets of Florida in CSI: Miami.
A whole new team of crime scene investigators is on hand to probe the seamy underside of what some refer to as Cuba North and others call Georgia South.
Consider it a tropical blend of people, culture, nightlife and, of course, the occasional killing or two.
Just as you do in Vegas, come for the crime, stick around for the clues.
And there's always a clue.
