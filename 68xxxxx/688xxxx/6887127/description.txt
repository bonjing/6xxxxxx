 Rating: [You decide!] Disks: 01: DESCRiPTiON: SecurityCam is a powerful video surveillance software that monitors
 web camera, connected to computer, and enables users to keep an eye
 on their properties from a local location or remote location via
 the Internet. The program stays out of way in system tray area, and
 waits for a movement at the front of the camera. Once movement is
 detected, SecurityCam starts either video recording or makes a
 snapshot of a picture. The program can optionally do some other
 functions like playback a warning sound
