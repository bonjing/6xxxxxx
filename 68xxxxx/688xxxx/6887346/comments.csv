lease don't on the quality for SCR versions. After watching 720p's and 480p's, even DVDRip looks like bad quality to us all. Its a SCR version so download only if you really wanna watch d movie now :-). But compared to all the SCR versions, I'd say this version is pretty decent and its the best quality of this movie available as of 14/Dec."
