Storyline :
One summer afternoon, out of boredom and peer pressure, three best friends (Dan, Mark, and Hugh) go to visit Dan's sister for dinner. Soon after meeting Dan's brother in law Rick, the trio finds themselves miles from home and far outside their comfort zone. What started off as an innocent trip spirals into an outrageous series of events none of them were prepared for.
