Who Made Who

Who Made Who is a hard rock album by Australian band AC/DC, released in 1986 as the soundtrack to the Stephen King movie Maximum Overdrive. King would allude to the album's title song in the 1990 revised and expanded edition of his novel The Stand, where a survivor of the novel's flu pandemic changes the lyrics to "Flu made who." Three tracks on the album â€” "Who Made Who" and the instrumentals "D.T." and "Chase the Ace" â€” were newly written and recorded by AC/DC. The rest were taken from the band's previous albums. Only one song, "Ride On", is from the Bon Scott era; all of the others feature Brian Johnson. Who Made Who reached #11 in the UK and #33 in the US, and has sold five million copies in the US. It was re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC remasters series.

Along with the album, the band released a video tape which contained music videos for the songs "Who Made Who", "You Shook Me All Night Long", "Shake Your Foundations", "Hells Bells", and footage from a live performance of "For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)" which was filmed in Detroit in 1983
