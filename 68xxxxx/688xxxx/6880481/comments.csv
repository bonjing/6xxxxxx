I have tried it with each of these 3 operating system on 3 different physical computers.

All 9 tests were unsuccessful.

All resulted in: ""PrÃ¸veperioden er udlÃ¸bet. KÃ¸b adgang."" (= Trial period has expired. Buy access).

I have not tried it with 7USB, because an eventual success would be totally irrelevant. Who would be willing to reboot into 7USB each time they need to look up a word in a dictionary? With a probability bordering on certainty: NOBODY!"
