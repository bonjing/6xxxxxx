Just a sizable collection of Christmas episodes from various adult cartoons, along with a few childhood classics thrown in. I take no credit for any of the actual videos, though I did do some tidying up with filenames and the like.

Various formats, resolutions, and lengths, although they've all checked out on VLC. Quality is generally pretty good, although it can vary, depending on the source.
