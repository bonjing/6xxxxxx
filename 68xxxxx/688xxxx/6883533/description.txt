Monday's Opie and Anthony Show from SiriusXM.
Typical Monday show.  No guests, lot's of talk.

Sorry guys, but real life's making it harder and harder to continue posting the show.  If I can't do it right, I'd rather not do it at all.  Most days it's going to be late in the day before I can post.  By then, the show's already everywhere.  Will continue to record it for myself, so let me know what you think.
