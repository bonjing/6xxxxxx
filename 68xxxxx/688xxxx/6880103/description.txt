"Itâ€™s not the end. But it is a new beginning." Thatâ€™s how Jay Malinowski is viewing the release of Bright Lights And Bruises, his first foray into the solo world outside of the cozy confines of his popular band Bedouin Soundclash. â€œIâ€™m cleaning my side of the street before going back to work,â€ says Malinowski of the 13-track soul purging recording while on a rare hiatus from his Juno award-winning day job. â€œThese are songs of things I lost along the way.â€ The self-produced acoustic-based album, which will be released on Bedouinâ€™s own Pirateâ€™s Blend Record label and distributed through Sony Music in Canada, February 16, 2010, shows off a different side of the artist -- quieter, deeply personal and incredibly contemplative, it is a sound befitting the catharsis he so urgently required. Bright Lights & Bruises is a stunning and remarkably stirring collection of material that shows someone whoâ€™s as much in touch with his feelings as he is with the craft of songwriting, and someone whoâ€™s willing to take chances and lay it all on the line. From the haunting and plaintive piano ballad Thereâ€™s A Light -- the albumâ€™s opener and first single -- to country strummers Life Is A Gun and Loving Hand, and the jangly, McCartney-esque pastoral melodicism of A Vacant Youth, Malinowski explores sonic and emotional spaces that will surprise but allure fans old and new.
