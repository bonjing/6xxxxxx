Theres just one shopping day until Christmas! Fred is so wrapped up in his
acting debut as Scrooge in the Bedrock production of A CHRISTMAS CAROL
that hes completely forgotten to buy any gifts. And worse, hes left baby Pebbles
stranded at Cave Care Center! But wife Wilma and a few familiar ghosts perform
a true Christmas miracle, helping hubby Fred remember the true meaning of the
season. Join Barney, Betty, Bamm-Bamm and Dino in this hilarious stone-age
version of the magical holiday classic.
