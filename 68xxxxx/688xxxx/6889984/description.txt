Dream House 2011 READNFO RC 720p BDRip LiNE XViD-26K

Imdb: 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1462041/

Plot:
Soon after moving into their seemingly idyllic new home, a family learns of a brutal crime committed against former residents of the dwelling.

Sources:
Russian bluray vobs thnxs!
DTRG line thnxs again :P

Notes:
Why readnfo?
Thnxs to the russians for the bluray and DTRG for the line :P
i used the cam audio and muxed it to the encoded russian 720p encode, then i put it into vdub changed the audio to pcm so now i can cut the video up into diffrent parts and sync each part up! more of the movie is now in sync up to 1hr 9mins is in sync! the rest of the movie in some areas are in sync then it does go oos then goes back to being sync again! also do note the audio is not full which causes number of syncing problems!

conclusion is to take or wait for retail in 3 weeks :P
