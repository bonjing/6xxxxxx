"Grumpy Old Man"

Its winter in Quahog, and Lois parents 
take Stewie away on a trip. But when 
Carter falls asleep at the wheel, the 
family decides it might be time for him 
to retire. Peter and Lois take the clan 
to Florida to check out some fine 
retirement communities, but Carter 
refuses to go down without a fight.

18/Slower
Evolve...or die.

Enjoy :)
