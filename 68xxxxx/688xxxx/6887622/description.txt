Review by Scott Yanow:
This historic music, which was released for the first time on this 1995 CD, features an exuberant session by a notable group of veteran all-stars, recorded live at UCLA in 1981. Altoist Art Pepper is heard on a lyrical and emotional version of "Over the Rainbow" (the only selection that has Charlie Haden on bass). Tenor great Zoot Sims swings on "In the Middle of a Kiss," "Broadway" and "The Girl from Ipanema"; the latter two songs also feature guitarist Barney Kessel. But the main reason to acquire this disc is to hear Sims and Pepper jamming together on "Wee" and "Breakdown Blues." The rhythm section of pianist Victor Feldman, bassist Ray Brown and drummer Billy Higgins is as tight, alert and hard-swinging as one would expect, and it is a joy to hear this rare encounter by the two great saxophonists. It is only a pity that Pepper and Sims did not record together more extensively during their careers.
