If your like me you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll want to finish the series up once these 26 episodes are up, unfortunately for those of you who like to watch anime in English the company that was dubbing quit out after WTC was finished so the second half can only be found in a subbed form. The second half can be found at the following URL: https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4969245/Higurashi_no_Naku_Koro_ni_Kai
