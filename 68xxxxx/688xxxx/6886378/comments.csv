Originally, I would play 6-8 stages and my framerate would be halved and more inconsistent, and sometimes it wouldn't save.

Now with this update, I've played 14 stages one after another without the framerate dropping more and more, and coming back all my progress was intact.

It still has moments where the framerate will go to hell and pick itself up, but that's okay with me(not great). These framerate issues haven't made me mess up in game yet."
