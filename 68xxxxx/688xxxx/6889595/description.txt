Last.Man.Standing.S01E11.The.Passion.of.the.Mandy.480p.WEB-DL.x264-mSD [MKV 119MB]

[/b][/color] You re a single metropolitan male in your late 20s in the mid-2000 s.
You ve finally found the one haircut that doesn t make you look like Richard Branson, got money in your pocket and a well-thumbed book on tantric philosophy that s taught you to make sex last a full 10 minutes.
Your job is now a career, your friends are for life and you ve learned not to tell  that  joke in mixed company.
The pressure s mounting on you to take that step into the big leagues.
Your parents aren t getting any younger, and you d like to present them with some form of significant achievement before it s time for you to change their nappies.
 And it s not even that you particularly want to get married; you re just annoyed that you ve never been asked.
 Even then, you d still prefer to be single on alternating weekends and public holidays.
But you re resisting.
 There s still a bad taste in your mouth when you think about matching quilt sets and  a quiet night in .
