breathtaking action photography from "Point Break."
Keanu Reeves stars as Johnny Utah, a clean-cut FBI rookie assigned to track down a gang of bank robbers operating in Southern California. Since his partner (Gary Busey) is convinced that the robbers are surgers, Johnny decides to go undercover in the maverick world of surfing. He soon meets Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) a charsmatic adrenaline junkie who'll do anything for a thrill...perhaps even rob banks. As the two become friends, Johnny falls under the dangerous influence of Bodhi. He becomes addicted to the endless days of surfing and reckless nights of partying, and gets involved with Bodhi's ex-girlfriend (Lori Petty). As Johnny gets closer to cracking the case, he learns the truth about Bodhi's most important lesson-if you want the ultimate thrill, you have to pay the ultimate price.
