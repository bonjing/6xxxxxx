Upon defeating the monster, they are shocked to discover that it reverts back to Riko Nirasaki who was afflicted by Damon-Hall Syndrome. KÅichi Kaga flees in terror. Beast vaccinates Riko while continuing to interrogate Yui, continuing to build suspicions that she is withholding information. Meanwhile, Kaga transforms into a monster due to Damon Hall Syndrome and attacks the X-Men, but is defeated. As she reverts from diamond form, Emma catches a glace of Jun Sanada and sees his image flicker to that of Mastermind, and he vanishes.
