This is a test cd that used to be given out with Soundstream stereo equipment.

AFIK, It has never been sold commercially.

It does have some cool funky bass in it.

I found this on another torrent site.

If you know of a way to tell if this is the original recording quality, let me know.


If you like this upload, show some gratitude.


Much love to all those keeping TPB alive!
