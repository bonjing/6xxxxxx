                           DESCRiPTiON 
                          
 Panoroma looks at issues affecting the British public and the rest of the world. 

With the world economy apparently in meltdown, Adam Shaw investigates how Britain 
could survive the crisis. He explores the potential for financial growth away from 
Europe in the fast-growing economies of places like Brazil, China and India, and 
asks what the Government needs to do to chart a path to a brighter future.  
                     
                                 Enjoy!
