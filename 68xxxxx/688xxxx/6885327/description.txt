Robin.Harris.Live.From.The.Comedy.Act.Theater.2006.PROPER.DVDRip.XviD-FiCO 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0853261/
Subtitles: None
Date: 2011.12

Director: Reginald Hudlin
Genre: Standup Comedy
Plot: Few contemporary comedians African-American or otherwise have 
influenced and inspired as many as the late Robin Harris, and in this 
release featuring never-before-seen stand up footage and interviews 
with a variety of celebrities and comics, comedy lovers who may not 
have had the opportunity to see Harris perform live can finally find 
out what all the fuss is about. No one could crack them up like 
Harris, and there were few venues in which the comedian felt more 
at home than at The World Famous Comedy Act Theater in Los Angeles. 
As Harris takes the stage of The World Famous Comedy Act Theater to 
tell a series of hilarious tales and toy playfully with the willing 
crowd, the cameras are rolling to capture a moment in time where the 
laughter never stops.
