Discover Nazi Germany's top-secret development of radar-evading technology.


In the final months of World War II a jet powered flying wing made its first test flight from a remote airfield deep inside Nazi Germany. Generations ahead of its time, the Horten 229 had been designed to be a lethal fighter-bomber and more importantly, virtually undetectable to Allied radar. Had Reimar and Walter Horten designed the worldâ€™s first stealth fighter? 


Hitler's Stealth Fighter goes behind the scenes with an elite group of aerospace engineers and stealth experts from Northrop Grumman as they build a full-scale model of the sinister bat wing fighter. Once complete, go where cameras have never been allowed as the stealth's Northrop team test the Nazi fighterâ€™s capability at their remote Tejon Radar Range. After decades of debate and speculation the mystery of the Horten 229â€™s stealth capability is finally put to rest.
