The More than Complete DC-Now More Completerer!

This fifty-second alphabetical installment is:  DC from Woo-Wz

What's This?
     It's a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh! Â®Â©)â„¢, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and M.C. Gaines among others.
       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those "Pre-DC" comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC super-heroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heroes are Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and among many others. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will be some "Post DC" comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c. 925gb in total. It will take as long as it takes, but it's nearly done. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.

=================================

     Since I'm probably posting the X-Z torrent on Friday, the final fill torrents are coming soon. I'd really like to know of anything I forgot, skipped, screwed up, or omitted with malicious intent.
     If you think just maybe you know something I should have included, that any idiot with a gnat's brain would have included, speak up. Perhaps something you wish upon a star I'd included? Is there stuff you know is scanned but apparently I don't, anything tenuously connected to anything ever even glanced at for one second by someone who worked for DC for five minutes? 
    Speak soon, or forever hold your peace. When I up the last fill, which will be part 56 or  maybe 57, your chance will have expired.  If there's any comic that I can share, let me do it now, for I may never torrent this way again. Sniff.

=================================
This week Glenn Beck called Tea Party  members who prefer Newt Gingrich over President Obama racist  because there is  no other good way to explain why they would. These guys -  the President and the former Speaker - they believe all the same things, right? So it must be racism. I am not making this up. 
Am I supposed to follow an act like that?

Just don't have the time to write today anyway, torrent fans, but I have the World's Finest Comics!  It says  so right on the cover.

Feel free to post this to other sites if you know how and are so inclined

Please Seed! Lots of people will start on the series months
or even a year or two from now. You are their only hope to complete
their downloads.

=========================================================================
Thanks to the Scanners and editors, and thanks to the seeders, the
anonymous folk that make the work of the scanners and uploaders multiply!
=========================================================================
Until we once again don't actually meet,

Cordially,
