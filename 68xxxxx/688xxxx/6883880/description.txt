Joe Rogan is back and uglier than ever.

This show lands soemwhat between standard
and competitive reality, having both high
motion sequences (cars, bungee, wrecks, 
etc) as well as low motion (eating, 
chatting, sitting challenges, etc.) So we 
went with a crf of 21 and preset slower.
[It was the water that pushed up the 
bitrate on this episode.]
