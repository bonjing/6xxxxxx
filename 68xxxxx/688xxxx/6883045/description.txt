Jaan Pehechaan Ho (Let\\\'s get to know each other) is a popular song, composed by Shankar Jaikishan, lyrics by Anand Bakshi, sung by Mohammed Rafi, from the 1965 movie Gumnaam, directed by Raja Nawathe, produced by N N Sippy and starring Manoj Kumar & Nanda (actress).

The song\\\'s video introduces the movie to the audiences. It was shot in a disco and features Laxmi Chhaya. The psychedelic choreography was by Herman Benjamin.

The song also appears in the opening credits of the 2001 movie Ghost World. In an interview, Ghost World writer Daniel Clowes mentions that he obtained his 20th generation copy of the scene from someone who had been housesitting for Peter Holsapple, guitarist and songwriter for The dB\\\'s, and he copied it from Peter\\\'s collection. Then they approached the sons of the producers and acquired the rights to use the song in the movie. The Ghost World DVD features the entire music video from the movie.

The song, with similar costumes and choreography, also appears in the Cullberg Ballet\\\'s rendition of Ekman\\\'s Triptych.

The song was also used for Heineken\\\'s 2011 \\\"The Date\\\" commercial.

The group \\\"Ted Lyons and his Cubs\\\" playing the song can also be seen in 1964 film Jaanwar playing \\\"Dekho Ab To\\\" (a cover version of I Want to Hold Your Hand by Beatles) and Tasveer (starring Feroz Khan), Love Marriage (starring Dev Anand), Bedaag (starring Manoj Kumar), Shehnai and Mere Sanam (both starring Vishwajeet). The dancer/choreographer Oscar Unger can also be seen in most of them.

Rough Translation;

Let\\\'s get to know each other
Life would become easier
You who have stolen my heart
Do no be so elusive (Dont Avoid Eye Contact)
(At least) tell me your name

May this wonderful evening
Not pass unavailed
For it will not return
On anyone\\\'s call
Whether you speak or not
Your message is clear

The hard blow fell
Right on my heart
Stolen glances,
Impassioned looks
Let this small matter
Not become a huge tale
