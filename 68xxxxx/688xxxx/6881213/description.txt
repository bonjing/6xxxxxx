Network: History

Whatâ€™s It All About? Although it seems like zombies are a recent phenomenon that has grown out of comic books, movies and TV, there actually is a long history of zombie legends from the dawn of civilization to today, and this two-hour documentary explores that history.

The special details how Europeâ€™s Black Plague became one of the most prolific periods for myths and legends about zombies, explores why Viking legends believed zombies were nearly indestructible except by decapitation or immolation; examines other zombie legends from around the world, including secret stories of Chinaâ€™s Terra Cotta Warriors and the voodoo rituals of Haiti; and shows how modern science added a whole new twist on zombies beginning with Mary Shelleyâ€™s Frankenstein.
