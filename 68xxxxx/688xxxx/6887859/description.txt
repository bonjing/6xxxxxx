Another strange and touching movie by the unique Harmony Korine.

I was dissatisified with the quality of the versions available, and ARTE ran it in HD so here it is in H264 at last.

I'm not one for synopsys, so I'll just give some snapshots and technical data.

Technical aspects :

The video was encoded according to AVCHD specifications so I guess a DVD-R readable by your Blu-Ray player is doable.

Picture :

The source HD DVB-T, and the broadcaster (arte) harcoded the french subtitles on the video. Nothing I can do about that. Most of these are located under the picture tough. Mpc-hc displays other subtitles at the same height over these, which you may like or not (you should have the option to move them as you see fit, if you don't).

Very few and short imperfections because of the reception (which was very good), they should not be a concern.

I was unsatisfied by the offer on bittorrent on Mr. Lonely There was no H264 of the DVD. Arte (fr) ran it in "HD", with a quality probably higher than the DVD, so here we go.

Also, I have worked to find and use the "best" avisynth technology on the source, and applied the strongest denoising/sharpening that wouldn't remove any noticable precision (and obv. thanx to high quality x264 encoding not loose anything noticeable there too).
