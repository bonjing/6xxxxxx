Get "Up and Running" with AutoCAD using Gindis's combination of step-by-step instruction, examples, and insightful explanations. The emphasis from the beginning is on core concepts and the practical application of AutoCAD in architecture, engineering, and design. Equally useful in instructor-led classroom training and in self-study, the book is written with the student in mind by a long-time AutoCAD user and instructor based on what works in the industry and the classroom.

    * Strips away complexities and reduces AutoCAD to easy-to-understand basic concepts.
    * Explains "why" something is done, not just "how": the theory behind each concept or command is discussed prior to engaging AutoCAD so the student has a clear idea of what they are attempting to do.
    * All basic commands are documented step-by-step: what the user types in and how AutoCAD responds is spelled out in discrete and clear steps with numerous screenshots.
    * Extensive supporting graphics (screenshots) and a summary with a self-test section and topic specific drawing exercises are included at the end of each chapter.
    * Also available in a 2D+3D version with 10 additional chapters covering 3D concepts. The ISBN for the 2D+3D version is 978-012-387029-2.
