[V],psspss,2011-12-15T07:31Z,the cappers uploaded an re-air episode and it pushed the real s06 out of order what im talking about.. this is the correct e06 but E05 previous called blah mars is rerally e04 and E06 called about earth something is E05
 it
was obviously flares tells me they havent watched the same
videos on it as i have,.

if it was flares how come the last light on said triangle craft

was the last to go off.. in the 'switch on' order it should of been first
as it would have to be a extremely long last flare that was controlled
to turn off last.

plus the lights hovered not dropped..

thats just applying normal common sense.. no brain washed media
non sense line what it was."
