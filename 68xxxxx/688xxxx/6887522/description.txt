4)  Forbidden Depths - Part 1 
This two-part film documents the month-long, deep-sea expedition of a team of internationally renowned scientists and researchers off the coast of Cuba. Led by Dr. Grant Gilmore of the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution, a group of American scientists and ichthyologists participated in this cooperative research mission along with a team of Cuban scientists aboard the Seward Johnson research vessel. The scientists made numerous dives in a sophisticated, deep-sea submersible known as the Johnson Sea Link, which is capable of diving up to 2500 feet below the water's surface. The team of scientists found new marine species, searched rich coral reefs, and investigated marine life that may hold cures to diseases.

5)  Forbidden Depths - Part 2 
Using sophisticated underwater technology U.S. and Cuban sclentists explore the rich but relatively unknown waters off the coast of Cuba. With underwater photographer Al Giddings and the submersible from Discovery Channel's landmark voyage to Galapagos, this rich underwater site is explored the first time.The scientists on board include Shirley Pomponi, a sponge expert; Tammy Frank, who studies shrimp-like species to understand adaptability; and Edie Vidder, a bioluminescence expert. The expedition identifies species new to the region and new to science.

Of all the Earth's predators known and feared, none is more shrouded in mystery than the Great White Shark. Nowhere on earth is the Great White more dreaded than on the island continent of Australia, where the vast majority of people live along the coastline, a mere stones throw from over 170 species of sharks. In Australia, the coexistence between humans and sharks is not a choice, but a necessity. This programme examines the history of the White Shark in Australia, from gruesome encounters with humans to the Iatest research. Now, by catching White Sharks and implanting transmitters into thern, researchers are tracking these predators and understanding for the first time where they go and what they do.

9)  The Orca - Killers I have Known 
Elusive and misunderstood killer whales are affectionately profiled in this documentary that follows intrepid researcher Ingrid Visser. Zipping around in an inflatable boat, responding to sightings phoned in to a hotline, Visser tracks pods of the animals as they cavort gracefully in the scenic waters of northern New Zealand. During her years of tracking the animals, Visser has been able to identify individual killer whales, or orcas, and we even see her interacting with one wild killer whale that seems to recognize and greet her. For many years, humans believed that killer whales would attack humans, but that fear turns out to be unfounded. Visser is usually in close proximity to the large creatures in the wild, but in underwater footage she is seen actually swimming among them. An energetic and engaging subject for a documentary, Visser displays a spirit in tracking the whales that is infectious. In interview segments she explains her fascination for the orcas, and provides insights into their behavior and her fears for their future as manmade pollution begins to seriously threaten their habitats.
