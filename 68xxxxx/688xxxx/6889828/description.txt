The Phil Collins Big Band was a side project of English pop singer Phil Collins which performed in the late 1990s. The group presented big band renditions of Phil Collins and Genesis songs, including hits such as "Sussudio" and "Invisible Touch". The group was primarily an instrumental act, with Collins remaining behind the drums, like the early days of Genesis and rarely singing at performances.

The group released one album, A Hot Night in Paris, in 1999.
