[/b][/color] "Imagine a world where your greatest fears become reality." In each pulse-racing "Fear Factor" episode, contestants recruited across the country battle in extreme stunts.
These stunts are designed to challenge the contestants both physically and mentally.
 If a player is too afraid to complete or fail a stunt, the player is eliminated.
If they succeed, they are one step closer to the grand prize: $50,000.
