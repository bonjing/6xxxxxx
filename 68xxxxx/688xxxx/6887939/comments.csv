like dark matter and parallel universes etc and get paid well
for stuff thats not even provable 

but when they make a statement about pheonix lights that it
was obviously flares tells me they havent watched the same
videos on it as i have,.

if it was flares how come the last light on said triangle craft

was the last to go off.. in the 'switch on' order it should of been first
as it would have to be a extremely long last flare that was controlled
to turn off last.

plus the lights hovered not dropped..

thats just applying normal common sense.. no brain washed media
non sense line what it was."
