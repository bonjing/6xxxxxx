The 2011 re-issue of Boney M.'s 1981 Christmas album. So what's new about this one then? Errr... besides the cover art and the title... not much really. Except for the fact that it proudly claims to include "All the Hits!". Really? So where are "Daddy Cool", "Ma Baker" and "Rivers of Babylon" then? Or is that a reference to the "Hit-Mix" that's been tucked on at the end as a "bonus track"...? False marketing anyone? Otherwise, the usual hodge podge of various edits, mixes, remixes and 90s versions and unfortunately also the usual share of tracks missing ("Winter Fairy-Tale", "Darkness Is Falling", "Hark the Herald Angels Sing", "Oh Christmas Tree" and "The First Noel" this time). The "Christmas Medley" has now been renamed "The Christmas Mix" and is this time included twice - this while the classic Christmas hit "Mary's Boy Child/Oh My Lord" is shorter than ever, 3:42 to be precise, more than two minutes shorter than the original 7" version: (no pun intended) - a new record. And nope, none of the tracks are digitally remastered. That's about it really. Well done Sony. You've done it again.

Enjoy and share!
