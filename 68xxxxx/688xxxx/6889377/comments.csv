If I had the money and manpower of a scene group, I could fix it. I'm one person supported entirely by your donations. "
 reason i am bothering is that 75% of games uploaded on tpb are you, many of them only by you.

so again, how is that relevant?  and if there is a better way to encode your files, why not be interested?  i am definitely not the only one to comment on the framerate issue, you would be doing a lot of people a favor by fixing this.  moreover it would be easy.

if it makes any difference, the second i am able to watch your games i'll likely be making a donation.  not a big one, i cant afford much, but still."
