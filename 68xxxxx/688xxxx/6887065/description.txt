Heavenly Creatures is a 1994 film directed by Peter Jackson, from a screenplay he co-wrote with his wife Fran Walsh, about the notorious 1954 Parker-Hulme murder case in Christchurch, New Zealand. Filmed on location in Christchurch, it features Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet in their screen debuts. The film deals with the obsessive relationship between Pauline Parker (Lynskey) and Juliet Hulme (Winslet), two teenagers who murdered Parker's mother (Peirse). The events of the film cover the period from the girls' meeting in early 1953 to the murder in 1954.
The film opened to strong critical acclaim at the Venice Film Festival in 1994 and became one of the best-received films of the year. Reviewers praised most aspects of the production; however, particular attention was given to the performances by the previously unknown Winslet and Lynskey, and for Jackson's directing. The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay.
