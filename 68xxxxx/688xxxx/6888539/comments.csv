s series to the correct numbers.
Slow pokes. Sheesh.

Encoding the Decoded 2012 ep right now.
Will have it out pretty soon.

I can't do Work of Art.
a) it's on same times as Sons of Guns and Decoded.
b) scene cappers already have it covered.
From what I can see they aren't slacking off to release them.  Often times same night they air.
c) And I have enough on my platter as it is.

Hah, I've paid for Amazon/iTunes stuff before and removed the DRM to share as a torrent.  The last show I did that for was Ancient Aliens S03E16.  Even on the re-air they did not use proper HD broadcast and there are some hardcore 720p nuts out there that want a true HD release, so I coughed up a couple bucks to make one that was 1,000x better than the previous wannabe 720p release. It was worth it.

As for loyal seeders it doesn't matter which site they're from as long as the people recognize that tag name/uploader and trust it as being legit and quality they will seed.  Especially if it's a series of interest to them.  People on TPB, KAT, 1337x, and ET are just as loyal as anybody anywhere else.  Thank you, guys and girls! :D"
