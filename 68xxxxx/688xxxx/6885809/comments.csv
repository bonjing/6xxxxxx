Do you, by any chance, have the film ""Birth"" in Blu Ray? Could you rip it in 1080p, please? This film has got beautiful cinematography.

This Three Colors triology is a masterpiece by one of my favorite filmmakers. I recommend also my favorite ""The Double Life of Veronique"", also...""Dekalog"", ""A Short Film About Love"", ""A Short Film About Killing"" and all the others! ;-)

And thank you for all you great choice of rips/cinema."
