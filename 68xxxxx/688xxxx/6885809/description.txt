This boldly cinematic trio of stories about love and loss from Krzysztof KieÅ›lowski was a defining event of the art-house boom of the 1990s. The films were named for the colors of the French flag and stand for the tenets of the French Revolutionâ€”liberty, equality, and fraternityâ€”but this hardly begins to explain their enigmatic beauty and rich humanity. Set in Paris, Warsaw, and Geneva, and ranging from tragedy to comedy, Blue, White, and Red (KieÅ›lowskiâ€™s final film) examine with artistic clarity a group of ambiguously interconnected people experiencing profound personal disruptions. Marked by intoxicating cinematography and stirring performances by such actors as Juliette Binoche, Julie Delpy, IrÃ¨ne Jacob, and Jean-Louis Trintignant, KieÅ›lowskiâ€™s Three Colors is a benchmark of contemporary cinema.
