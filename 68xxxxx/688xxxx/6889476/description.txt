Live Nirvana Bootography Review:
Yet another release of the 02/22/94 show. Allright at first look I thought this was a mislabel but after hearing it I was a little upset to find "Scentless Apprentice" cut-out and put in the middle of the setlist. Besides that, it is a normal copy of the 02/22/94 show. Also this is the only version of the show that I have seen with "Heat-Shaped Box" And "Demolition" are put together on one track, and it also includes the drum solo... so I guess that is a plus. Again pick up ROMA if you get the chance.
