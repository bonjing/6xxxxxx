From the Infowars web site ::

On the Tuesday, December 13 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with Texas Rep. and presidential candidate Ron Paul about the campaign and the 2012 election. 

Alex also talks about the United Nations' Durban, South Africa climate conference with Piers Corbyn, who is a meteorologist, astrophysicist, outspoken critic of the theory of anthropogenic global warming, and owner of the business Weather Action. 

Alex also covers the latest news, including preparations for an attack on Syria and ominous police state developments on the home-front.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
