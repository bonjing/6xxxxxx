This is my personal collection of Earl Sweatshirt\'s music. 

As far as Kitchen Cutlery goes, I am not sure if every song is there, or if every song that I put in there is from that album. I just collected all the songs I could find and if they weren\'t from an odd future album assumed they were from when he went by Sly Tendencies. I don\'t know the tracks order, I just put them in alphabetic.
