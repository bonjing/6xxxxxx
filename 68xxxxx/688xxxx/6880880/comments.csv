i dont care about standing out..

its about supply and demand.. cos media
are to lame and dumb to provide the peoples
needs over their greed.. 

but whateva man you do it your way i do it mine

respect comes in staying if its your source or not
in the header. dont have to deface a avi name
for that.

anyhow back to watching the stuff ive made
not even had a chance myself to check out
the contents :) great show this.. well interesting
but it end up being more the same each episode
apart from the odd death. shows how lame it
is..

if it was me.. I would expect the right.. if anyone
is near a mined road and you dont go and get far away.. then makes you a target for a trigger man
after all they hide in with the locals and dont
wear unions forms and say here I am come and get me

usa are just to nice to the ememies"
for redistribution would be suggested and then rename them however you want for your own collection on your own computer.  I'm sure many people rename these anyway to a simpler more uniform format which matches the rest of their episodes and would be something similar to:
Series Name . S##E## . Episode Title . HDTV . XviD - tag . avi
Or, they might delete the HDTV.XviD-tag section to keep the bare minimum basics.

If you got it off the WWW you have to call it a WebRip even if the network logo in the video says HD because the quality just is not there. Sure, it might look decent, but it's still not a true HDTV.XviD.  HDTV.XviD's come directly from the original recording from the HD STB.  Encoded once.  If it's snagged off the web it's a compressed format of a previously compressed format and if you convert the FLV or MP4 to XviD it's compressed yet again.  Trying to label that as HDTV is flat out false advertising.

The date in brackets is completely unnecessary and should be information posted in the details of the torrent along with episode duration, video dimensions, bitrates for video and audio, and a quick overview about the episode itself - you can copy that from wiki, tvrage, or the official website of the show.

You can call me a snobby egotistical piece of shit dickhead but this is only advice to you (and everybody thinking of sharing TV recordings) on how to make a legit looking release which actually can help you earn trusted status on some sites.

Oh yeah... If you're not doing 2-pass encodings, you really should. It'll give you better compression and higher quality.  The XviD bitrate calculator will also give you the bitrate to use to get you on that 350MB mark no problem for that even more official looking XviD release.

There ya go, kiddo. You can either heed the advice or ignore it.  Even if you hate it I'm sure someone out there will take it."
