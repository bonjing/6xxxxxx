The Eaglesoft Development Group Cessna Citation X 750 Extreme 2.0 model for Microsoft Flight Simulator X/SP2 and Microsoft Windows XP, Vista, or Windows 7, includes a very accurate rendition of the Honeywell Primus 2000 Avionics package from Eaglesoft Development Group.
Realistic Honeywell Primus 2000 Avionics, along with an excellent flight dynamics package from Eaglesoft Development Group, offer the dedicated flight simulation enthusiast an immersive environment where the lines between real world operation and flight simulation operation might come closer together.  For this reason we would like to state that the Eaglesoft Development Group Cessna Citation X 750 Extreme 2.0 model is built for Flight Simulation purposes only and should never be used for real world aviation training or operation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The team members at Eaglesoft Development Group are very pleased to provide an excellent visual model along with realistic flight dynamics, gauges, and sounds for the dedicated flight simulation enthusiast. We trust that you will enjoy your Eaglesoft Development Group Cessna Citation X 750 Extreme 2.0 model for Microsoft Flight Simulator X for many years to come.
