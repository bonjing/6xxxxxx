68 (sixty eight) Jungle Jim [Image]

Vietnam, 1968: Behind enemy lines, a soldier stands alone. A one-man army armored against the risen, hungry dead under burlap, bamboo and Army green. Armored against the living with a Bowie knife and a mobile arsenal. If you got left behind he'll find you. If youre the enemy youll never see him coming. If youre a zombie he'l kill you again. Sometimes, to slay monsters you have to become one yourself. Jungle Jim is a stand-alone one-shot comic story set in the grim world of 68. Meshing smoothly with the ongoing military horror series, Jungle Jim is a savage new slant on the Vietnam/Zombie apocalypse scripted by MARK KIDWELL with stunning artwork by NATE VAN DYKE and JAY FOTOS.
