Chris Wood is an uncompromising writer whose music reveals his love for the unofficial history of English-speaking people. 

With gentle intelligence he weaves the tradition with his own contemporary parables; his writing has been said to share the same timeless quality as Richard Thompson at his best. 

The Irish Times heralded Chris Wood as "the renaissance man of English folk" when on his own R.U.F Records label he released The Lark Descending in 2005. 

The album includes the BBC Folk Award-winning song "One In A Million".

The Lark Descending celebrates a few of the stories of the people who are governed, in rich and compelling fashion--the indigenous population of England has been unravelling the universe in music and song for millennia.
