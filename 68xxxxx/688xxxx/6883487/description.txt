Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Monday, December 12 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with Glenn Spencer, an anti-illegal immigration activist who publishes the American Patrol Report. He will talk with Alex about the latest open border scheme -- the proposal for an entry point on the Mexican border without border patrol agents. 

Alex also talks with pharmacist and radio talk show host [and one of Alex's partners in his supplement marketing business, infowarsteam.com] Ben Fuchs. 

Alex confronts the latest news, including the arrest of a "right-wing" family on cattle rustling charges in North Dakota. The arrests were made by local law enforcement with the help of U.S. Air Force Predator drones, a clear violation of Posse Comitatus.

[Technically, the drones belong to the Border Patrol.]

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
