Storyine: Death is just as omnipresent as ever, and in Final Destination 5 it strikes again. During the bus ride to a corporate retreat, Sam (Nicholas DÃ¢Â€â„¢Agosto) has a premonition in which he and most of his friends â€” as well as numerous others â€” die in a horrific bridge collapse. When his vision ends, events begin to mirror what he had seen, and he frantically ushers as many of his colleagues â€” including his friend, Peter (Miles Fisher), and girlfriend, Molly (Emma Bell) â€” away from the disaster before Death can claim them. But these unsuspecting souls were never supposed to survive, and in a terrifying race against time, the ill-fated group tries to discover a way to escape DeathÃ¢Â€â„¢s sinister agenda.
