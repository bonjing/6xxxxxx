Personal favourite documentary!
(we are 72% super/fruit-fly)

Documentary providing a fly's eye view of one hundred years of genetic research. Drosophila melanogaster, the common fruit fly, has helped scientists unlock the secrets of life as the subject of thousands of genetic experiments.

Using specialist photography and 3D animation the programme explores the fly's world, meeting gay, drunk and violent flies, as well as mutants high on crack cocaine, all lovingly raised by a slightly obsessed breed of scientists past and present. And the fruit fly may now even help us find a cure for cancer.
