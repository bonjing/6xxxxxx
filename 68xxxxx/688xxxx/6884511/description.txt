Document's Volume 1: Rockin' and Rollin' (1948-1950) includes the 10 Gold Star masters that Jackson waxed in the late '40s; 2 sides recorded for Modern Records in 1949; and 11 tracks cut for Imperial Records in 1950. All 23 tracks are solo recordings, from the acoustic "Freedom Train Blues" to the heavily amplified "Milford Blues" (which contains the precursor to the "Rockin' and Rollin'" riff).

Lil Son Jackson: Restless Blues  Volume 2

This set from Document, the second in the label's presentation of Jackson's complete recorded work, includes material he recorded between 1950 and 1952 for Imperial Records at sessions held in Dallas, Houston, and Fort Worth, some of it featuring Jackson singing solo to his own acoustic or electric guitar accompaniment and some of it with a small blues combo behind him. Highlights include the intimate opener, "New Year's Resolution" (where Jackson clearly sings "revolution" rather than "resolution," which actually adds to the song's charm), the wise (if obvious) "Time Changes Things," the nervous "I Wish I Could Go Home" and the energetic and feisty jump blues of "Red Light." Jackson also does a band-backed do-over of his most famous song here, "Rockin' and Rollin" # 2," which had previously been recorded in a solo setting as "Rockin' and Rollin'," which morphed over time into the blues standard "Rock Me Baby."
