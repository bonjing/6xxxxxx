Throw your flat-bottomed fanboat into high gear and slip and slide through the muddy waters of the backwoods bayou. Smash and crash through a destructible world filled with rickety swamp shacks, fishinâ€™ boats, chicken coops, gators, and more. Pack your cargo hold to the brim with moonshine, tobacky, snake oil and other contraband and then sell â€˜em to the highest bidder in a rampaginâ€™ 10-day race for profit and glory. Just make sure you keep an eye out for Smokeyâ€“the more notorious you get, the more cops will come gunninâ€™ for you.
