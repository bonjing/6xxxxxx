Sim City 2000 Special Edition   Includes SimCity Urban Renewal Kit & scenario pack

A re-packaged version of SimCity 2000, SimCity 2000 Special Edition, was released in 1995 for Microsoft Windows and DOS PCs, partly because the original SimCity 2000 in 1993 could not be run under Microsoft Windows, even in command prompt mode.
In addition to containing All expansions, it also featured the SimCity Urban Renewal Kit, the Vol. 1 scenario pack, remade music, new cities selected by Maxis from a 1994 competition, bonus scenarios and cities, and movies.
