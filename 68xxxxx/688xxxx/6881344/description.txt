It has been an incredible year for Adele, starting with her #1 album \"21\", her number 1 single \"Someone Like You\", the global smash \"Rolling In The Deep\" and her spellbinding live appearance on The Brits. Her album \"21\" has become the biggest selling album in the world this year -12 million copies sold and counting - and \"21\"and \"19\" remain the UK\'s 1st and 2nd highest selling albums so far. She has received rave reviews for her live shows and \"Live At The Royal Albert Hall\", recorded at the height of this amazing year, showcases exactly why Adele has become one of the most sought after live performers in the world.
