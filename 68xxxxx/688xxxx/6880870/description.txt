Unlike most other tax guides, How to Pay Zero Taxes focuses on tax saving, not tax preparation. Jeff Schnepper stands apart from the crowd of tax-book authors by creating an easy-to-read, easy-to-apply guide that explains what people really care aboutâ€”paying less to the IRS!
This updated edition covers more deductions than any other such book, including those related to child care and elder care, job hunting expenses, mortgages and points, investment expenses
