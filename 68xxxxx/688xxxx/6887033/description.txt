     Experience the ultimate rush with the relentless thrills and 
     breathtaking action photography from "Point Break."

     Keanu Reeves stars as Johnny Utah, a clean-cut FBI rookie assigned to 
     track down a gang of bank robbers operating in Southern California. 
     Since his partner (Gary Busey) is convinced that the robbers are 
     surgers, Johnny decides to go undercover in the maverick world of 
     surfing. He soon meets Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) a charsmatic adrenaline 
     junkie who'll do anything for a thrill...perhaps even rob banks. As the 
     two become friends, Johnny falls under the dangerous influence of Bodhi.
     He becomes addicted to the endless days of surfing and reckless nights 
     of partying, and gets involved with Bodhi's ex-girlfriend (Lori Petty). 
     As Johnny gets closer to cracking the case, he learns the truth about 
     Bodhi's most important lesson-if you want the ultimate thrill, you have 
     to pay the ultimate price.

     Keanu Reeves   .... FBI Special Agent Johnny Utah
