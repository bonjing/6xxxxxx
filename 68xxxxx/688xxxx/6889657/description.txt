Comments from the uploader:

I downloaded this video from: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6828408/Assassins_Creed_Embers_%28Bonus_Movie%29

I encoded the video to h264 Hi10P, which reduced the size from 1.92 GiB to 291 MiB without sacrificing quality.

Also included are subtitles:
 - They transcribe the audio (for people who have a hard time understanding)
 - They translate some expressions (Italian/Chinese -&gt; English)
 - And they correct some errors in the original's grammar (Mio caro Sofia -&gt; Mia cara Sofia)

The subtitles were written by myself, because none of the subtitles I found on the internet met with my standards.
They either had wrong timing (started too soon, ended too soon or ended far too late), used the wrong words or had errors in grammar or orthography (especially the Italian transcripts)


This is my first torrent, so I hope I did everything correctly.
Also, I'm afraid I can't seed all the time.
My only PC is a Notebook, which I need for studies (and I'm not allowed to run torrents while at the university), also my ISP throttles my speed during weekends from 2Mbps to a lousy 400kbps (Upload only).

Please bear with the inconvenience and once you've got the video, please seed to at least 1.0 or 1.5 for the sake of all those who will follow.

How to play Hi10P content:

Videos with a depth of 10 bits per color are becoming increasingly common, especially in the Anime scenes.

The Pros include:
 - Smaller size at the same quality or better quality at the same size
 - Reduced banding (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour_banding)

The Cons include:
 - No hardware support (A relatively powerful CPU is needed for playback, especially at higher resolutions)
 - No native support from media players (additional codecs are required)


Because of the Cons, I have decided to add this little "How to" section.

If you're on Windows:

---------------------

If you're using Windows Media Player:

 - You'll need to install either Haali filters (http://haali.su/mkv/), or LAV filters (http://code.google.com/p/lavfilters/).
      If you need support for "Ordered Chapters", you'll need Haali.
      If you're not sure, whether to pick x86 or x64, you probably need x86 (even if you run Windows 7 x64)
 - You'll need DirectVobSub for subtitles (if you don't already have it)
 - (OPTIONAL) If you want thumbnails, you might like IcarosYou'll need to have LAV filters installed on your system (even if you DON'T use them). If you run a 64 bit OS, you'll need LAV x64 for Icaros to work.

If you're on Mac or Linux:

Sorry mate, you're out of luck.
Maybe Google can help you out.
