over 4 days or less so how can they predict global warming and mad weather events

lets face it.. if we get lots of sun and droughts
then it amazing how much power you can
get from solar panels which can hook up
to machines to make sea water drinkable
since its rising and is everywhere

when you live in a country of quakes you
are always prepared.. we have sealed containers of food torches fire and a cupboard full of tins

i think maybe its just usa that arent prepare
for bad events :) going by these shows lol"
