This is Part 2 L-Z of the tracks in this torrent. Theres all sorts of Northern on it from Stompers
floaters/oldies/modern/crossover but all still the soul we love.
I have tried to only add sounds over the Â£100 mark and quite a few into 4 figures. And although 
alot of these are my own I have \'BORROWED\' some from friends and other peeps on the scene.

Im not saying that I agree with the high prices put on some of these but with the coming back
to the scene of alot of the old niter crowd who now have some dosh in thier pocket they are
paying over the odds for them. This has been good for the ones who have sat on their sounds
over time and want to make a few quid.
I hope you enjoy these and they give you some tingles and goosebumps! Get them on, turn the 
sound up and boogie like nobodys watching!
Love and peace.
Unionjack
