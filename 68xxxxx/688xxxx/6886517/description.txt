Betty Hutton (as Annie Oakley) and Howard Keel (as Frank Butler) star in this sharpshootin' funfest based on the 1,147-performance Broadway smash boasting Irving Berlin's beloved score, including Doin' What Comes Natur'lly, I Got the Sun in the Morning and the anthemic There's No Business like Show Business. As produced by Arthur Freed, directed by George Sidney and seen and heard in a new digital transfer from restored elements. This lavish, spirited production showcases songs and
performances with bull's-eye precision, earning an Oscar for adaptation scoring. The story is brawling boy-meets-girl-meets-buckshot rivalry. But love finally triumphs when Annie proves that, yes, you can get a man with a gun!
