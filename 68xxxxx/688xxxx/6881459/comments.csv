Audio and video quality is very good!
Too bad the movie is ""horrible""! I mean it is a scary horror movie. Too scary for me!

The movie is spoken in Korean with optional Chinese or English subtitles. 
The movie is divided into two files so there will be a short break in between. But it is very convenient to burn to CD instead of DVD. 

(I found everything works well with VLC and also with Asus O!Play HD media-player but if for some reason the subtitles don't work with everyone, simply rename the srt-file (either the Chinese or the English one) to exactly match the avi-file but of course leaving the extensions unchanged. Then it will always work!)"
