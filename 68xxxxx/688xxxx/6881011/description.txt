[/b][/color] Charlie Brooker, the author of E4's BAFTA nominated Dead Set, returns with a new three-part 60 minute mini-series for autumn 2011.
Charlie authors two of the three films while the third is written by Jesse Armstrong (Peep Show, The Thick of It, Four Lions).

Over the last ten years, technology has transformed almost every aspect of our lives before we've had time to stop and question it.
In every home; on every desk; in every palm - a plasma screen; a monitor; a smartphone - a black mirror of our 21st Century existence.
Our grip on reality is shifting.
We worship at the altars of Google and Apple.
Facebook algorithms know us more intimately than our own parents.
We have access to all the information in the world, but no brain space left to absorb anything longer than a 140-character tweet.

Black Mirror is a contemporary British re-working of The Twilight Zone with stories that tap into the collective unease about our modern world.
The three stand-alone dramas are sharp, suspenseful, satirical tales with a techno-paranoia bent.
