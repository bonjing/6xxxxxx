320 kbps CD Rip - MP3 Format

First of all, Mariah is the BEST! I love her music so much that despite already having the original version of this album I bought this special Edition for 1 bonus track!

This \\\\\\\"Anniversary Mix\\\\\\\" is rare as far as I know, I have not seen this version available anywhere else.
It is a BONUS TRACK ripped from a version of Merry Christmas that was a 2005 Limited Edition only available in 7-11 Stores that I bought, which is now Out of Print. Seeing as how it\\\\\\\'s that time of year, and I have nothing else to offer the world (LOL) I decided to share it with you :)

Thanks for downloading and please seed in the holiday spirit!!!
