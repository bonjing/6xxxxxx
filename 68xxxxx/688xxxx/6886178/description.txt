                                   Flashpoint
                             +++ HDTV (XviD/MP3) +++
                              The Complete Season 4


Flashpoint is about an elite tactical unit, called the Strategic Response Unit (SRU), within a Canadian metropolitan police force (styled on the Toronto Police Emergency Task Force). The SRU are tasked to resolve extreme situations that regular officers are not trained to handle including hostage-taking, bomb threats and heavily armed criminals. Equipped with high-tech tools and a cache of weapons and explosives, members use negotiation tactics and intuition to try to avoid the use of force.


Epiosde order:

The order of episodes seems to be a kind of confusing matter â€“ so I post the link to the current episode order listed by CTV on their site at present.

The torrent consists of scene releases, so if you need subs, just use the ones for those releases (e.g. Flashpoint.S04E01.HDTV.XviD-LOL.srt) name them like the files and they load automatically when you start the file in VLC.


All files properly named.

After 24 hours initial seeding there should be enough seeders to get the whole thing with decent speed in a decent time.
