Here in flesh and blood is the famous footage taken of a startled young female Bigfoot taken in 1967. This clip shows the footage zoomed in and slowed down so as to highlight details easily missed, such as her pendulous breasts and huge powerful stride.
According to Lloyd Pye (great book \"Everything you know is wrong\"), the more mature female bigfoots have enormous breasts that they sling over their shoulders when walking, thus the \"young\" age of this one.
This clip is also available on youtube.
