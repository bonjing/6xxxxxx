Storyline:
Kent (Jason Weaver) is ready to put his playboy past behind him and marry the girl he loves- but first, he has to prove heâ€™s changed his ways for good. Convinced that â€œall men cheat,â€ Brooke (Gabrielle Dennis) hires a reputational temptress (Caryn Ward) to confirm her suspicion that Kent is incapable of fidelity. But, when the professional seductress falls for Kent, the ultimate test of loyalty becomes a fight to win his affection. Torn between the girlfriend determined to make him Mr. Perfect and the seemingly perfect woman, Kent realizes that his grass may be green enough! Also starring Carl Payne, Wendy Raquel Robinson, Nadine Ellis and Darius McCrary.
