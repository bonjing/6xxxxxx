this time,it is the Win64 version of vlc media player 1.3.0-git Beta from today :
december 13,2011.
Beware :
I up it just for test as this version does not work for me still its first build.
I still get a serious crash with vlc-cache-gen.exe during every new installation.Failed every time i try to install it .
Therefore i would like to know if you get the same problem than me with this 
new Win64 specific version.
Please,post your feedback,opinion and more about so.

For me : still failed during installation anyway :(
