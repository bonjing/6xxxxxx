[/b][/color] When the toughest, hardest swamps need to be logged, Bobby Goodson is usually on everyone???s short list.
Bobby is a third generation logger who turned to ???swamp logging??? a few years after his father???s business was burned to the ground.
Although his dad decided to retire after that incident, Bobby simply found a new way to log.
He brought the innovative technique of laying down a ???skid road??? to his home state of North Carolina after watching it done in Georgia.
???My dad couldn???t believe it, but we???d found a way to keep from sinking into the swamp and keep the land underneath in pretty good condition too."
