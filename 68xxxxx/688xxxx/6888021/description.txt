Regular Monday guest Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com joins us to go over the past weekâ€™s developments, including the EU Summit in Brussels last Friday that resulted in a near-unanimous decision to pursue further economic integration. We discuss the destruction of the EU, and how the globalists are seeking to control that destruction for their own purposes. We also talk about the new Canada-US border agreement and the prospects for Australia in their new carbon tax economy.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
