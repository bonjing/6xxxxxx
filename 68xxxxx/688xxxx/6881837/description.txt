                              The Complete Season 2


Boardwalk Empire is a period drama focusing on Enoch "Nucky" Thompson (based on the historical Enoch L. Johnson), a political figure who rose to prominence and controlled Atlantic City, New Jersey during the Prohibition period of the 1920s and 1930s. Nucky interacts with several historical figures in both his personal and political life, including mobsters, politicians, government agents, and the common folk who looked up to him. The government also takes an interest in the bootlegging and other illegal activities in the area, sending agents to investigate possible mob connections but also looking at Nucky's expensive and lavish lifestyle for a county political figure.

Like the historical Enoch L. Johnson, the Nucky of the television series is the second of three crime bosses who head the Republican machine and use racketeering and power politics to control Atlantic City. However, Terence Winter, executive producer along with Martin Scorsese, Mark Wahlberg and Tim Van Patten, has stated, "Nelson Johnson's book was really just a jumping-off point."
