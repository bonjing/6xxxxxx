This is a huge collection.
I try to find every release of every side projects of the band mates from Death From Above 1979.


It includes all music from DFA1979 (minus Blood On Hands Radio Mix and Black History Month (Alan Braxe & Fred Falke Remix Instrumental)) (original download from "amanwithidolmind") [PS. I have the vinyl for the Radio Mix but don't have good equips to rip, sorry][The rips from You're A Woman is mine, the both, normal and UK Bonus]
Many videos, plus some videos from the first show at Brazil in UMF with Iggor Cavalera as special guest in Romantic Rights (not so good, he don't know the music).
More pics than the original too!


Black Cat #13 if not all, almost all music from them. (I Blast Off i try to rip from my vinyl, but is a f*** poor quality as i don't have the rights equips)


MSTRKRFT - I don't give much attention to it, but i guess is a complete collection.


Femme Fatale - all 3 discs.


Standing 8 (I guess is where Jesse take the "This Robot Kills" in her Juno-6).


Sebastien Grainger (I downloaded the original torrent from "amanwithidolmind" and make some changes and added some musics. Thank you so much for the effort, but i miss two photos that came corrupt from a single).

Bad Tits with a video from Bangkok Hilton and STEMS from it.


All downloaded from various sites from internet, sorry if i forget to mention someone.
