Project Indu Mezu devoted himself to experimental industrial since 1997. Starting with a tape collages, in 2004 he turned to digital research. The style and tone change from album to album, while maintaining a constant thirst for novelty.

The album is a wild jumble of sounds, glitches, some twists and mikromelodies. Bubbling and gurgling rhythm is turning to stright booming and then almost disappears, and it can only be traced by following the internal pulsation. Technically, it\\\'s a half collage material that is the hallmark of Indu Mezu today. The set of samples is cut from hours, days and months of experimental raw neatly carved, polished, rewritten and assembled into mosaic monstrous monolith. By the way, this music can not be called experimental any more. All experiments have been conducted previously, Dark Clowd is the consolidation and implementation of techniques and technologies. It\\\'s all precise, everything is on it\\\'s place and meets the goal.
The material was recorded in 2010, but includes some earlier unpublished tracks. For example, LField, recorded in 2006 for a special project of Lagunamuch Community, transformed into a v/a Main Control Board.
