Synopsis : Total Uninstall - Uninstall any program with the most advanced
uninstaller software. Total Uninstall accurate analyzes installed programs to 
uninstall them completely.

My Personal Opinion: I have tried almost all uninstallers out there and I can
honestly say.. this is the best.. especially if you're into making Portable
Applications or you like to keep your computer clean of trash... which is very
hard with installations. Most software manufacturers do a shitty job with their
uninstallers. All they care about is that you install their product. The worst
uninstaller i have ever used is 'Your Uninstaller! Pro'. Stay away from that
crap. All it does is uninstall, lol. It doesn't use snapshots. It's a rip off.

How to Install           : Execute, launch 'TotalUninstallPortable.exe'.

Notes                    : Unlike other versions that claim to work but do not
when you block the Internet, this really works! 

Activation               : 
1. Install to 'PortableApp' directory or your designated directory.
2. Launch 'TotalUninstallPortable.exe'.
3. Disconnect Internet or Block 'Tu.exe' & 'TuAgent.exe' with Firewall.
4. Register with provided Name & Serial.
5. Complete.. this is a 1-time activation.

Crack Warning            :
I am using ESET Smart Security 5 and if i have 'Potentially Unsafe Apps.'
checked.. i get a warning. It's completely safe. I personally use this. With
most 'cracks' / 'keygens', Anti-Viruses will falsely identify as 'Malware'.
* If you are unsure.. just don't use it :)

Upgrading from Older Version?
If you're using an old version.. all you do is install this and import all of
your saved snapshots via 'Import': http://www.martau.com/tu_bk_compat.php
