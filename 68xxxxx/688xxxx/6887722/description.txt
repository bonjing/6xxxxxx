The multi award-winning Inbetweeners return â€“ in this critically-acclaimed film

Will (Simon Bird), Simon (Joe Thomas), Jay (James Buckley) and Neil (Blake Harrison), have finished school forever, and are off on their first lads holiday. Theyâ€˜re looking forward to two weeks in Malia with no parents, no teachers and little chance with the ladies.

From disastrous holiday accommodation, to Simonâ€™s heartache, to Neilâ€™s spectacular dancing, to Jay falling asleep in an ants nest, itâ€™s a real coming-of-age film â€“ where 4 boys become menâ€¦ or at least try to. And with the chance for holiday romance the boys pull out all the stops!
