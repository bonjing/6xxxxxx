 How the Grinch Stole Christmas: Every Who down in Whoville liked Christmas   
 lot. And every family likes How the Grinch Stole Christmas! a lot! This    
 joyous, heart-tickling holiday event based on Dr. Seuss beloved book and   
 featuring the voice of Boris Karloff has delighted all ages since its 1966  
 debut. Can the Grinch steal the towns holiday spirit by stealing their     
 holiday treats? Or does Christmas... perhaps...mean a little bit more?      
 The answers to those questions unfold charmingly under Chuck Jones         
 pitch-perfect direction.                                                    
                                                                             
 The Grinch Grinches The Cat in the Hat: What happens when the mischievous

 ever-so-delightful Cat in the Hat stands in his way?                        
 The result is a triumphant story of an unlikely hero who uses a little      
 caring and compassion to help save the world from an unfriendly and         
 unbeautiful future. Watch and see if the Cat in the Hat can go              
 from a peaceful picnic in the shade to helping the frightfully              
 mean Grinch turn a new leaf.
