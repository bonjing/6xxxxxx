Thanks :D :D"
rformed. My PC is running Vistax32 Home Prem. 

I install, overwrite the program directory with the cracks and then run. Under HELP/ABOUT the popup window states registration to Vista Account Name on the PC and all works OK. After allowing a update the ABOUT popup window now states unregistered and doesn't allow driver downloads. 

You must recopy the crack drivergenius.exe to after an update to restore the registration, and keep the database updates for the drivers. It looks like the developers for Driver Genius have improved security a bit, other torrents note that serial numbers become blacklisted quicker and other cracks experience a similar problem.

Great work scene4all, thanks for the crack. "
