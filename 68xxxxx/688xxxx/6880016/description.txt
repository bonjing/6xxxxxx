    A ruthless crook abducts the wife and child of a bank manager and        
    then masquerades as an insurance company detective while scheming to     
    rob the institution in this crime drama. Unfortunately, some of the      
    manager's employees learn about the plot and the terrified manager       
    must beg them to remain silent. Fortunately, the cops have been on       
    the case all along.
