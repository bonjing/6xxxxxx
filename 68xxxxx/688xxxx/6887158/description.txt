More Than Nine Lives, the second release from Industry 8 is a specially priced two disc
 compilation. All profits are to benefit PAWS (Philadelphia Animal Wellness Society), the
 only no-kill shelter in Philadelphia. Curated by Dean Troxell and Joe Scott, the dark music
 experts from Philadelphia's Digital Ferret Music Store, the compilation is a showcase of
 some of the most exciting artists in post punk, minimal wave, experimental, rhythmic noise
 and death rock. The 36 tracks spanning the two discs bring exclusive tracks from established
 genre leaders like darkwave icons Black Tape for A Blue Girl to artists who make their cd
 debut such as the experimental Blood Rhythm. Ambitious in its selection and scope but
 unified in theme and vitality, More Than Nine Lives is a glimpse at what is at the forefront
 of the dark music genres in 2011. Whether you enjoy this compilation for the music or the
 cause, remember it's limited to 500 copies and has undeniably endearing cover artwork from
 Mike Wohlberg
