This book provides seven principles that will radically change the way that you live your life. It gives you specific wisdom of how to go from just living a mediocre life to finally living a life that you've only dreamed of. Here's what two of John Di Lemme's students have to say about this book...

"John's teachings radically transformed my life when I was at a point of giving up. It scares me to even think about where I would be today if it wasn't for John and his team. As one of John's elite coaching students, I have no only changed my life, but I have also radically exploded my business in a so-called poor economy. Today, I am a fired-up, laser-focused champion! I am excited about life and what God has in store for me." - Bev Ervin, Florida 

"When I first met John in 2008, I was slowly killing myself by allowing my weight to soar to over 300 pounds. My obesity brought on diabetes, hypertension, and sleep apnea. I was plagued with an essential tremor and full of excuses of why I was not accomplishing my desired results in life. I was only 65 years old at the time, but I knew that I wouldn't last much longer if I didn't make a change. Today, I have shed over 125 pounds and gained a new respect for life. As I hold my beautiful granddaughter, Jewel, I can confidently say that I am eternally grateful for John's coaching that saved my life and taught me how to live again." - Dr. Benny McDaniel, Tennessee
