Go Ask Alice is an honest portrayal of the life of a drug addict. Originally published in 1971, the book provides an empathetic description of one 15-year-old girl\'s descent into a life of drugs that still resonates in today\'s teen culture. The book\'s strength lies in the breadth of the first-person account, from her early days as an innocent youth who\'s main worries were popularity and image to her life on the street, where the only thing she worried about was where she would get her next fix. It also details her difficult, uphill battle back to sobriety.

This isn\'t a fairytale story about the heroine overcoming one obstacle to triumph in the end. Although the book is fictional, Go Ask Alice \'s heroine faces real problems as she falters, regresses and constantly struggles against her problems.
