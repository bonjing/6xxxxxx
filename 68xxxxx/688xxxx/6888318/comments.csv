I disagree. It's idiocy to ever expect *any* keygen to be clean.

Do what I did (and mentioned in the description of this upload): use a Windows VM with a clean snapshot, copy the keygen into it, disconnect its network adapter, get the serial number and revert the VM to the snapshot. Presto: you get a working serial number and both your main machine and VM are clean. I do this for every keygen I run. If you're especially paranoid, do this in a VM without e.g. VMware Tools, to reduce the possibility that the keygen can communicate with the host system in any way.

The only criterion that matters in judging a keygen is whether it produces working serial numbers; you only need to run it once to get what you need. It isn't like a cracked copy of a game executable that you'll need to run repeatedly on an OS install that you care about."
