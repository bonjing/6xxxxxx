and again now for Mac users :

This is a new beta build of vlc media player 1.2.0-pre3 for Mac Intel OSx 32 bit from today : December 13,2011.
Note :
1.1-branch-intel is the latest VLC snapshot of the stable branch (32 bit)
However as it is still as beta stage and not official,might crash/fail in certain circumstances so.
Use only at you own risk and delivered such "as is"
for personal testing purpose then !
require Mac OS X 10.6 or later

Comment,feedback,opinion and more are still welcome then.

Enjoy and regards
