[/b][/color] Rick Castle is one of the world's most successful crime authors.
But when his rock star lifestyle isn't enough, this bad boy goes looking for new trouble and finds it working with smart, beautiful Detective Kate Beckett.
Inspired by her professional record and intrigued by her buttoned-up personality, Castle's found the model for his bold new character whether she likes it or not.
Now with the mayor's permission, Castle is on her case and in her way.
Kate's initial disdain for Castle turns to grudging respect as he quickly proves that a background in plotting murders can be a valuable asset in catching killers.
As they solve a new crime together each week, their partnership grows as does their love-hate relationship.
These two may not always see eye to eye, but together they might just write a whole new chapter in crime-solving.
