,uYkam,2012-05-18T05:38Z,Thanks you very much! Works well at my PSP ^^
and put it in my iso folder but when i try to start the game the screen flashes red. Then it's followed by a black screen and nothing happens. I can still press home and exit but I can't play the game. What's happening? I can play other games just fine."
