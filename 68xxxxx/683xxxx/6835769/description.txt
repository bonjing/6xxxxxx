Hello everyone! This is my very first upload from, "The Pirate Bay". This torrent includes, "xUbuntu 11.10 Desktop i386.iso" This file is clean, no hacks, cracks, or anything. I downloaded this to a website called, "xUbuntu" (That's where I got it from) To download this file, you need to have a program that would let you download torrents, like uTorrent or bitTorrent. So, please seed and comment me if there is any problems with this file. I will fix it. Also, make sure you read the system requirements from the website, "xUbuntu.org" (Don't include the quotation marks when you enter the website name.) If you can't find it, I will tell you right now:

xUbuntu 11.10 System Requirements:

You need 256 MB RAM to run the Live CD or 256 MB RAM to install. The Alternate Install CD only requires you to have 64 MB RAM at install time.

To install xUbuntu with the standard installer (Ubiquity), you need 4.4 GB of free space on your hard disk. The Alternate Install CD only requires you to have 2 GB of free space on your hard disk.

Once installed, xUbuntu can run with starting from 256 (or even just 192) MB RAM, but it is strongly recommended to have at least 512 MB RAM.

So, enjoy it and seed! Thanks.
