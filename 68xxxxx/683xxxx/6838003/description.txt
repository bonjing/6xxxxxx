The California-Yucatan Railroad, being built for the good of Mexico, is under siege by a gang of 
terrorists hoping to force its sale; no one can prove their connection to profiteer Marsden. 
Manuel Vega, aged co-owner, calls in the aid of his nephew James, great-grandson of the original 
Zorro. Alas, James seems more adept at golf than derring-do; but after he arrives, Zorro rides 
again! Can one black-clad man on horseback defeat a gang supplied with airplanes and machine guns?

Hammond, owner of the town's stagecoach line and a leading citizen, is opposed to Idaho becoming a 
state, and kills Randolph Meredith, owner of the town's newspaper, for endorsing it. Meredith's 
sister Barbara, expert with a bullwhip and pistol, dons a black costume and mask and becomes 
"The Black Whip", dealing a blow to Hammond and his gang each time they perform some heinous act in 
their efforts to keep the town, and their power over it, unchanged. Aided by government agent Vic 
Gordon, Barbara confronts Hammond in a final showdown just as the town votes on whether or not to 
accept statehood.
