A nice production from the Knowledge Products Series with true Scottish
actors used - as Adam Smith was himself a Scot as was David Hume by the way.

"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker,
that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. 
We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, a
and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages"

This is the fundamental tenet underlying the philosophies of Adam Smith
and his view of all that is involved in the functioning of any economic model.

I think this view has some real merit in what has to be considered the
truth. However it is far from the whole truth as we also strive for our
families and therefore our communities and in this regard we do cater to
some notions of self interest that go far above just the basest needs of
mere survival as living things and instead as specifically human beings in
the full command of their faculties.

And it is only such thinking that will yield the best results in making
decisions over an economy such as setting price floors and ceilings
if need be and the same for wages and in allocating resources which are scarce
to those that have real merit and the factors of production to only those we 
should trust and be prepared to abdicate to in case of need in the case of war, 
insurrection or what have you.

So yes he is correct it is self interest that rules, however benevolence must
not be missing or it is not a state that the best folks will choose to consider
their own until such time as it could be better constituted to allow for such a
disposition without being imprudent in the least and on the contrary altogether
with the righter notions of merit in our midst.
