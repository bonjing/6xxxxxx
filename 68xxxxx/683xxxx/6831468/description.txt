-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Namgyal Yeshi currently resides in New York where he is also an active member 
of the Tibetan Youth Congress of NY & NJ. He was introduced to the lyrical power 
of Rap by Adam Yauch of the Beastie Boys. Born in the Kham region of Tibet, 
Namgyal happily reminisces on his childhood, growing up within a traditional 
nomadic family. At the same time, he recounts the presence of the heavy Chinese 
influence and iron-fisted rule in Tibet. The inspiration for his Rap tracks come 
from the prospect of an independent Tibet with justice restored. His tracks 
lyrically illustrate the injustice the Tibetan people endure on a daily basis 
under Chinese rule. The catchy instrumentals and Rap verses become Rap pleas that 
serve as a haunting reminder of the endangered Tibetan culture and population. 
It is then that it becomes clear that Namgyal\\\\\\\'s ultimate message to his audience 
is to stand together for Tibet.
