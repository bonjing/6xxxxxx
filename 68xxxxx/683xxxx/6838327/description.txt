This was a project that I decided to take on once I realized my coffee table book, "The Top 100 Canadian Albums" by Bob Mersereau was sending me subtle messages (well ok, not really) that I should put together a compilation that includes all 100 albums. It's also, after some searching, that there's no real Canadian compilation out there on torrent network. Lots of UK ones to be found, American ones, Rolling Stone, etc but nothing Canadian. So I took it upon myself to throw this together and after 3 months it's finally been completed. First off I would like to thank all the uploaders that helped make this possible for the albums I don't have. There's too many to name so a big THANK YOU to all. 

I realize this is a huge 28.2 GB file and was thinking about splitting it in half or in thirds but I have a few other 20+ GB torrents and after 3 years they are trading well although probably not the most efficiently. So just be patient for the download - I know it's going to take some time.

Most of all Enjoy!

Kit



-Audiochecker logs included for rips that are not mine.

-Some albums include artwork.

- K-os - Joyful Rebellion ripped using burst mode due to a scuffed disc. I do not hear any audible skips or distortions so will leave it in the torrent but it's not exactly the rip I wanted.

- Steppenwolf 1968 is a MFSL rip.

- The Guess Who - Wheatfield Soul was ripped from a 2 album-combination CD that included Artificial Paradise. The EAC log will reflect this as I have only included Wheatfield Soul.

- The Band - Music From Big Pink includes bonus tracks that the EAC log reflects and are not included.

- A few were double Cd's that included 2 albums from a band so obviously just included the one that made the list. The EAC log file might reflect this.

- Remasters include (that are labeled as a Remaster):

Neil Young - Harvest
The Band - Music From The Big Pink
The Band - The Band
Rush - Moving Pictures
Leonard Cohen - Songs of Leonard Cohen
Neil Young - Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere
Leonard Cohen - Songs Of love And Hate
Neil Young - On The Beach
The Guess Who - Best Of
The Band - The Last Waltz
Oscar Peterson Trio - Night Train
Willie P. Bennett - Hobo's Taunt







The Top 100 Canadian Albums 2007





From Wiki:


The Top 100 Canadian Albums is a book by Bob Mersereau, published in 2007 by Goose Lane Editions.

Mersereau acknowledged that the list will cause heated debate among music fans across the country. "The important part is to talk about Canadian music and enjoy it", he said. "I'd be shocked if there wasn't complaints and arguments and debates."

Mersereau surveyed 600 music journalists, retailers, musicians and disc jockeys of all ages, from all parts of Canada. They each submitted a list of 10 favourite Canadian albums released between 1957 and 2007.



Criticism

A review from the National Post by Mark Medley identifies regional and genre biases in the book. â€œWhile any list of "Top 100" anything is sure to ignite some controversy, there are definitely some glaring omissions from journalist Bob Mersereau's new book.â€ He lists 10 albums he considers to be amongst these glaring omissions. Four of these albums are from British Columbia artists. One of these was The New Pornographersâ€™ Mass Romantic. â€œTo completely leave off Carl Newman, Neko Case et al. is plain wrong. I'm grouping in Stars' 2004 album Set Yourself on Fire in with this.â€ Medley also noted the omission of BC band The Grapes of Wrath's album Now and Again. â€œThis album cracked the top 50 in Chart Magazine's 1996 and 2000 top 50 Canadian albums polls.â€ He also notes the under representation of hip hop artists, and lists Maestro Fresh Wesâ€™ Symphony in Effect and Dream Warriors' And Now the Legacy Begins as two of his omissions
