Well, the wait is over.  Universal Music has revealed the complete details for the November 21 reissue of the Rolling Stonesâ€™ 1978 Some Girls across multiple formats.  Following in the footsteps of last yearâ€™s Exile on Main Street set, Some Girls will offer a number of previously-unreleased songs, recently completed by the Stones, as Jagger told German network ZDF last month: that â€œIâ€™ve just been in the studio finishing some outtakes from 1978 â€¦ Theyâ€™re going to be released [on] a rerelease of Some Girls.  So these are going to be some 10 extra tracks from that time [that] were never released.
No doubt collectors and casual fans alike will be anxious to revisit Some Girls.  The chart-topping album remains the bandâ€™s biggest-selling album in the United States, and was the Rolling Stonesâ€™ first to feature Ronnie Wood as a full member of the band line-up.  Itâ€™s a more accessible album than Exile, and includes the classics â€œBeast of Burdenâ€ and â€œMiss Youâ€ as well as fan favorite â€œShatteredâ€ and even a raw, greasy Motown cover of The Temptationsâ€™ â€œJust My Imagination (Running Away with Me).â€ 
November 21 is the date to mark for Some Girls in all its various incarnations.
