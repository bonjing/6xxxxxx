Thus, it is pressing to envisage the extent of the diabetes problem and ensure synergistic approaches aiming in alleviation of its ghastly toll. The chapters of this book report cutting-edge research on molecular events in adiposity and type 2 diabetes, thus opening the way for innovative drug-based therapeutic strategies. It addresses all those who wish to keep in touch with recent developments in the field.
