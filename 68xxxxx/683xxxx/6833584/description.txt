If you download this torrent you commit yourself to seeding for at least two days. Not too much I think. Otherwise you are just an egoistic parasite who does not care for other people violating the idea behind this wonderful feature.

After more than 150 uploads I think I may ask this. Less than 3% are willing to share for more than a day. I know I speak for a lot of people who - just like me - hate it, to keep uploading for just a greedy bunch. I hope you think higher of yourself.

Enjoy,
