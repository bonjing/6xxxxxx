The only version I've been able to find of this book has been ripped from tapes, with horrible audio quality and large chunks missing making it painful to listen to and hard to follow.
This is a new rip, from 9 CDs.  The 4th disc is scratched and there's a bit of odd noise at the start of that track, but otherwise the quality is good.

This is the 6th book in the Discworld series.
It's read by Celia Imrie (with Nigel Planer as DEATH).
Complete and unabridged.
