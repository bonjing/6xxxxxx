The espionage thriller begins in 1997, as shocking news reaches retired Mossad secret
agents Rachel (Helen Mirren) and Stefan (Tom Wilkinson) about their former colleague
David (CiarÃ¡n Hinds). All three have been venerated for decades by their country because
of the mission that they undertook back in 1966, when the trio (portrayed, respectively,
by Jessica Chastain, Marton Csokas, and Sam Worthington) tracked down Nazi war criminal Vogel
(Jesper Christensen) in East Berlin. At great risk, and at considerable personal cost, the
team's mission was accomplished - or was it? The suspense builds in and across two different
time periods, with startling action and surprising revelations.
