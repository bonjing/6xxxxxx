How.I.Met.Your.Mother.S07E11.The.Rebound.Girl.480p.WEB-DL.x264-mSD [MKV 118MB]

[/b][/color] How I Met Your Mother is a comedy about Ted and how he fell in love.
It all started when Ted's best friend, Marshall, dropped the bombshell that he was going to propose to his longtime girlfriend, Lily, a kindergarten teacher.
At that moment, Ted realized that he had better get a move on if he, too, hopes to find true love.
Helping him in his quest is his friend Barney, a confirmed bachelor with endless, sometimes outrageous opinions, a penchant for suits and a foolproof way to meet women.
When Ted meets Robin, he's sure it's love at first sight, but destiny has something else in store.
