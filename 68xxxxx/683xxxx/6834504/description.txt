A Sample of Verses 

The Gopi-gita (SB 10.31.1-19 &10.32.1-2)

jayati te 'dhikam janmana vrajah
?srayata indira sasvad atra hi ?
dayita drisyatam dikshu tavakas
?tvayi dhritasavas tvam vicinvate (1)

The Gopis said: â€œO beloved, your birth in the land of Vraja has made it exceedingly
glorious, and thus Indira, the goddess of fortune, always resides here. It is only for
Your sake that we, who are yours, maintain our lives. We have been searching
everywhere for you, so please show yourself to us.â€

vara-da nighnato neha kim vadhah (2)
SB 10.31.2/Gopi-gita 2/BRS 3.5.29

O Lord of love, in beauty Your glance excels the whorl of the finest, most per-
fectly formed lotus within the autumn pond. (And where did You get this beauty?
You have expertly stolen it from the lotus. At first You have stolen our hearts with
Your glance but then You disappeared). O bestower of benedictions, You are
killing Your maidservants who have given themselves to You freely, without any
price. IsnÃ¢Â€â„¢t this murder?


visha-jalapyayad vyala-rakshasad?
varsha-marutad vaidyutanalat?
vrisha-mayatmajad visvato bhayad?
rishabha te vayam rakshita muhuh (3)

O greatest of personalities, You have repeatedly saved us from all kinds of dan-
gerâ€”from poisoned water, from the terrible man-eater Agha, from the great rains,
from the wind demon, from the fiery thunderbolt of Indra, from the bull demon
and from the son of Maya Danava.
