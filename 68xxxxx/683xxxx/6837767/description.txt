REMEMBER!

1. All FASM releases were done by THE PEOPLE for THE PEOPLE, so if you think they
   are worthy share them anywhere you want, but if you like the movie, show your
   gratitude to the creators by going to cinema or buying Bluray/DVD!
_________________________________________________________________________________
2. UNFINISHED/SAMPLE movies HAVE synchro problems, full movies DON`T. This is the
   nature of highly compressed content. The QUALITY of the display depends ALSO
   from the PLAYER you use. There are some buggy players which display those
   movies at the significant worse quality!! If you have any problems with your
   video player check "Instruction for fixing your player problems" folder.
_________________________________________________________________________________
3. Please COMMENT my work ONLY if you have actually seen it. If you LIKED this
   release - tell others about it. If you didnt, leave a comment saying  why, so
   I can learn from your opinions and provide you with something better in the
   future. Everything here has been done with the reason, so if you do not
   understand something dont assume its done bad. Of course we also make mistakes
   so any observation is welcome.

4. I have found that XBox360 can play stereo AAC directly and 5.1 through WINDOWS
   media center extender. For more info read this forum: 
  
_________________________________________________________________________________
5. WDTV devices are causing so much problems with AAC. I am not sure is this
   also the case with this release, so its better for me to give you straight link
   to the discussion regarding this: http://wdtvhd.com/index.php?showtopic=23287
_________________________________________________________________________________
6. Movies can be directly streamed through WWW using Adobe Flash Player 9 or new.
_________________________________________________________________________________
7. FASM Quality Enhancer Bitrate Squeezer is h264 compression method optimized
   directly for lowbitrate HD contents. It is constantly being improved,  each
   revision brings quality to a new level. Its efficiency over standard x264
   encoding is explained by the same reason as XVID encodes are better than DIVX3
_________________________________________________________________________________
8. Any subtitles made for different releases, but taken from the same source
   (Bluray) should also work with this release. If you are looking for them visit
   http://subscene.com/
_________________________________________________________________________________
9. AAC sound must be decompressed and send through HDMI or SPDIF as PCM. Please
   also note that if you do have video card with HDMI that means you do have two
   different sound cards. Please make sure you do send the sound to the correct
   one. Its quite different from AC3/DTS where you send compressed sound directly
   from the source.

10.PS3 with Custom firmware does not have Cinavia protection. In case of Cinavia
   protected sound on the BluRay, it will be muted after 20m on official firmware
   Not all movies have this protection though...
_________________________________________________________________________________
11.FASM 540p releases have display resolution 960x540 and have SEMISTEREO sound.
   They are targeted for modern smartphones and IPAD, so they have the resolution 
   close to their native screen resolution and are very small to fit into those 
   devices memory. We can find also some reason for people who are looking ultra 
   small size encodes. For most movies the target range is somewhere around 400MB 
   but the quality will be  better than you expect it to be at this size...
_________________________________________________________________________________
12.FASM 720p releases  have display resolution 1280x720 and have special HRTF 
   transcoded STEREO sound converted from 5.1 BluRaysource. Just imagine the file 
   which is small enough, have great quality, which you can play on multiple 
   devices from smartphones to large TVs directly, without the need to using some
   special converting software. If you can imagine that you have the idea of 
   whats offering you FASM 720p RIP.
_________________________________________________________________________________
13.FASM 1080p releases  have display resolution 1920x1080 and have 5.1 AAC sound.
   Their size may vary but they are always smaller than 4GiB.The idea behind this 
   is to be able to store them on FAT32 formatted pendrives, hard disk, because 
   some devices like PS3 dont recognise other file formats.
