Parabelle's 3 albums so far. The vocalist of Parabelle is from the orginal Evan's Blue, and much of the sound and style of Kevin Matisyn's Evans Blue carries over. Parabelle was a side band of Kevin Matisyn while he was in EB, after he was kicked out of EB Parabelle became his only band. So if you like Evan's Blue, then you'll like Parabelle.
