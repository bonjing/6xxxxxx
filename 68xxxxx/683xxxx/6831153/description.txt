[/b][/color] "Allen Gregory" is an animated series that tells the story of one of the most pretentious 7-year-olds of our time.
When he looks in the mirror, Allen Gregory De Longpre doesn't see a child.
He sees a young man who is intelligent, sophisticated, worldly, artistic and romantic???characteristics he inherited from his doting father, Richard.
The pair share an extraordinary father-son bond???a bond that is sometimes annoyingly interrupted by Richard's life partner, Jeremy, for whom Allen Gregory has minimal respect, if any at all.

They live together in a stunning architectural loft, along with Julie, Allen Gregory's adopted Cambodian sister.
Although Allen Gregory has allegedly composed operas, written novels and dated Chloe Sevigny, he's about to embark on his greatest challenge yet: leaving the safety of his father's homeschooling and attending elementary school with children his own age.

His journey will be a struggle, not only with the other kids at school, but with the faculty as well.
Whether it's the all-out rivalry with Gina Winthrop, his by-the-book second grade teacher; his unique relationship with Judith Gottlieb, his 68-year-old principal; or his desperate desire to be best friends with Joel Zadak, the school's popular stud, Allen Gregory has his work cut out for him.
With the help of his trusty friend and assistant, Patrick Vanderweel; and the support of Superintendent Stewart Rossmyre, who believes the De Longpres are a tremendous asset to the school, Allen Gregory won't have to get his hands too dirty.

"Allen Gregory" is about an outsider.
And while he may put on a tough exterior, deep down, all Allen Gregory wants is to fit in.
Well, that, and for Julie to run away and never be seen or heard from again.
And Jeremy too.
