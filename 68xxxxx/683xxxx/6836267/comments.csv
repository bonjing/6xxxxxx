pload speed depends on the activity your connection was having at the time, but 100 kb/s is considered good (mine is 40 kb/s -_-), if you want to upload bigger torrents you might want to conduct a speed test ot ask at ""Yahoo Answers""on how to maximize your upload (and even download) speed ... sorry but I've never uploaded a torrent before. So, I can't help alot in this field but I'm sure others might benefit you more than me ... Thanks"
