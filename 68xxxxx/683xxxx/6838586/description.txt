  Joe Crowley has been travelling up and down the UK looking at some    
  of the nation's most dangerous roads and asking if there is more      
  that can be done to make these routes safer for those who use them.   
                                                                        
  Joe is in Kent to see a stretch of the A262 that is a risk to both    
  drivers and pedestrians alike. He meets the mother of a police        
  officer killed at a notorious junction as she travelled to work,      
  hears the many stories of local residents, and gets the assessment    
  of an independent road safety expert, before putting all these        
  concerns to the county council.                                       
                                                                        
  Also on the show, we travel to Warwickshire and see what was          
  previously a notoriously dangerous stretch of the A45, we meet a      
  young mother who, following the death of her husband on the road,     
  campaigned for years until changes were made and Joe visits the       
  Transport Research Laboratory to find out the impact of mobile        
  phones on drivers' concentration.
