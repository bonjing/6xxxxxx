Part of the BBC's All America Season, Rich Hallâ€™s Continental Drifters (BBC Four) saw the curmudgeonly comedian ride through the history and symbolism of that great US institution: the road movie. This was a treat, not just for fans of Hallâ€™s relentless acerbity, but because the genre boasts some enduring classics: Paris, Texas and Badlands are among the all-time great films.
Driving through those badlands of South Dakota to the mountains of Montana, Hall stripped down the genreâ€™s appeal. â€œA true road movie is about escape from oppression: itâ€™s a literal portrayal of rebellion.â€ A prime example, he said, would be Thelma & Louise, because people could identify with that rebellion. Punctuating his witty observations were film clips, interviews with historians and shots of the spacious vistas so integral to road movies.
The best part of the 90-minute documentary came when Hall, defending the reputation of muscle cars, unleashed an unexpected diatribe against Jeremy Clarkson, whom he called the â€œill-informed and overhyped god of all things automotiveâ€. â€œHeâ€™ll tell you that [a muscle car] canâ€™t compare to a Ferrari,â€ he ranted. â€œBut comparing a muscle car to a Ferrari is like comparing Jeremy Clarkson to a real television host. If this car was a woman itâ€™d be Elizabeth Taylor. If Jeremy Clarkson were a woman, I wouldnâ€™t be a goddamn bit surprised.â€
