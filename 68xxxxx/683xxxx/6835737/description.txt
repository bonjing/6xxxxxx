  A powerful, provocative series from celebrated filmmaker Adam         
  Curtis, which argues that humans have unwittingly been colonised by   
  machines.                                                             
                                                                        
  A series of films exploring the idea that we have been colonised by   
  the machines that we have built, seeing everything in the world       
  today through the eyes of computers.                                  
                                                                        
  Episode Three: The Monkey in the Machine and the Machine in the       
  Monkey                                                                
                                                                        
  This film argues that because our political dreams seem to have       
  failed, we have retreated into machine-fantasies that say we have no  
  control over our actions, to excuse our failure. At its heart is one  
  of the most famous scientists in the world, Bill Hamilton, who        
  argued that human behaviour is really guided by codes buried deep     
  within us. This was later popularised by Richard Dawkins as "the      
  selfish gene" and said that individual human beings are really just   
  machines whose only job is to make sure the codes are passed on. The  
  episode begins in 2000 in the jungles of the Congo and Rwanda.        
                                                                        
  Hamilton is there to help prove his dark theories. But all around     
  him the Congo is being torn apart by "Africas First World War". The  
  film interweaves the two stories  the strange roots of Hamiltons    
  theories, and the history of the Wests tortured relationship with    
  the Congo over the past 100 years.
