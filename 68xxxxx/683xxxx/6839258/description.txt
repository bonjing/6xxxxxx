Here's a zombie book I just wrote that's yours for the taking! 

It's the first of a trilogy and I'm really interested in what you may think about it. It's a bit "edgy" so this isn't for the timid or easily offended. 

If you like it, I would really appreciate it if you could find the time to leave a good review on either my kindle or nook listing. Just search for "Z Strain" or "Rutger Klamor", and I'm sure you'll find it. 

Naturally, no obligation. Just enjoy! Finally, a book written by a die-hard zombie fan for die-hard zombie fans!

Thanks a lot,

Rutger 

ps: this is a correction to my first upload "Z Strain" because I think I may have messed something up. Please forgive me and give it another go!
