The X-Men anime is written by famed English comic book writer/creator Warren Ellis, and borrows story elements from famed Scottish comic book writer Grant Morrisonâ€™s early 2000s story arch for New X-Men, as well as Joss Whedonâ€™s mid-2000s run on Astonishing X-Men.

As Hisako starts training to use her powers, she finds herself at odds with Cyclops who still does not trust Emma and shows a dislike to Xavier recruiting her as part of the X-Men. As the other X-Men discuss the possibility of Mastermind having a hand in Jean's death, Cyclops pits Hisako in a real battle against him, pushing her to go berserk with her powers so she can take control of it. Noticing Hisako lacking self-confidence, Emma agrees to have Xavier read her mind, revealing her childhood and her affiliation with the Inner Circle and 
her reason for leaving, also proving she was not involved with the battle with Jean. As a result, Cyclops apologises to Emma while Hisako strives to learn from her mistakes. As the X-Men prepare to leave for Tohoku with the vaccines, Emma questions Xavier about a woman named Yui Sasaki which she saw when their minds were linked.
