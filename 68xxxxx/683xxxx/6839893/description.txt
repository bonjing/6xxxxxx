CÃ©line Marie Claudette Dion, born March 30, 1968), is a Canadian singer. Born to a large family from Charlemagne, Quebec, Dion emerged as a teen star in the French-speaking world after her manager and future husband RenÃ© AngÃ©lil mortgaged his home to finance her first record. In 1990, she released the
English-language album Unison, establishing herself as a viable pop artist in North America and other English-speaking areas of the world.
