Spraff

Having performed live to over 1.2m people,
the UK's hardest working comedian Jimmy Carr,
is back with his brand new stand-up DVD

Star of hit TV shows 8 Out of 10 Cats and 10
O'clock Live, Jimmy is well known for his slick
one liners and non-stop gags, but his acerbic wit
and fast-paced comedy style are at their brilliant
best when he has the stage to himself

Packed with over 100 minutes of brand new material,
including too-rude-for-TV jokes, hilarious heckling,
and even better put-downs, Jimmy pushes the boundaries
of comedy and delivers a spectacular show

Notes

The previous release Jimmy.Carr.Being.Funny.DVDRip.XviD-HAGGiS
had, for some unknown reason, the first 10mins repeated at the
end of the show (after the credits). Not only that, this part
was out of sync. We're honestly not sure how it happened, so
we will put it down to laughing too much at all the recent standup
