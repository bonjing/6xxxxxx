joepic9 has done a fantastic job, and even though it's easy to subscribe to GBTV today and get everything online right away, it's good to be able to download certain segments or other programs on your computer to share with others. 

Conservatives have a long history of using alternative/non mainstream media, and Piratebay fits nicely in with that segment of the population. I used to copy VHS tapes of patriotic or conservative material back in the 90's to all my conservative friends, because none of it was available on ""PBS"" or other mainstream media. 

But all this is soon a thing of the past as the internet has taken over all forms of control and brainwashing away from the government. The fact that Glenn Beck can launch his own TV show on his own network on the internet is a sign of times to come. "
