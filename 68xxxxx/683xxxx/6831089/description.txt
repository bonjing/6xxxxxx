The Truth Behind: The Ark
It's perhaps one of the greatest biblical tales. The story of Noah's Ark. In a one hour investigation for the National Geographic Channel - The Truth Behind... Noah's Ark divides fact from fiction. Exploring Durupinar, the site in Eastern Turkey that many believe is where the Ark came to rest; we put religious faith and science head to head. Using CGI, extraordinary experiments and personal accounts from both Ark supporters and non-believers, the film explores just how plausible this biblical epic really is? It is perhaps the best-known story in the Bible: A righteous man named Noah, who built an ark and survived a flood. But what happened - or didn't happen - to Noah is raising questions: in geology, in astronomy, even in global imaging. And they start with the most basic question of all: did it really happen?
