"Sketches" contains demo versions of the songs from Ane Brun's latest studio album "Changing of the seasons". The songs are mostly performed with voice and guitar or voice and piano.

"Sketches" also presents two new tracks, "Miss Moaning" and "My baby's Arms". Both favorites of Ane's, but they did't fit the context of the album "Changing of the Seasons".
