Once in a while i have to re-examine my top 1000 to make room for new ones. This is hard. Especially when there are already 1071 in there. So I re-listened IQ, maybe I could shift it to the next 1000 (or worse). So I listened and listened the whole record and I could not find a weak track. So its still there and I realised not too many people know their music.

So here is your change to hear some old fashioned Symphonic Rock somewhere between Yes and Genesis:


IQ - Frequency (Symphonic Rock)

01 - Frequency
02 - Life Support
03 - Stronger Than Friction
04 - One Fatal Mistake
05 - Ryker Skies
06 - The Province
07 - Closer


Enjoy
