

Traditional building economics has primarily been concerned with issues around project appraisal and cost management techniques. On the other hand, modern construction economics has a wider focus with stronger links to mainstream economics, reflecting an increased interest in a range of theoretical issues in construction economics, both at the macro and micro level. In Modern Construction Economics: Theory and Application, a variety of approaches are used to present a coherent vision of synthesis between industry economics and project economics. ã€€

Topics covered include:

    * developing construction economics as idustry economics
    * competition and barriers to entry in construction
    * innovation in construction
    * theory testing in construction management research
    * collusion and corruption in the construction sector.

Including contributions from academics in the UK, Sweden, Hong Kong, and Australia, this is a truly global review of a core issue for the construction industry worldwide. The result is a unique book that will push toward the development of a comprehensive theoretical framework of construction economics. This is a must-read for all serious students of construction economics, and all practitioners looking for a deeper understanding of their industry.
