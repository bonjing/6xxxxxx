    A group of friends search for a young English Oxford student who has     
    disappeared whilst researching in Greece. They are shocked to find       
    that, wherever he has been, certain unsolved murders have taken          
    place. Not believing that their friend could be the perpetrator of       
    such acts, they press on with their search, finding him under the        
    spell of a beautiful Vampire, whose blood-sucking methods include the    
    use of sado-masochism. Believing they have killed her, the group         
    return home, unaware that their friend is now a Vampire.
