Only a few hundred years ago there emerged the ideal of inalienable rights to life, liberty, property, free speech, freedom of conscience and religion, etc. Yet rights now are routinely claimed to include health care, employment, housing, and education; the Universal Declaration of Human Rights even lists paid vacations. Are rights bestowed by government, or do we possess them simply because we are human? Do we have a â€œrightâ€ to all things we need for a full human lifeâ€”even if it obligates others to provide them?

The Morality in Our Age series examines the historical and philosophical background of todayâ€™s most pressing moral challenges. Though a final â€œanswerâ€ is notoriously elusive in moral discussion, youâ€™ll develop a much better insight into the forces and principles at play on todayâ€™s most serious moral issues, problems, and dilemmas.
