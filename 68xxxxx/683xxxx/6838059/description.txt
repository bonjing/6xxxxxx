Niccolo Machiavelli was a 16th century Political writer whose best
known legacy is his famous work "The Prince" presented here is the
BBC production along with The offering from The Giants of Political
thought series (Knowledge products). 

His ideas are always touted as mainly he result of "wicked awareness" and
a need to be practical in the midst of it as being what is the resulting
idea of wisdom. As such it lacks real insight into human potential and its
proper rule through judicious use of power that is motivated by the greatest
idealism rather than the expediencies of what is the status quo - fraught
with inadequacies as has generally always been so.

Men must be taught what is right rather than what has generally worked well
enough to keep them going. That is the ultimate failing in his message
and of almost all others that continue to think this way today everywhere we
look on the world stage.
