Is Raat Ki Subah Nahin (No End to This Night) is a 1996 Hindi thriller film directed by Sudhir Mishra. 

The film stars Tara Deshpande and Nirmal Pandey, and the entire plot of the film takes place through a single night. The film is based on a story by Sudhir Mishra\'s brother, Sudhanshu Mishra, who died in 1995. The score for the film was created by M.M. Kreem, and includes soulful numbers like, Chup Tum Raho and Jeevan Kya Hai with lyrics by Urdu poet, Nida Fazli.

An advertising executive, Aditya/Adi (Nirmal Pandey) has a beautiful wife (Tara Deshpande) at home and a beautiful mistress (Smriti Mishra). This secret affair is the catalyst for much of the plot. Adi ends up getting into a scuffle with a bunch of gangsters led by Ramanbhai, (Ashish Vidyarthi). To add to all the tension, Ramanbhai himself is under quite some duress because his colleague, Vilas Pandey(Saurabh Shukla) is after his life. A small-scale gang war erupts in the city, a cop (Ganesh Yadav) is changing sides faster than a chameleon, a rival gang lord (Virendra Saxena) is offering deals - and in the middle of all this, Nirmal Pandey finds himself caught. This happens in the span of single night.
