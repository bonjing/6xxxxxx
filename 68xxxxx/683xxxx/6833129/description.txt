"Dead & Buried"

The team learns that their 14-year-
old patient is suffering from more 
than teen angst when her physical 
symptoms worsen. Despite Foremans 
firm opposition, House becomes 
obsessed with solving a peculiar case 
of a deceased four-year-old patient, 
which gets him into serious trouble. 
Meanwhile, Park tries to get Chase to 
admit the reason behind his recent 
obsession with grooming.

18/Slower
Evolve...or die.

Enjoy :)
