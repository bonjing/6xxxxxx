From Will and Ariel Durant's The Lessons of History 
(quoting Joseph Arthur Comte de Gobineau):

"Everything great, noble, or fruitful in the works of man on this planet,
in science, art, and civilization, derives from a single starting point,
is the development of a single germ; ... it belongs to one family alone,
the different branches of which have reigned in all the civilized countries
of the universe. . . . History shows that all civilization derives from the
white race, that none can exist without its help, and that a society is great
and brilliant only so far as it preserves the blood of the noble group that 
created it".

The following is an added excerpt form the net:
In this illuminating and thoughtful book, Will and Ariel Durant have succeeded
in distilling for the reader the accumulated store of knowledge and experience
from their four decades of work on the ten monumental volumes of The Story of
Civilization. The result is a survey of human history, full of dazzling insights 
into the nature of human experience, the evolution of civilization, the culture of 
man. With the completion of their life's work they look back and ask what history 
has to say about the nature, the conduct and the prospects of man, seeking in the 
great lives, the great ideas, the great events of the past for the meaning of man's 
long journey through war, conquest and creationâ€”and for the great themes that can 
help us to understand our own era.
