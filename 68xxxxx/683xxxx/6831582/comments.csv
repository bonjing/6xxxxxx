Searches on TPB search engine and others don't always return a hit.

As much as i try not to duplicate it's gonna happen now and then.

I think it would be much easier for you to check your hard drive to see if you already have a certain book before downloading than for me to keep track of the several thousand books here on TPB and my HD.

Now,about your bandwidth problem.Have you considered paying for unlimited bandwidth,that way you can download all the porn you want and not worry about reaching your limit or you can get a girlfriend and cut back on the porn or eliminate it altogether LOl :)
