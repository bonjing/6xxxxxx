After several attempts to find this book, I decided to buy it and then share it with folks that were looking for it. 

This is the audiobook "Where Men Win Glory - The Odyssey of Pat Tillman"


It is a good book which chronicles the life of Patrick Tillman, the former Arizona Cardinals safety who dumped millions of dollars to enlist in the Army and fight with the US Army Rangers.


This is my first torrent, so comments are welcomed on how to improve my future offerings.  

-Enjoy and please seed when finished.  I found a bunch of torrents for this book but absolutely nobody was seeding it.
