ust wondering, but why do you only upload the 720 double sized ones for some of these shows now? Not a huge deal, but I really don't care that much about quality on these shows to download triple sized files. Is it just this show because the compressed versions are such shit quality? 

Also...WTF is up with this ettv dickhead? All his episodes get cut off and he's just jacking yours and trying to make it look like he's you. Quit downloading that cocksucker's torrents people. HE's a hack. "
