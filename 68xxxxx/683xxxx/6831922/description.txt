Having performed live to over 1.2m people, 
the UK's hardest working comedian Jimmy Carr, 
is back with his brand new stand-up DVD.

Star of hit TV shows 8 Out of 10 Cats and 10 
O'clock Live, Jimmy is well known for his slick 
one liners and non-stop gags, but his acerbic wit 
and fast-paced comedy style are at their brilliant 
best when he has the stage to himself.

Packed with over 100 minutes of brand new material, 
including too-rude-for-TV jokes, hilarious heckling, 
and even better put-downs, Jimmy pushes the boundaries 
of comedy and delivers a spectacular show.
