The Belle Brigade is an American vocal and instrumental duo consisting of siblings Barbara Gruska (born c. 1983) on guitar, drums, and vocals, and her younger brother Ethan Gruska (born c. 1989) on guitar, piano, and vocals. The duo released its first album, The Belle Brigade, in 2011 to positive critical response.


The Belle Brigade's music, marked by harmonies reminiscent of The Everly Brothers and Simon & Garfunkel, has been described as having roots in the classic California pop rock and country sounds of groups like Fleetwood Mac and The Flying Burrito Brothers[9] as well as The Beatles.[10] Ethan Gruska has said that their strongest influence is Paul Simon's solo work.[11]

Their debut album has received critical attention and praise. Los Angeles Times music writer Randall Roberts described their album as "a dozen California pop gems" and said of their first single, "Losers": "A defiant, classically structured song about being sick of social games, pretense and irony, "Losers" feels like one of those works of alienation that's existed forever, one that would ring true just as clearly had it been released in 1957 or 1974." L.A. Times record reviewer Mikael Wood called the album "the sound of a record nerdâ€™s dream come to messy, muscular life." Newsday critic Glenn Gamboa referred to their "doe-eyed innocence . . . that makes their sun-kissed '70s SoCal sound even more appealing." Paste reviewer Alexandra Fletcher listed their song "Where Not to Look for Freedom" as one of her "10 New Songs For The 2011 Summer". And El Paso Times reviewer Doug Pullen called the album "charming, compelling, timeless and inspiringâ€”and worthy of repeated listening" and said it was his "favorite album this year."
