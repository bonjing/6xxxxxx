"How the Failure to Identify, Prosecute and Convict President Kennedy's Assassins Has Let to Today's Crisis of Democracy," with Joan Mellen.


No description of the show is provided on the KPFA web site.

This is not an interview by Bonnie Faulkner, are are most episodes of Guns and Butter. It is, rather, simply the playing of a recording of an address given by Joan Mellen to the Ethical Culture Society in New York City on January 24, 2006 [including an approximately 15 minute long question and answer period at the end].

A transcript of the lecture [but not the Q&A] can be found here: http://www.joanmellen.net/NYC_2006article.html

An alternative audio file can be found here: http://nysoundposse.com/2006/01/event-who-planned-murder-of-jfk-who.html




================================================

"Guns & Butter" investigates the relationships among capitalism, militarism and politics. Maintaining a radical perspective in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, "Guns & Butter: The Economics of Politics" reports on who wins and who loses when the economic resources of civil society are diverted toward global corporatization, war, and the furtherance of a national security state.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
