In September,Justin Bieber announced on his Twitter that a Group he's always 
  idolized, Boyz II Men, would appear with him in a song on his holiday Album,
  "Under the Mistletoe".

Now, the song that the pop star and the famous R&B Group collaborated on has Music Video. The song, "Fa La la", is definitely a holiday love song,but the Video doesn't
have the singers belting out the lyrics surrounded by Mistletoe,christmas trees &
snow - unlike his heavy holiday themed first Video off the Album "Mistletoe".
