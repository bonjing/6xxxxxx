 The first authoritative guide to metal-organic framework chemistry

Among their many meaningful uses, metal-organic frameworks, or simply MOFs, hold the promise of expanding the fuel capacity of hydrogen-fueled vehicles with the ability to compress hydrogen molecules into small areas. Building on this technology, MOFs could increase this capacity even furtherâ€”to the point where fuel-cell-powered cars can one day become a reality.

The first, and definitive, reference on MOF chemistry, Metal-Organic Frameworks looks at the scientific possibilities inherent in these crystalline compounds with an in-depth view of how their chemical properties enable them to maximize surface areas with scaffolds made up of linked rods. Metal-Organic Frameworks covers the essential MOF fundamentals and discusses their key benefits, such as how they can be made with simple and low-cost building units to afford technologically advanced molecular and supramolecular materials. This book:

    * Uncovers rational design strategies, particularly in connection with self-assembly and supramolecular chemistry
    * Describes pore surface engineering and decoration
    * Outlines emerging applications to separations and gas storage
    * Discusses how the fields of nanotechnology and green chemistry are contributing to MOF studies

Metal-Organic Frameworks collects input from leading authorities in MOF chemistry and details important and timely contributions. Comprehensive coverage offers the reader a thorough and reliable view of the groundbreaking discoveries and forward-thinking research defining how far this field has comeâ€”and how far it still has to go. Suitable to gain an advanced-level understanding in this area, this book also serves as a valuable teaching tool, making it an ideal addition to the classroom.
