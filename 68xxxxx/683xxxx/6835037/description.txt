Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs -Discography 

All songs and videos from a group that cant be placed in any genre 

Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs is a long name for a one-man act, but that's the moniker electronic artist Orlando Higginbottom chose for himself, just for fun. His three EPs have exploded in his native UK, and the Oxford-born performer and producer is now working on his first full-length album, which he describes as "just dance music," without any genre associations. In an interview with Spinner, Higginbottom discussed dinosaur costumes, being the son of an Oxford University music professor, teaching children how to play steel pans and not taking the scene too seriously.

London, United Kingdom
Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs is a London, UK duo of Edmund Finnis and Orlando Higginbottom. Their music swings between overt musicality and dance. Their live show has toured internationally, featuring bizarre instruments, glitter cannons and, of course, dancing dinosaurs.

Their second EP, â€œAll In Two Sixty Dancehalls EPâ€ (2010, Greco-Roman), brought them notoriety. The lead track, Garden, was especially critically aclaimed.
