ly friend, apart from the odd griefer, which we just rollback his account. We take griefing very seriously, and operate on a 5 block code. 1 Block griefed = 1 week ban.
5 Blocks = 5 week ban. We like to think our server is very secure, and I think it is! The uptime is great, apart from the odd matinence downtime. So come on over, and play with us!
We have an Economy, Lockette, Toggle PVP, Factions, No Losing Items on Death and Lots of good commands (type /help ingame)! Just make sure to read the rules! /rules. There is normally no lagg. So come on down! Cracked Clients Welcome.
