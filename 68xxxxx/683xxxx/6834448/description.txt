UNTIL THE LIGHT TAKES US(2009)


[b]Chronicles the history, ideology and aesthetic of Norwegian black metal
a musical subculture infamous as much for a series of murders and church
arsons as it is for its unique musical and visual aesthetics. This is the
first (and only) film to truly shed light on a movement that has heretofore
been shrouded in darkness and rumor and obscured by inaccurate and shallow
depictions. Featuring exclusive interviews and verit with the musicians, 
a wealth of rare, seldom seen footage from the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Inner Circle\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"s earliest 
days, Until the Light Takes Us explores every aspect of the controversial 
movement that has captured the attention of the world. This is the movie 
that gets inside the minds and hearts of black metal\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s musicians. The 
filmmakers moved to Norway, living and filming there for two years. The 
movie is not about them though - it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s about the extraordinary people and 
events that make black metal unique, unforgettable, and inevitable. This 
is black metal as seen through the eyes of those who created it, of those 
who live it, of those who are at the center of the story of black metal.[/b]
