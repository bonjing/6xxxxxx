Recorded amidst family, friends, and fans, Get Along isnâ€™t the first live set offered up to listeners by the sisterly Canadian crooners Tegan and Sara,the single live disc, comprised of 15 favorites like â€œAlligator,â€ â€œCall It Off,â€ â€œMonday Monday Monday,â€ and â€œSentimental Tune,â€ finds the duo waltzing through its 15-year career with the kind of ease and amiable confidence that can only come from longtime friends who also happen to be siblings.
