Between the Buttons is the fifth British and seventh American studio album by The Rolling Stones. It was released on 20 January 1967 in the United Kingdom and 11 February 1967 in the United States as the follow-up to the ambitious Aftermath. Between the Buttons is seen as the beginning of the Stone's first complete departure from their R&B roots and the beginning of their brief foray into psychedelia.

In 2003, the American version of the album featuring "Ruby Tuesday" and "Let's Spend the Night Together" was ranked number 355 on Rolling Stone Magazine's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.
