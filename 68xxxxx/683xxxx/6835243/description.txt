Hauntingly beautiful; deep with feeling, this music is truly of Heaven. A phenomenal meditation tool or simply music to deeply relax and just listen to. Also, for the uninitiated, this CD is a valid introduction to both Orthodox Christian Sacred Music, and Orthodox Russian Spirituality in particular. It's well worth noting that music such as this can quite literally change your life -- in surprisingly profound, and meaningful ways; I know many whom it has.

Amen
