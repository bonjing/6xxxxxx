A World of Computers
Computers are everywhere: at work, at school,
and at home. As shown in Figure 1-1, people
use all types and sizes of computers for a vari-
ety of reasons and in a range of places. While
some computers sit on top of a desk or on the
floor, mobile computers and mobile devices
are small enough to carry. Mobile devices, such
as many cell phones, often are classified as
computers.
Computers are a primary means of local and
global communication for billions of people.
Consumers use computers to correspond with
businesses, employees with other employees and
customers, students with classmates and teachers,
and family members and military personnel with
friends and other family members. In addition
to sending simple notes, people use computers
to share photos, drawings, documents, calendars,
journals, music, and videos.
Through computers, society has instant
access to information from around the globe.
Local and national news, weather reports, sports
scores, airline schedules, telephone directories,
maps and directions, job listings, credit reports,
and countless forms of educational material
always are accessible. From the computer, you
can make a telephone call, meet new friends,
share opinions or life stories, book flights,
shop, fill prescriptions, file taxes, take a course,
receive alerts, and automate your home.
