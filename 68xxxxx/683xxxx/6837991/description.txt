If you\'re looking for the all-time number one purveyor of mainstream romantic soul, Smokey Robinson may well be the man, in the face of some towering competition. 
With the Miracles in the 1960s, he paced dozens of tuneful Motown hits with his beautiful high tenor. As a solo performer from the 1970s onward, he was one of the staples of urban contemporary music. But his singing gifts, as notable as they are, comprise only one of his hats: he\'s also one of pop\'s best and most prolific songwriters. 
As a songwriter and producer, he was the most important musical component to Motown\'s early success, not only on the hits by the Miracles, but for numerous other acts as well (especially Mary Wells and the Temptations).
