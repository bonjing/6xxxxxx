The Screamin' Cheetah Wheelies' [256k MP3]

The Screamin' Cheetah Wheelies' self-titled debut album plays like a gateway between guitar hero classic rock and hippie jam band grooves, often combining both within the confines of a single track. The band certainly doesn't play coy with its ...    Full Descriptionsound, as evidenced by the opening song "Shakin' the Blues." Each member of the band gets a mini solo sandwiched between testosterone-induced power chords. Mike Farris' throaty vocals, reminiscent of Widespread Panic's John Bell, provide a constant source of emotion that complements Rick White and Bob Watkins' stellar guitar-driven riffs. The second track, "Ride the Tide," epitomizes the band's sound as an acoustic opening gives way to a full-blown assault of feverish guitar licks and catchy hooks. This pattern is repeated on "Moses Brown," a soulful song about a spiritual man spreading a message to misguided children that they need to rediscover love in the world.
