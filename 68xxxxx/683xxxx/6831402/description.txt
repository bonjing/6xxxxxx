That harmless looking scrap of jewellery young Susan is sporting turns out to be a weirdstone, an item of such power that the forces of good and evil are about to go to war to possess it. And if all this wasnâ€™t enough to traumatise the wee lass and her brother Colin, they are going to have to get used to dealing with goblins, elves and the neâ€™er-do-well morthbrood (evil witches and warlocks) and not just the animals on the farm where theyâ€™re staying.
