                            ============================




History reports that the mighty Inca were swiftly wiped out by a small band of Conquistadors. But, new evidence is being unearthed that may help re-write history. Remains of those who died in battle have been discovered, and for the first time physical evidence is suggesting that Spain\'s conquest of the Incan Empire may have actually taken twenty years. 


Brought to life through CGI reconstruction and reenactments, the untold epic saga of decades of guerilla warfare and rebellion are finally revealed as National Geographic uncovers the truth behind the Inca\'s last stand. 


By its height in the early 16th century, the Inca Empire had conquered and absorbed hundreds of other chiefdoms and spanned over 772,000 square miles. Its warriors remained undefeated in battle for nearly a century before falling to the Spanish at the Siege of Lima. How did some 200 European adventurers manage to take down a chiefdom so mighty? Part of the answer lies in resources, specifically the horses, iron, and steel the Spanish had at their disposal. 


In this interactive artist\'s rendering, compare Inca and conquistador soldiers to see how markedly their dress and weaponry differedâ€”differences that played a decisive role in the fall of the Inca Empire
