
Here is a revolutionary approach to help you overcome habits, phobias, chronic pain, and other "self-defeating sequences" through the easy-to-use techniques of self hypnosis.

Self-Hypnosis shows you how to make your own tapes to reprogram your subconscious and attain your goals. The effect of these techniques is to put the "self" back in "self-help" and to eliminate the many dependencies and co-dependencies that complicate and take the joy out of life.

Hypnotic suggestions are effective because they bypass the conscious mindâ€™s natural resistance to change and reprogram the computer we call the subconscious to permanently effect these changes. By devoting a mere 20 minutes each day to this approach, you will literally take charge of your life.

The results that can be achieved using these techniques are virtually endless. Hypnosis can: - Increase self-confidence. - Increase and focus concentration. - Improve memory. - Improve your sex life. - Enhance creativity. - Eliminate headaches, even migraines. - Eliminate insomnia. - Relieve chronic pain. - Slow down and even reverse the aging process.

And donâ€™t forget that self-hypnosis can be used for two problems plaguing so many people: losing weight and quitting smoking!

This revised edition now comes with a 72-minute CD with self-hypnosis exercises designed to improve your self-image, overcome fears, improve your creativity, and much more.

Self Hypnosis is a must-read for anyone interested in exploring self-awareness and taking control of his or her destiny.
