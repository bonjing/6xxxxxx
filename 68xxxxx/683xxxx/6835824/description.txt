[b][color=blue]::Plot::[/color][/b]
  [b][i]Ben battles Dr. Animo as Heatblast/Eye Guy/XLR8 when he's hit by a DNA wave that puts the Omnitrix in self-destruct mode.
Tetrax senses it and comes to Earth to warn Ben about it. Ben, Tetrax and his pilot, Gluto, travel across the galaxy to find Azmuth, the creator of the Omnitrix. Gwen soon appears on the ship to help Ben.

After some time of searching on Incarcecon, Ben, Gwen and Tetrax get themselves in a street-fight, where Ben spots a female Chimera Sui Generis, Myaxx, who claims that she created the Omnitrix. Actually, she was Azmuth's assistant and directs Ben and the others to Xenon, where Azmuth lives. Soon, it was intercepted and boarded by Vilgax and his drones, but they were stopped by Ben, Gwen, Tetrax, Gluto, and Myaxx. In that action, Gluto is assumed dead.

When they got to Xenon, they were attacked by a group of wild Floraunas, where Gwen was captured by them and assumed dead. After Ben's sadness, Tetrax told him the tragic story about him bringing Vilgax the final element he needed to destroy his home planet, Petropia. Even though transforming would accelerate the self-destruct, Ben transformed into Cannonbolt to break into Azmuth's lab, but Azmuth refused to help them. Ben then sees Vilgax, Sixsix and their massive army of drones. Azmuth removed the main part of the Omnitrix, but Ben, Tetrax and Myaxx still fought.

Soon, it was revealed, that Gwen and Gluto were still alive and helped battle. Soon, Azmuth put the Omnitrix back together and unlocked Way Big. Ben then transformed into Way Big, defeated Vilgax's army of drones, grabbed Vilgax and threw him into space.

Ben is brought back to Earth, finding out that zombies are attacking the mall, and heads off to stop them.[/i][/b]
