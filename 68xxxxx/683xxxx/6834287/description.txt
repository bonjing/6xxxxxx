AskIt Wordpress Theme

AskIt is perhaps the most advanced theme we have created, and effectively transforms your blog into a fully functional question and answer site. AskIt allows your visitors to post their questions and have them answered by fellow members. Any visitor can post answers to these questions which are then voted on by the community until a "correct" answer is chosen by the question author.
