Hi,
Subs can be found in two ways : srt (a txt files) and 'idx/sub often as idx/rar (two files from the DVD).
TvTeam seemd having some problems with their batch who decompress the release multipart rar and then delete all the rar, cause it also delete the rar files of the sub too. the idx files only is useless. You can get the release from TvTeam but you have to get the idx/rar from another torrent.
