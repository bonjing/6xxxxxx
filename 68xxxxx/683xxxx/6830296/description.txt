This is the Stronghold 3 Updates 3 and 4 Compilation as seen onand downloaded from the fileserve link provided there. Thought this might be better for you :)

This updates the game to version 1.4.24706.

I have tried it myself and it seems to work fine.

Fairly simple to apply.

All you have to do is copy and paste the assets and bin folders into the Stronghold 3 installation directory and overwrite all.


Please don't delete this torrent. I swear it's legit and I'm only trying to help out.

I'll try and help with any problems, though I doubt I'll be any help :)
