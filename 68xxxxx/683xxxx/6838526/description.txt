Epoxy polymers are one of the most versatile materials belonging to the family of thermosetting plastics. These plastics are produced by a so-called cure process, in which liquid precursors are converted into the final solid material by a polymerization reaction. Epoxy resins find important industrial applications in the fields of adhesives, coatings, carbon-fiber and glass-fiber composites, among many others. They are integral parts of PCs and other electronic equipment, cars, aircraft, floors, eolic-energy generators, and many other objects and structures found in our daily life.

In this only up-to-date book to focus on new developments and innovations in this hot field, international experts from industry and academia present everything scientists need to know on the topic.

The first section provides general concepts of the synthesis and properties of epoxy polymers and serves as a basis for the subsequent chapters. The second section covers new types of epoxy polymers recently commercialized or not yet present on the market, while the third section includes chapters related to the capacity of generating controlled nanostructures in epoxy-based materials. A fourth section is devoted to innovations in epoxy-based materials such as pre-pregs, structural foams, injection-molded products and self-healing epoxies. Concluding remarks and perspectives are discussed in a short final section.

The result is a one-stop reference source, collecting scientific and technological breakthroughs otherwise spread throughout hundreds of publications, patents and reports.
