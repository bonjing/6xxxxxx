PROMISE
Relax ... It's over, you belong to me. I will fill you up with earth.
It's over and you can never get out of, I will take the last digit of love.
You are my first and I can hardly breathe, I found you fascinating.
You are my favorite, lay down to sleep because that's all you can do to get it to stop.
Just as blue-eyed like a broken paper doll, I have not left you yet. So cold and from being offensive, your eyes are full of cataracts, Tomorrow I will disappear again.
You are my, you will always be my, I can not divide us. But I can combine your ...
All I want is to succeed fascinated by your second.
You belong to me, I will have to die to make love to you.
