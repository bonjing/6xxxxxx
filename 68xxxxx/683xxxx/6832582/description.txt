What do you learn in Stripper Shark System?

The program is totally geared towards a system for going out to strip clubs, meeting the girls, and getting them into bed.  The best part of the program is that Julian Foxx gives you the exact lines to use in the strip bar.

    How to pick which strippers are most open to go home with a customer
    How to break her â€œstripper actâ€ so that she opens up to you and feels a connection with her
    How to get strippers to want to have a threesome with you
    How to get strippers to think you really â€œgetâ€ her
    How to get into strip clubs for free

You also get a really killer bonus called 123 Threesome that Julian created showing you how to find strippers who will work to find girls that will have a threesome with you and her.

Overall, if the idea of banging strippers appeals to you, then there is really no reason not to fork over $40 for this program  (Be aware that the program comes with 2 trial weeks of his membership program. If you donâ€™t cancel within the time period, you will be billed $50 a week afterward until you cancel.  You can easily cancel, but make sure you remember to do so if you donâ€™t want to stay on as a member).  It cost less that your average night out at the strip club and was created by a guy who is legitimately banging his share of hot strippers.
