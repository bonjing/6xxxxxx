As some of you may know, the SKIDROW version of Saints Row The Third comes with some weird bonus stuff that takes all challenge away from the game. This fixes that.

I have tried this with the SKIDROW release personally, but I did not play or save before fixing so I don't know about any effects to saves.


To apply:

Just copy and paste the stuff from the relevant folder to the installation directory.


A bit of the readme:

NO DLCs enabled / no preorder content at all

ChangedDLCS folder, has these changes

Disabled bonus $$/respect on start
Disabled bonus hourly/weekly $
Disabled other bonus money drop related shit (i think npcs dropped more $ or something).
Disabled VTOL/SaintsTank etc (VTOL is what instantly takes over areas)
Kept all outfits + homies + weapon packs + preorder packs i could.


Please don't delete this torrent. I swear it's legit and I'm only trying to help out.

I'll try and help with any problems, though I doubt I'll be any help :)
