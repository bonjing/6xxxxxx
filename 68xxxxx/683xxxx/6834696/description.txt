
Grand Funk Railroad was, at best, a singles band, capable of turning a couple of crunching rockers and hooky singles out with each album. 
Though it may be missing a fan favorite or two -- and that could mean something concise and catchy or meandering jams like "T.N.U.C." -- this does have the overwhelming majority of their best songs, including not just hits like "We're an American Band" and "Some Kind of Wonderful," but also album tracks. 
Some longtime fans, like Homer Simpson, may find favorites missing, but this remains a nearly ideal summary. (AMG)



This single disc, 15-track Grand Funk compilation contains just about every single hit that Mark Farner and company recorded out during their magical late-'60s/early-'70s run. 
Although they were never the critic's choice, Grand Funk became a "people's band" on the strength of such rock anthems as the epic "Closer to Home/I'm Your Captain," "We're an American Band," "The Loco-Motion," and "Some Kind of Wonderful," which are all included here. 
CAPITOL COLLECTORS SERIES serves as a solid, to-the-point overview of a band that, more than most, evokes the point when the '60s became the '70s. (cduniverse)
