Notice of Action under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
Abuse Incident Number:      Not Applicable
Report Date/Time:           Tue, 1 May 2012 17:46:55 -0700

Dear Comcast High-Speed Internet Subscriber:

Comcast has received a notification by a copyright owner, or its authorized agent, reporting an alleged infringement of one or more copyrighted works made on or over Comcast's High-Speed Internet service (the 'Service').  The copyright owner has identified the Internet Protocol ('IP') address associated with your Service account at the time as the source of the infringing works....

There was more threatening language in addition. Gonna look some more into this to see what it means and/or how to avoid.

BTW, the movie sucks."
