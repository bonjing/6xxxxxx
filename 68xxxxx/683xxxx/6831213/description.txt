Sensing Murder (America version 4:3)

Missing Teens

Airs Thursday, Oct. 6 year 2006

On August 24th 1979, high school sweethearts 17-year-old Mary Leonard and 19-year-old Ricky Beard vanished. Their families never lost hope that they might return, until six years later, when their remains were discovered in a wooded area. An autopsy confirmed that they had been murdered. Police in Akron, Ohio, have investigated the case for 27 years â€” with no arrests. Now, with the permission of the families, they are calling in two of America's most respected psychics, Pam Coronado and Laurie Campbell. Psychics believe that objects that belonged to the victims â€” photographs â€” even visiting the crime scene â€” retain an energy that allows them to see the crime. Can they use their unique skills to provide new clues? Can they actually sense murder?
