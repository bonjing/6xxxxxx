"The trial and death of Socrates" - the apology of Socrates and Phaedo
(Plato) read by Bruce Alexander et al

The unexamined life is not worth living says Socrates in this writing
by Plato - and he goes on to discover whether "to know what is right is
to do what is right" - or perhaps "you don't really know what is right" -
being the argument as it were.

This is not the stuff of John Stuart Mill who argues with precision that is
incredulously the stuff of brilliance and true genius.

There are too many self supported statements that seem as assertions dressed up
with rhetoric to seem self explanatory or self evident or in any event self
sufficient perhaps, given the reputation of the speaker (Socrates) and the 
vernacular style of the relaxed manner of rhetorical banter of the time and place in question.

That all said, this is one of the great works of Classical Philosophy from
ancient times and is standard reading in all Universities dealing with western
thought from this period and genre of material equally.

As such it should have been commissioned into the public domain a long time ago -
but for the universal lack of wisdom on this planet in respect of the Bill Gates
types that are required to write the cheques more sensibly. the text itself as
certainly already in the public domain so it only requires a few hours of a
competent enough speaker who is adequately to be compensated for his or her efforts I say.

as it is this 4CD set is priced at fully twenty six pounds at some enterprising
sites on the net as Bruce Alexander is well considered in his talented 
performance here I gather, on the part of others too perhaps.In any event its
a nice British accent - and it beats the offerings of Michael Scott "hands down"
as unacceptably boring by any measure of comparison whatever.
