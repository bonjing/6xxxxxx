He Said was the name used by Wire member Graham Lewis for his solo releases in the 1980s. The first He Said release was Hail, which was released in 1986 on Mute Records. The music on Hail was more electronic than Wire's work, representing the natural progression that much post-punk and experimental music was taking at the time. A series of singles were released from the album, including "Pump", "Pale Feet", and "Only One I". In 1989 Lewis released Take Care, which would turn out to be the last He Said release to date.
