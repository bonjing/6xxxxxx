New version of the utility that inserts a valid license to update NOD32 Commercial versions 2.5.x, 2.7.x, 3.x, 4.x, 5.0.x, including Eset Smart Security.



Significant improvements since version 1.4.0 Final:



- ESET Support v5.

- Added the option to choose the ESET product type for which the license to download (EAV= NOD32 Antivirus, ESS= ESET Smart Security ,EAVBE = NOD32 Antivirus Business Edition, ESSBE= Eset Smart Security Business Edition).

- Added an option to change the seconds to wait for the detection of internet when activating the option "Start with the system."

- Fixed errors when connecting to certain license servers.



Note: Inserts new licenses very fast. Everything works on an automatic way.

If you click on Desktop shortcut, one icon appears on the Taskbar and here, using right-mouse-button you may configure the way you prefer. I prefer Default Settings and "Run at Windows Startup".

It can be configured to Hidden Mode too.

With Uninstaller.
