Notes from original dimeadozen uploader: Opening for Judas Priest. I'm not familiar with BLS, so I had to rely on setlist.fm for some guidance and I think this is right. If anyone knows the name for track 5 please let me know. Enjoy!

Notes from TPB uploader:
I admit I'm not familiar with BLS either
As for Track 5, other commenters suggested either Demise Of Sanity or Suicide Messiah. The words I heard seemed to match the listed lyrics of Suicide Messiah.

Sounds a bit washed-out due to the taper's distance, but still very clear.
