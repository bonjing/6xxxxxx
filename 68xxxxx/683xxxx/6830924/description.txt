Secrets of the Superbrands
Alex Riley thinks he's immune to brands. When it comes to fashion, technology and food brands he just goes for the cheapest and what works for him. He's convinced he's not seduced by the advertising, celebrity endorsements and hype which surrounds the big global brands. So how did that pair of Adidas trainers get in his wardrobe? And how did that can of Heinz Baked Beans make it into his shopping trolley? And why does he have a Nokia mobile phone in his pocket rather than any other make?
With the help of marketeers, brain scientists and exclusive access to the world of the superbrands Alex sets out to find out why we buy them, trust them, even idolise them.


1)  Technology 
Alex Riley explores the world of the technology superbrands - how they get us to buy their stuff, trust them and even idolise them. He meets the supergeeks who are inventing the future and finds out how some of the most powerful companies in the world really make their billions.

2)  Fashion 
Fashion novice Alex Riley dives into the world of clothing superbrands to find out how these billion dollar global organisations have invaded our wardrobes and our minds. When he discovers that designer handbags are so desirable that some women will pay 100 pounds a month just to rent one, he's determined to have their head examined to find out why.

3)  Food 
Alex Riley is on the trail of the global food and drink giants. What's so special about them? How have they penetrated our brains so we recognise them like members of our own families? Alex travels the globe to find where they've come from and how they make us keep on buying them.
