Introducing My First TRAINZ Set!
Get the creative juices flowing as you build winding tracks up, around and through real life rooms in a house! Sit back and take in the view as you watch trains steam around your masterpiece. You can even interact with different industries to pickup and drop off passengers and inventory.
