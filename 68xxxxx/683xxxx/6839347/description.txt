In September, Justin Bieber announced on his Twitter that a group heâ€™s always idolized, Boyz II Men, would appear with him in a song on his holiday album, Under the Mistletoe.

Now, the song that the pop star and the famous R&B; group collaborated on has a music video. The song, â€œFa La La,â€ is definitely a holiday love song, but the video doesnâ€™t have the singers belting out the lyrics surrounded by mistletoe, christmas trees and snow â€“ unlike his heavy holiday themed first video off the album, â€œMistletoe.â€
