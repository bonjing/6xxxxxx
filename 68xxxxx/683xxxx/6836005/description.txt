Notes

The first three tracks were intended as vinyl release by Frank Zappa. "Buffalo Voice" and "Secular Humanism" are earlier versions of the tracks released in 1994 on Civilization Phaze III.  "Worms From Hell" is the full-length version of the music used in the opening credit of the 1987 Honker Home Video release "Video From Hell".  "Feeding The Monkies At Ma Maison" and "Samba Funk" are previously unreleased. 
All tracks on this CD were probably recorded in 1986.

Packaged in a cardsleeve with a lenticular print insert and a 6 page foldout insert.
