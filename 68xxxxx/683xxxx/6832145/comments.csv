ex. low volume. Its most likely because you are missng the AC3 Filter. You will need it, even when playing in VLC.

Im not sure, but i think it happens if the audio is 5.1 then you will only get some of the channels, and if its not the ones with dialogue, you will get very low volume. plz correct me if im wrong.

Merry Xmas :D"
