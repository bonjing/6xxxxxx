Metasploit: The Penetration Tester\'s Guide
===========================================

Book Description
Publication Date: July 22, 2011
\"The best guide to the Metasploit Framework.\" â€”HD Moore, Founder of the Metasploit Project

The Metasploit Framework makes discovering, exploiting, and sharing vulnerabilities quick and relatively painless. But while Metasploit is used by security professionals everywhere, the tool can be hard to grasp for first-time users. Metasploit: The Penetration Tester\'s Guide fills this gap by teaching you how to harness the Framework and interact with the vibrant community of Metasploit contributors.

Once you\'ve built your foundation for penetration testing, you\'ll learn the Framework\'s conventions, interfaces, and module system as you launch simulated attacks. You\'ll move on to advanced penetration testing techniques, including network reconnaissance and enumeration, client-side attacks, wireless attacks, and targeted social-engineering attacks.

Learn how to:

    Find and exploit unmaintained, misconfigured, and unpatched systems
    Perform reconnaissance and find valuable information about your target
    Bypass anti-virus technologies and circumvent security controls
    Integrate Nmap, NeXpose, and Nessus with Metasploit to automate discovery
    Use the Meterpreter shell to launch further attacks from inside the network
    Harness standalone Metasploit utilities, third-party tools, and plug-ins
    Learn how to write your own Meterpreter post exploitation modules and scripts

You\'ll even touch on exploit discovery for zero-day research, write a fuzzer, port existing exploits into the Framework, and learn how to cover your tracks. Whether your goal is to secure your own networks or to put someone else\'s to the test, Metasploit: The Penetration Tester\'s Guide will take you there and beyond.



Practical Packet Analysis: Using Wireshark to Solve Real-World Network Problems 2nd Edition
===============================================================================

Book Description
ISBN-10: 1593272669 | ISBN-13: 978-1593272661 | Publication Date: July 6, 2011 | Edition: Second Edition

It\'s easy to capture packets with Wireshark, the world\'s most popular network sniffer, whether off the wire or from the air. But how do you use those packets to understand what\'s happening on your network?

With an expanded discussion of network protocols and 45 completely new scenarios, this extensively revised second edition of the best-selling Practical Packet Analysis will teach you how to make sense of your PCAP data. You\'ll find new sections on troubleshooting slow networks and packet analysis for security to help you better understand how modern exploits and malware behave at the packet level. Add to this a thorough introduction to the TCP/IP network stack and you\'re on your way to packet analysis proficiency.

Learn how to:

    Use packet analysis to identify and resolve common network problems like loss of connectivity, DNS issues, sluggish speeds, and malware infections
    Build customized capture and display filters
    Monitor your network in real-time and tap live network communications
    Graph traffic patterns to visualize the data flowing across your network
    Use advanced Wireshark features to understand confusing captures
    Build statistics and reports to help you better explain technical network information to non-techies
