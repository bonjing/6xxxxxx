Beginning with a historical introduction that examines Newton's laws, Earth's Magnetosphere then explores Maxwell's equations and subsidiary equations such as continuity, constitutive relations, and the Lorentz transformation; Helmholtz' theorem; and Poynting's theorem, among other methods for understanding this exchange.
