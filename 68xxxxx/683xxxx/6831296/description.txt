Knowledge Management Systems and Processes


Unlike other books in the field, Knowledge Management: Systems and Processes enhances the conventional exposition of KM with an in-depth discussion of the technologies used to facilitate the management of knowledge in large and small organizations. It features numerous case studies and vignettes describing practical applications of KM initiatives at leading firms and government organizations, including details such as system architecture. Written by two recognized researchers in the field, the book makes extensive use of the latest developments and examples from KM. An online Instructor's Manual with PowerPoint materials, solutions to end-of-chapter exercises, and test questions is available to adopters.
