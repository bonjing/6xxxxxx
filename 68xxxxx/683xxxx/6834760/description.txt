An intresting series of books from best-selling Scottish crime writer Val McDermid (known for her books about criminal psychologist Tony Hill and detective Carol Jordan and the U.K. TV series Wire in the Blood).
 
This is about a lesbian reporter, Lindsay Gordon and her crime solving adventures.
 
Though written in the third person, the narrative is focused on Gordonâ€™s perspective, and the crimes that the amateur sleuth investigates are among the more civilized kinds of literary murder. The Gordon series also regularly treks through the landscape of lesbian and womenâ€™s culture. Early books were set in a girlsâ€™ school and a womenâ€™s peace camp; later books explore the changing terrain of lesbian relationships, from breakups to affairs to lesbian parenting.
 
Enjoy!
