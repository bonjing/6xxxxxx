Synopsis: WinRAR is a powerful archive manager. It can backup your data and 
reduce the size of email attachments, decompress RAR, ZIP and other files 
downloaded from Internet and create new archives in RAR and ZIP file format. 

How to Extract: Extract "self-extracting" EXE to desired folder, launch 
"WinRARPortable.exe". 

Beautiful Custom Theme:
* includes integrated "Imagination 3" Theme. WinRAR's default theme is so bland 
and ugly to look at. (refer to screenshot) 

VS. Competitors:
* this version is truly stealth: PortableAppz has a version posted but like 
many of his apps., it leaves trash in the registry and uses the standard theme.

Shell Integration Support: (refer to provided screenshot)
* To enable Shell Integration support: start WinRAR &gt; settings &gt; integration &gt; 
click "OK" to save. You can now use WinRAR in Windows Explorer. Because this is
stealth, it's only available when WinRAR is open.

Local Install Support:
* This is also compatible if WinRAR is already installed on machine.
