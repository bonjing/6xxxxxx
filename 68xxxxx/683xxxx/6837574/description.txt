PLot :

This is a different type of movie by Hrishikesh Mukherjee. This movie where empathises with the Indian musicians on one hand, also brings out the tale of a son(Amitabh) of a rich father(Om Prakash) who takes a stand against his father. The movie has some really beautiful music (mostly light Hindustani classical) and of course has the battle to live poor and dying than to ask support from the father.

Indian Classical based melodious Songs :

The source rip was shaking very badly. I had to remove the vigorous shakes using Deshaker filter in Avidub. Hence the viewer may experience broad borders in some scenes . These are the borders created by Deshaker to compensate the shaking. However the quality of the movie does not suffer and is quite good.
