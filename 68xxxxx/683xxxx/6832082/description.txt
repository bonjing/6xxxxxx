Dog Man Star is a very theatrical album in the way the songs are very long and intense. It takes a while to get to know it and in several songs, the "catchiness" of the Suede sound is a little more hidden than usual. You do get your traditional hit anthems, though, with songs like "We Are The Pigs", "The Wild Ones" and "Heroine". That Bernard Butler left the band after the recording of "Dog Man Star" took away some of the experimental identity of Suede. Ironically enough, that's when the band became huge all over Europe and success started pouring in.
