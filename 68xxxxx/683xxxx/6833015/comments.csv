Anyway; I'd like to add my voice to those that are against the use of .rar files, why is this even being done? It doesn't really compress the files that much, since H.264 is compression specifically designed for video after all, so if it's properly encoded in the first place then .rar won't give any benefit at all. The result is that the cost of seeding the torrent is double as you have to keep the .rar version to seed, and the decompressed version for watching.

Please just optimises your H.264 encodes and stop using .rar; I'll seed anyway as I always do, but this weird practise is eating up my storage space far more quickly than it should!"
