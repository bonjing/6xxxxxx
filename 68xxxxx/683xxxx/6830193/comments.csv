ame is great. i am suprised it aint more popular
there are a lot of option
you can shange the cokpit view haight,move camera up,down etc
if you dont like the screen shakes when driving you can disable that
nose cam,bumper cam is good(not too low)
hud elemnts are good
there are a lot of cars
good to drive
wheel support works great
and also the game looks good and runs great

and manus and loading times are great
after playing gris,dirt etc. i am so sick of those slow 3d menus and long loading times

this game reall does need gamers support

i will buy it and that is rare

only original game i have is fallout 2"
