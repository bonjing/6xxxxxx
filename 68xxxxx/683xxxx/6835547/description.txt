WORKDONE:

Ok first off the readnfo ...well when remuxing the ac3 track its oos by 200ms,so corrected the sync issues.Now haven't
grabbed all the others but read in shouts that there is oos issues with a few of the releases,so heres a fixed one 
The video i made a script and used a heavy noise filter,changed the brightness slightly and increased contrast some more,also
changed the rgb colours slightly and finally added a touch of sharpness to it.
IMHO...but bad Q,but would have liked the sources files to rip as it would be even better then,but hey ho ...better than nothing.
Check sample for Q.
