The footage is from the concert film "The Song Remains the Same".
The concert took place in Madison Square Garden, New York City     
Led Zeppelin the greatest band of our human race.I believe that? Rock N' Roll is the best style that our kind invented,and Zeppelin the best band of all time.This is such unique band that gives me shivers when I think this type of music was created by humans.We are all able to do that,but only this four guys were able to do it in this level of complexity and creativity.
