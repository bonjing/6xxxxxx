I downloaded the trial version from the Corel web site and used it that way - everything installed smoothly with the exception of the Vista problem (i.e. ownership of files, because Vista redirects things instead of giving exact locations WP X5 was erroring out immediately, saying it couldn't continue.  I just deleted the old user, made a new one and reinstalled at which point everything worked fine! :D  Thanks again."
