In this book, Jenny Rogers offers practical advice on research and preparation, giving guidance on how to behave during the whole selection process and present your skills and experience in a relevant manner. Handling the preliminaries and the actual interview â€“ from personal presentation to asking questions - and what to do when you are offered the job are also examined.

You know the feeling. You meet someone newâ€”at a party or at workâ€”and you just hit it off. There is an instant sense of camaraderie.
In a word, you â€œclick.â€
From the bestselling authors of Sway, Click is a fascinating psychological investigation of the forces behind what makes us click with certain people, or become fully immersed in whatever activity or situation weâ€™re involved in.

From two co-workers who fall head over heels for each other while out to dinner and are married a month later (and fifteen years later remain just as in love), to a team of scientists who changed the world with the magic of their invention, these kinds of peak experiences, when our senses are completely focused on the moment, are something that individualsâ€”and companiesâ€”strive to achieve. After all, when youâ€™re in the â€œzone,â€ youâ€™re happier and more productive. Why is it that we click in certain situations and with certain people, but not with others? Can this kind of magical connection be consciously encouraged? Is there a way to create such peak experiences, whether on a date or in your job?

According to Ori and Rom Brafman, there is.

In a powerful, story-driven narrative that weaves together cutting-edge research in psychology and sociology, the Brafmans explore what it means to â€œclickâ€: the common factors present when our brain and senses are fully engaged. They identify five â€œacceleratorsâ€ that increase the likelihood of these kinds of magic connections in our work and relationships.

From actors vying for a role on a popular TV series to police officers negotiating with hostage takers, we learn how one can foster an environment where we can click with another person and shape our thinking, behavior, and emotions.

A fascinating journey into how we engage with the world around us, Click will transform our thinking about those moments when we are in the zone and everything seems to fall into place.
