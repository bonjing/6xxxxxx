This offering was obtained as a paid for download at a time when it was
offered by a UK based bookseller - at a time when the publisher (Knowledge
products) did not appear to have their offerings available any more.

It appears that the cassette based versions are now back in supply, however
for those that prefer mp3s as more competent, allow me to keep you supplied
instead as the mp3 versions appear nowhere else to be found anymore.

The Giants of Political thought series - John Stuart Mill - On Liberty
with a bonus reading from and brief discussion of Mary Wallstonecraft's
views on the rights of women.


John Stuart Mill is undoubtedly the most brilliant philosopher of all time.
His best known works include Utilitarianism (which gave us the principle of
"the greatest good for the greatest number") and "On Liberty" - the most
brilliant piece of writing in the English language I submit.

The latter deals with matters of individual versus state rights and responsibilities and is indispensable reading for anyone with an intelligent
mind to enable a better basis from which to make an enlightened contribution
to debates of the perennial sort that will always be a concern for western
democracies as it were.

Also included is a BBC panel discussion mp3 on John Stuart Mill's ideas
- although it is limited in scope and the readings from the text in these mp3
files only excerpts - the truth be told.

You can often find lovely Easton or Gryphon and other leather bound versions
of the book on ebay - otherwise stick to the audiobooks I say! (of which this
is the best Ive so far found)
