*** Second Attempt at this Torrent  ***
*** Please disregard the first attempt, I did not do it correctly ***

After several attempts to find this book, I decided to buy it and then share it with folks that were looking for it.   I have enjoyed this site and downloaded from others so I am now making an effort to give back.  


This is the audiobook "Where Men Win Glory - The Odyssey of Pat Tillman"


It is a good book which chronicles the life of Patrick Tillman, the former NFL star who played for the Arizona Cardinals that rejected millions of dollars to enlist in the Army and fight with the Army Rangers.


This is my first torrent, so comments are welcomed on how to improve my future offerings.  


-Enjoy and please seed when finished.  I found a bunch of torrents for this book but absolutely nobody was seeding it.  I will keep this online and seeding as long as I see that others who download it are sharing as well.
