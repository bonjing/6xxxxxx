  Have you ever wondered about who lived in your house before you?      
  Where did they come from? What were their dreams, hopes and fears?    
  And what became of them?                                              
                                                                        
  Who's Been Sleeping In My House? is a new 8-part Australian series    
  presented by archaeologist Adam Ford exploring the incredible         
  stories that lie between the bricks and mortar of our homes.          
                                                                        
  From the Western Australian goldfields to the tropics of Queensland,  
  Adam peels back the extraordinary lives of everyday Australians -     
  people who lived, loved, bore children and moved on in the great      
  cycle of life.                                                        
                                                                        
  As ghosts of the past, family secrets and architectural surprises     
  are revealed, one thing is for certain - the present owners'          
  relationships with their homes will be changed forever by the         
  startling mysteries and unexpected revelations Adam unearths.         
                                                                        
  In episode one Adam visits Ashcombe, a home in the heart of           
  Ballarat, Victoria. He discovers how the 19th century dining room,    
  antique bottles and garden path to nowhere are linked to Ballarat's   
  boom and bust, death in the Victorian goldfields and the power of     
  family.                                                               
                                                                        
  This is an exciting new series format where the walls really do       
  talk. Beneath the floorboards, between the walls, under the eaves,    
  or somewhere deep down in the garden, the secrets of the past are     
  just waiting to be revealed - because every home has a story to tell.
