Since Iâ€™ve uploaded this torrent, a lot â€“ at least 100 (probably more) â€“ has downloaded it. At this moment the number of downloaderâ€™s is a little bit more than 100. And only 4 (!) seeders, including me.
You all have to help seed what you download.
I, or any uploader, canâ€™t be sole responsible for the life of our torrents. If you believe so, we canâ€™t upload anything new; weâ€™re going to be busy seeding our old torrents. SO PLEASE SEED!!"
