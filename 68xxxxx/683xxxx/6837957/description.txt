Peatbog Faeries provide another reminder of the strength and variety of the Scottish music scene. They are based in the Isle of Skye, just over the water from North Uist, the inspiration for so many Julie Fowlis songs, but their approach to traditional themes could hardly be more different. The Faeries are a contemporary instrumental dance band who match rapid-fire bagpipe, fiddle and whistle solos with guitar, keyboards and electronica, occasional brass, and an impressively confident rhythm section. They are festival favourites and best experienced live, but there's an engagingly live feel to this latest all-instrumental set, which ranges from furious work-outs to more thoughtful mood pieces, some written by their new fiddle-player Peter Tickell, who can also be heard in Sting's band. At their best, on tracks such as The Naughty Step, they start with bubbling electronica, sturdy percussion and a solid bass riff, then introduce hypnotic work-outs on pipe or fiddle. Slower, more atmospheric pieces, including Fishing at Orbost and Ascent of Conival, would make great film music.
