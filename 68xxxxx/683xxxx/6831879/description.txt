A stranger with no memory of his past stumbles into the hard desert town of Absolution. The only hint to his history is a mysterious shackle that encircles one wrist. What he discovers is that the people of Absolution don't welcome strangers, and nobody makes a move on its streets unless ordered to do so by the iron-fisted Colonel Dolarhyde (Ford). It's a town that lives in fear. But Absolution is about to experience fear it can scarcely comprehend as the desolate city is attacked by marauders from the sky. Screaming down with breathtaking velocity and blinding lights to abduct the helpless one by one, these monsters challenge everything the residents have ever known. Now, the stranger they rejected is their only hope for salvation. As this gunslinger slowly starts to remember who he is and where he's been..

* What is DXVA?
DXVA, or DirectX Video Accelleration, is a system built into Windows operating systems
since Windows XP that allows programs, if they support it, to offload the decoding of
certain media codecs to the GPU. Doing so reduces the strain on the CPU and allows for
even High Definition content to be played on a relatively weak system.
