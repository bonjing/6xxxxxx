SYNOPSIS

Twelve hundred years ago the people of Tibet developed a comprehensive medical 
system. They understood how the mind affects the body. They knew subtle ways of 
changing the body's chemistry with medicines made from plants and minerals. 
They blessed their medicines in lengthy rituals. And they encoded this knowledge 
in a series of elaborate paintings called thangkas. Blue Buddha: Lost Secrets of 
Tibetan Medicine traces the odyssey of traditional Tibetan medicine from it's 
roots in ancient Tibet, to a worldwide interest in it's traditional medical wisdom. 

We meet several leading physicians in India, as the program introduces us to the 
basic concepts of this ancient system of healing. We also trace the fate of the 
77 thangkas that comprise the Atlas of Tibetan Medicine, the great mnemonic 
device that encodes the entire system of healing. From the snows of Siberia and 
the Himalayas to the vital culture of Tibet in exile, in Dharamsala, India, this 
is a stunning high-definition look at where Tibetan medicine has come from.
