
Taken From Introduction 


From the beginning, Peter Steidlmayer recognized that the basic
pattern of market behavior is a continuing point, counterpoint:
imbalance, balance, imbalance, balance, etc. Now, in his latest work,
he relates this continuum to the process of distribution. His recent
research shows that the market's ultimate common denominator is a
balanced distribution-in other words, the bell shaped curve.
When market activity forms a bell shaped profile, a segment of
market action is complete. Stated another way, a balanced distribution
is the long-term framework to which you relate short-term
moves in individual sessions.
Market Profile Â®data captures and continuously updates this
development.
