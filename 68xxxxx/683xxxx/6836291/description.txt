- DA2 DLC Pack Installer will patch the game to v.1.03 ONLY if an
  older version is found.

- After patching to v.1.03 it will backup your original
  DragonAge2.exe into a zip file named 103_BACKUP.zip located in the
  bin_ship folder and replace the file with v.1.03 NODVD version from
  Fairlight.
  
  * Be sure if your using an old version and using a NODVD fix to put
  the original exe back to prevent v.1.03 patch from failing.

Notes (Originally from illiria):

* You may (depending on an Act you are playing) need to access your
  Special Deliveries chest twice in order to obtain Signature
  Edition and Pre-Order Bonus Items. Which means that you will need
  to exit the house, and return again.

* In order to have the Mabari war hound in your party, you need to
  open the character's ability tree, and drag the Summon Mabari icon
  to your on-screen ability quick-access list.
