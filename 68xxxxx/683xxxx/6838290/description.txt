Blue Gold: World Water Wars
In every corner of the globe, we are polluting, diverting, pumping, and wasting our limited supply of fresh water at an expediential level as population and technology grows. The rampant overdevelopment of agriculture, housing and industry increase the demands for fresh water well beyond the finite supply, resulting in the desertification of the earth. Corporate giants force developing countries to privatize their water supply for profit. Wall Street investors target desalination and mass bulk water export schemes. Corrupt governments use water for economic and political gain. Military control of water emerges and a new geo-political map and power structure forms, setting the stage for world water wars. With over one billion people in the world having little or no access to clean and safe water; and with almost 2 million children dying each year because of it, such war is not a far fetched guess. By most estimates, in about 25 years, as much as two-thirds of the world's population will be living in conditions of water scarcity; and the demand for water will outweigh the world supply by half. There are already some 30 Nation States currently facing serious water shortages.
