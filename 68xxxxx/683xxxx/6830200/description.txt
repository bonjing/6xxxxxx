Episode 2

The police now have two murder cases, both victims having military backgrounds. Sarah Lund and Ulrik Strange start to investigate the possibility of a link between the two. In parliament, while in the middle of complicated political negotiations, Buch deals with the publicised terror threat and a possible connection to Islamist fundamentalists. Meanwhile at Herstedvester Prison, Jens Peter Raben is still in isolation when he finds out that his friend has been murdered.
