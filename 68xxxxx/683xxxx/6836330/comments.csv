ifferent people over and over and you may call your god different names but the main message your religion conveys is to be kind to your fellow man and sow good in this world, I don't understand this hatred towards another religion, muslim people may take credit for a particular wrong doing but that doesn't mean all muslims are bad people it means that some extremist ( I think people have lost sight of the true meaning of this word) has taken the words of his/her particular religious document whether it be the Bible or the Qur'an or any other book, tome or novel (*cough* Dianetics *cough*) etc and twisted those words to fulfil their agenda, this agenda may be formed out of ignorance, frustration or greed, a lot of these people are misguided, they are led to believe what they are doing is right, on the contrary some of the people are doing it for personal gain, the point of my rant is, shut the fuck up, live YOUR life, and tell me if this fucking rip is good quality or not (and perhaps a rating out of 10 for the film, I'm not pushing for that though)

consider that I am athiest, white, 21, and an electrician that lives with his girlfriend before you throw ridiculous assumptions at me and make yourself a fool, I was also pissed while writing this rant but I'm just really tired of hearing these fucking ignorant religious arguments on a medium such as piratebay.

P.S I also realise my hipocrisy by criticising Scientology discreetly... but seriously no ones going to read Harry Potter and in 50 years start worshipping Lord Voldemort (I hope) so I don't really respect Scientology as a religion. "
