SYNOPSIS

A group of Tibetan monks find themselves torn between spiritual enlightenment 
and their love for football in The Cup. While the Football World Cup is being played 
in France, two young Tibetan refugees arrive from Tibet at a monastery in exile 
in India. Its atmosphere of serene contemplation is somewhat disrupted by football 
fever, the chief instigator being a young student, the soccer enthusiast Orgyen. 
Prevented by various circumstances from seeing the matches on television in a 
nearby village, Orgyen asks for permission to watch the upcoming World Cup Final 
between France and Brazil; the Geko and Khenpo say yes. However, now the monks 
have to figure out how to pay for the satellite dish they'll need to pull in the 
broadcast. The Cup was shown as part of the Directors Fortnight series at the 
1999 Cannes Film Festival.
