This site contains exclusive information about a new type of Fusion reactor which exist only on paper, so far. Some  theory and calculations of the concept is based on known theory from other fusion research. Some information is only assumed, because no practical data is available yet. Its only proposal of a very interesting idea. The Theory's still have to be reviewed by other people  and practical research still have to be done. This knowledge is shared to convince an organization, institute or company to put the idea into practice. In theory most of the problems known in Tokamak and other fusion reactors seemed to be solved. The idea is patented and approved to be unique. Read further and convince yourselfâ€¦
