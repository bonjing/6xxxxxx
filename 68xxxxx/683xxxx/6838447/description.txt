Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a martial art, combat sport, and a self defense system that focuses on grappling and especially ground fighting. About 80% of all free fights end on the ground. The art was derived from the Japanese martial art of Kodokan judo in the early 20th century.

It teaches that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend against a bigger, stronger assailant by using leverage and proper techniqueâ€”most notably by applying joint-locks and chokeholds to defeat the other person. BJJ training can be used for sport grappling tournaments (gi and no-gi) and mixed martial arts (MMA) competition or self defense.

Today, nearly all MMA fighters train in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu due to the success that past practitioners have had in the sport. 

Vale tudo, meaning "everything allowed", or "anything goes" are full-contact unarmed combat events, with a limited number of rules, that became popular in Brazil during the 20th century. While vale tudo uses techniques from many martial art styles (BJJ), making it similar to modern mixed martial arts competitions, it is a distinct style in its own right.
