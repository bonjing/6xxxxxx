Side notes: Sorry no screenie Bayimg is down. Original copy i got from here, had a email harvester virus + trojan backdoor + dropper on the installer on it, then you got to install the program. This has the email harvester and trojan dropper + backdoor removed (TEST IT, I DARE YA! LOL!) For the absolute file piggy that hates to download the TXT file wit their downloads and come back and flame on the torrent sites they can't register the program. Click Help, you see Enter Registration Code or something simliar, click it, enter in the following:

Name : H3X4 Code : 48C01A31

Voila cracked, you wont even need to restart the program or your computer. And if you come back and say my torrents are nasty viruses, may the next chocolate bar that you buy at the local convience store contain a chocolate dipped rat and you not notice its the butt end until after the first bite. I've sent this to well over 30 of my own friends for youtube flv conversion to mp3 or conversion to handhelds and they all boast its glory so much i've had well over 1000 download thru my MU account.
