  A powerful, provocative series from celebrated filmmaker Adam         
  Curtis, which argues that humans have unwittingly been colonised by   
  machines.                                                             
                                                                        
  A series of films exploring the idea that we have been colonised by   
  the machines that we have built, seeing everything in the world       
  today through the eyes of computers.                                  
                                                                        
  Episode One: Love and Power                                           
                                                                        
  A dream rose up in the 1990s that computers could create a new kind   
  of stable world, bringing about a new kind of global capitalism free  
  of all risk and without the boom and bust of the past. They would     
  also abolish political power and create a new kind of democracy       
  through the internet where millions of individuals would be           
  connected as nodes in cybernetic systems  without hierarchy. This    
  episode tells the story of two perfect worlds.                        
                                                                        
  One is the small group of disciples around the novelist Ayn Rand in   
  the 1950s. They saw themselves as a prototype for a future society    
  where everyone could follow their own selfish desires. The other is   
  the global utopia that digital entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley set    
  out to create in the 1990s. They were joined by Alan Greenspan who    
  became convinced that the computers were creating a new kind of       
  stable capitalism  Like a new planet, he said. But the dream of    
  stability in both worlds would be torn apart by two dynamic human     
  forces: love and power.
