The coup is the most frequently attempted method of changing government, and the most successful. Coup d\' Ã‰tat outlines the mechanism of the coup and analyzes the conditions: political, military, and social, that gives rise to it. In doing so, the book sheds much light on societies where power does indeed grow out of the barrel of a gun and the role of law is a concept little understood.

This is a rare book and can be hard to find on any torrent site. This book covers all the realistic conditions for most coup d\'etat. Its age really changes nothing. The political systems in place haven\'t changed enough to invalidate the points herein. In fact, as you may notice, the book probably may have even more validity now. -uploader
