Road Rockers is a scorcher taped 95 percent live-on-the-floor over two days with very few overdubs. It's an honest recording, in the same way that you could always count on Janis Joplin to exude sincerity. "This Is My Life" provides the album's highlight, a passionate statement on individualism -- complete with gut-churning guitar solo -- that makes you wish it was your life too. The disc includes both an acoustic and an electric rendition of Dylan's "Highway 61 Revisited." While it's the latter that appears on the soundtrack album for Bruce McDonald's film Highway 61, the acoustic version allows the subtleties and full-range of Chiarelli's expressive vocal instrument to shine. 

Rita Chiarelli (vocals, guitar); Colin Linden, Rod Phillips, Richard Bell.
