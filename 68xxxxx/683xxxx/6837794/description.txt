A PROMISE FOR THE
FAMILY OF MAN
In 1972, Maharishi went to Houston to inaugurate the first
standardized 33-lcsson course in his Science of Creative Intelligence
taught in the U.S.
During his one-week stay, he visited NASA as the guest of
meditating astronaut Rusty Schweikert, received the key to the
city from the mayor, spoke to the Houston Symphony and the
Texas Bar Association, and granted numerous radio and TV
interviews.
The highlight of the week, recorded on this tape, was
Maharishi\'s memorable lecture on his Science of Creative
Intelligence to an audience of 2,900 in Houston\'s famous Jones
Hall.
