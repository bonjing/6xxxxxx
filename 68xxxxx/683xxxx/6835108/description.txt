DEscriptION
Itâ€™s a well known fact that Microsoft doesnâ€™t provide language packs for its operating systems before releasing the Beta of the OS. Windows 8 is still in pre-beta stage, so we canâ€™t expect official language packs for Windows 8 at this point of time.

Here is how to install language packs in Windows 8 Developer Preview:

Step 1: Create a manual system restore point before proceeding to the next step. 

Step 2: Download a language pack and My WDP Universal Language Pack Installer software from here (this Torrent). 

Step 3: Run the MY WDP Language Pack Installer and use the browse button to brose to the language pack that you have downloaded in step 2. Click select button and wait for a few minutes to complete the procedure.

Step 4: Once done, reboot your PC, go to Control Panel > Language, click Add button, select the language pack that you just installed. Finally, log off and log on to change the language.
