    Steve Seost, a veteran musician, luthier and guitar repairman demonstrates
    the proper techniques of the basic set-up and maintenance of the four 
    primary guitar types: solid body fixed bridge, solid body floating tremolo 
    bridge, acoustic, and bass. Steve also demonstrates the correct way to
    change strings, adjust the neck, assess the nut, adjust the pick-up height,
    and set the intonation and action so that your instrument is ready for
    whatever you are. Whether you are a seasoned guitarist or a beginner,
    you will benefit from Steves clear and concise instruction.
