State-Sponsored Terrorism, Crimes, and Lies - Collection 4 (Israel revisited):

The emphasis of this upload is on the crimes against humanity committed by the Zionist State of Israel. Of course Israel can commit these crimes with virtual immunity with the protection and support of the USA and other Western countries. This subject was covered in the previous uploads of this series and the upload entitled: â€œRacism and the Myth of the Chosen Peopleâ€.
