 :::::[ PLOT SUMMARY ]:::::
 
                                                                       
   Two brothers try to create a miracle in I Wish, the latest film     
   from acclaimed Japanese director Kore-eda Hirokazu. Despite being   
   produced for a mass audience and various commercial interests       
   (including Japan Rail), the editor-writer-director manages to       
   retain his signature documentary style and his eye for capturing    
   subtly powerful emotional moments.                                  
   After their parents' divorce, brothers Koichi and Ryunosuke are     
   forced to live separately. While the older Koichi is miserable in   
   Kagoshima with his mother and grandparents, the younger Ryunosuke   
   enjoys a laid-back life with his musician father in Fukuoka.        
   Despite their different lives, the two brothers - who often         
   contact each other on their cell phones - want desperately for      
   their family to reunite. One day, Koichi hears that the energy      
   generated when two trains on the new Kyushu bullet train line pass  
   each other can make any wish come true, as long as the wisher is    
   present. Koichi and Ryunosuke then decide to hatch a plan - with    
   the assistance of their friends and other adults - that involves    
   meeting at where the two trains pass and combine their wishes for   
   a better chance of a reunion.
