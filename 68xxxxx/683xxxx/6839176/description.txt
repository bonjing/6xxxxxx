"Man is born free - yet everywhere he is in chains" - Jean-Jacques Rousseau
(The social contract) - Perhaps the greatest known French Philosopher of
them all.

In order to gain moral freedom says Rousseau, it is necessary to impose a
tyranny of sorts - in the application of societal laws - the effects of which 
would be to free man from the worse fate - of being at the whims of instinct
rather than moral reason in guiding his affairs. (Hobbes uses a slightly similar
approach I submit).

He does suggest that Christians are happy to become slaves rather than
masters of their own fate perhaps and he isn't any kinder to the Jewish faith
either in his appraisal of its fate in most societies as a result of having
"too many rituals" as he puts it (section 2d). Many a time he seems to express
a cynical disposition towards human nature overall that would suggest he has not
a man who could have been without some need to conform as perhaps from within
he lacked a good enough enthusiasm of his own to fit in with humankind equally
across the board. He even gave up his own children (fully five in fact) to
institutional living - blaming others for his lack of better luck as it were.
