How to create usb stick with win7 bootable:

Method1:

this will work only on vista or 7 enviroment NOT in XP!
you'll need a 4-8gb fast usb stick - insert it (all information on the usbkey will be lost)
in cmd type:

01. diskpart
02. list disk
03. select disk 3,7 or whatever (usb stick!!!!! not your hdd!!!)
04. clean
05. create partition primary
06. select partition 1
07. active
08. format fs=fat32
09. assign
10. exit

Now to copy Windows Seven's DVD content to the Flash Drive
Simply type in CMD the following command to start copying all the content from the Windows Vista/7 DVD to your newly formatted high speed flash drive.
xcopy /s/e/f F:\*.* H:\

where F is your dvdrom or daemontools virtual dvdrom and H is the letter or your usb stick
(F and H are just for example - your letters might be different so pay attantion!)

Note x64 boot is diffrent than x86 32bit boot so you really need to make all these steps if 
you use the same usb key where you have x86 win.

boot up install enjoy

Method2:
use ultraiso to put iso image to usbkey - also works with win 2k, xp


How to activate office:

On C: drive I put a hidden folder called IT - i'll explain below it's purpose
So after install win and all the drivers do not update windows yet, go to C:\IT
Because IT folder is hidden you may type in a explorer window in addresbar C:\IT and hit enter...
There you have OTK2010V216.rar and IORRT 3.5.cmd
Option 1: Unrar and use EZactivator to have activated office with 180 days till next activation
Option 2: Use IORRT to have unactivated office with 30 days reset counter on every restart forever
NOTE: You can't use EZactivator if you have IORRT installed

While the EZactivator installs autoKMS and other goodies the antivil will pop-up that detects unwanted software so you need to allow these in order to activate otherwise activation will fail. The activator is easy to use and if it fails first time you have other options to try again. Don't worry it will work just check green log on it's main window scroll down to see the result. Should state succesfully activated.

What for is that IT hidden folder:

This is only for advanced users so if you're a regular user don't bother...
It's purpose is to install specific drivers during windows installation so when windows complete to install the drivers will be also installed and the system is ready to go.

How can be done?
Well if you use dvd.iso it can't, you need to create usb stick.

After create your usb pen drive with wf7sp1x64 installation files you have to prepopulate usb\...\IT\Drivers\corresponding subfolders with DIGITALLY SIGNED drivers of your coresponding hardware.
First you have to download the drivers and unpack them. Don't use .exe drivers just inf, cat etc- the uncompressed form of the driver
Navigate to usb stick to ...\sources\$OEM$\$1\IT\Drivers\ there you have a directory structure with audio, video, chipset, etc place your drivers into the corresponding folders without changing the names of the folders, keep the directory structure intact! ADD ONLY THE DRIVERS THAT YOU KNOW ARE OK, AND IF WIN 7 KNOWS THE CHIPSET LET IT BE, ADD ONLY WHAT IT MUST BE ADDED!
If you have a driver that can't be unpacked you can place it to soft folder and define silent swiches in the install.cmd file for example the nvidia driver:
the file from internet is let's say 266.58_desktop_win7_winvista_32bit_international_whql.exe it can be unpacked/extracted to a folder that contains a lot of other folders and files needed for a full option install of driver with DisplayControlPanel, PhysX, etc but the main is setup.exe along with setup.cfg so we need to run setup.exe just with silent swich, the rest will take care setup.cfg file.
So in usbkey ..\sources\$OEM$\$1\IT\Drivers\Soft\ we create a folder nv that contains all files and folders needed for nvidia driver and now  we have to edit install.cmd like that:


original:

In a simmilary fashion you can install a touchpad driver or a activeprotect driver the trick is to find silent swiches for them
setup.exe /q or dpinst.exe /s ...you got the ideea
Remember that has to be signed drivers otherwise you'll be prompded to "continue anyway" thing...
Of cause I could use bcedit functions to temporary disable dirvers signing policy but another restart is not quite welcomed...

enjoy, post your opinion
