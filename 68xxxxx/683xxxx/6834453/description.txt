Eh...this mod will make your game run with full 4gb(original launcher will only use 2gb), remember those fps dip in the city and those shitty crash every now and then? Well those problems will be lessen with this mod(not completely but you'll notice the different).

This mod is not mine, I just saw it somewhere on the net and though that it would be useful. The original moder who made this mod is MonochromeWench.

Instruction:

First, make sure Steam is running. Then run Skyrim4GB.exe to launch the game! 
You don't even need it in the games directory, just make sure skyrim4gb.exe and
skyrim4gb_helper.dll are together.

If your version of Skyrim is not the standard version with the
SteamAppID of 72850 you need to run Skyrim4gb.exe and specify the actual 
SteamAppID on the command line. Example: Skyrim4gb.exe 72850



Happy gaming:)
