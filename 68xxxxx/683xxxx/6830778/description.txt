His captors want him to assemble a missile for them but instead he creates an armored suit and a means to prevent his death from the shrapnel left in his chest by the attack. He uses the armored suit to escape. Back in the U.S. he announces his company will cease making weapons and he begins work on an updated armored suit only to find that Obadiah Stane, his second in command at Stark industries has been selling Stark weapons to the insurgents. He uses his new suit to return to Afghanistan to destroy the arms and then to stop Stane from misusing his research.

* What is DXVA?
DXVA, or DirectX Video Accelleration, is a system built into Windows operating systems
since Windows XP that allows programs, if they support it, to offload the decoding of
certain media codecs to the GPU. Doing so reduces the strain on the CPU and allows for
even High Definition content to be played on a relatively weak system.
