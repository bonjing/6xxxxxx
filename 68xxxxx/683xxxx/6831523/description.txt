Web Technologies: A Computer Science Perspective is ideal for courses in Web-based Systems (aka Web/Internet Programming/Systems) in Computer Science, MIS, and IT departments.

 
This text introduces the key technologies that have been developed as part of the birth and maturation of the World Wide Web. It provides a consistent, in-depth treatment of technologies that are unlikely to receive detailed coverage in non-Web computer science courses. Students will find an ongoing case study that integrates a wide spectrum of Web technologies, guidance on setting up their own software environments, and a variety of exercises and project assignments.
