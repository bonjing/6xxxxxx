The perfect foundation for all your holiday projects
Just in time to get that last-minute holiday project completed, we bring you another new Special Edition downloadable collection from our popular Canvases graphic background product line! Taking up where the first volume left off, Christmas Canvases 2 adds to your holiday graphic resources with 45 all-new Christmas and New Year\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s-themed image backgrounds, each delivered in 5 useful size formats for a total of 225 brand new seasonal images. No more staring at a blank page or an empty timeline hoping for inspiration. This sumptuous new library of subtle background images provides a wide variety of powerful starting points for your next holiday-themed creation. Unlike our more complex Juice Drops illustrations, Canvases are not about layers and lots of graphic elements. They are about giving your text, your photos and your ideas the perfect foundation to come alive and project your message.
Look at any professionally designed poster or brochure and you are unlikely to find a simple solid color background. Instead you will find a sophisticated mix of color and texture that creates a perfect backdrop for the product or message being promoted. This is what Christmas Canvases 2 provides for you - without all the hard work. It gives you an interesting holiday graphic base and a creative nudge to get your ideas flowing and your project moving. Christmas Canvases 2 images provide a subtle themed environment that enhances your product, text, or photos and makes your material stand out. In most cases, a simple reflection is all you will need to make your product or text message blend completely into the background graphic as if it were born there.
