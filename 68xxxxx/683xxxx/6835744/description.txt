  A powerful, provocative series from celebrated filmmaker Adam         
  Curtis, which argues that humans have unwittingly been colonised by   
  machines.                                                             
                                                                        
  A series of films exploring the idea that we have been colonised by   
  the machines that we have built, seeing everything in the world       
  today through the eyes of computers.                                  
                                                                        
  Episode Two: The Use and Abuse of Vegetational Concepts               
                                                                        
  This is the story of how our modern scientific idea of nature, the    
  self-regulating ecosystem, is actually a fantasy based on cybernetic  
  ideas that were projected on to nature in the 1950s by ambitious      
  scientists. A static machine theory of order that sees humans, and    
  everything else on the planet, as components, cogs in a system. But   
  in an age disillusioned with politics, the self-regulating ecosystem  
  has become the model for utopian ideas of human "self-organising      
  networks"  dreams of new ways of organising societies without        
  leaders, as in the Facebook and Twitter revolutions, and in global    
  visions of connectivity like the Gaia theory.                         
                                                                        
  This powerful idea emerged out of the hippie communes in America in   
  the 1960s, and from counterculture computer scientists who believed   
  that global webs of computers could liberate the world. At the very   
  moment this was happening, the science of ecology discovered that     
  the theory of the self-regulating ecosystem wasnt true. Instead      
  they found that nature was really dynamic and constantly changing in  
  unpredictable ways. But the dream of the self-organising network had  
  by now captured our imaginations.
