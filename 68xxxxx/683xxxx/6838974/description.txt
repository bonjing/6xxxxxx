Are you ready? This is m first special file that I ever created with nLite. This is a program that you an intergrate hotfixes, addons, updates, drivers, tweaks, and more. You can check it out and download it at, "www.nliteos.com" I added addons and removed some components that is not very optional. (f you see a classic startup like Windows 2000, I just edit the startup with nLite to be in classic mode, so your setup can be faster, instead of being so slow. (Especially old computers.) Thi file is called, "Windows XP SP3 Home Edition Special, by Windows10". I will tell you what addons I add in. (I removed Games, Internet Games, Paint, Pinball, MSN Messenger, Outlook Express, and Windows Messenger.) I think. Here are the addons I added in the installation.

Addons Added:

Windows Media Player 11
XP Vista Pack (Tell me if you are having problems with this addon.)
Yahoo Widgets
CCleaner 3.12
Firefox 8.01
Winrar 4.01

So, I will make more special editions of windows. Enjoy my first special edition of windows xp and please seed, comment me if there are any problems with this file.
