To intergrate Windows Media Player 11 with nLite, first download Windows Media PLayer 11 Intergration for Windows XP. Here is the link: http://www.windowsupdatesdownloader.com/ProgramFiles.aspx
Just click the download from the Subheading, ""WMP11 Intergrator"" on the page.
(If you want Windows XP Service Pack 3 and updates of it, download Windows Updates Downloader from that page also. Then, on the page, click the tab, ""Update Lists (ULs)"". Then, scroll down until you see Windows XP Service Pack 3 or 2. (It can be x64 or x86, whenever it matches your machine type.) Click download and open the file, or save. (If save, go to that file of where you downloaded it: Like the ""Downloads"" folder. Then click on it.) Now, you will get a message. (Don't worry, it's not an error.) Open ""Windows Updates Downloader"" then you'll see a list of columns for updates of Service Pack 3. Click the column that says Windows Service Pack 3, also Windows Media Player column you should check to intergrate it. After that, go to your Document folder and you'll see Windows Updates Downloader. Click on it then you'll see two folders whatever you just downloaded. Now, open nLite. Click the tab, ""Hotfixes, Updates"" something like that and click ""Intergration of Service Pack"" tab also. For intergration service pack, open the Windows XP Service Pack 3 you just downloaded and wait until it's done. Then, for intergration for hotfixes, updates, add-ons, click the select button of the page and open you downloaded Windows Media Player 11 setup. Now, during the slipstream of nLite, they will ask you to download WMP11 Intergrator. Now open WMP11 intergrator and select windows Media Player 11 for Xp setup. Put the output on the nLite root folder from your hard drive on folder, ""Program Files"". Then, continue nlite and there you go. Enjoy! (Note: If you want to integrate drivers to your installation, use nLite and select the tab, ""Drivers Intergration"". Thanks for asking that question, please seed!"
