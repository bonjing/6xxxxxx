A long-running series of adventures featuring Robin of Locksley--Robin Hood--and his group of 
Sherwood-Forest-based freedom fighters. Robin and his men protected England from the evil 
machinations of Prince John while good King Richard was away at the Crusades. The series was 
primarily intended for children, and was unusual in that it frequently re-used the same actors 
in different roles, or different actors in a recurring roles.
