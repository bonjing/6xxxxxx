Plato's Republic has interesting ideas for those that argue mainly on semantics
and make generalizations that fail to take into account crucial elements such as
the true nature of what is fundamentally of human merit and concern and a core
part of whatever is to be truly considered is soul.


Could we really be convinced that virtue means only doing the one thing you are fit
for in respect of a vocation? Are wives and children truly to be held in common?
Such apparent Socratic wisdom fails the test of human sensibility in its application
in any event - I daresay. It isn't true wisdom as it isn't humanly practical.

But then we do have some wisdom from this greatly famous work - for example we are
told that justice is not found in just paying back what you owe r always telling the
truth. we are given an example of where using simple rules rather than greater 
principles would make this clear in any real bid for true justice.

I would have been grateful for this in my senior philosophy studies at the university
of Alberta under Professor Carmichael back then! So much reading indeed!
