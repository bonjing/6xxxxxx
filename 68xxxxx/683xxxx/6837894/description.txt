K heres the scoop on this file and why im uploading a driver file to Pirates Bay. These controllers are not dealt with anymore. Gravis doesnt have drivers to them, despite all the forums and such telling you to go to this backdoor ftp link to get the files. Impossible, period, the links are dead. All of them, even the old/outdated/legacy areas of Gravis dont have drivers past 98. I've gotten these to work on XP and since i thought i had the only 2 controllers left in the world of these and then my neighbour gets 2 and friends find more of them and no ones even gotten a disk with them. WE NEEDED A NEW COPY ONLINE. Found these over a year ago thru some foreign site. I've checked them myself they do work. XP will give you some headaches putting them in, the installer was built for 95/98 not XP however will run and install the proper drivers (or if you are knowledgeable about driver searches on your pc, they are inside this pack) One of mine came with the usb converter, but these are digital pads and the converter will only handle one at a time, while every tom, dick and harry have a midi game port on their sound cards, this is the solution. I couldve wrote a site about these, naw, lol i got work doing GCPPW.com's videos lol, to busy, but to post it to torrent, all the time in the world. So i hope this helps someone else out, they worked great for me.

I dont have any specifics about these things, dont even know if they got force feedback to be honest. But i figure i might just make someone elses day putting this up. Seen driver packs before on here. What the heck, a single driver...enjoy! No password on the zip file.
