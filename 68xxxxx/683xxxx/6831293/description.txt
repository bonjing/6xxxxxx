Lee Blaske - The immortal kiss of the Vampire 


The piano and his vocals entwine and invoke. The sensuality practically drips off the CD. The darkness of his subject comes forth, but rather than being a frightening cold dark, it is the warm comforting dark of a womb. Beautiful. I primarily use it for mood music and background. I find it very soothing. It begs the question... Fair warning, one listen and you will be hooked.
