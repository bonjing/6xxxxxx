Dawn Kinnard's 2008 album, The Courtesy Fall.


Taken from her official website's 'bio' section:
"Dawn Kinnard doesnâ€™t need a biography. She needs professional help. Or thatâ€™s at least what you or I might prescribe. But thatâ€™s because we subscribe to the traditional approach to self perception and method of understanding our own place in the universe. In reality, thereâ€™s nothing wrong with her, she does things a little differently...

Those familiar with her 2008 album â€˜The Courtesy Fallâ€™ will already know her smoky, raspy voice which encapsulates sadness and songs which explore themes such as solitude and lost love through insightful tales full of witty lyrics and black humour...

Just a couple of short years ago, Dawn released her debut album. Brimming over with brains, beauty and most importantly, amazing melodies. â€˜The Courtesy Fallâ€™ found Dawn drawing comparisons to the likes of Martha Wainwright and Cerys Matthews and finding critical acclaim at every turn."
