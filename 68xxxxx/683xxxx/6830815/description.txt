Synopsis

Small Acts of Resistance (How Courage, Tenacity and Ingenuity 
Can Change the World), is a book by Steve Crawshaw and John 
Jackson. The book contains over 80 true stories from 60 countries 
exploring people's ability to resist injustice and change the 
world around them. The preface is written by Vaclav Havel, 
former President of the Czech Republic.

Big changes often start with acts that looked pointless at the 
time: small acts of resistance, bold acts of defiance, subtle 
acts of subversion, even witty acts of disobedience. The small 
acts range from famous struggles such as those against Nazism 
and Communism and for Civil Rights to ones that have been 
ignored by the media or are still continuing.

The protagonists range from a few icons to, mainly, people who 
have been unjustly forgotten or have remained anonymous. Telling 
the stories of more than eighty acts of resistance, spanning the 
world and the 20th and 21st centuries, this book pays homage to 
the groups and individuals that treat the impossible as the 
possible that just hasnÃ†t happened yet. Small Acts of Resistance 
celebrates the awe-inspiring ingenuity and courage of the human 
spirit and pays tribute to those who have been standing up to say "no".
