Of course, the sooner mistakes are caught, the less costly they become. Based on the authorsâ€™ combined experience working on projects large and small, Construction Management: Subcontractor Scopes of Work delineates how project teams can avoid mistakes and run projects more intelligently, effectively, and efficiently.

This bookâ€™s concentration on the nuts and bolts of a construction project, rather than on basic philosophies and concepts, sets it apart. It focuses not on the mechanics of writing subcontract scopes of work, but on why they are written the way they are. Designed by contractors for contractors, this is not a book of simple checklists describing how to address various issues, but a compilation of practical examples and lessons learned to form a knowledge base that can be applied to any project. This knowledge can be used to prepare bid documents that clearly define the roles of the various subcontractors, ensuring the full scope of the project is covered without redundancy or duplication.
