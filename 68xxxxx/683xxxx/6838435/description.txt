
 Modeling Uncertainty in the Earth Sciences highlights the various issues, techniques and practical modeling tools available for modeling uncertainty of complex Earth systems and the impact that it has on practical situations. The aim of the book is to provide an introductory overview which covers a broad range of tried-and-tested tools. Descriptions of concepts, philosophies, challenges, methodologies and workflows give the reader an understanding on how to make optimal decisions under uncertainty for Earth Science problems.

The book covers key issues such as: Spatial and time aspect; large complexity and dimensionality;   computation power; costs of â€˜engineeringâ€™ the Earth; uncertainty in the modeling and decision process. Focusing on reliable and practical methods this book provides and invaluable primer for the complex areas of decision making with uncertainty in the Earth Sciences.
