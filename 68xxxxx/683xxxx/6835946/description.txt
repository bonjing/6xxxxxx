Here is a brand new white label from jivid.  

Jivid kills this Tech N9ne remix with some sick drumstep flava.

Stay tuned... 2012 is just around the corner. More tracks coming from skrilla, jivid, 

Genghis bomb, autocide and me.. the one and only... superstar dj apostasy. 

Thanks for all the support.
