The major crossover between Suicide Squad and Checkmate with implications for every US intelligence agency in the DC Universe.  War breaks out between Suicide Squad, Checkmate, Project Peacemaker, Project Atom, CBI, and Force of July and featured Manhunter and Firestorm.

"The Janus Directive" was an eleven-part comic book crossover first published by DC Comics between May and June of 1989. Among the creators who contributed to the storyline were writers John Ostrander, Kim Yale, Paul Kupperberg, Cary Bates and Greg Weisman and artists John K. Snyder III, Rick Hoberg, Rafael Kayanan, Tom Mandrake and Pat Broderick.
A pretty cool crossover that sheds light on later intelligence series including later versions of Suicide Squad and Checkmate.
Note: This crossover was included in the Checkmate v1 torrent.
