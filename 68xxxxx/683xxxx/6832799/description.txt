Synopsis:
-----------

41 1 "Back in Black" Seung-Hyun Oh Paul Giacoppo November 11, 2011  

Six months into the future, Rex learns that Black Knight became the head of Providence after White Knight went against the orders of his superiors, the Directorate. During this time-skip, Providence has adopted a new method of dealing with captured E.V.O.S. Instead of researching the incurable creatures, they now use a machine to brainwash them into servitude. Rex is horrified by this practice and quickly rebels, but is stopped by CÃ©sar and Black Knight. They try to use the mind-control device on him, but he is saved by Dr. Holiday and Agent Six. His friends and White Knight are revealed to have left Providence and established a new movement to combat Black Knight's extremist activities.
