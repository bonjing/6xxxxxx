Plot

Come Dine With Me, the nation's favourite cooking show is back with a follow up to last year's hit DVD: It's Come Dine With Me - Extra Spicy. Packed with all new highlights the DVD is extra saucy, extra loud and extra shocking. It's weirder, it's funnier and it's loaded with even more never-before-seen material 100% exclusive to DVD and of course it's all narrated by Dave Lamb.
