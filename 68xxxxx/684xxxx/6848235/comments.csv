Thanks anyway. "
to MAKE EYE CONTACT with her.

Look long and adoringly into her eyes. Never look down (a sign of submission, timidity, and weakness) and never look at a woman's breasts when you're talking to her (a common mistake many men make). Women will reject you and consider you disrespectful if you do. Maintaining eye contact also says to a woman that you are interested in her and that you want to get to know her. This is a pre-requisite (according to women) to get to know how she is in bed. Also, be sure and SMILE! A smile sends a positive and important message. A smile says, ""I will not reject you. I like you."" A smile combined with prolonged eye contact says, ""I like you a lot. I want to know you. Let's talk."" Women who smile back at you and who maintain eye contact with you too are those who will be most receptive to your advances. Note: Raised eyebrows is also a positive signal which you should interpret as a come-on. These next few tips I want to share with you are truly essential and fall under the heading of WHAT TO SAY.

As far as your opening line goes, well, that would be a whole article all by itself. But after you break the ice with an opening line, the very next thing you should say or do is INTRODUCE YOURSELF. For example, simply say, ""Oh, my name is (your Name). I'm pleased to meet you."" Just use your first name in informal situations, and both your first and last name in more impersonal situations. Then allow the woman you're picking up to offer you her name. Pause for a moment. If she doesn't offer it, ask her what her name is. Then, and this is very important, USE HER NAME in the very next sentence that comes out of your mouth. Using her name works like magic to put her at ease and makes her more interested in you. A person's name is the most important and powerful word you can ever say.

The next thing you want to say or do is COMPLIMENT HER. Call attention to some detail about her, and flatter her in a totally positive way. Be sure to say something specific, that is special about HER. Be polite and creative when dishing out compliments. The more poetic and/or dramatic you can be, the better the results you'll get. Because men lust with their eyes, BUT women lust with their ears! A lot of guys ask me what they should talk about once they get a woman's name and after they have complimented her. What you need to do is find out what she wants, what she desires, or what turns her on, her passion or hobby. Ask her questions about that and you will have captivated her completely. Also, always find ways to agree with her.

NEVER DISAGREE with a woman when you first meet her. You want to create a context of relatedness, and that's done by agreeing with her.

The last tip I leave you with is NEVER BE SHY ABOUT ASKING HER FOR HER PHONE NUMBER. It doesn't matter that you only just met her. Even if you have only spoken with her for as little as one minute! Be direct. You can say something like, ""I have to be going now. But I'd love to see you again. Can I call you?"" Without the all important phone number, you will never get anywhere with a woman. Because to score you will need a date. And to get a date you the number. So ALWAYS ask for the telephone number!
