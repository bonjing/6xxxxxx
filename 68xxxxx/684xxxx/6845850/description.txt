I did not crack this game and i take no credit for it.
I did not find it here so i thought i should up it :3

I used daemon tools to mount it and install. After that i installed in the same fashion cult of mytras and that was it o/ Game work like a charm, happy gaming.
Ps: you need to keep the cd mounted to play it :P

If you like original games this is for you.
It s a bit like total war only there is no turn based in it, just battles and after each battle you upgrade you troops, if you win of course ;)

The upgrades are xp witch adds customization like anti cavalry and block for example and better equipment if you can afford it. Recruitment of new units and so on. I also like that you need a diverse army configuration, unlike most games that you can just stack up on high level killers. I found light infantry to be necessary even in the later parts of the game for example. If you where to just stock up on the most expensive heavy infantry in rough terrain light infantry would pawn you. Any way i liked it, hope you guys also like it :D
