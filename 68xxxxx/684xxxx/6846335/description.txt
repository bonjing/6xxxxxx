It's the legendary TV show that's been popular with audiences for decades, and the longest running weekly prime-time series in television history. The winner of numerous awards, including seven Emmys, it's THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF DISNEY! Uprooted from their comfortable home in Pennsylvania, James and Kate Tanner, along with their sons Virgil and Andy (played by real-life brothers Ron and Clint Howard) journey to the wild country of 1890s Wyoming to become farmers. Soon, they come face-to-face with tornadoes, bears and wolves. But through the hardshipss their love for each other endures, even when a local rancher sees the newcomers as "squatters" on his land, and will stop at nothing -- including murder -- to drive them out. THE WILD COUNTRY is a wondrous adventure full of true grit and courage that celebrates fammily togetherness and determination.
