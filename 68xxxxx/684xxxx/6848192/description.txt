What's new in this new version :

McAfeeÂ® VirusScanÂ® Enterprise is our ï¬‚agship 
anti-malware solution deployed to more than 
60 million endpoints across the globe. It includes 
state-of-the-art technology to proactively stop 
and remove threats while extending protection 
for new security risks.
The primary focus of the McAfee VirusScan 
Enterprise, 8.8 release was to enhance the 
performance of malware scanning to enable end 
users to conduct business without interruption. 
Version 8.8 includes some signiï¬cant performance 
improvements:
ï¿½ï¿½ File-caching performance
ï¿½ï¿½On-demand scanning (ODS)
ï¿½ï¿½On-access scanning (OAS)
ï¿½ï¿½Memory consumption
ï¿½ï¿½ Registry scanning
ï¿½ï¿½ Battery life
ï¿½ï¿½ Boot time
In addition to signiï¬cant performance improvements, 
key components of the product have been redesigned 
to provide a richer end-user experience and improve 
response time. Highlights of the new or enhanced 
capabilities include:
ï¿½ï¿½ Support for Microsoft Outlook 2010
ï¿½ï¿½Complete integration of McAfee AntiSpyware 
Enterprise 
ï¿½ï¿½ Script scan URL exclusions interface
ï¿½ï¿½Added capacity for user-deï¬ned unwanted 
programs 
Performance Improvements
File-caching performance
Every ï¬le being accessed on the system is scanned 
by McAfee VirusScan Enterprise. If the ï¬le is 
found to be clean, these ï¬les are cached, and, the 
next time these ï¬les are accessed, they wonâ€™t be 
scanned again because they were already in cache 
as â€œclean.â€ In McAfee VirusScan Enterprise, 8.7, 
the scan cache was limited to one sessionâ€”in other 
words, once the system was rebooted, the cached 
ï¬les were lost and needed to be scanned and 
cached again, resulting in longer ODS and OAS 
scans. In McAfee VirusScan Enterprise, 8.8, the 
cache is retained, even if the system is rebooted, 
which means the â€œcleanâ€ ï¬les in the cache donâ€™t 
have to be scanned again. This dramatically 
improves scanning time when ï¬les are repeatedly 
being accessed by applications, such as Microsoft 
Outlook or Microsoft Word.
In McAfee VirusScan Enterprise, 8.8 ODS now 
uses or shares the cache generated by on-access 
scanning. This greatly improves the performance 
of ODS scanning because now it will use the results 
of OAS cache to determine if ï¬les need to be
