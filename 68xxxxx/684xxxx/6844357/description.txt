2011 release, the sixth solo album from the singer, songwriter, producer and Fleetwood Mac member. On Seeds We Sow, Lindsey Buckingham has created some of his most personal and intimate lyrics and songs of his storied and award winning career. From the soft melodic pop/rock tinge of End of Time, the album's most rockin' track, One Take, and the almost lullaby-esque hushed tones of the closing number, She Smiles Sweetly, the album showcases Buckingham's full arsenal of skills.
