    Very poor quality DVD release, we did this with a lot of proper          
    filters aka srestore job.. minor ghostie still exists, but it's in       
    vob's too.. so.. this is the best can do.

    An atomic explosion awakens Gammera--a giant, fire-breathing turtle      
    monster--from his millions of years of hibernation. Enraged at being     
    roused from such a sound sleep, he takes it out on Tokyo.
