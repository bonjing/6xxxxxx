  Joe Crowley has been travelling up and down the UK looking at some    
  of the nation's most dangerous roads and asking if there is more      
  that can be done to make these routes safer for those who use them.   
                                                                        
  Joe is in Lancashire looking at the A588, and a section of road       
  where the speed limit and a lack of pedestrian crossings are a        
  hazard to all road users. He meets the family of a teenager           
  seriously injured as she crossed the road, hears from those who live  
  alongside the road and gets the assessment of an independent road     
  safety expert, before confronting the council.                        
                                                                        
  Also on the show, we visit the A1307, just south of Cambridge, to     
  hear how a decade of campaigning saw major improvement work carried   
  out by the council on a notorious and deadly stretch with dramatic    
  results; and Joe visits the Transport Research Laboratory to find     
  out how psychological traffic calming measures can influence the      
  speed of drivers.
