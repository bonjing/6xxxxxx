for let us know that is dark :)"
ng too special, lacking in story, but good if you just want to watch long fight scenes with equal dialogue, the movie cant make up its mind, whether it wants to be action packed, or have some kind of story, but in trying to do this it kind of ruins itself IMO. i give it a 5/10 if you want something to just look at, but 4/10 if you want to actaully connect wiht something"
