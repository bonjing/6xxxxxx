It is 2032 - 20 years after the end of World War III. To survive the
nuclear holocaust, humankind fled from the contaminated surface to find
safety in vast bunkers, cities created deep underground. Decaying
shelters and hideaways set the stage in mankind's struggle for survival
where they battle horrible mutants, bloodthirsty mercenaries and other
threats.

fallout, but also the dark shadows of the past in the role of the
mysterious psychologist Albert. As Albert, the player will be part of a
team of medical scientists in charge of monitoring the fugitives'
mental stability. If Albert does not confront his greatest weaknesses
and deepest fears, he will not survive the claustrophobic depths of the

more secrets than simply the growing madness of its inhabitants. Defy
