hello

this is call of duty mw3 that is in wbfs formate ready to drag to your wbfs formated hard disk drive you need to use iso 250 not 249 to play this you may have to update your cios to get this game to work this is a NTSC-U game will work om all wii systems that are softmoded or hardmoded will work on other region wii's to as well if your setting are adjusted correctly 

to burn'
you need to download an app called wii backup manager search for it yahoo download it then you need to add this file to it then convert it to iso file then after that is done you will need an aditional program call imgburn google that download it install it add the iso file you will then need a dvd-r cd's only dual layers work to but are not needed burn at no faster then 6X people say i personally have the best succes at burning at 2X and another thing is do not do anything else on your pc while this process is being done i noticed if you run other apps or drag drop things on and off your hard drive while doing this that the burn may get corrupted a little bit and make the game a little buggy so make sure not to perform any other task while you are doing this burning at 2X take about 20 or so minutes then put in wii and play
