Be on time and dress for your weather with this skinnable clock

offers a number of enhancements for people who like neat
solutions.

Dress for Your Weather. A digital thermometer, a weather forecast
station, and a dress guide, all in one convenient package.
Weather Clock keeps you updated on the weather at your location,
so you always know what to wear. If you go mobile from time to
time, Weather Clock goes mobile with you: just change the
location to get the weather for where you are at the moment.

Had enough of being late? Feel like you are wasting time? Things
are getting out of control?
Be on Time, Be in Control. The time on your computer will always
be precise with Weather Clock's synch features, but more
importantly, you can organize yourself and get things done by
setting alarms for certain events, appointments, and tasks. Use
the built-in calendar to track appointments or get in synch with
your friends and colleagues using the time zones tracking
feature.

You can now go to bed without stopping to shut down your computer
or you can depend on Weather Clock to shut down the computer when
it's time to go to bed. Customize the look of the clock display
and the floating calendar widget using a wide selection of skins.
