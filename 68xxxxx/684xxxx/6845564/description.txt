Title: BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE
Type: FullDisc, Re-Authoring BD25
Source: Germany Blu-Ray Region B (German DTS HD-MA 5.1,English DTS-HD MA 5.1, German Subtitles)
Re-Authoring/added:
- Professionally re-synched DVD Italian AC3 5.1 upsampled to DTS-HD MA 5.1 audio track
- Professionally re-synched DVD Spanish AC3 5.1 
- Re-synched Catalan subtitles
- Re-synched Danish subtitles
- Re-synched English subtitles
- Re-synched Finnish subtitles
- Re-synched Italian subtitles
- Re-synched Norwegian subtitles
- Re-synched Spanish subtitles
- Re-synched Swedish subtitles

Note: the Spanish DVD release includes DTS 5.1 audio tracks, unfortunately only a 
DVD5 copy was found lacking DTS tracks. For this reason it was pointless upsampling
the Spanish AC3 audio track to DTS-HD MA like the Italian just because it wouldn't have been 
the best possible version, which in this case would be upsampling using DTS track instead.
