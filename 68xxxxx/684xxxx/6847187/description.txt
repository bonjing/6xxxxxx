Bursting Out is a 1978 live album by rock band Jethro Tull. It was recorded at various locations during the European Heavy Horses tour of May and June 1978, but it is not certain where each track was recorded. As shows the introduction from Claude NOBS (founder of Jazz Montreux Festival), as well as the "thanks" given by Ian Anderson, it looks like this album has been recorded at the Bern Festhalle (Switzerland), on 28/5/1978
