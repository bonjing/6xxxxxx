FROST is a compound geometry object for 3ds Max that can be used to generate a single mesh from particles, vertex clouds, object positions, point data files or a combination thereof using various iso-surface or geometry cloning techniques.
This version supports the 32 and 64 bit builds of 3ds Max 9, 3ds Max 2008, 3ds Max 2009, 3ds Max 2010, 3ds Max 2011, and 3ds Max 2012.

How to install:
1. Install Frost

2. Add Frost to 3DSMAX (from start menu/Thinkbox ...)

3. Start Keygen and generate your license file based on your hostid.

You can get your 12digits hostid by either running lmtools or simply by running
 "c:\program files\Thinkbox\Frost\Licensing\Win32\lmutil.exe hostid"

Your hostid will look like 1234567890ab


4. Start 3DSMax, Select Frost and a window will pop up.
Select NodeLocked and browse to the license you generated


5. That's it, Enjoy it


NB: default license location is
 c:\program files\thinkbox\licensing but you can put it where you want



Enjoy!
