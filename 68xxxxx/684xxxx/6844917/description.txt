Book Description
================
"More than one thousand compelling pages from one of the most haunting, 
cogent, and individual imaginations in contemporary literature."-William 
Boyd

The American publication of The Complete Stories of J. G. Ballard is 
a landmark event. Increasingly recognized as one of the greatest and 
most prophetic novelists, J. G. Ballard was a "writer of enormous inventive 
powers," who, in the words of Malcolm Bradbury, possessed, "like Calvino, 
a remarkable gift for filling the empty deprived spaces of modern life 
with the invisible cities and the wonder worlds of imagination."

Best known for his novels, such as Empire of the Sun and Crash, Ballard 
rose to fame as the "ideal chronicler of disturbed modernity" (The Observer). 
Perhaps less known, though equally brilliant, were his devastatingly 
original short stories, which span nearly fifty years and reveal an 
unparalleled prescience so unique that a new word-Ballardian-had to 
be invented. Ballard, who wrote that "short stories are the loose change 
in the treasury of fiction, easily ignored beside the wealth of novels 
available," regretted the fact that the public had increasingly lost 
its ability to appreciate them.

With 98 pulse-quickening stories, this volume helps restore the very 
art form that Ballard feared was comatose. Ballard's inimitable style 
was already present in his early stories, most of them published in 
science fiction magazines. These stories are surreal, richly atmospheric 
and splendidly elliptical, featuring an assortment of psychotropic houses, 
time-traveling assassins, and cities without clocks. Over the next fifty 
years, his fierce imaginative energy propelled him to explore new topics, 
including the dehumanization of technology, the brutality of the corporation, 
and nuclear Armageddon. Depicting the human soul as "being enervated 
and corrupted by the modern world" (New York Times), Ballard began to 
examine themes like overpopulation, as in "Billenium," a claustrophobic 
imagining of a world of 20 billion people crammed into four-square-meter 
rooms, or the false realities of modern media, as in the classic "Why 
I Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan," a faux-psychological study of the sexual 
and violent reactions elicited by viewing Reagan's face on television, 
in which Ballard predicted the unholy fusion of pop culture and sound-bite 
politics thirteen years before Reagan became president. Given Ballard's 
heightened powers of perception, it is astonishing that the dehumanized 
world that he apprehended so acutely neither diminished his own febrile 
imagination nor his engagement with mankind, evident in every story, 
including two new ones for this American edition.

So eerily prophetic is his vision, so commanding are his literary gifts, 
the import and insight of J. G. Ballard's deeply humanistic and transcendent 
works can only grow in years to come.
