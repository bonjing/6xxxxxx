     Tony Aaron (Neeson) is a private eye who makes his livnig setting up phony
     adultery cases with the help of his wife. But a routine setup fatally
     backfires when Tony's wife and his client - a wealthy artist
     - are murdered. At first, all clues point to the artist's mysterious
     mistress, Angeline (San Giacomo), but Tony is also named as a prime
     suspect. Both maintain their innocence, and guilt seems even harder to
     assign when the two plunge into a steamy forbidden affair. One is guilty,
     the other is innocent, - but the real killer might ultimately get away
     with murder.
