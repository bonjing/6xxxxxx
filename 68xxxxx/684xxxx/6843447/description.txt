Required to have: update 6 aka 1.3.0 of 27 oct 2011 release, not the update 5 of 20 october 2011 release, why? because this DLL is connected to the other DLL files from update 6, it will mess up something if used with the wrong update.

You need to run greenluma, then the game (as admin from desktop shortcut, or maybe if not as admin then from steam as non-steam game if you think this works)

If you're using smartsteam then nothing will be unlocked! You need greenluma.

Unlocked all 3 DLCs: 
- Ryder Campaign (but you should know it's not coded in the game yet, when I wrote this)
- Bloodbath arena 
- Ripper Mod (already works if you're using greenluma without the included game*.dll - this means ripper mod is the only one unlocked if you use greenluma; if u use the included game*.dll file then all 3 DLCs are unlocked) 


you need this game*.dll included here for this torrent: https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6843265/
to work, to have arena unlocked.
