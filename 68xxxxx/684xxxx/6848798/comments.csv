Thanks for the info. I'm hoping to hook back up with Jorrell for 2012."
here, and I am too busy to waste my time on the low-qual feed and idiotic banter that passes for commentating on this side of the pond. You saved my life and your efforts last season were award-winning. I salute you, and for one, will not mind waiting the extra time to be able to see this season in such a complete fashion as you provided last time out. Thank you, thank you, thank you! "
