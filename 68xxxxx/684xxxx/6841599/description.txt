GospeLink 2001 -- a searchable collection of over 3000 LDS books, works, and 
publications.


As of my releasing this as a torrent, GospeLink 2001 is over 10 years old and no 
longer sold nor supported (that I'm aware of).  I feel very strongly that everyone 
ought to have access to this incredible library without having to pay monthly fees.
the need for everyone to have access to these important works far outweighs the 
continued profit motive.

In addition to the GospeLink program, I've also included Yanceyware software, tools,
and some essential libraries. It was created by an LDS programmer and intended 
primarily for LDS libraries. It's excellent software. It was initially created for 
for handheld operating systems, especially PocketPCs and Windows Mobile devices.
However, there is also a Yancey desktop program for Windows operating systems as 
well. 

I will also be releasing another massive Yanceyware ebook library via torrent, the 
contents of which were converted directly from this Gospel 2001 library. I converted
them via a conversion program (Yanceylink, included in this torrent package) to 
Yanceyware ebook format.  Most everything of the Gospel 2001 library is included 
except the periodicals, such as the Ensign, New Area, Friend, Liahona, etc.  
(Yanceylink crashed everytime I tried to to convert them).


May the Lord bless you and lead you in your Gospel research.  Please make good use
of these tools to honor our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
