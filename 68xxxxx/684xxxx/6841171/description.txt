When Bankers Were Good

History Documentary hosted by Ian Hislop, published by BBC in 2011 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Ian Hislop presents a film about the colourful, seriously wealthy Victorian financiers whose spectacular philanthropy shows that banking wasn't always associated with greed or self-serving financial recklessness. Ian looks at attitudes to money and morality when the City of London first became the world's financial centre. Many Victorian bankers were far from comfortable about their new-found riches, which caused them intense soul-searching amidst furious national debate about the moral purpose of money and its potential to corrupt. The bankers examined in this film include Samuel Gurney, George Peabody, Angela Burdett-Coutts and Natty Rothschild. Ian champions these extraordinary and generous individuals, and along the way, he meets Dr Giles Fraser, until his recent, dramatic resignation canon chancellor of St Paul's Cathedral, chairman of the FSA Lord Turner, philanthropic financier the current Lord Rothschild, historian A N Wilson and chief rabbi Lord Sacks.
