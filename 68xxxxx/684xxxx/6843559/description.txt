Jacket by Shallow Gravy - a Venture Brothers music video.


Lyrics:


Yellow Jacket, Straight Jacket, Smoking Jacket, Full Metal Jacket!
Flak Jacket, Leather Jacket, Varsity Jacket, It\'s Brock\'s Jacket!
Puffy Jacket, Bulletproof Jacket, Track Jacket, a Woolen Jacket!
Dungaree jacket, Jean jacket, Denim jacket, They\'re all the same jacket!

You are my outerwear. My special coat, without a tear!
Jackets are everywhere.
With a hood, or a belt, or a sleeveless one.
Doesn\'t count, that\'s a vest called a jerkin.
A-2, 3, 4.
Fonzie\'s Jacket, Bolero Jacket, Tuxedo Jacket, an Eisenhower Jacket!
Nehru Jacket, Satin Jacket, Riding Jacket, Technicolor Jacket!
Welding Jacket, Child\'s Jacket, Driving Jacket, Reversible Jacket!
Members Only Jacket, a Padded Jacket, Fringed Jacket, Double-Breasted Jacket!

These are the coats we wear. Of Devils plaid, and Witches Hair!
Jackets are everywhere.
You are my outerwear. My special coat, without a tear!
Jackets are everywhere.

With a hood, or a belt, or a sleeveless one.
Doesn\'t count, that\'s a vest called a jerkin.
Uh......we\'re all wearin\' Jackets.

--Ecclesiast
