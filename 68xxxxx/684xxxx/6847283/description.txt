Oaths play an important part in the Mahabharat ,This is probably because it is necessary to remind Man
that oaths are not to be broken, Which is why everyone in the story is bound by some oath or the other,
Be it Bhishma or Shikhandi or Bhima or Arjuna or Draupadi or her father Dhrupad, Each one is bound
by an oath, Even Shakuni has sworn an oath. But it is now obvious to him that the fulfillment of his oath
is difficult.
