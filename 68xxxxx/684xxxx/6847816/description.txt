Review: Judged to perfection, Jochum's mass series holds in exquisite balance the choral line, the perfect tempo and a keen feeling for the works' spiritual dimension - James Jolly, Gramophone 1000th issue

â€œLike Bruckner, Eugen Jochum came from a devout Catholic family and began his musical life as a church organist. He would have known the Mass texts more or less inside out, which explains why his readings focus not on the sung parts â€“ which, for the most part, present the text in a relatively four-square fashion â€“ but on the orchestral writing which, given the gloriously full-bodied playing of the Bavarian orchestra, so lusciously illuminates familiar words. He approaches the Masses with many of the same ideas he so eloquently propounds in his recordings of the symphonies and the music unfolds with a measured, almost relaxed pace which creates a sense of vast spaciousness. This can have its drawbacks: you can be so entranced by the beautifully moulded orchestral introduction to the Benedictus from the D minor Mass that the entry of a rather full-throated Marga Schiml comes as a rude interruption. DG's transfers are extraordinarily good â€“ they really seem to have produced a sound which combines the warmth of the original LP with the clarity of detail we expect from CD.â€ Gramophone Classical Music Guide, 2010
