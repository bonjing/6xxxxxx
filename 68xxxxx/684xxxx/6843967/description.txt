[b]Thx Hive
 
CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D

Video: Russian DVD9 Nechto.2011.DVD9
Audio: Misteres Line + Russian 5.1 Effects
thx
 
Encode:
well that was a load of work.
DVD itself had great quality, just no subs for the Norwegian spoken parts.
First there were no subs, only had the full subs file from the ts.
As i started to manually retime them, suddenly there were subs till 40mins then till 1h5m but not for the end, i retimed the rest of the full sub file to the dvd till it was completly subbed and hardcoded them with the usual settings.
added brightness,sharpness,rgb and denoise.
 
Took Misteres Line, which was great btw, cleaned it through, but it didnt fit right on the dvd. had to delay at the beginning.
Only Problem was it wasnt perfectly sync to the complete movie, nothing too major but slightly noticeable. talking about -200 up to +200ms moving back and forwards throughout the movie.
When i inserted the line into the russian 5.1 track it wasnt that sync, you could hear gunshots, music and effects twice on some spots.
The russian track had loads of effects, so i had no choice than to resync the line again to get it lipsync and than reinsert them back into the 5.1 track.
now its a perfect release.
the movie and the effects are great, i can really recommend that movie.
took me more than 7hours to get it right.
got very nice
enjoy
