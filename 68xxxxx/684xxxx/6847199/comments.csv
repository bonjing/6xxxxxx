he man deserves a skull! straight the green one, no need to bother with the pink.
already got it from another source but i'm sure it's great quality as always. 
i found this remake of the classic from 1985 quite entertaining. it's interesting to see the changes. hmm, the original is probably a tad deeper as most of the 80 horror films tend to be but it's been ages and i need to watch that one again. farrel played a pretty decent ""jerry"". some more gore would have been appreciated but there's never enough of it, right? kidding :)"
