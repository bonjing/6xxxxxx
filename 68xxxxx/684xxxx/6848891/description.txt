This humorous episode plays on that old hit TV series gimmick of having 
one of the main characters encountering a double who gets him into trouble.
In this case Lorne Greene played 2 roles, since con man Bradley Meredith 
looks and sounds just like Ben Cartwright! What are the odds ??

\"A Deck of Aces\" was so popular that in the next season, 
a sequel \"One Ace Too Many\" was made.

Guest Stars --- Alan Oppenheimer, Linda Gaye Scott, 
Charles Dierkop, and Bern Hoffman.   With Ray Teal as Sheriff Roy Coffee.
