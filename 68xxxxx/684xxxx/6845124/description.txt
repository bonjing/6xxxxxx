2Pac (Tupac) - Greatest Hits [2 Disc] (iTunes)

Uploader Notes: This was a very special set.  It took awhile for me to compile it.  I really wanted to offer the best quality possible.  I ripped the music off of my own 2 disc in a lossless format and than encoded it to a 256 kbps M4A format which results in a lossy format with much higher sound quality than a 320 kbps MP3 format.  Apple uses it because of this fact.   Also M4A (AAC) format allows for a much smaller file size.  So enjoy.

Like I said, special upload.  Buy it if you can afford to, (it's only $20 on Amazon), if not then enjoy this up.

Say thanks, seed, and again say thanks.

Also, when you put it into iTunes it will put the songs under one album (greatest hits) but the tracks on the disc will be seperate (disc 1s tracks come first and then disc 2)
