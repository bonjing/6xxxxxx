Road to Morocco is an 1942 American comedy film about two fast-talking guys tossed up on a desert shore and sold into slavery to a beautiful princess. The movie is the third of the "Road to..." films starring Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, and Dorothy Lamour, and also features Anthony Quinn and Dona Drake.

The film was written by Frank Butler and Don Hartman and directed by David Butler for Paramount Pictures.
The picture received Academy Award nominations for Best Sound Recording (Loren Ryder) and Best Writing, Original Screenplay. In 1996, Road to Morocco was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

In an NPR interview, Middle East expert Dr. Jack Shaheen of Southern Illinois University cites Road To Morocco as "one of the most stereotypical films ever to come out of Hollywood."

The film was topical as American troops landed in Morocco on 8 November 1942 during Operation Torch.
