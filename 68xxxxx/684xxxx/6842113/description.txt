- I took the Torrent that DaNeedle99 and added the Cider Wrapper to it.

- I could not get it working before, kept freezing at the loading screen.

- This works for me and i'm on a Macbook Pro

- Just unzip the game and play.





Graphic and Resolution - To change the resolution or graphics setting go to "Skyrim Preferences" and then look for "The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim" in the same folder.




Let me know if it works for you :)
