Das boot is a bout a great bunch of men who are caught up in a terrible
war situation - and have to live through the hell of life threatening 
cruelty that is the reality of any such circumstances.

I watched this movie as fully a German patriot despite being British in all
my Schooling and articulation as I feel just as equally drawn of the 
plight of the men shown in this movie (who are a different form of British
I submit) and that were victims too of the madman Hitler. Some could just
as easily been Italian or French or Swedish (the Captain too certainly) etc
All in the family - Im glad the end to the carnage did finally come.
