The words you were inept in finding in your long-winded uneducated post were ""thank you froggie100 for doing for me what i am unable to do for myself because it is easier to make believe that i know what i am talking about rather then taking the time and doing the work that froggie100 is doing his best at to acomplish through his studies in IT technoligy""
Try this: With your fingers (use one on each hand, you have two), type in GOOGLE.COM (dont chew gum at the same time, we will get to the more advanced later in your tutalidge). WHAT IS A SCREENER? Take the results and have your mommy read it to you as a bedtime story until you know that it is as real to you as the easter bunny and santa claus.
In a few few years  the frogster has a good chance at being elite in peddeling his wares.
You heard of it as the  ""Elite WaReZ"", but you will never know exactly what that means for you are doomed to a lifetime of being a script-kiddy!
