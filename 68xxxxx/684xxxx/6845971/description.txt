WORKDONE:

Right heres are take on immortals and boy did it need some lov'in 
Opted to do a cropped version as there is already alot of non cropped releases...Anyway for this we made a script
which contained resized ( needed to fix AR for this to 1.875 ) and heavy noise filter.
From here we dropped it into vdub and increased the brightness and increased the contrast by double the amout.Then 
we cropped the hardcoded subs off and resized to the best mod 16 which was 720 x 320 (after crop it was 720 x 333 ).
Now we lowered the chroma and also increased the intes loads ....something like 1.23.
Finally we then hardcoded the english only subs back onto the video 
Now will say there is some HC subs in parts but not many at all as they were different heights ....but didn't want to crop
anymore and hate blurs.
Audio needed some TLC aswell....so stripped and remastered in goldwave and then remuxed to the encode.

Oh also tagged as R6 as this is no way a dvdscr.....IMHO.
Check sample for Q.
