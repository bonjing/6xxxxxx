The Walking Dead comics, in PDF format. Contains issues 1 through 90. Current as of October 26, 2011. 

I was frustrated that I couldnt view digital comics on my nook color, so I converted the usual .CBR / .CBZ digital comics into PDF's for use on e-reader devices such as iPad, Nook Color, etc.

I removed the "Letter Hacks," advertisements, previews for other comics, etc. This torrent is a no-BS PDF collection of The Walking Dead series, perfect for e-readers, tablets, and people just getting into reading the series.

Each PDF contains 5 issues of the series. They are organized from Issues 1 through 5, 6 through 10, 11 through 15, 16 through 20, etc.

Also included in this package is The Walking Dead Survivor's Guide, 1 through 4.

I used DCT-JPG compression, and B5 177 x 250 mm page sizes to add a blank white space to the right of each page so you can scroll up and down without covering up any of the art (intended for touch-screen devices, it's 2011, people.) It is hardly noticeable.

I did not scan any of these comics, I only edited the .cbz and .cbr files, converted the images to pdf format, and compiled them all together in one torrent. Credit for the scans goes to ArchAngel and Minutemen release groups. 

Some of you may not appreciate the way theyre organized or the blank white space or that I removed the ads and Letter Hacks. Keep in mind this torrent is intended for speed-reading through the series on an e-reader. I originally did this all for myself, made it to my standards, and enjoyed it very much. I decided I would share it on the ol' TPB. If you don't like it, DL something else. If you're looking for authenticity, DL something else or purchase the comics yourself.
