    During the last days of WW2, several female prisoners arrive at Camp     
    5 to work as sex slaves for officers and guinea pigs for horrific        
    experiments by Nazi doctors who are trying to find a cure for burns.     
    But these women are not going to die without a fight... Can they stay    
    alive until the closing Red army comes to their rescue?
