        Abandoned as a baby, 12 year-old Hollis Woods has been in more
        foster  homes than  she cares  to remember.  Edna Reilly,  her
        dedicated  social  worker,  finally  places  Holis  with Josie
        Cahill, a retired  art teacher whose  home is filled  with her
        whimsical  creations.  Beatrice is  Josie's  cousin and  loyal
        friend.

        Josie is delighted to discover  that Hollis is also an  artist
        and Hollis responds  to Josie's warmth  and openness. But  she
        soon  realizes  that  Josie  is  increasingly  forgetful   and
        confused by  everyday tasks.  Fearing that  she'll be uprooted
        again, Hollis escapes  with Josie to  the summer cabin  of her
        previous foster  parents, the  Regans. Teh  Regan parents  had
        wanted to adopt Hollis, but  when their young son was  injured
        in an accident, things fell apart for Hollis yet again.

        While  Hollis and  Josie celebrate  a most  unusual Christmas
        together at  the cabin,  Hollis worried  about their uncertain
        future and whether she will ever have a real home.
