     While on the run from the reformatory,    
     a 12 year old boy named Municipality      
     finds and saves a two day old abandoned   
     baby from becoming the prey to a          
     ferocious street dog. Failing to find     
     any takers among the people whom he       
     deemed responsible and respectable,       
     Municipality takes up the onus of         
     finding the mother of that abandoned      
     baby himself. Municipality's rock steady  
     determination ultimately helps him emerge 
     a winner against all odds as he reaches   
     that baby's mother but in bargain he      
     loses his most precious possession, the   
     flawless and god-like image of a mother   
     he used to see in his dreams and probably 
     the hope that he'll ever find his own
