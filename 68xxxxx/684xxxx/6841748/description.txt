This is a file that fools Capture One to think you have more
than 30 days to try the program. In fact is for life.

I found this in a torrent signed mad_dog along with 
Capture One 6.2.1 - 32bits.
I tried this with several versions including the last 
Capture One 6.3.2 - 64bits on Windows 7 64bits and it works like a charm.

How to use:
1.Install any version of Capture One 6.2 or newer (on Phase 
One's home sites you'll find the last version - 6.3.2 for now).

2.Don't start Capture One.

3.Put the file CaptureOne6.cmd on your desktop.

4.If you've installed Capture One in default location (on C:\Program Files...)
you can use CaptureOne6.cmd for starting the program. You'll see a License window.
Choose "Try (30 days left)" and "Capture One Pro" from the pop-up list, then hit 
on the bottom right the "Try" button. Don't try to activate. Every time you want 
to start the program you have to double click CaptureOne6.cmd. Forget about the
original Capture One icon/shorcut.

5.If you have installed Capture One anywhere else than default location, 
then you have to edit CaptureOne6.cmd file, according with your new location.
You cand edit cmd file with notepad, wordpad... etc.
