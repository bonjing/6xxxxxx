Saints Row The third BSOD Fix FOR Gigabyte 990FXA-UD3 and AMD FX-8xxx CPUs

This is a beta BIOS Update for the 990FXA-UD3 rev(1.0) specifically version F6c
It should fix the BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) for Saints Row The Third and/or other games that suffer form the same symptoms.

Warning!!!
1)This is a BIOS update specifically for the motherboard version i mention above i am not responsible if you f*ck this obvious part up
2)I am not responsible either if this harms your computer in anyway(if it helps i have used it and it worked)
3)This update has disabled 4 cores from the 8 core so expect to have only 4 cores at your disposal (doesn't really matter anyway no game uses more than 4 cores as of yet)
4)In my personal test this update has increased the amount of fan speed by 1000rpm and the temperature by about 5C still even while playing saint row the third the on Ultra and high res textures enabled temperature didn't exceed 55C though i got a lot of noise from the fan.

Download @BIOS from gigabyte website or just use your friend google here is a link for the mentally handicapped  
http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=3894#utility
scroll down until you find @BIOS that's the one.
Use the program to install BIOS.

On a side note download EasyTune 6 if you want to personally see the cpu temperature and fan speeds real time and more.

P.S. This IS my first torrent so i might have missed something like making it public for example and that would be quite retarded for me, but you get the point help and don't whine.
