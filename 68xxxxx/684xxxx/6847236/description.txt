Story So Far

Hastinapur is eagerly waiting for Queen Kunti, the Pandavas & the new bride Draupadi. Every flame raises its
neck to scan the horizon, The roads have laid themselves out for their welcome. The palace is spending sleepless
nights, Duryodhana is seething with anger, Shakuni is planning some new treachery, Gandhari is awake because
Dhritirashtra cannot sleep, However, he will not tell Gandhari why. This is the moment of danger, Bhishma feels
this even more intensely He is like the stick that cannot bend in any direction, even if he wishes it to.
He waits for his mother on the river bank, but she dose not appear.
