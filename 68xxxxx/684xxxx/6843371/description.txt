From the Hub's hit cartoon series created by Lauren Faust comes this unofficial 
soundtrack of songs, as released so far in November 2011!

All your favorites are here, to entertain fans and children of any age!

Pinkie Pie's "Smile Smile Smile" and an extended version of the theme song have 
been carefully edited and restored from low quality leaks to sound better than they 
have before! There's also an unusual extended version of the end theme, and the 
original demo for Pinkie Pie's "Hop, Skip and a Jump!"

So join your very best friends in Ponyville - Twilight Sparkle, Applejack, Rainbow 
Dash, Pinkie Pie, Rarity and Fluttershy - for a very special collection of fun, 
music, friendship and magic.
