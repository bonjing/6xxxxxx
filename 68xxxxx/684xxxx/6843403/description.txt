  Joe Crowley has been travelling up and down the UK looking at some    
  of the nation's most dangerous roads and asking if there is more      
  that can be done to make these routes safer for those who use them.   
                                                                        
  Joe is in East Sussex where he is looking at a three mile stretch of  
  the busy A27, a road which has seen 149 accidents resulting in        
  injury and 13 deaths in just 10 years. He meets the brother of one    
  victim, hears from concerned local residents and gets the assessment  
  of an independent road safety expert, before putting those concerns   
  to the Highways Agency.                                               
                                                                        
  Also on the show, we travel to Skipton in North Yorkshire to see the  
  A6069, and hear how local residents campaigned for improvements on a  
  deadly corner until major improvement work was carried out by the     
  council; and Joe visits the Transport Research Laboratory to find     
  out the impact of street lighting on road safety and driver           
  behaviour when driving at night.
