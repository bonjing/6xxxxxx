O Land of Bharat! O Land of Aryans! O Bharat O India! Time is warning you! That which benefits the nation is right
Both Ethics & Politics are of the same opinion, The peoples welfare should be the ultimate criteria.
If you have not learned this from the Mahabharat, then my narrating it has been futile There is no greater Religion
than Patriotism, no greater dream than the nation's welfare, no greater benefit than the nation's benefit .
O Mother! Grant thy progeny the boon of Patriotism, so that they may live & die for none other but you.
Bless thy children for they stand on the edge of their own battlefields. By coincidence, this story too has reached
Kurukshetra So, listen to the story with greater care because it has reached the moment of Truth.
The Kurukshetra of every era is the moment of Truth, Look! the armies have camped in Kurukshetra.
