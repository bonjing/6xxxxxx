Your Money and How They Spend It 
BBC-HD

In the first of two entertaining (and timely) specials, the BBC's political editor Nick Robinson explores where our money is going, what the government is doing with it and who the winners and losers are where public spending is concerned. Among stuff we learn tonight: while politicians strive to appease pensioners, the rest of us are apparently being diddled out of Â£97,000 a month for eight technically unworkable and abandoned fire control centres. For the next 24 years. Ali Catterall
