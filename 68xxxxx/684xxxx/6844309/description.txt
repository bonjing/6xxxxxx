This is an unusual smooth-jazz album devoted to the moon and stars from Swedish jazz trombonist Nils Landgren. He has roped in some impressive support, including Jazz Crusaders pianist Joe Sample and French accordion star Richard Galliano. Landgren's warm-toned trombone is as persuasive as his Nat Cole and Chet Baker-influenced singing. He delivers standard songs with freshness, affection and precision. Swinger Joe's Moonblues shuffles on with a gleefully virtuosity, Moon River, acquires a wistful new character, and Jimmy Webb's The Moon's a Harsh Mistress, gets a haunting treatment from Vince Mendoza's arrangement for the NDR Big Band. The album's dedicated to the late EsbjÃ¶rn Svensson, Landgren's friend and collaborator for many years.
