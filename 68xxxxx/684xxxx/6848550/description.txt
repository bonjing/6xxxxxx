    Rick Turner is engaged of Donna Trent and is having nightmares with a    
    beautiful blonde woman dancing in the sky. One night, he is              
    mysteriously driven to a doll shop, and in the next morning he           
    returns to the place with Donna. He finds a doll that resembles his      
    fianc, but the owner Francis Lamont delivers another doll to him,       
    with the face of the woman of his dreams, Bianca Milan. Rick looks       
    for Bianca and is seduced and convinced by her to join a sect that       
    worships the diabolic Camba, while the health of Donna is threatened     
    by Francis and Bianca.
