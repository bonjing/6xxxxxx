Special (1 ep x 33 min) | 2008 | 


[edit] Plot
Two years after the defeat of Majin Buu in the main Dragon Ball Z series, Mr. 
Satan finally finishes construction on his brand new hotel. Feeling guilty that 
the hotel is in honor of what the majority of Earth believes to be his defeat of 
Majin Buu, he invites all of the Z Fighters and their families to a banquet. 
Shortly after dinner begins two Saiyan Spaceships land just outside of town, and 
a mysterious Saiyan confronts the party at the hotel. He is revealed to be 
Vegeta's brother, Tarble, who had been deemed too weak to fight in the past and 
thus had been sent to a distant star before the destruction of Planet Vegeta. He 
asks his brother for help in dealing with Abo and Cado, soldiers who are 
remnants of Frieza's army, who are causing havoc on his world. As Abo and Cado 
land, the Z Fighters draw straws to see who gets to battle. Goten and Trunks are 
chosen to fight and the battle begins. Without going Super Saiyan, the children 
are easily defeating the two soldiers so Ado and Cado fuse into Aka.

Aka easily devastates Goten and Trunks, slamming them around and tossing them 
like ragdolls. Facing the stronger Aka, the boys merge into Gotenks and appear 
to defeat Aka. However, while everyone is celebrating, he attacks the boys 
again. Piccolo blocks the attack. In his next attack, Aka destroys most of the 
hotel while Gotenks protects Tarble and his wife. Goku and Vegeta join the 
fight, but Goku tricks Vegeta into looking away while he defeats Aka. With the 
battle over, Mr. Satan invites everyone back to what's left of his hotel, where 
their banquet is still waiting. Abo and Cado join them in their banquet.


[edit] Characters
