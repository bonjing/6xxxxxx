Thin Ice (1988)

Vince, a college student, loves the mountains, skiing and fun, so an invitation to Lake Tahoe is a no-brainer...

However, the trip includes people from a church group, and six strong sets of opinions about God soon collide. Vince's weekend of fun is threatened as tensions rise and sparks fly. This thought provoking drama combines plenty
of action and humor both on and off the slopes.

On the Edge (1989)

Vince bets his college roommate he can prove that God exists. Thereâ€™s only one problem: he has no idea how. His only hope is to take him on a camping trip with friends from church. Thus begins this adventure shot on location in the spectacular Yosemite National Park.

Amidst the hiking, campfires, and storytelling, they talk about the tough questions people ask in life. Laughter, sorrow, and plenty of action will definitely keep you "On The Edge" of your seat.
