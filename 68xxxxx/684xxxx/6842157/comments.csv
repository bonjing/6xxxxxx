,slancio103,2011-12-10T09:54Z,Hey... I've tried the alternate boot trick... watched the vid about the wii remote... but when I press A the close hangs and i need to reboot by pressing power button... it seems the wii will not see that I watched the vid. When I go back to try to load the game it still plays the vid over and over. I installed some update blockling software to stop my Wii from bricking. Can this be blocking the wii from updateing that i saw the vid?
