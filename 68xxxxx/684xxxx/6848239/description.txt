This torrent contains FRESH rips of all seven Bob Hope & Bing Crosby â€œRoad Toâ€¦â€ pictures, as well as two documentaries, all DVD extras, and all six of the â€œFamily Guyâ€ ROAD TO spoofs.

It is important to note that copyright renewal issues and bad studio film storage practices have left a few of the original masters in less than perfect conditions. This means that some of these have been commercially released in great shape with lots of extras and subtitles, and the 3 of them are not in the best shape and have extras or subtitles.

Except for the FAMILY GUY spoofs (thanks to the OP!), I have ripped all of these fresh from commercial DVDs to the highest AVI resolution possible, and always to a bit rate of at least .15 â€“ Enjoy.



Road to ... refers to a series of seven comedy films starring Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, and Dorothy Lamour. They are also often referred to as the "Road" pictures or the "Road" series. The movies were a combination of adventure, comedy, romance, and music. The minimal plot often took a back seat to gags, many of them supposedly ad-libbed by Crosby and Hope during filming.

Rumour has it that, during the filming of "...Singapore", Dotty Lamour said to the camera, "Hey fellas, I haven't had a line for ages!" From that time on, the scene was set for what was one of the most enduring franchises in the history of motion pictures.

Each film is not simply a comedic film, but a satire of some of the popular film genres of the day, including jungle, Arabian nights, Alaskan adventure, and high seas. The final film not only comes much later, but involves a newer genre; Hong Kong spoofs the spy films of the sixties.

In 1977, an eighth Road to ... movie was planned titled Road to the Fountain of Youth; however, Crosby died that year of a heart attack.

In 1947 Astor Pictures released a compilation film of several of Crosby's Educational Pictures short subjects called The Road to Hollywood to evoke the series.
