"Release the Brake! (Brussels, Belgium)"

The race continues in Belgium, where teams take 
a thrilling test drive and try to re-create 
classic Belgium waffles.

(Rules are unclear if a show such as this would
be 'reality' or 'competitive reality'. Due to
this being a literal race involving lots of
running and high motion we went with 
'competitive'.

22/Slower
Evolve...or die.

Enjoy :)
