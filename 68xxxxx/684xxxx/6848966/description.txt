"Amish Guy"

On the return from an adventurous day at 
an amusement park, the Griffins car 
breaks down in Amish country and they are 
stranded with no way out. When Meg falls 
for an Amish boy, the Griffins then find 
themselves in a crusade against the 
conservative locals.

18/Slower
Evolve...or die.

Enjoy :)
