Some really excellent Indie Folk that draws strong similarities to Fleet Foxes with its vocal harmonies and climactic peaks. Very good range overall on the album going from that style to a more contemporary and subtle acoustic feel on several songs showcasing Bram's amazing voice. Three very strong songs at the end give the album a real airy and lightweight feel for a very relaxing listen.
