Deftones 2003 self titled album (originally to be titled "Lovers" which I find far more interesting ;-) ripped to FLAC by me from a scratch free with CDDA Extractor many moons ago!

*** Added the B-Side single "Lovers" as a bonus track ***

"Lovers" was ripped from a scratch free Hexagram CD-Single to FLAC by me as well.
