Evidently, the radio broadcast was "Best of Glenn Beck" on account of Thanksgiving. As of this afternoon, there are neither podcasts nor mp3s posted for the regular radio program, although there is a 4th Hour podcast (which I haven't listened to yet, but is included in this torrent for your listening pleasure). I waited to see if anything would be posted, but still nothing.

 I am travelling abroad and my system at home appears to have crashed, so I am on a slow connection that may not be up 100% of the time, so PLEASE SEED THIS TORRENT after you download for at least a few days.

 RESIST WE MUCH! SEED WE MUCH!
