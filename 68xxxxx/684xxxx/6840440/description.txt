Storyline:

This is an English language film (made in America) adapted from a novel by German author Erich Maria Remarque. The film follows 
a group of German schoolboys, talked into enlisting at the beginning of World War 1 by their jingoistic teacher. The story
is told entirely through the experiences of the young German recruits and highlights the tragedy of war through the eyes 
of individuals. As the boys witness death and mutilation all around them, any preconceptions about "the enemy" and the 
"rights and wrongs" of the conflict disappear, leaving them angry and bewildered. This is highlighted in the scene where 
Paul mortally wounds a French soldier and then weeps bitterly as he fights to save his life while trapped in a shell 
crater with the body. The film is not about heroism but about drudgery and futility and the gulf between the concept of 
war and the actuality.
