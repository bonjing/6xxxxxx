convert DTS audio to AC3.
 It takes less than 20 minutes (without any change in the video, only audio is converted) to convert and yet preserve the original DTS audio, too. Play perfectly in TVs LG. On my LG LW5700 42 ""works perfectly. :)

 MKV2AC3 is freeware:

Handbrake converts audio as well, but is much slower because the video is recoded as well."
