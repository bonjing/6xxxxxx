But at least it wasn't another paranormal activity film. And in my opinion, I thought it was pretty cool that they used what they used for the ... evil or whatever you want to call it. 

Anyway, about the film, who's to say this did or didn't happen. I mean its not like the government is actually gonna tell us if something like this did happen, they do everything they can to cover it up, like area 51. I don't see any life on the moon, there's nothing there, no water, no heat source, no atmosphere, no good gravity, nothing. Now mars on the other hand, yeah, I could see that. 

If I had to recommend this film, it'd be this. DL a smaller copy and go from there, no since in burning your BW for something you'll prolly wish you hadn't.  "
