Health-Medical Documentary hosted by Martin Jarvis, published by Channel 4 in 2011 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Just days after the trial of Dr Conrad Murray returned a guilty verdict for the involuntary manslaughter of Michael Jackson, this powerful and dramatic documentary explores the relationship between the King of Pop and his personal physician, with exclusive access to Dr Murray and his defence. The documentary, by multi-award-winning director Tom Roberts, has filmed with Murray and followed him throughout the trial itself, away from the glare of the public spotlight. The film explores Jackson's private world where the controversial use of powerful medication was a way of life, where a man adored by millions lived as a virtual recluse and where an unknown cardiologist from Las Vegas found himself the unexpected companion, confidante and intimate to one of the most famous men in the world.
