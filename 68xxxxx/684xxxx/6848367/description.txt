As the X-Men arrive back in Tohoku, Hisako's parents inform them of strange things that happened while they were away. As Beast administers the vaccine to various mutants, some of which have already started going through secondary mutation, the other X-Men investigate the abnormalities, including a strange 
volcanic area by the river and a twisted metal bridge. As the X-Men fly towards the centre of the area in which mutants have been affected by secondary mutation, Emma starts hearing a painful noise and the Blackbird is shot down. Upon landing, the X-Men witness the Blackbird being attacked by living snow 
before they are attacked by another U-Man, who uses their powers against them. However, Beast manages to find its weakpoint, allowing the others to defeat him. They spot he has a mutant detection device before he self-destructs himself. As a snowstorm kicks in, the X-Men finds shelter in a lodge owned by Yui Sasaki, the woman Xavier mentioned, who was the headmaster of a mutant institute Hisako went to when she was little.
