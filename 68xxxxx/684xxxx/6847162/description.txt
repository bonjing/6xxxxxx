Austin & Ally S01 E01 Rockers & Writers 720p Web DL

Description:

Opposites rock when an unlikely partnership is formed between Austin, an extroverted musician/singer, and Ally, a brilliant yet shy songwriter - and their two best friends, Trish and Dez. Austin and Ally combine their talents to create a true musical tour-de-force, but will they be able to make it when embarrassing footage of Austin starts showing up on a local blog or Dez misreads the words and gets a kangaroo for Austinâ€™s next video?
