NOVA studies the recent discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating - apparently caused by a mysterious repulsive force that some scientists believe counteracts gravity. The program follows the efforts of two rival teams of astronomers as they search for exploding stars, map out gigantic cosmic patterns of galaxies, and grapple with the ultimate questions: what is the size and shape of the universe, and how will it end. Watch now before you fly apart.
