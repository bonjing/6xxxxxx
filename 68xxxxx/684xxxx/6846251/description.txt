Earl King - The Sonet Blues Story 
Released: 2006
Label: Verve
Format:Mp3@320


The influential 1950s and '60s singer, songwriter, and guitarist Earl King is heard here performing some of the songs that made his reputation, including "Trick Bag," "Come On Let the Good Times Roll," (the latter covered by Jimi Hendrix on Electric Ladyland), and the Lee Dorsey hit "Do Re Mi" (which was also covered in the U.K. by Georgie Fame). The backing is pure vintage early-'60s New Orleans, the guitar playing down-and-dirty, and the atmosphere irresistible.
