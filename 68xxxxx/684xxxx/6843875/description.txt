RELEASE NOTES

If you had the chance to change history would you? Could you?

In Germany hurtling towards the global catastrophe in the second world
war, you step into the murky arena of international espionage as you
try to alter the course of history and try and achieve what so many
failed: the assassination of Adolf Hitler

As a special agent trained in the latest sabotage techniques you have
to infiltrate Hitler's inner circle and avoid the ever-watchful eyes of
the ever-dangerous Gestapo. And they will be watching you, they always
are

A Stroke of Fate: Operation Valkyrie transports you into the world of
the 1940s, mixing with the most hated figures in European history;
Himmler, Goebbels, Muller and Hitler himself. While you are there
though, do you have what it takes to achieve the impossible task that
eluded so many others, the final solution to the Hitler problem?
