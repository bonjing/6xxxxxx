The narrative voice of the director, through his own memories, retraces his first experience as a cinema spectator: at the age of 5, accompanied by his sister to the cinema Gran Kursaal, he watches the projection of the film The Scarlet Claw (1944) by Roy William Neill, with Basil Rathbone in the part of Sherlock Holmes. An event that together with the historical events of Spain and of the Francoism, will mark forever his imagination and will influence his future experiences as a director.

This short film was specifically done by VÃ­ctor Erice to be shown at the exhibition 'Erice - Kiarostami. Correspondences', held at the Centre de Cultura ContemporÃ nia de Barcelona from 9 February to 21 May 2006.
