Polish filmmaker Andrzej Wajda adapted his 1975 effort Land of Promise (Ziemia obiecana) from an 1897 novel by Wladyslaw Stanislaw Reymont. The story concerns three Polish laborers of vastly different social, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds. Unlike many of their recalcitrant contemporaries, the three men are able to overcome their differences and work together. Eventually they create and manage a textile factory, founded upon the edicts of equality, trust, and respect. By concentrating on three individuals, Wajda is able to reflect Poland's 19th century ascension from ancient feudalism to modern capitalism. But this is no sugar-coated "beating the odds" saga; Wajda makes it clear that with progress comes sacrifice and heartache. Also released as The Promised Land, Land of Promise originated as a multipart series for Polish television.
