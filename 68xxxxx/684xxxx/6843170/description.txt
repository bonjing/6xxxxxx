   Widower businessman Mr. Sinha lives a very 
   wealthy lifestyle along with two daughters,
   Juhi and Reshmi. Both are of marriageable  
   age and he wants them to get married to    
   equally wealthy families. Juhi ends up     
   falling in love with a middle-classed young
   man named Vijay Kumar Gupta much to the    
   chagrin of Sinha, who refuses to bless the 
   couple, compelling them to elope. Years    
   later Vijay and Juhi become parents to a   
   young boy, Munna, Sinha forgives them and  
   asks them to return home. The train they   
   were traveling in meets with an accident   
   and amongst the survivors are Vijay and    
   his son. A grieving Sinha welcomes Munna   
   and Vijay, treats Vijay as his son, lets   
   him run the business as well as decides to 
   make him the heir to his wealth and estate.
