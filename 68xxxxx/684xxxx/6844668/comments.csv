,zappaz62,2011-11-30T00:10Z,Works for me! GPU accel. still buggy. Thanks for these beta-builds.
uninstall all previous version first,and delete/reset completely your cache and settings options aswell.
Dude,i installed it such as on no less than 15 computers (mines,girlfriend,friends,parents,ect...)
And in each computer,this version works perfectly fine.
If you forget to reset your cache while uninstalling
previous version,so ya,you might get few possible errors as i got aswell by the past by not having done this
stuff so,ya.
Retry and let me know if persisting,please.
