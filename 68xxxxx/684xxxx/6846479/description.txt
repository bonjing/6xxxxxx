RCA's The Mario Lanza Collection is a terrific, three-disc set that contains 61 highlights from his time at the label. Many of his best-known songs are here, all in their familiar hit versions. While casual listeners may find the sheer bulk of this set somewhat intimidating, its comprehensiveness makes it ideal for the serious fan. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine
