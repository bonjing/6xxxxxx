Just Burn The ISO Image Included in The Torrent to a Blank DVD (4.7 GB - The Common DVD in The Market) 
Edit BIOS Settings
*Set SATA as AHCI Mode 
*Turnoff "Processor Power Management"
It is Better to Remove All Other Hard Disks Presented in Your Computer
{IF Your DVD Rom Hangs During Installation Your DVD Drive isn't Getting Enough Power So Change The Power Cable and USE Separate Power Cables for "DVD ROM and HDDs" }

Boot From The DVD 

Select Your Language

Open "Disk Utility" From Utilities Menu

Erase The Partition Where You Want to install Lion using "Disk Utility" as Mac OS X Extended

Exit "Disk Utility"

Customize Your Installation 

Thats it

When Installation Completes Boot From The Hard Disk to Which You Installed Mac OS X Lion


Enjoy :D
