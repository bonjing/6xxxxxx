Colin Murray reviews the day's Premier League action, featuring Liverpool v Manchester City at Anfield and Swansea City v Aston Villa at the Liberty Stadium. 
The Reds were impressive 3-0 victors in last season's corresponding fixture against City and were looking for a repeat performance, while this was the first time 
Swansea and Villa had met since the Swans were last in the top flight in the 1982/83 campaign.
