To those with an eye for the finer re-tales we salute you.

Once upon a time there was a bang. But unfortunately for Frankie, this is not the way the world ended. Instead it ended not with a bang but a whimper. Frankie\'s last stand saw the end of our heroes. What a waste man!
But Frankie say \"Fuck The Past!\". Men say \"he who forgets the past is doomed to repeat it\". Frankie say \"he who can change the past is blessed to forget it\".
In another dimension of the vast Frankie-verse, there is a better world. In this world there is no such knowledge of something called a \"Liverpool\". As historians would tell it, after the BANG, Frankie said \"Go forward! Harder! Faster! Longer! More!\". And then in a flash an even bigger bang came... the Wasteland. The Wasteland was relentless on an unsuspecting world. Frankie say \"Make the masses kiss our assets!\".  Frankie lived on to fight many a battle. Doing it right.
And it was good.
