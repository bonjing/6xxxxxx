Book Description
Itâ€™s your first day on the new job. Youâ€™ve got the programming chops, youâ€™re up on the latest tech, youâ€™re sitting at your workstationâ€¦ now what? New Programmerâ€™s Survival Manual gives your career the jolt it needs to get going: essential industry skills to help you apply your raw programming talent and make a name for yourself. Itâ€™s a no-holds-barred look at what really goes on in the officeâ€“and how to not only survive, but thrive in your first job and beyond.

Programming at industry level requires new skills â€“ youâ€™ll build programs that dwarf anything youâ€™ve done on your own. This book introduces you to practices for working on large-scale, long-lived programs at a professional level of quality. Youâ€™ll find out how to work efficiently with your current tools, and discover essential new tools.

But the tools are only part of the story; youâ€™ve got to get street-smart too. Succeeding in the corporate working environment requires its own savvy. Youâ€™ll learn how to navigate the office, work with your teammates, and how to deal with other people outside of your department. Youâ€™ll understand where you fit into the big picture and how you contribute to the companyâ€™s success. Youâ€™ll also get a candid look at the tougher aspects of the job: stress, conflict, and office politics.

Finally, programming is a job you can do for the long haul. This book helps you look ahead to the years to come, and your future opportunitiesâ€“either as a programmer or in another role you grow into.

Thereâ€™s nothing quite like the satisfaction of shipping a product and knowing, â€œI built that.â€ Whether you work on embedded systems or web-based applications, in trendy technologies or legacy systems, this book helps you get from raw skill to an accomplished professional.
