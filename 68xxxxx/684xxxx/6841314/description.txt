Encode:

Great movie but file had that usual handbrake convert problems with variable video bitrate which makes it hard to convert to any format, without audio getting oos to video.
Video itself had some noise but was very nice.
removed that noise, added brightness, sharpness,rgb.
resynced the audio on various places. audio moved from -200 to +200ms forward and backwards.
This great movie deserves a lipsync version.
As a bonus there are english subs attached now.
tried to make video to decent size without losing quality.
got very nice
