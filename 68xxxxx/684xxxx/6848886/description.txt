"The Man in the Blue Flannel Pants"

The Simpsons host a tastemaker party at 
their home to promote Absolut Krusty, Krusty 
the Clowns own brand of liquor. Mr. Burns 
takes notice of the partys success and 
decides to promote Homer to Account Man 
for the Springfield Nuclear Plant. Robert 
Marlow (guest voice John Slattery), a 
seasoned account veteran, takes Homer under 
his wing and shows Homer what the high life 
is like in the corner office. Meanwhile, 
Lisa introduces Bart to a new literary world 
which sparks his interest in reading classic 
novels, and when Homers long hours at the 
office become the norm, a family vacation 
with Marge and the kids help him realize 
that family always comes before work.
