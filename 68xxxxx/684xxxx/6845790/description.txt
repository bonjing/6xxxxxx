[Description taken from another encode of this movie from the web].

"The image jumps a bit, especially during the first 20 min. It's like very short freeze frames, and then the film resumes, without showing the "missing" frames, so there's a little jump in the action. This is not due to the encoding, since the problem is already present on the original dvd. Moreover, I've been told by someone who has seen it, that this problem is even present in the restored 35mm print of the film."

The source has been auto-cropped to take out unnecessary black space on the top, bottom, and sides.
