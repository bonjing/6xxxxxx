This torrent includes the official podcast mp3s released on the www.glennbeck.com website for the radio show. It includes the "4th Hour" with Pat & Stu which is available only to subscribers (ie. it is not part of the regular radio broadcast).

 Today Joe Pags is filling in for Glenn who is presumably away for Thanksgiving.

 I am travelling abroad and my system at home appears to have crashed, so I am on a slow connection that may not be up 100% of the time, so PLEASE SEED THIS TORRENT after you download for at least a few days.

 I will be back home for Monday's podcasts. See you then. 

RESIST WE MUCH! SEED WE MUCH!
