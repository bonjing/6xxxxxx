STORY SO FAR
Duryodhana has won the game of dice, Hastinapur has lost. The values which Indians were proud of
& which guided their lives & society have also lost. It may be that Dhritirashtra was frightened by
Draupadi's curse,but it could also be that he was frightened by his ambition & filial love (Family Duty)
But there is no doubt that he was frightened, However, his fear has played havoc with Shakuni's game
& Duryodhana's dreams. Neither Shakuni nor Duryodhana is willing to accept that .
When Draupadi threw the dice of her divinity, even an experienced player like Shakuni lost . Whatever
he had won was lost in a moment & he could do nothing about it.
