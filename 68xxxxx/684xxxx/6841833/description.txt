Quote:
Criminal Macabre: A Cal McDonald Mystery is a comic book series starring Cal McDonald, an antihero American comic book character created in 1990 by Steve Niles (writer). The character's adventures have been published by Dark Horse Comics and later IDW Publishing.

Cal himself is akin to John Constantine, a DC Comics paranormal detective. He takes illicit drugs, and befriends a network of ghouls to assist him in his cases. Policemen do not really care to be involved with Cal.

I managed to get the proto-cal comic, Big Head from Daughters of Fly in My Eye

Supernatural Freak Machine 4 and 5 were never individually published but were supposedly published in a tpb tat to my knowledge hasn't been scanned. I cannot seem to find the short story All My Bloody Things from Dark Delicacies.

Just a quick note for some reason the scanner of the novels included pdfs of their scans of inside the cbrs for some-reason. Don't ask me why.
