STORY SO FAR

Underhand methods result in tragedy However, if the truth is on one's side then Religion will also side with you
There are two types of politics, One based on the treasury & the other based on Truth. One serves the King's
personal interests, while the other serves the nation. The aim of the first is to be on the throne forever, while the
aim of the second is to remain in the hearts of the people. Both these alternatives can be seen clearly in the
politics of Hastinapur. Duryodhana, under the guidance of Shakuni is walking along the first road, Yuddhistir
follows his duty along the other road. Duryodhana has the royal treasury, while Yuddhistir has Religion. In that
sense, Mahabharat is the story of conflict between Materialism & philosophy. When the story finally ends people
will realize on which of the two roads one must walk. But listen to what Gandhari has to say.
