Roy Orbison and Friends, A Black and White Night is a 1988 Cinemax television special 
originally broadcast on January 3, 1988 starring Hall of Fame singer/songwriter Roy Orbison. 
The special was filmed entirely in black and white. A live album was released following the 
broadcast.


Background

The special consisted of a performance of many of Orbison's hits at the then Ambassador 
Hotel's Cocoanut Grove nightclub (Los Angeles) in Los Angeles, filmed on September 30, 1987, 
approximately a year before his death. Three songs, "Blue Bayou", "Claudette", and "Blue Angel", 
were filmed but not included in the original broadcast due to time constraints.

Put together by musical director T-Bone Burnett, Orbison was accompanied by a supporting 
backing band which included many notable musical performers. All were fans who volunteered 
to participate in the special.[citation needed] Other celebrity admirers of Orbison were in 
the audience, including Billy Idol, Patrick Swayze, Sandra Bernhard, and Kris Kristofferson. 
The backing band was the TCB Band, which accompanied Elvis Presley from 1969 until his death 
in 1977: Glen D. Hardin on piano, James Burton on lead guitar, Jerry Scheff on bass, and 
Ronnie Tutt on drums. Male background vocalists, some of whom also joined in on guitar, were 
Bruce Springsteen, Tom Waits, Elvis Costello, Jackson Browne, J.D. Souther, and Steven Soles. 
The female background vocalists were k.d. lang, Jennifer Warnes, and Bonnie Raitt. During the 
end credits, several of the band members are shown talking about how Orbison influenced them.

The song "Oh, Pretty Woman" from this performance, which features dueling guitar solos between 
Springsteen and Burton, was nominated for a Grammy Award for best live performance. Re-released 
as part of a CD bearing the same title as the motion picture, the song won the 1991 Grammy Award 
for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance.

The audio from this special was released as an album by Virgin Records in 1989, 
titled A Black & White Night Live.
