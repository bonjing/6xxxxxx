The Story So Far.

When Balaram asked the Yadavas to bring back Arjun the quarrel ended. The maces were kept aside,
The bows & arrows were discarded , The tension was defused. Subhadra was decked up like a bride &
there was love & happiness in the air. Subhadra's face shone like the moon & the bangles tinkled on
her hands. With Lord Krishna smiling in the background Subhadra moved towards Arjuna to garland
him.
