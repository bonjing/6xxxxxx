These files are NOT all you need to unlock/play Bloodbath Arena

I don't have the original files (as released on 23 November 2011) so if anyone could get those to me then we can make this fully work(we only need like 20 meg), but until then you can use a temporary workaround which will unlock all DLCs and enable arena for you to play at the cost of not being able to hear the voices in the arena intro cinematic AND not being able to see the actual English texts just the code for them, like here: http://i.imgur.com/2X1K3.jpg
If you're good with that then you can check the following link to download the extra files which I didn't want to upload (because it's not fully cracked ie. we miss at least DataEn.pak and some .dll files):

Right then, what you get here are all those 6 parts (in that url above), which were known as:
dead island bloodbath.1_to_1.update.gcf  (except it's decrypted and .rar packed to reduce size by 300 meg)
and delivered to some people via steam since long ago (ie. september 2011)

so you will still need these files, that's why I allowed myself to make torrent with these.
