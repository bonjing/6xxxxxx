Unbeatable Resumes: America's Top Recruiter Reveals What REALLY Gets You Hired


What does Tony Beshara do that most resume â€œexpertsâ€ dont? While the experts write resumes all day, Tonyâ€”the veteran placement specialist featured regularly on the Dr. Phil showâ€”actually uses them to get people jobs.
With Unbeatable Resumes, Tony dissects and discusses real-life resumes for jobs in a wide range of industries from healthcare to banking, construction to technology, administration to sales and marketing, and more. The book shows readers how to build a powerful resume, utilize keywords effectively, use gaps and job changes to their advantage, and pair their resumes with concise, dynamic cover letters. He complements his expertise (he has personally placed more than 8,500 professionals) with the results of a survey of more than 3,000 managers, executives, HR specialists, and other hiring authorities about what gets resumes read, interviews granted, and jobs offered.
