Review
â€œBenklifa has devised an elegant strategy to reduce risks while creating consistent profits. His strategic approach to options trading should be a part of every traderâ€™s approach, especially in volatile markets.â€
â€”Michael C. Thomsett, author, Options Trading for the Conservative Investor

â€œMichael Benklifa is the real deal. His insights into the iron condor strategy stem from years of trading this approach with big money in various market environments. His experience will benefit both beginning and advanced options traders wanting to enhance their knowledge of perhaps the best strategy in options trading.â€
â€”Steve Lentz, DiscoverOptions

â€œVery few books explore a trading strategy in the kind of detail that Benklifa has applied to condors. Itâ€™s all hereâ€”trade timing, entry and exit rules, volatility effects, selection criteria, adjustments for sharp rallies and declines, and risk management, just to name a few. Unlike most trading books, this one was written by someone who has devoted years of effort to perfecting and trading the strategies illustrated in this book. That simple fact has driven Benklifa to dissect the complex dynamics of the condor trade into enough detail to fill an entire volume. Trading condors without reading this book is like going to war without a gun.â€
â€”Jeff Augen, author, Trading Options at Expiration

â€œToo many options books lose clarity in an attempt to explain every strategy for every market condition. Benklifa avoids this pitfall by focusing on one strategy, the iron condor. Benklifa combines his lucid explanation of the iron condor with guidelines of the trading discipline needed to make it successful. The emphasis is upon profit optimization, not profit maximization. Risk and reward are given their due. He does a superb job of reducing the equation to the lowest common denominatorsâ€”time, price, and implied volatility. The book provides a rock solid foundation for the understanding and application of core trading concepts.â€
