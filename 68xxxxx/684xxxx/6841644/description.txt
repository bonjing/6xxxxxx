America's favorite arctic herd is busy decorating 
for the holiday season. In his rush to help, Sid 
(John Leguizamo) destroys Manny's (Ray Romano) 
favorite decorations. Manny is so upset he convinces 
Sid he is now on Santa's naughty list. Sid, Crash 
(Seann William Scott), Eddie (Josh Peck) and Peaches 
(Ciara Bravo) take off for the North Pole to plead 
their case to Santa (Billy Gardell). Meanwhile, 
Manny, Ellie (Queen Latifah) and Diego (Denis 
Leary), worry over Peaches' safety and race to find 
her. Back at the North Pole, Sid and his crew 
accidentally destroy Santa's Workshop on Christmas 
Eve, and it's up to these newfound friends to 
orchestrate a Christmas miracle.
