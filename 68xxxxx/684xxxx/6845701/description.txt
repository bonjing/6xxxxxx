This is the only publication that presents a modern interpretation of the Classical Orders. The new edition of this successful title now includes the proportions in both metric and imperial measurements to make the orders more accessible and to provide a valuable reference for designers.

The inclusion of both 100-part and 96-part systems of proportion is underpinned by an essay on James Gibbs - one of the 18th century authors of standardized proportioning systems - and his influence in America. Along with additional plates, this book gives a
clear introduction to those not familiar with the classical genre and is an easy to follow guide which assists architects, interior designers and conservators with the quality of their design.
