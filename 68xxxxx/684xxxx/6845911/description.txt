TIPS Please read this will help a lot

If you are recording with fraps which you probably are since you just downloaded it  =D it wont make one big video it makes little 3 minute videoâ€™s donâ€™t be worried as soon as it stops recording it goes of recording straight away you wont notice any little jumps in your videoâ€™s its that fast.

So open up a video editior recommended for beginners is camtaisa or windows movie maker. 
Camtasia download at the pirate bay here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6711652/TechSmith_Camtasia_Studio_v7.1.1___Serials_[ChattChitto_RG]

Windows movie maker here: http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker

So  like I was saying open up a video editior get all the fraps videoâ€™s when your done recording and put them in the video editor. Do whatever you want with them and save it/render it/process it. 
After that delete the videoâ€™s from fraps what were made since they take up to 3 gigs of your hard drive! And there and another thing use any-video-converter from here to make file sizes for the final video smaller if it is too big to upload to youtube or to make it faster to upload.

Hope you enjoy making videoâ€™s of games of whatever you do with fraps ïŠ
