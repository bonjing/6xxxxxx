Masters of Darkness: Aleister Crowley - The Wickedest Man in the World (TV 2002) 
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0814208/

Aleister Crowley was perhaps the most controversial and misunderstood personality to figure in the new era of modern day witchcraft. Known by the popular press of his time as The Great Beast and The Wickedest Man in the World, Crowley was a powerful magician, poet, prophet and famed occultist. He was also a one-time witch, though most of the elders of the craft would discredit him the title.

Born Edward Alexander Crowley, he is primarily known for his occult writings and teachings. He founded the religion of Thelema, which became adopted by the Ordo Templis Orientis (O.T.O.) as well as the magical order Argenteum Astrum, the Order of the Silver Star. He was also a highly controversial member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, where he was known by the magical name of Frater Perdurabo.

Crowleyâ€™s lifestyle was absolutely shocking in the era in which he lived. Besides his interest in the occult, he was sexually promiscuous with both genders (at a time when homosexuality was still illegal in Britain), frequented prostitutes, was vocally defiant against Christianity and Victorian and post-Victorian prudishness toward sexual subjects, and was a drug addict.

While Crowley detested Christianity, he considered himself an immensely religious and spiritual person. His writings record incidents of experiencing deity, and Thelemites consider him to be a prophet. In 1904, he encountered a being known as Aiwass, described as a â€œministerâ€ to Horus, the central deity in Thelema, and as a Holy Guardian Angel. Aiwass dictated the Book of the Law, which Crowley wrote down and published, becoming the central Thelemic text.

Crowleyâ€™s beliefs included pursuing the Great Work, which included gaining self-knowledge and uniting with the larger universe. He also encouraged seeking out oneâ€™s ultimate destiny or purpose, commonly referred to as oneâ€™s True Will.

Involved as a young adult in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, he first studied mysticism with and made enemies of William Butler Yeats and Arthur Edward Waite. Like many in occult circles of the time, Crowley voiced the view that Waite was a pretentious bore through searing critiques of Waiteâ€™s writings and editorials of other authorsâ€™ writings. In his periodical The Equinox, Crowley titled one diatribe, Wisdom While You Waite, and his note on the passing of Waite bore the title, Dead Waite.

His friend and former Golden Dawn associate, Allan Bennett, introduced him to the ideas of Buddhism, while Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, acting leader of the Golden Dawn organization, acted as his early mentor in western magic but would later become his enemy. Several decades after Crowleyâ€™s participation in the Golden Dawn, Mathers claimed copyright protection over a particular ritual and sued Crowley for infringement after Crowleyâ€™s public display of the ritual. While the public trial continued, both Mathers and Crowley claimed to call forth armies of demons and angels to fight on behalf of their summoner. Both also developed and carried complex Seal of Solomon amulets and talismans.

In 1899, Crowley acquired Boleskine House, in Foyers on the shore of Loch Ness in Scotland. In a book of fiction, titled Moonchild, Crowley later portrayed Mathers as the primary villain, including him as a character named SRMD, using the abbreviation of Mathersâ€™ magical name. Arthur Edward Waite also appeared in Moonchild as a villain named Arthwaite, while Bennett appeared as the silent, monkish Mahathera Phang. While he did not officially break with Mathers until 1904, Crowley lost faith in this teacherâ€™s abilities soon after the 1900 schism in the Golden Dawn (if not before). Later in the year of that schism, Crowley travelled to Mexico and continued his magical studies in isolation. Crowleyâ€™s writings suggest that he discovered the word Abrahadabra during this time.

In October 1901, after practicing Raja Yoga for some time, he said he had reached a state he called dhyanaâ€”one of many states of unification in thoughts that are described in Magick (Liber ABA). 1902 saw him writing the essay Berashith (the first word of Genesis), in which he gave meditation (or restraint of the mind to a single object) as the means of attaining his goal. The essay describes ceremonial magick as a means of training the will, and of constantly directing oneâ€™s thoughts to a given object through ritual. In his 1903 essay, Science and Matter, Crowley urged an empirical approach to Buddhist teachings

Crowley began to travel, mostly in the East studying Eastern Occult systems and Tantric Yoga; he also studied Buddhism and the I Ching. Then for a time he lived in an isolated setting near to Loch Ness in Scotland. In 1903 he met and then married Rose Edith Kelly, sister of the well-known artist Sir Gerald Kelly. She bore him one child. While they where on holiday in Egypt the following year, April 1904, he and Rose took part in a magical ritual during which he alleges to have received a message from the Gods. As a result of this communication he wrote down the first three chapters of his most famous book Ã¢â‚¬Å“Liber Legis, the Book of LawÃ¢â‚¬Â. This book contains his oft-quoted dictum: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Love is the Law, Love under WillÃ¢â‚¬Â, upon which Crowley based the rest of his life and teachings.

Aleister Crowley: The Other Loch Ness Monster
Original Air Date:11 August 2000

In year 2000 BBC Scotland made a short documentaroy about Boleskine, Crowleyâ€™s house on the banks on Loch Ness. The show was called The Other Loch Ness Monster, but the BBC have so far refused to show it outside of Scotland. Channel Four have filmed a more throughgoing documentary although broadcast has again been delayed due to editorial difficulties. Now you can watch the entire Aleister Crowley mystical thelemic documentary video entitled The Other Loch Ness Monster with appearance by Kenneth Anger.

Aleister Crowley and the Other Loch Ness Monster is quirky and fascinating short documentary on the most wickedest man in the world and his time at Boleskine House, at the turn of the last century. Crowley purchased the estate on the shores of the south-east shore of Loch Ness in order to carry out rituals from The Book of the Sacred Magick of Abramelin the Mage, as he required:

...a house where proper precautions against disturbance can be taken; this being arranged, there is really nothing to do but to aspire with increasing fervor and concentration, for six months, towards the obtaining of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.

Crowley described Boleskine in Confessions:

The house is a long low building. I set apart the south-western half for my work. The largest room has a bow window and here I made my door and constructed the terrace and lodge. Inside the room I set up my oratory proper. This was a wooden structure, lined in part with the big mirrors which I brought from London.

For Crowley, Boleskine House was a Thelemic Kiblah, a Magical East, where he practiced the Black Mass and summoned demons, which may have caused disruption to Loch Ness, as Crowley later claimed in his autobiography: 

...the spirits he summoned got out of hand, causing one housemaid to leave, and a workman to go mad. He also insinuates he was indirectly responsible for a local butcher accidentally severing an artery and bleeding to death. Crowley had written the names of some demons on a bill from the butcherâ€™s shop.

Garry S. Grantâ€™s documentary is never less than engaging, and contains fine contributions from Kenneth Anger, Colin Wilson, Neil Oram, Head of the UK OTO, John Bonner and Mogg Morgan. The commentary is read by former Jesus of Nazarerth actor Robert Powell.

The Man We Want to Hang (2002) 
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360775/

Every time you turn on your television set it's impossible to avoid the imprints of Kenneth Anger's influence on nearly everything that flashes across the screen. More widely known for his dishy Hollywood exposÃ©s Hollywood Babylon and Hollywood Babylon II than his influential body of short films, the maverick director, along with his contemporary Andy Warhol, explored the ways commonplace images and objects can be subverted to project different meanings. But Anger's most lasting and pervasive influence (to which everybody from Martin Scorsese and Wes Anderson to every non-reality television show is heavily indebted) is his innovative use of pop songs as the basis for a film soundtrack.

The title comes from a newspaper headline, one of many that the tabloid press bestowed on occultist Aleister Crowley whilst titillating their readers with lurid descriptions of orgies and Black Masses throughout the 1920s. Before the Second World War it was still possible to label a self-aggrandising magus â€œThe Wickedest Man in the Worldâ€. If only they knew what was comingâ€¦

The paintings were filmed in exhibition at the October Gallery in 1998 and Anger turns the original tabloid headline around by making the hang refer to hanging a painting. Crowleyâ€™s crude artwork often turns up in books but there are several pictures in the film I hadnâ€™t come across before. Crowleyâ€™s depiction of the Himalayas, where he spent some time mountaineering, look very similar to those of Nicholas Roerich, the painter whose work HP Lovecraft references in At the Mountains of Madness. It would have been nice to have some more information about the pictures but thatâ€™s not Angerâ€™s style.
