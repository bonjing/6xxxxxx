RELEASE INFORMATION

Platforms: Windows desktop OS, PocketPC (2002 to Mobile 5+)

Yanceyware is Freeware (actually it's Donation-ware, please donate at 
www.yanceyware.com. I did).  It was developed by an LDS member in his own free
time, and it's superior to most handheld readers out there. Even the PC desktop
version is fantastic. 

I've included the following in this release:
- Yanceyware software and tools: 
	YanCEyWare Reader.exe -- this is the PocketPC software installation for 
		WindowsPPC2002 or higher.  
	PocketPC cab files -- these can be copied to your device and installed 
		directly on your device.  Two different files are included: 
		WindowsPPC2002 and higher
		Windows Mobile 5 and higher
	YanCEyDesktop 1.40.0855.exe -- Yancey Reader for Windows OS (requires
		the installation of dotnet2.0 or higher)
	YanceyLink -- Allows you to convert ebooks from GospeLink 2001 to 
		Yancey ebook (ybk) format.  
	XPresso_0.2[20].exe -- Allows you to convert any html document into 
		Yancey ebook (ybk) format. 

- GospeLink collection -- I used the Yanceylink tool to convert the entire 
	GospeLink 2001 library and included all 1500+ ebooks here (minus 
	periodicals, such as the Ensign, New Era, Friend, Liahona, etc. -- it 
	crashed everytime I tried to to convert these).

- Sorted Libraries -- These ebooks are sorted into different folders by subject,
	thus you can select each relevant library, instead of having to sift 
	through a single massive library list of hundreds of ebook titles on 
	your PocketPC.

May the Lord bless you and lead you in your Gospel research.  Please make good 
use of these tools to honor our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
