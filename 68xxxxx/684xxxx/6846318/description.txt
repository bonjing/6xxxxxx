This boxed set contains Pat\'s rare 1953 Republic recordings and every single DOT recording made during the Fifties. The original mono versions of Pat\'s hits (never reissued on CD before now) are here together with the more commonly used 1959 stereo re-makes. All of Pat\'s albums from the Fifties are here (most in stereo), and there\'s even an unissued album. There are 88 previously unheard recordings, including unissued versions of several big hits like Friendly Persuasion, Love Letters, A Wonderful Time Up There, Too Soon To Know and others. The set is rounded out with an 84-page hardcover LP-sized book with a biography, discography and numerous photographs from Pat\'s personal collection.
