Comments:

Another quasi legal issue, of the 'hotch potch' of the Hamburg recordings.

I have listed the dates and versions as Identified in several sources, However I do not remain convinced at either the running order or the dates of the shows for example at the end of track 8 John can be heard saying 'I'm a roadrunner honey' but this falls between songs that are alleged recorded on the 25 and 28 December , where as the only recording we have of 'Roadrunner' is supposedly from the 31 December 1962.

I am amazed that no one has clearly identified the three tapes and original sources, clearly the shows were recorded without edits between or of the songs as keep being released and unfortunately I quickly loose interest. If someone provides a copy of unedited tapes I'll readdress the versions , but for now what you see is what you get. Heavily edited and processed songs in a jumbled order.

This is the best version to date that I have heard, but I have yet to find a copy of the Lingasong disc
Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg: Germany; 1962'.
