Because the audio was alright played back on the Boston Accoustics PC 2.1 speakers and on the Sharp Aquos TV 2.0 speakers.
I know what you're talking about but it's not a HUGE ordeal like you're making it out to be.
That's why I didn't bother with it.

Calm you're damn horses cuz I've released a real HD source version with audio you better not bitch about.

If you don't like it then by all means you do not download from me ever again.
