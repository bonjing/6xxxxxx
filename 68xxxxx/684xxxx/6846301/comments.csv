¨¬ù customized PC DVD burner fw allows for burning 100% of an XGD3 ISO to regular DVD+R DL discs. Preferred media for error-free burns are Verbatim MKM001 (burning at 2.4x), and Verbatim MKM003 (burning at 2.4x or 4x). Note: √¢‚Ç¨≈ìA√¢‚Ç¨¬ù versions have MTK chipset, but are old and untested. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìY√¢‚Ç¨¬ù versions have the NEC chipset, which is not supported. All regular features of the burner function as normal, including LightScribe, LabelTag, Smart-Erase, Smart-Burn, Smart-X, and SuperAllWrite. Even with the custom iXtreme Burner MAX fw flashed to the drive, it is still fully functional as a regular burner, not only for XGD3, but also XGD2, and all other ISOs and data, up to 8.7GB worth."
