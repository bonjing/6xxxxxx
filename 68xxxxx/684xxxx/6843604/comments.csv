 is way off the mark. 9 would be very close to a dvd rip and this is nowhere near that.  A/V 5 and thats being generous. Watched it on a 32 inch screen and it was just about watchable...Not much better than a ts and ive seen better cams. So if u really cant wait then i suppose this will do. If u can id say wait for the proper dvd rip as this torrent should be labelled as a ppv
