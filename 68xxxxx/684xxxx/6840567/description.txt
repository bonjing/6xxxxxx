Bafta-winning film-maker Brian Hill unravels the extraordinary story of Mark Kennedy, the undercover police officer who infiltrated groups of environmentalists to inform on their planned protests. He lived as Mark Stone for seven years, becoming a popular figure in the community, sleeping with women and falling in love with one activist, even as he gathered intelligence. 

Kennedy paints a picture of two worlds: the mostly well-intentioned world of the activists and the uncaring police he was working for. Itâ€™s hard to know which is more shocking: his sexual relationships with â€œtargetsâ€ or the scale of resources devoted to thwarting peaceful protest. 


Either way, itâ€™s an eye-opening film.
