This is an accompaniment disc formerly included with William D. Mounce's "Basics of Biblical Greek." You do not need to have the book to benefit from this program.

The disc has a full 35 chapter video lecture series, visually instructing the student concerning the in's and out's of Koine Greek; everything from basic alphabet/pronunciation to rare tenses and moods.

Furthermore, the disc has interactive tools for quickly learning the language:

        Parseworks 

Parseworks is a program allowing the student to practice the parsing process in order to learn to correctly determine the proper case/number/gender/tense/voice/mood quickly and easily. This skill is necessary for ensuring proper translation. 

        Flashworks

FlashWorks is a vocabulary drilling program. Each word is tagged for difficulty, type (noun, verb, etc.), chapter, and frequency in the Biblical text. You can then ask for any cross section you wish, such as "all verbs occurring more than 30 times in the New Testament that occur in chapters 16 through 24 in the text and which I have tagged with a difficulty rating of three through five" (five being the most difficult for you). FlashWorks remembers words as you get them right and/or wrong and can automatically set the difficulty rating. An updated Flashworks version may currently be downloaded for free from http://www.teknia.com/flashworks

All in all, this is a great help for any student of Koine (biblical) Greek, its a shame the author no longer includes it for free when purchasing the book.
