├óΓé¼┼ôThis game is awesome, think Real Racing for boxing! The 3D engine is superb. I hardly ever give 5 starts trust me, so far the demo deserves it. I├óΓé¼Γäóm buying the full version now. If this was made by Gameloft or some other big developer, this would be in the top 25, I├óΓé¼Γäóm pretty sure.├óΓé¼┬¥
