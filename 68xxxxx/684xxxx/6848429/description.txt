Source: DVDSCR ZJM thx

Encode:

I had to do some Premiere Pro video editing, the source screener was terribly dark.
It still has chinese subs, cropping them looses too much. It's better as it is now.
It's not R5, but all in all, I think it's the best there is at the moment.

Video: 720x576 PAL (25 fps)

Audio: English AC3 2.0 Stereo

Subs:  Romanian only -&gt; preselected
