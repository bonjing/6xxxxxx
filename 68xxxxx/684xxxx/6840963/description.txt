Symbion app that ACTUALLY uses your camera light as a torch

I bought it for my Vivaz. Sony Ericsson phones used to have a lovely built in function for that but not since they let damned Nokia make their software. If I wanted a Nokia phone I'd have damn well bought one!!

anyhow, the app cost me a few Â£'s so here it is for you for free :-)

enjoy
