Long time HearYa favorites, Elliott BROOD are back with their 3rd effort entitled Days Into Years. And true to their rootsy form, the Toronto based trio does not disappoint. After a 5-day journey through the seasides towns, battlefields and cemeteries of the French and Belgian coasts, BROOD saw Canadian names etched in stone at a World War 1 cemetery and started writing a record. Inspired by ghosts and monuments, Days Into Years is a lasting piece of work in its own right.
