 2070. Our world has changed. The rising level of the ocean has harmed the
 coastal cities and climate change has made large stretches of land
 inhospitable.

 The latest in the award-winning strategy series, Anno 2070 offers a new
 world full of challenges, where you will need to master resources,
 diplomacy, and trade in the most comprehensive economic management system in
 the Anno series.

 Build your society of the future, colonize islands, and create sprawling
 megacities with multitudes of buildings, vehicles, and resources to manage.
 Engineer new production chains such as Robot Factories, Oil Refineries and
 Diamond Mines and trade with a variety of goods and commodities.

 * A new era
   While adhering to the fundamentals that made the Anno franchise a success,
   the near-future setting will bring numerous new gameplay mechanics,
   architectural breakthroughs, and all new challenges. Additionally, players
   will be able to build massive cities, the scope of which has never been
   seen in prior Anno games.
 * Become an architect of the future
   Face the current world challenges to shape the world of tomorrow. You can
   either join the Tycoons to pursue an industrial and efficient course, or
   side with the Ecos to create a more sustainable and environmentally
   friendly direction.
 * An evolving, dynamic world
   Decisions will have an impact on the environment, the architectural look
   of the world, and the needs of populations.
 * Discover hidden depths and new resources
   The mysteries of the sea and the sky are waiting to be discovered. Take
   advantage of the transport systems of the future and develop a powerful
   economy.
 * The enhanced Anno with new features to master
   Smuggle wares between harbors without being detected by the coastal
   patrols or forge alliances with powerful figures to expand your influence.
