Anuman Interactive has released new screenshots for XIII: Lost Identity, putting to rest once and for all rumors that this might be a sequel to Ubisoft's 2003 first-person shooting game. It's not! Anuman describes Lost Identity as an "interactive story with puzzle games and enigmas," based on the original Belgian comic books. Check out the screens behind the cut.
