Her voice is amazing. I think love game is good, but one of her lowest grade songs when it comes to talent. Every time I hear her sing acoustic my heart melts and i fall in love....

people have their preferences. Thank you for ending by not putting mine down.

""A Very GaGa Thanksgiving"" are amazingly stunning performances that really touched my heart.
highly recommended!"
