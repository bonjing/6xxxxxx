  2070. Our world has changed. The rising level of the ocean has harmed the
  coastal cities and climate change has made large stretches of land
  inhospitable.
 
  The latest in the award-winning strategy series, Anno 2070 offers a new
  world full of challenges, where you will need to master resources,
  diplomacy, and trade in the most comprehensive economic management system in
  the Anno series.
 
  Build your society of the future, colonize islands, and create sprawling
  megacities with multitudes of buildings, vehicles, and resources to manage.
  Engineer new production chains such as Robot Factories, Oil Refineries and
  Diamond Mines and trade with a variety of goods and commodities.
 
  * A new era
    While adhering to the fundamentals that made the Anno franchise a success,
    the near-future setting will bring numerous new gameplay mechanics,
    architectural breakthroughs, and all new challenges. Additionally, players
    will be able to build massive cities, the scope of which has never been
    seen in prior Anno games.
  * Become an architect of the future
    Face the current world challenges to shape the world of tomorrow. You can
    either join the Tycoons to pursue an industrial and efficient course, or
    side with the Ecos to create a more sustainable and environmentally
    friendly direction.
  * An evolving, dynamic world
    Decisions will have an impact on the environment, the architectural look
    of the world, and the needs of populations.
  * Discover hidden depths and new resources
    The mysteries of the sea and the sky are waiting to be discovered. Take
    advantage of the transport systems of the future and develop a powerful
    economy.
  * The enhanced Anno with new features to master
    Smuggle wares between harbors without being detected by the coastal
    patrols or forge alliances with powerful figures to expand your influence.
