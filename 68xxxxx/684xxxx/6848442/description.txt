Game Description:

he Holy Zeteginean Empire came about as a result of the great war against King Zenobia. But the Empire was holy in name only, as the oppressive emperor rules through ruthless military force and fear. But on the shores along the eastern frontiers, the remnants of the Knights of Zenobia begin to stir. You must lead this rebellion against the Holy Zeteginean Empire, which is the last gasp of hope in this bleak world. OGRE BATTLE is a remake of the cult RPG or strategy game for the SNES, with a 32-bit upgrade. The game takes place through 30 strategic battles, each with a fair amount of role-playing customizability. You can equip groups with magic items, promote characters to new skill classes, and form new teams.
