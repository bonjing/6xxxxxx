Synopsis:


While trying to avoid the clichÃ©s of Hollywood romantic comedies, Dylan and Jamie soon discover however that adding the act of sex to their friendship does lead to complications.
The undeniably hot chemistry between Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis easily makes Friends with Benefits a hilariously perfect romantic comedy which not only took a stab at the romantic comedy cliches, but also brought the "sexy" back to a genre that has grown stale in the recent years.

NOTES : RippeR brings to you another high quality release in small size. English Subtitles added. Check sample before downloading :)
