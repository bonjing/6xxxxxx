This is a compilation of all audio books written and READ by Douglas Adams that I know of. The sources of the books are mainly torrents with the best quality I could find.
e.g. The trilogy was posted by h00py on demonoid, but The restaurant at the end of the universe missed some chapters, I filled in the chapters with chapters from a different dl, albeit with lesser quality.

All books are chapterized. Almost all files are 64Kbps or more.
Have fun.
