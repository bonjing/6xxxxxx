
Advanced Magick for Beginners


The author assumes no previous knowledge, only a willingness to explore what magick offers, yet itâ€™s apparent to anyone with a background in the subject that Alan Chapman is drawing on a wide range of experience, from classical Crowleyean Magick to eastern metaphysics, and back again to Discordianism and Chaos Magick. Chapmanâ€™s writing-style is humorous, direct, seductively logical, and his enthusiasm for the benefits of magick is both tangible and infectious.The novice magician will indeed find themselves equipped to commence all sorts of magickal operations: trance work, enchantment, divination, and even some of the higher forms of spiritual development. To experienced magicians, Chapman offers a subtler challenge: he revitalizes magick by cutting it free from the extreme relativism Chaos Magick bequeathed, provocatively redefining it as: â€œthe art, science and culture of experiencing truth.â€
