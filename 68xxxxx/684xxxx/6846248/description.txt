Plot
 
There's something terribly wrong with Nina's adopted son Tyler. The seductive Dr. Max Schreck knows the cure - fresh, young blood. Schreck, who's really the original Prince of Darkness and father of Tyler, has discovered that vampires can lead more normal lives by existing on the hospital's blood supply. Max intends to seduce Nina into being his next victim, and together with Tyler they will rule over a new age of vampires. But Tom, Max's jealous brother, has a plot of his own as he intends to destroy Max.
