First note: YOU MUST HAVE A MODDED PLAYSTATION TO PLAY THESE, or PLAY THEM ON AN EMULATOR.

I have ripped these at the lowest possible read speed ~4x. They are .mdf and .mds files. I could not make them iso's. They dont work if I do that.

I can confirm that they do in fact work. I have burned them all to cd's and they play perfectly on my MODDED Playstation 2.

These are my own "ORIGINAL" discs that I ripped from. My discs have no scratches, so I dont expect there to be any problems. Let me know if there are though.

This is an epic game!!! As you would already know if you have found this torrent. 

To make this even sweeter for you guys, I will also provide this link:
 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6836267/Legend_of_Dragoon_Official_Prima_Guide


This is one of my other torrents, an Official Prima Strategy Guide for The Legend Of Dragoon,  it is in PDF form, no passwords, no viruses. Happy downloading and have fun!!!


I will be seeding 24/7, forever! But please do your part and seed too! This game deserves it....

I have a 650kbps connection, so it shouldn't take too long to download.
 
Let me know if you need help trying to burn them to discs to play on your machine, I will provide support. If you are trying to play them on an emulator, I am sorry but I cannot help as I do not know how to get those to work very well.
