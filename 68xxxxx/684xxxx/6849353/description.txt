This is a fresh build of the excellent compendium of C.M. Kornbluth's short fiction from NESFA Press. Given that they're dragging their feet on joining the twenty-first century and offering quality e-book versions of their titles, hopefully this will be a nice introduction to Kornbluth to the e-reader crowd. Available as an epub or mobi.
