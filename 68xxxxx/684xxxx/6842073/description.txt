This time Max and Stacy discuss taxpayers in the West being pepper-sprayed with toxic debts, while in China fraudsters receive five fingers of death. 

In the second half of the show, Max talks to Gregor Macdonald about Warren Buffett's investment in Japan and the cost benefit analysis of the energy policy of invading resource-rich nations in order to liberate their oil.        



The .mp3 in the torrent is audio extracted from the Russia Today video. You can watch the video online at:

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
