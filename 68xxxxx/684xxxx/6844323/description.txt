An unemployed young man, Daniel, walks the streets of his town, trying to chat up girls, making money here and there through scams with his friends. To earn money to buy himself a new coat, he accepts a job from a local photographer to dress up and pose as a pavement Santa Claus. In his new costume, Daniel finds that he is treated far more kindly by people, especially women...
