It may sound stupid, but if they were rotten enough to switch the Screener ending, why wouldn't they do that with an R5. Anyone who knows about the whole story on the switch please educate me.

Will report back only if the actual movie for this torrent is diff in A/V from the sample. Otherwise appears good to go! "
