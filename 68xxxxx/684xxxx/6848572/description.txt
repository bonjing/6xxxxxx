The web brought a world of music to our doorstep, but listening in a web browser is a huge hassle. Musicality makes services like Pandora, Last.fm, and Grooveshark just as easy to use as iTunes. If you love music, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it!

One player, much music

Musicality lets you switch quickly and easily between Pandora, Last.fm and Grooveshark (with more on the way) so you can enjoy your music no matter where it lives.

Break free of the browser

Get your music out of the browser and into a streamlined window of its own. Close it, and the music keeps on playing. No more juggling browser tabs, or accidentally closing the wrong window. 

Rock the keyboard

Use the media keys or define your own keyboard shortcuts to play, pause, skip, and rate your music without leaving your current application or even taking your hands off the keyboard. 

Growl

Musicality works with the popular Growl notification service, letting you know which song is playingâ€”including the title, artist, album, and even the cover artâ€”simply and unobtrusively. 

Remote control

Musicality supports the Apple Remote so you can play, pause, skip and even rate your music without ever leaving the dance floor.

Last.fm

Musicality can send information about the songs you play to Last.fm, where you can share it, track it, and graph your listening trends in all kinds of interesting ways.
