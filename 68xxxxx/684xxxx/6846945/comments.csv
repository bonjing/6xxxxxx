I have injected code into uTorrent as you can see with the 6 radio buttons.

It multiplies you actual data in real time so if you select X50 and upload @ 10kb/s for 10 sec uTorrent is
gonna show that you have uploaded:

10kb x 50 x 10s = 5000kb (5MB)

If you then swtch back to X1 @ 10kb/s for 10 sec uTorrent is gonna report that you have uploaded

10ikb x 1 x 10s = 100kb (0,1MB) for a total of 5,1mb"
