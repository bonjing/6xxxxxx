Entertainment Tonight Canada Conversations || 25 November 2011 || Nickelback


In the aftermath of the protest over their performance at the half-time show for the Detroit Lions football game on the US Thanksgiving the guys of Nickelback are in Toronto talking with their old friend Rick Campanelli. Then they are the half-time show for the 99th Grey Cup between Vancouver and Winnipeg, in Vancouver. Methinks they love any kind of football to be doing two half-time shows in one week. 

Much was made of the petition to NOT have them perform in Detroit. The band says it was down to one guy who was wanting that gig himself and who just wasn't happy with being rejected. So he got out a little propaganda and tried to get everyone to hate the decision. But apparently actual people in Detroit loved the idea of them doing the half-time show. -- Can you tell i watched an episode of Love Hate & Propaganda before this show? -- No bad press? Also, Chad's new hair style is rather shocking the first time you see it.
