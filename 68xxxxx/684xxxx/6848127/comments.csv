many hrs work, screener was dark as hell, but that can be fixed, played with brightness and contrast, its right on the edge without going over.
Screener has some chinese subs in two lines and english underneath, cropping them away looses too much video. better let them as they are. Also see no use in blurring them. 
Only fixed the ar.
what made it more complicated is the video was running too low, so everytime the video is moving its stuttering a lot,which is really annoying in an action movie.
that was very complicated to fix, made 5 different videos to get it finally done, video is now running smoothly.
Audio was also messy, it has so much bass in action scenes, i had to run it through couple instances of cleaning, its still there, but not as agressive as it was before.

V: 8
A: 8 for dvdscr

its very watchable"
