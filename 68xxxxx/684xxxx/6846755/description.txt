Ronnie Milsap Live
RCA Victor AYL1-4255
Â©1976

It took a while but I finally found a new sealed copy of
this record.  I cleaned it and recorded it with fairly nice
equipment and then did a two-pass critical listen with
headphones on while I took out a few minor imperfections
with Goldwave.  I don\\\\\\\'t think you\\\\\\\'ll be distracted by a
single snap or pop.  There is a low audio buzz in the right
channel at the start of Play Born To Lose Again that I am
convinced is in the vinyl.  Other than that I believe it\\\\\\\'s a
very nice recording.

I\\\\\\\'m going to offer it in three torrents.  The FLAC version
is one long continuous track and has the cover and label
scans at 300 DPI.  The MP3 version is cut into tracks
according to the disk labels and has the cover and label
scans at 150 dpi.  The Wave version is for those who want to
burn it directly to an audio CD and also includes the 150
DPI scans.

I bought this album for one song: I Can Almost See Houston
From Here.  It\\\\\\\'s my all time favorite Ronnie Milsap song and
as far as I can determine, it was never released on any
other album.  The rest of the album is OK, in my opinion,
except for Honky Tonk Women.  Besides being totally out of
place in this album, it didn\\\\\\\'t need covered by Ronnie Milsap
or anyone else.

Whatever.  Have fun.
