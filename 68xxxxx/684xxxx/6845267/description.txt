Benny Anderssons Orkester (aka BAO aka Benny Andersson Band) is a Swedish band, with Benny Andersson as musical leader and composer. The band was formed in mid 2001 by 16 people, some from Orsa SpelmÃ¤n, and Helen SjÃ¶holm and since 2004 Tommy KÃ¶rberg as singers.

BAO includes some of Sweden's most experienced contemporary and folk musicians:

Benny Andersson - accordion, piano, synclavier, etc.
GÃ¶ran Arnberg - pipe organ, spinet
Janne Bengtson - flute, piccolo, crumhorn, baritone saxophone
PÃ¤r Grebacken - saxophones, clarinet, recorder, piccolo
Leif GÃ¶ras - violin, cello, mandolin
Nicke (Nils-Erik) GÃ¶the - violin, mandolin
Jogga (Jan-Anders) Ernlund - contrabass
Calle Jakobsson - tuba, bassoon
Leffe Lindvall - trumpet, cornet
Kalle Moraeus - violin, zither, guitar, banjo, etc.
Olle Moraeus - violin, viola, mandolin
Perra (Per-Erik) Moraeus - violin, mandolin, saxophone
Lars Rudolfsson - accordion
JÃ¶rgen Stenberg - drums, percussion instruments
Tommy KÃ¶rberg - vocals, guitar
Helen SjÃ¶holm - vocals

All members of the band are occupied in external capacities during the majority of the year, some in the theater orchestras in Stockholm. The brothers Moraeus, Leif GÃ¶ras and Nicke GÃ¶the play together in Orsa SpelmÃ¤n. During the summers the members of BAO meet up and rehearse, and then go out on mini-tours, to which tickets are highly sought after. The concept of these tours are A concert with dance, so a dance floor is brought along. Tommy KÃ¶rberg and Helen SjÃ¶holm together perform the vocals for the non-instrumental songs.

Being a typical Benny Anderssons Orkester album, BAO 3 (the title indicates that it's the third BAO album) includes many different musical styles, ranging from Swedish folk music to pop, jazz, classical tunes and viennese influences. The album is officially credited to Benny Anderssons Orkester, Helen SjÃ¶holm & Tommy KÃ¶rberg, indicating that it also includes several tracks with vocals. In fact, compared to its studio predecessor, BAO! in 2004, the amount of vocals tracks has increased. No less than seven out of the 12 tracks on the album are sung by either Helen SjÃ¶holm or Tommy KÃ¶rberg or as a duet. Tommy KÃ¶rberg can be heard on a BAO studio album for the first time , after already appearing together with the group during their tours and also lending vocals to two tracks on Benny Andersson's two solo albums from the 1980s, Klinga mina klockor and November 1989.
As usual, most of the lyrics were written by Benny's former ABBA partner BjÃ¶rn Ulvaeus, while all the music was composed by Benny Andersson himself.

BAO 3 was recorded in Sveriges Radios Studio 5 and Atlantis Studio, both in Stockholm, during 2007. Like all Benny Anderssons Orkester albums, it was engineered by Bernard LÃ¶hr und subsequently mixed by him and Benny Andersson at Mono Music Studio. (wikipedia)
