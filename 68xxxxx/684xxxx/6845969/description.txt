Biograph is a 53-track compilation spanning the career of Bob Dylan, from his 1962 debut album to the 1981 LP Shot of Love. Released in 1985 by Columbia Records, on both a 5-LP and a 3-CD Box set, it was one of the earliest and most successful examples of the CD Box set. It reached no.33 in the US and went platinum. Sony Music is now releasing the box once again in Europe.

The recordings on Biograph are a mix of rarities, hit singles, and fan-favorite album tracks. They are not presented in chronological order, instead jumping around the 60s, 70s and 80s from song to song. Of the 53 tracks, 22 had not been previously issued on any of Dylan's albums, including Lay Down Your Weary Tune (which closes the Martin Scorsese film No Direction Home) and Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?.

The set comes accompanied with a 42-page booklet, containing rare photos and liner notes by Cameron Crowe, who also interviews Dylan about each of the tracks.
