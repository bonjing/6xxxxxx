Tested on PSP-1000(5.50 GEN + Prometheus 4) & PSP-2000 (6.20 TN-E) + Prometheus Iso Loader v1.

Instructions:

To play just put game-iso to ISO directory on your Memory Stick.

And remember these files are for the custom firmwares ONLY!

Enjoy & Have fun! :)

Follow me on twitter @NitrogenUA, to be aware of further releases.

P.S.: Might be a good idea to convert this to ISO, if you experience any performance issues.
