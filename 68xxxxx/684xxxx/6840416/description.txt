Command your army and battle enemies on land, sea and air. Select your units wisely and deploy them to take full advantage of higher ground, natural choke points and defensive walls.

Tactical decisions will be made on every turn. Where should your reinforcements go? Does your base have adequate defences? Do you have time to capture that enemy Factory? Can you afford an aerial strike? Should you make another cup of tea before starting the next round?

It's a Great Little War out there, and you'd better be ready for it!

Varied missions are the order of the day here - Capture the enemy HQ, Escort the Generalissimo to safety, Guide small squads behind enemy lines, Defend your base... it's going to be one crazy ride!

But fear not - the Great (and definitely NOT cowardly) Generalissimo is here to save the day, along with his indefatigable aide Jenkins. If the Great Little War doesn't get to you, their puns and hi-jinks certainly will.

So tell us, Trooper. Have you got what it takes to win this Great Little War?
