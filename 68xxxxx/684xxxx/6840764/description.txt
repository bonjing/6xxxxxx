1920 X 1080p 3400k video bitrate 256k audio 2CD format with a break

includes subtitles for Danish Spanish Romanian Serbian and with 
an English template set of srts too for those that want to make
subs for other languages available too using a template such as this.
Nice music from the movie and the Russian Red army chorus samples too
are included in a separate folder here for you.

Reds is a movie about a great peoples - the peoples of Russia in fullness
of what is Euro potential of the most beautiful form. It is sad that Russia
was so little aided by the Bush administration in its early start with free
markets and personal freedoms, and its a sad pity that some old guard 
oppressive types still hang around at the Kremlin. 

If there were more caring folks from the US such as "Jack Reed"
(Beatty's Character in the movie) who really had better ideas than to
support communism or any other sort of oppressive regime to the human spirit
the world would indeed be a better place in which to exist. Nukes aren't
needed nor do we need men who want to live for them. Anywhere at all.
Whats needed is the human spirit of Julie Andrews to be allowed to rise to 
the top in Russia - equally - and then some more - I hope and pray!
