Guest Stars --- Alfred Ryder and Richard Mulligan.

Just a heads-up on this one: Michael Landon's script was filmed 
early in 1968 to air during the 9th Season but NBC pre-empted 
it after Martin Luther King's murder. It wasn't really 
any more violent than the average episode.

As one of the longer delays in TV history while a series 
was still in production, it didn't finally air until 3 years later. 
So that's the reason Candy is in the episode, the photography, 
editing, and music are different, and Joe's hair is shorter.

The only thing that changed is the 9th Season theme (the last 
with the version heard since the beginning of the series) was replaced 
by the 12th Season one to fit in with the other episodes that year.

David Canary who played ranch foreman Candy from the 9th through 
11th Seasons, was billed as a "Special Guest Star". He returned 
to the series in 1972 for the 14th Season following Dan Blocker's death.
