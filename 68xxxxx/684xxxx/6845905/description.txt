
The Craft of the Cocktail: Everything You Need to Know to Be a Master Bartender, with 500 Recipes

Cocktails are bigger than ever, and this is the first real cookbook for them, covering the entire breadth of this rich subject. The Craft of the Cocktail provides much more than merely the same old recipes: it delves into history, personalities, and anecdotes; it shows you how to set up a bar, master important techniques, and use tools correctly; and it delivers unique concoctions, many featuring Dale DeGroffâ€™s signature use of fresh juices, as well as all the classics.

Debonair, a great raconteur, and an unparalleled authority, Dale DeGroff is the epitome of Perfect Bartender, universally acknowledged as the worldâ€™s premier mixologist. From Entertainment Weekly and USA Today to the Culinary Institute of America and the nationâ€™s best restaurants, whenever anybody wants information or training on the bar, they turn to Dale for recipes, for history, for anecdotes, for funâ€”for cocktail-party conversation as well as for cocktails.

Thatâ€™s what The Craft of the Cocktail isâ€”the full party, conversation and all. It begins with the history of spirits, how theyâ€™re made (but without too much boring science), the development of the mixed drink, and the culture it created, all drawn from Daleâ€™s vast library of vintage cocktail books. Then on to stocking the essential bar, choosing the right tools and ingredients, mastering key techniquesâ€”hints worthy of a pro, the same information that Dale shares with the bartenders he trains in seminars and through his videos. And then the meat of the matter: 500 recipes, including everything from tried-and-true classics to of-the-moment originals. Throughout are rich stories, vintage recipes, fast facts, and other entertaining asides. Beautiful color photographs and a striking design round out the cookbook approach to this subject, highlighting the difference between an under-the-bar handbook and a stylish, full-blown treatment. The Craft of the Cocktail is that treatment, destined to become the bible of the bar.
