Depending upon what sites you visit, I'd also recommend Grace Potter & the Nocturnals at Red Rocks - 2011.  

Both shows, the band really fires up and has a great time.  For all I know, that happens for each performance they do?

If you search ""Live From the Artists Den"" on this site, there is a handful of really enjoyable shows to see."
