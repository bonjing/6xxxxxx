  Spend three months in the life of one ordinary Australian family.     
                                                                        
  The Cardamone family allowed 35 remote-controlled cameras to follow   
  their every move, day and night, for three months. The result is a    
  no-holds-barred view of the dynamics and universal themes of family   
  life.                                                                 
                                                                        
  Dad Angelo, Mum Josephine, and their three boys - David (20), Stefan  
  (18), and Adrian (14) - live in the outer suburbs of Melbourne.       
  There is nothing unusual about them, except that they agreed to take  
  part in this project. When we meet them, we find out Dad works in     
  the construction industry, Mum in cosmetic sales, David is at uni,    
  Stefan is in his last year of school, and Adrian is in Year 9. They   
  have lots of friends and extended family who pop in.                  
                                                                        
  Over eight weeks, we watch their lives unfold; from exam results to   
  birthday parties, from pizza nights to Christmas celebrations - the   
  stuff of everyday life. But by allowing such intimate filming of      
  their lives the Cardamones also reveal all that is behind the         
  ordinary. The emotions, the tensions, the strengths and the           
  weaknesses that shape the way we all behave. Its not always pretty,  
  but its real.                                                        
                                                                        
  The Family is about the Cardamones, but it is also about all of us.   
  What makes us tick, how do we interact, and how do we celebrate,      
  commiserate, and consider our lives?                                  
                                                                        
  Episode 1: Married With Children                                      
                                                                        
  After 25 years of marriage, Angelo and Josephine have learnt to       
  negotiate most things. But when their youngest son wants a trail      
  bike for his birthday they are totally divided.
