This is I submit, the greatest piece of literature ever written in
any language - it is needless to say in the most brilliant English
by the greatest philosopher of all time - Sir John Stuart Mill

In it he argues that we must act to prevent evil to others by
accordingly limiting the freedoms of those who would otherwise 
cause such harm to others - while being respectful of everyone's
rights otherwise to be free from molestation by the state as it were.

Everyone should have read this document in order to be a competent
civic duty capable human being - to the fullest extent possible I submit
