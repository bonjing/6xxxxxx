Allmusic Review:
Originally issued in 1990 under the name This Christmas, this album finds one of soul's most fiery and recognizable voices delivering a 12-song session filled with contemporary and original Christmas compositions. It's safe and delightful background music for the holiday season, and her sultry vocals make the otherwise two-dimensional backing music seem rich and full. For the most part the collection is easygoing and pleasant, with the highlight being her beautiful interpretation of "O Holy Night" and the lowlight most definitely being an acrobatic and vocally dramatic "Angel Man" as the album's closer. It's a very nice record on the whole, but likely of enjoyment only to LaBelle's die-hard fans. Most casual listeners would find this CD to be nothing more than a passing holiday fancy.
