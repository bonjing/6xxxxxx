They also have a remastered version of the series that is ~18-19GB  (and has enough seeds that I was able to download in less than 24 hours) with default English audio that's amazing as well. If you'd like your English GW with the best possible quality then these two torrents are your best bets. (If you prefer Japanese audio, then the [EG] remastered release is smaller and of nearly equal quality. :)"
