[/b][/color] Based on his "Why Did I Get Married?" movies, Tyler Perry???s "For Better or Worse" follows the ups and downs of marriage and dating.
The show centers on Angela Williams (Tasha Smith), the owner of a successful beauty salon, and her husband of 13 years, Michael (Michael Jai White). Michael is a former professional football player who has recently partnered with Richard Ellington (Kent Faulcon) and Joseph Jetson (Jason Olive) on a new sports news program called C-Sports Now.

Michael???s business relationship with Richard and Joseph is complicated, however, by the fact that Joseph is dating Keisha (Kiki Haynes), Michael???s ex-girlfriend and the mother of his teenage daughter.
In addition, Richard???s wife, successful real estate agent Leslie (Crystle Stewart), is Angela???s best friend, which sometimes makes it difficult for the couples to keep their business and private lives from mingling.
Brown plays Jennifer, a funny, sassy employee in Angela???s salon.

Targeted to young adults, this series mingles its ample supply of comedy with a few more serious moments as the couples deal with the issues they face.
