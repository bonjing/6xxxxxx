Nearly 250 REAL old skool garage from the 94-98 days.

All tracks are mp3 320.

Some records have shown their age so snap, crackle and pop are expected.  I have removed the worst of the pops in all tracks.  If you wish to clean up the mp3 files further, you can use software programs such as Wave Corrector.

Imported using a Technics 1210 and Art USB V2.

More to come in the future.
