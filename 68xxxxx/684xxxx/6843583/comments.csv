it was uploaded earlier? As a previous poster has already stated, ""Do people really not know how to read dates? I mean, I know it's in a numeric format, something most high school dropouts don't know, but come on!
In all seriousness, at the time this was uploaded (November 25, 2011 in case numbers are too hard), this torrent contains all the season 3 episodes AIRED. Of course it's not going to be the whole thing; do you really need someone to tell you this in writing? Can you not deduce the fact that since the rest of season 3 hasn't aired, it must be referring to the complete collection of season 3 that HAS aired up to that date? FFS!""

Now do you understand????"
