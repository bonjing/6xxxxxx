The American version is 60 minutes long, only music. The version from Canada, also released under the title Reunion Concert, is 87 minutes long with more songs and interviews. It's their first taped appearance since The Last Waltz.
Filmed in Vancouver's Queen Elizabeth Theatre at the final concert of the reunion tour of '83, with Levon, Rick, Garth, Richard, Ernie Cate, Earl Cate, Ron Eoff and Terry Cagle.
The original 120 minute version of the concert was shown on a pay TV network in Canada, with no commercials. The interviews are longer and there is more music. Amateur video copies of this TV version may be circulating... The four songs not included in the official video releases are "Voodoo", "You Don't Know Me", "Caldonia", and "Rock'n Roll Shoes".
