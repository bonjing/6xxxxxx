Minecraft installer 3.0.0 for minecraft 1.0.0
READ THIS !!!BEFORE!!! (Especially the troubleshooting section) You E-Mail me for help
I will be using the same name on all my torrents now to avoid confusion with the names (Sorry)

This Minecraft installer was compiled by kaise123 (Kai)

This installer has 3 options for Basic minecraft without mods, minecraft with mods, and minecraft with a mod for improving performance (For slow computers) It is easy to choose which version you want in the installer. All versions have an in-built list of cracked minecraft servers.

I take no credit for the loader, which was created by AngelDE98, AnjoCaido, Mojang (The base), Kartracer97, Smoolak, JBExtrem, Zebz213 and others.
I merely added all the mods and the 'cracked' loader and made a convenient easy-to-use installer that gives you options =)
The mods are owned by their respective creators and I take no credit for their creation. To see the page the mods came from just Google the mod's name.

This is an easy-to-use, user-friendly way of putting minecraft on your computer.

You can contact me via e-mail ~kaise123@gmail.com~. Or add me on Skype (kaiwaugh)

Known Bugs:
Sometimes some of the Zombe mods don't work in some places
The No-Clip mode doesn't work
Please report ANY non-normal minecraft errors or bugs to me!

################### ABOUT ####################

This installer can install minecraft without mods (Vanilla Minecraft) and with Mods
When installed in the multiplayer menu there is already a list of cracked servers for you to play. The top one is mine :)

To play just run the installer, choose what version you wish to install and than click on the icon either on your desktop or in the start menu. If you have a slow internet connection it may take longer to load because it loads the news page.

The modded version includes thease mods:

Zombe's Modpack - A multitude of different mods (Press F7 In-Game for options)
WorldEdit CUI - Allows you to see your worldedit selection
TooManyItems - In-Game item spawning
Single-Player commands - Allows you to use commands and worldedit in single player
Rei's Minimap - A better map than the inbuilt minecraft one that shows other players and mobs (If supported by server)
Console - A better console for minecraft multiplayer
Modloader - Used for better mod compatibility
*Optifine* - Improves minecraft performance by adding various tweaks. Only in the OptiFine Version.

############## TROUBLESHOOTING ###############

If you find that mods don't work, RE-install using the installer and try again. If it still does not work RE-install again and try without an internet connection and see if that works

Minecraft lags??? Try the optifine version. Even though the game may look like it has crap graphics it still needs a half-decent PC to run on.

Java Error? (EG: A Java Run Time Environment was not found on your computer) Install the latest java. 64 Bit computers often need both the 64 AND the 32 bit version.
