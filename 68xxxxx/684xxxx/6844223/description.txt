Give Me the Banjo

Arts Documentary hosted by Steve Martin, published by PBS in 2011 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

The banjo's been called America's quintessential instrument, perhaps because its long and contested history has encompassed so many popular musical forms, from black folk styles and the 19th century minstrel show, to blues, ragtime, early jazz, old time folk and bluegrass. One of the biggest challenges of making Give Me the Banjo was trying to cover the full range and breadth of music that the banjo has helped to shape.
 
Ask Dr. Ralph Stanley what he's been playing for the last half century and he'll call it "old time mountain music." Enjoy these diverse performances from Cynthia Sayer, Taj Mahal, Rhiannon Giddens and Abigail Washburn.

Narrated by Steve Martin, Give Me the Banjo brings together contemporary players-including Pete Seeger, Earl Scruggs, Bela Fleck, Mike Seeger, Don Vappie, Abigail Washburn and The Carolina Chocolate Drops-with folklorists, historians, instrument makers and passionate amateurs to tell the story of America's instrument in all its richness and diversity.

Originally aired on November 4, 2011.
