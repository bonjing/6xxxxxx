Why do the relatively poor native populations in Mexico and Africa have such low levels of the chronic diseases that plague the United States?
Why is the rate of seasonal affective disorder in Icelandâ€”a country where dreary weather is the normâ€”so low?
Why is it that older women in Okinawa have such low breast cancer rates that it is not considered cost-effective for them to get screening mammograms?

The Jungle Effect has the life-changing answers to these important questions, and many more.
Whether it's the heart-healthy Cretan diet, with its reliance on olive oil and fresh vegetables, the antidepressive Icelandic diet and its extremely high levels of omega-3s, the age-defying Okinawa diet and its emphasis on vegetables and fish, or the other diets explored herein, everyone who reads this book will come away with the secrets of a longer, healthier life and the recipes necessary to put those secrets into action. The Jungle Effect is filled with inspiring stories from Dr. Miller's patients, quirky travel adventures, interviews with world-renowned food experts, delicious (yet authentic) indigenous recipes, and valuable diet secrets that will stick with you for a lifetime.
