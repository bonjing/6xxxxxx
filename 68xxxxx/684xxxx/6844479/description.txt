This colorful blowout features saxophonists Paul Flaherty and Joe McPhee (the
latter switches to pocket trumpet on two numbers), trombonist Steve Swell,
bassist John Voigt, and drummer Laurence Cook emphasizing group
improvisations. There are plenty of individual heroics and mood variation for
variety with the most exciting moments are when the full quintet jams together
at its most passionate. The five musicians had never played together before as a
group and did not even rehearse before the recording began. Particularly strong
are Joe McPhee's soprano solos and the wild playing of trombonist Steve Swell
even if the final number, "All Is Always Now," ends a bit inconclusively. All
five players were clearly inspired by the setting and the opportunity to play
with each other, and Paul Flaherty deserves credit for gathering these musicians
together.
