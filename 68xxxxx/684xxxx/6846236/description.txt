Plot
 
Forbidden passion, unquenchable vengeance, and the kiss of darkness all play a deadly role in this electrifying new chapter of vampire lore. Vlad Tepes, the legendary Prince of Darkness, has resurfaced in Los Angeles with a new look, a new life and a new love. But with his new life comes an old enemy... an enemy who has waited his eternal life to even the score.
