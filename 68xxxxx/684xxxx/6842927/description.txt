KNOWN ISSUES

* There are some issues with the notes app when using the HTC Flyer; these are being looked into.

* The keyboard is a little too wide on Archos tablet devices, where a sidebar sits in front of it.

* There are still occasional problems with personalization over a mobile network. Use wifi in the event that this happens.

* Certain applications are known still to suffer from repeated character problems in specific situations. In particular, there is a problem when deleting the first word in message in WhatsApp. We are currently talking to the WhatsApp team to find a fix for this. We have also had reports of problems with the search box on the homepage in Dolphin Browser HD.

* Deleting the first word in a sentence on hard keyboards will change the shift state of the first character (i.e. from upper to lower or vice versa). If this delete action is repeated, the shift state will alternate.
