From todays NY Times.

From DNA sampling to lie detector tests, modern-day detectives have a scientific world at their disposal. Nova investigates the ever-evolving technology used to solve crimes in Nova: The Science of Murder. Police are very careful when dealing with the scene of an incident. One hair sample can become important evidence later on. Aside from garnering clues about the act, thorough examinations can yield answers about motivation and cause. Nova features techniques from forensic scientists and an up-close look at an autopsy. The program interviews psychiatrists and pathologists who solve crime from the inside out. The documentary closes with a nod to gun control and the diminishable nature of violent acts. ~ Sarah Ing, Rovi
