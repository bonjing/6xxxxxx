,Xyberfaust,2011-12-16T14:00Z,"This is the live-action Witchblade series starring Yancy Butler, to clarify.     This is NOT the anime.

It was released as a TV movie on TNT called ""Witchblade"" based on the comic. 
It was so well done and so popular, that they continued it with a tv series that ran for two seasons.  It had really great ratings throughout, but was canceled due to some behind the scenes politics. "
e places back into the show.   It's what it should be.  

So this is basically the definitive and only way to see the original Witchblade episodes with their original audio/music in widescreen.  

I uploaded it to Demonoid with an extensive list of all the original music that is back.  

The premiere episode of Season 2 was originally one big episode (actually aired as a movie called Witchblade 2 on the WB later).  On the DVD release though, it is edited as two separate episodes cut down in time for syndication.  So its missing a bunch of scenes.   I just included the original uncut TVrip of it so it would be complete.  The original music is back in the cut version though.  

Find it's page on Demonoid to read more.

I hope everyone appreciates this wonderful, neglected series.  It's truly one of the great gems lost in time.  And its kinda sad but triumphant that, after years of vocally wishing someone would put back together the way it was, I had to finally take it upon myself to learn how and just do it."
