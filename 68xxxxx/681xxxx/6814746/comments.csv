Thanks for downloading my torrent! I havent been on Pirate Bay in some time, so I'm not even sure you'll see my answer. But as stated in the description, this is just about everything from The Sims 3 Store Updates (not the Store itself, as that would be an INSANE amount of files) from 2009-2011. I actually just recently tried to add December to this file, but this file caused enough problems as is, during its creation, and as expected I was unable to add it. However, I'm sure you have since found it via torrents. I know there were a bunch for December 2011 up to the most current. Hope this helps explain it a little bit. Again, thanks for the nice words, and I'm glad you enjoy the file!"
