The original Xombi series by Milestone and later adopted into the DC mainstream series.  He also appeared as Green Lantern facing off against Anansi.

Xombi was a Korean-American scientist named David Kim from West Orange, New Jersey. He developed a nanotechnological virus capable of extensive tissue regeneration. Before David Kim could test his invention, a villain named Dr. Sugarman broke into his lab and tried to steal the virus. In the fight, Kim was critically injured, and his assistant injected him with the virus in an attempt to save his life. However, since the nanites used available matter to restore Kim, his assistantâ€”who had laid his body on her lapâ€”was partially "devoured" by the nanites. Kim became a "xombi" - a potentially immortal, technologically enhanced human being. This embroiled him in the affairs of various races of supernatural beings that secretly lived among humanity for millennia, known collectively as the shadow worlds.
