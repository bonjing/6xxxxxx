Tyler.Perrys.Meet.the.Browns.S05E06.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 141MB]

[/b][/color] Meet the Browns follows the misadventures of Tyler Perry???s beloved Leroy Brown.
When Brown???s father, Pop Brown, dies and leaves Brown his old house, Brown discovers a letter asking him to ???Take care of the old--??? Brown later discovers that there was a second page that finished that sentence: ???--Thunderbird in the garage???. By then it???s too late, he???s already opened ???Brown Meadows???, a home for seniors.

Thinking he???s carrying out his daddy???s wishes, Brown enlists the help of Cora (his daughter), Will (his nephew), and Will???s wife, Sasha, a nurse.
Soon, because of a fire at a nearby seniors home, Brown Meadows is filled and Brown is overwhelmed.

His new residents include Miss Daisy (an aging B-movie actress who lives in the past, and the many different characters she played in her career), Colonel Cleophus Jackson (an ex-Marine who won???t give Brown an inch), and Ms.
Edna (who???s still very in touch with her sexuality, like ???Blanche??? in Golden Girls).

Soon, they are joined by the handyman, Jes??s, who's studying to be a lawyer and two foster children, Brianna and Joaquin, who have been tossed around from home to home.
Brianna and Joaquin finally find refuge in Brown???s house even though it seems to be an odd match.
Finally, the gorgeous and not-too-smart London Sheraton (a very spoiled celebrity/heiress) is brought to Brown Meadows to serve her community service for a DUI conviction.

With a lot of laughter and some lessons about life, Brown and the residents of Brown Meadows learn to live with and love each other.
