The Black Eyed Peas Experience dance game brings BEP's music, moves and style to gamers. It features fun dance moves as well as hit songs from The Black Eyed Peas multi-platinum selling albums. Players control their on-screen avatar via the Kinect while following the dance moves of 3D avatars, including each of The Black Eyed Peas: apl.de.ap, Fergie, Taboo and will.i.am.

The Black Eyed Peas Experience takes that concept even further, and features a comprehensive selection of The Black Eyed Peas' hit music tracks as well as dance routines arranged by the group's famed creative director and choreographer, Fatima Robinson.
