Since mw3 came out, i have been hoping for xbox controller support. sadly :(  that day never came, but, i have gotten the closest to it, with Xpadder.

Make sure you change your mouse sensitivity and put the hold aim on.

If you  click B , you will crouch
if you hold B, you will go prone.
I hope you like this,
Also, you can browse the menus with this too, not using the friggen mouse

The only issue with this is, B doesnt go back. I am unable to make it go back without fucking something up so here you

Comment for Help!!!
Thanks
