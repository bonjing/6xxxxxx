Academy Awards Best Picture project notes â€“ 

In the case of almost every BP winner, especially the more recent ones, there is no shortage of available torrents. However, these have been ripped to multiple formats and standards. What I noticed is that there was both a shortage of the older films, and that many had not been ripped to the most basic and widely used format; Xvid AVI files. Many also had various other deficiencies, such as missing extras, no subtitles, low resolution, poor seeding, or comments from downloaders noting various technical problems.

So, I have endeavored to create new and clean, fresh rips, including all the extras and so forth. I am seeding each film (starting with the first BP winner, 1928s WINGS) individually, complete with full documentation and screenshots, and clearer labeling. A couple of the oldest films were swiped from existing torrents because a good commercial copy of the DVD is unavailable, but the rest are fresh rips Iâ€™ve made using DVDFab. My technical standards was to try to keep each film to at least .15 pixels. Each film has two passes.
