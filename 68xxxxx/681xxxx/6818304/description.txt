                           DESCRiPTiON 

 "I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here", is a reality TV Show, set in the     
 Australian jungle. In it we see different celebrities battle it out to be     
 crowned King or Queen of the jungle. To do this, they must carry out          
 challenges, which give them 'stars'. How ever many stars they successfully    
 get, is the number of meals they get to eat that night. If you get no stars at
 all, they have to live of rice.                                               
                                 Enjoy!
