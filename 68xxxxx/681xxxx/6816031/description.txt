Notes from original dimeadozen uploader:  The band certainly did not disappoint us with this killer setlist and performance.  
Now, that's how you do a final world tour!  I taped from the back of the arena, lower level 
just right of center.  The crowd around me was pretty well-behaved, and the sound in this
venue is always good.  They sure don't make arenas like they used to.  If you get a chance
to see the Priest on the Epitaph tour, do yourself a favor and go.  Enjoy!

Notes from TPB uploader:
Sounds a bit washed-out due to the taper's distance, but still very clear.

* Making a DIME torrent available on TPB
* Put in clearer filenames and metadata
* Did not edit the audio at all
