In this torrent are the original scripts used for the TV series "The Prisoner" from 1967-68, as they appear on the 40th Anniversary DVD collection.

* Scripts for all 17 produced episodes, some in multiple versions with different people's marks on them.
* Unused scripts and story treatments
* JPEGs of the "Tally Ho" newsletter
* A high resolution map of the Village

All scripts have been scanned in and NOT OCR'd, so the legibility is variable. This is how the PDFs appeared on the DVD (from what I gather).
