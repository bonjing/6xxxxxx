A literary tour de force, I, Partridge: We Need to Talk About Alan charts the incredible journey of one of our greatest broadcasters.

My iPod had issues playing such a large file, so I've divided the unabridged audiobook originating from this torrent: 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6715570/I__Partridge_-_Alan_Partridge__%28Unabridged%29
into seven approximately hour-long files:

Ch 1 - 4
Ch 5 - 9
Ch 10 - 16
Ch 17 - 21
Ch 22 - 26
Ch 27 - 30
Ch 31 - end

Included in this torrent are those seven parts, and the original seven-hour-long file, all MP3 and 80 kbps.

For ease, you can have iTunes remember your listening place (like with a podcast):
Right Click &gt; Get Info &gt; Options &gt; Remember Playback Position



Also included is the ebook from this torrent:

You can read it with the free MobiPocket ebook Reader:

Jurassic Park! etc.
