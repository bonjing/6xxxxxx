Password should be in order, and I know the pw differs in mail and at login here..
It just doesn't work anymore, and the address registered [which is at the bottom of nearly every uload I've made so questions and such can be mailed if there's anything], associated with the 'verifire' account, is 'not registered' when I try password reset.

But when I tried to make this '.._temporary' account to tell people I've not just abandoned ship (ironic in regard to the site we're commenting right now), I was told that the 'address is already in database'.

And I get no help from 'TPB-crew'.
I guess they'd have been strapped to the mast and lashed for not doing their duty if this was a pirate ship.. LOL.

Anyway. Furthermore; the antivirus I use is best there is, and it cost a lot, but I got to have it. Experience taught me that.

Problem is, though, that on TPB my a.v. have no effect. Password and address should have still been associated with my account, right?
Unless:
1. TBP has been hacked and my account targeted for destruction, or
2. TPB itself have shut me out.

I don't know, because 'the crew' are drinking grog or something instead of answering distress-calls from its members. Apparently.

So.. I'm starting migrating to another site shortly, if God wants me to. 
He may not. I'll know when I know.
Loads of work, though, but I'll try my best.

Still online, but how long? No idea.

@EVERYONE: If you want to have some of my uploads, or any other's uploads that makes sense and helps in some way on this journey toward eternity's dead-line;
MAKE HARDCOPIES!
Time is ticking by the nano-second, and it'll soon be up. WWW2 is here already, just try going to a online bank or something. Google WWW2. It's just a matter of TIME before it replaces WWW. Believe it.
Take to heart these words. You might be very glad one day if you did, and regret if you don't.

In love,
V.

PS: I blog occationally, at: 'blog'- ending with 'spot'; 'Verifire's blog'. You might want to check it out. Or not."
