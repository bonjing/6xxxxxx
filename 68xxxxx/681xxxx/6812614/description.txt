    Following her Great British Bake-Off triumph, Mary         
    Berry demonstrates a genuine passion for fresh herbs      
    and wants the world to know how easy they are to grow,   
    use and store. She questions a commercial herb grower     
    about why more herbs are not available fresh in our        
    supermarkets and she visits the largest collection of     
    organic herbs in the UK. Mary introduces us to three of  
    her favourite herbs and cooks three delicious meals to    
    showcase them including a superb lemon balm ice cream.     
                                                              
    Award-winning chef Jason Atherton is passionate about    
    only using fresh, seasonal fruit and vegetables in his    
    restaurant kitchen. Cabbage has always been a staple on    
    his menu but it has an image problem and is shunned by    
    the younger generation. On Jason's revival campaign, he  
    seeks the advice of a young cook and food blogger to      
    find out how to get more young people eating cabbage       
    and he leads by example, using the various cabbage        
    varieties we produce in Britain in truly inspirational   
    ways in the Revival kitchen.
