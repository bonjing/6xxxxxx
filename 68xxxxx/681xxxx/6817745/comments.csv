   Popular torrents get lots of seeders. Odd ball oldies like this do not. They get weaker as time goes by. Now that this is 100% I'll only be feeding at 5-15kb/s. The 700mb file should maintain more seeders and that helps leechers a year down the road.

   If everyone just seeded to just over 1 this system would work a lot better."
