Glenn Beck - Restoring Honor Rally - in Washington D.C.

I recorded this live from C-Span on 8/28/2010.

It is 3 hours and 30 minutes long.

I have NOT seen this complete rally on the Internet anywhere.

Be sure and watch Glenn's show on Monday 8/30/2010 to see his comments and the "fly over" from 8-28.
