In this series Duffy and his classmates are in their final term at Fenn Street, Bernard Hedges is soon to be married and he has to try and offer careers advice to 5C. Dennis seems to be unemployable but would like to work with animals, Maureen is thinking of becoming a nun, Frankie Abbot wants to be a private eye. Another great comedy from the 1970's.

The Final 3 episodes are b/w and not colour due to industrial action when the show was filmed.
