While his military advisors were telling him to invade Cuba, he refused. Khrushchev said, before his death, that if any nuclear missiles remained in Cuba after an American invasion, he would have sent at least one missile to New York. This never happened, because Kennedy showed great leadership in adverting a possible nuclear war with Russia. Also, as face_mcgace mentioned, he died before the Vietnam War, you fucking idiot."
