Plot or Synopsis
One day, a young herbalist Xu Xian (Raymond Lam) came to the mountains and accidentally fell into a lake. White Snake (Shengyi Huang), in the incarnation of a beautiful lady came to his rescue. Her passion for this young man could not be contained, and with the help of Green Snake (Charlene Choi), she ventured into the human world and got married to Xu Xian.

Fa Hai (Jet Li), a sorcerer from Jinshan Temple, whose mission was to subdue demons and slay monsters, arrived in town and detected a touch of evil from the medicine provided by Xu Xian. Xu Xian made White Snake drink some sulphur-flower wine on Dragon Boat Festival, and the lady immediately turned into a big white snake. Meanwhile Fa Hai came to subdue White Snake. Under confusion, Xu Xian used a sacred sword and wounded the large white python. White Snake escaped with serious injury.

Xu Xian was grief-stricken and tried to make remedy by risking his life to obtain a spirit grass for his wife. Xu Xian got the grass but during the course was possessed by demons. In order to save him, Fa Hai kept him in Jinshan Temple.

After taking the spirit grass, White Snake regained her strength and power and rushed to Jinshan Temple for her husband. She was overcome with rage after the failure to enter the Temple. In extreme frenzy, she summoned up a flood over the Temple causing death and damages. -- Distribution Workshop
