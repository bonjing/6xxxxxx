Rules.of.Engagement.S06E04.Nature.Calls.480p.WEB-DL.x264-mSD [MKV 153MB]

[/b][/color] RULES OF ENGAGEMENT is a comedy about the different phases of male/female relationships, as seen through the eyes of an engaged couple, Adam and Jennifer; a long-time married pair, Jeff and Audrey; a single guy on the prowl, Russell; and his office assistant, Timmy.
As they find out, the often confusing stages of a relationship can seem like being on a roller coaster: people can describe them to you, but to really know what it's like, you have to take a ride for yourself.
