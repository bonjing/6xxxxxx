Following a sell-out UK spring tour and recently 
announced autumn tour extension Chris Addison, 
off BAFTA-winning comedy The Thick of It, In The 
Loop, Skins, Lab Rats, Mock The Week and his own 
BBC 5 live show 7 Day Sunday makes his critically 
acclaimed stand-up available in shiny, round 
format (DVD) for the first time.

Recorded live at London's Bloomsbury Theatre, 
Chris Addison covers material from the personal 
to the, well, less personal in his own unique 
and hugely entertaining style. Daftness! Whimsy! 
Jokes! Lies! Smartarsery! Flapping about! All 
present and correct.
