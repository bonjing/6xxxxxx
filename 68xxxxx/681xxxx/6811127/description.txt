This torrent is a good compliment to a previous UL of mine: "The Fatal Shore: The Epic of Australia's Founding" as this book focuses in, and expands on, the first five years of the New South Wales penal colony. At the book's center is the relationship between Arthur Phillip, the pragmatic first governor, and Woollarawarre Bennelong, the Aborigine who eventually served as a liaison between the settlers and natives.

There are two complete & unabridged versions of the audiobook in this torrent . . . you can choose either the mp3 version (each chapter is a single file, 32 files in total -- plus an m3u file for your convenience), or you can choose the fully chapterized m4b version for iPod, iPhone, iPad, or similar devices (2 chapterized files with chapter illustrations -- NOTE: You will find the photo descriptions on your iPos chapter menu along with it's appropriate chapter title). Both versions are at 64 kb/s (the same rate as the orig. files). The m4b is also already fully tagged for iTunes (you will find the complete info text--including the full Table of Contents--on your lyrics window, and the author & narrator biopics on you artwork window).

Included in the torrent are . . .
- an epub version of the book in case you'd like to follow along.
- a Pictorial Companion to the book/audiobook that has over 80 pgs. of illustrations, maps & charts that follow the book chronologically.
- A folder of great maps relating to the book.

SUMMARY . . .

The versatile Keneally commands a loyal readership no matter what topic he addresses. And here it's Australia's origin story of British settlement, which succeeds Robert Hughes' The Fatal Shore (1986). Using the techniques of fiction, accomplished novelist Keneally strives to vivify scenes based on the historical record.

It was 1786 when Arthur Phillip, an ambitious captain in the Royal Navy, was assigned the formidable task of organizing an expedition to Australia in order to establish a penal colony. The squalid and turbulent prisons of London were overflowing, and crime was on the rise. Even the hulks sifting at anchor in the Thames were packed with malcontent criminals and petty thieves. So the English government decided to undertake the unprecedented move of shipping off its convicts to a largely unexplored landmass at the other end of the world.

Using the personal journals and documents that were kept during this expedition, historian/novelist Thomas Keneally re-creates the grueling overseas voyage, a hellish, suffocating journey that claimed the lives of many convicts. Miraculously, the fleet reached the shores of what was then called New South Wales in 1788, and after much trial and error, the crew managed to set up a rudimentary yet vibrant settlement. As governor of the colony, Phillip took on the challenges of dealing with unruly convicts, disgruntled officers, a bewildered, sometimes hostile native population, as well as such serious matters as food shortages and disease. Moving beyond Phillip, Keneally offers captivating portrayals of Aborigines, who both aided and opposed Phillip, and of the settlers, including convicts who were determined to overcome their pasts and begin anew.
