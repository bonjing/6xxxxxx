I have heard better audio with other CAMs Why bother making a torrent if the video is DVD and Audio is trash. For crying out loud, this guy is clearing his throat, sniffling, moving papers around and using Auto Volume Control instead of manual. This further destroys the quality when nothing is coming out of the speakers, the volume automatically rolls up to full. 
This was not a theater recorded audio but the results of an admixture making a torrent. 
This should be banned under the rules of IDIOTS MAKING TORRENTS.

Hackulus, you have some good comments on most of your torrents, please pull this one, it is disgusting what you have to hear on the audio."
