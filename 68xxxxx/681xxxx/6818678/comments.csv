The Windows 7 is only unpacked and the boot file is extracted  from the iso downloaded from piretebay: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6216518/Windows_7_SP1_AIO-DKW#filelistContainer
all the credits go to: froggie100
I've included Hiren's Boot CD 10.1 in which is included the Mini XP.
As FaeGiN said this is a great combo disk to have, so please seed after you finish downloading it.
Thanks."
