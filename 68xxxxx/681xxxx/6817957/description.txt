What makes Install Creator different from other Installers?

    Small footprint of the executable
    An empty installer is only 100Kb. We cram the complete professional installation program and the complete uninstaller in 100kb! Compare that with other installer programs: minimums of 500Kb.
    We feel it is inexcusable to have a 500Kb installer!
    A simple and easy to understand interface
    There's no complex scripting language, you simply select a directory that contains the files to install and set options for any special individual files and that's it, you're done.
    Easy step by step wizard - it's a cinch!
    When the project is done, just save the settings and you can load the project later to update it or use it as a template for your next installer.
    Complete customization
    You can change all the texts, choose any bitmaps, customize each screen of your installer.
    And you can preview the look of the install process at anytime during the creation process.
    Fully functional freeware version
    The freeware version is fully and completely operational. You will not find a better installer even at 10 times the price. You have nothing to lose test it out today. All these features sound obvious and standard - don't they? So why do we still find programs on the Internet that decompress the data files onto the desktop (isn't that annoying?). Then there are the programs without proper de-installation routines, and products that create a directory at the root of your C drive instead of directing the files where you want them.


PLEASE SEED!!!!!!
