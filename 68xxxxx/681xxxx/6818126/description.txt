Trip
Mistabishi

*to travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive...*
- Robert Louis Stevenson 1881

In early 2010, a rogue electronic musician journeyed into an isolated East London industrial estate and setup temporary accommodation in a disused clothing factory. Armed only with antiquated studio-hardware, a polybag full of Shulgin\\\'s finest, and reinforced by a nearby Funktion One vendor, he set about creating the conditions for a series of musical events on his own terms.

The terms and conditions were simple: *do whatever you want*.

Now, in the autumn of 2011, the sounds of this musical journey are ready to make their way into the World.
