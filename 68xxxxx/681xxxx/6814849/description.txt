DESCRIPTION
Bobbi Starr's husband Max dies an unexpected death, and with the coaxing of her flower shop employees/friends, she elects to hunt down where his donated organs went as a way to heal her grieving heart. The script is a bit lacking in situational and emotional resonance in places, but it's all well shot and decently executed. Danny Mountain has Max's corneas, but he only has eyes for the beauty of nature and for Starr's New Age-y shop manager Kimberly Kane. Their condom-clad vag bang is up to Kane's usual, fine standards. Jock Michael Vegas focuses his physical attention on Zoe Voss, and Voss' cowgirl in her scene with him is compelling stuff, with the girl getting herself off hard. Nerdy goofball Rocco Reed has Max's heart and gets in Allie Haze's pants after she brings him red roses on their first date. Doctor Mark Davis helps Bobbi Starr remember that a man's life is worth more than the sum of its physical body parts by pleasuring her with his own body parts. These two excellent performers provide a good climax to this couples piece with their passionate fuck on a couch.
