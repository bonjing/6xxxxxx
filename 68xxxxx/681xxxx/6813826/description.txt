 Originally, there were only 300 pressings of this LP. "Rockers today, you will love it tomorrow," were Zukie's words back then in the 1970's. How right he was. Another Blood and Fire release, so it comes with nuff Liner Notes by Steve Barrow, and Artwork. This album is a collection of Tappa Zukies (David Sinclair, July 2, 1955) dubs, mixed by Philip Smart. It's one of the best DUB albums I've heard, and certainly some tracks, like MPLA, I consider to be in my all time top ten. On several tracks the mixing takes over the original sound so much, that a true mystic vibe enters. No smooth, polished versions, but hardcore dub coming from the ghetto's of Kingston Jamaica.
 It is a mix of the best quality reggae musicians that play on this album. In his notes, Steve Barrow writes "First issued when dub was still relatively fresh, and long unavailable, 'Tappa Zukie In Dub' proves a fitting cornerstone to the producer's career, so just string up and stand back, and let King Tappa rock the musical atmosphere!".
