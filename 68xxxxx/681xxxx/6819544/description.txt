  Just hours before his death, John F. Kennedy appeared before a crowd  
  in Fort Worth, Texas to honor the freedoms of America in what would   
  be his final speech. Though the Zapruder film, a silent, 8mm home     
  movie of the presidential motorcade through Dealey Plaza, is the      
  most complete visual recording of JFK s assassination, it is just     
  part of a vast record of sights and sounds captured on camera that    
  day. This four-hour special from HISTORYTM uses unique, rarely seen   
  and heard footage to document the Kennedy assassination and the       
  nearly 50 years of speculation and controversy that changed America.  
  Home movies from eyewitnesses, Dallas police dispatch radio           
  recordings, and raw news footage provide a shocking, unflinching      
  look at the assassination of the president and the days that          
  followed while examining the aftermath, and the enduring              
  controversies, that emerged as succeeding generations of Americans    
  struggled to comprehend the sudden murder of an unforgettable leader.
