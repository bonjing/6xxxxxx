Wï»¿riting can be a deeply satisfying activity for kids. Itâ€™s a great outlet 	 
for their creativity, one that lends itself to wild flights of fancy. Itâ€™s 	 
also a wonderful vehicle for personal expression, more so now than ever 	 
in this age of e-mail. 	 
But writing is also tough. Simply staring at a blank piece of paper is no 	 
way to get started. Itâ€™s just too discouraging, when what is needed is 	 
encouragement and plenty of it. If only kids can start with the seed of an 	 
idea, their imaginations can flower. Writing can become an activity thatâ€™s 	 
both exciting and enriching. 	 
Thatâ€™s the purpose of the prompts contained in this book. Think of them 	 
as a little push to help your students get started, the same kind of push 	 
that any writerâ€”even the most gifted veteranâ€”naturally needs. 	 
The prompts are organized by the ten months of the school year. Most of 	 
them are tied to specific events in a given month. For example, October 	 
includes a selection of Halloween-related prompts and June is full of those 	 
with summer themes. There are also prompts pegged to the anniversaries 	 
of historic happenings, like the Wright Brothersâ€™ famous flight (December 	 
17); prompts tied to the birthdays of famous childrenâ€™s authors such as 	 
Theodor Geisel (March 2); and even some that relate to unusual dates 	 
such as Elephant Appreciation Day (September 22). 	 
Kids will find that the prompts send them off in all kinds of directions, 	 
urging them to write stories, poems, songs, and mini-essays. The emphasis 	 
is on varietyâ€”interesting exercises spur interesting writing. Kids are even 	 
encouraged to write rap songs, e-mails, petitions, sports stories, and gos-	 
sip columnsâ€”all in an effort to get those creative juices flowing. 	 

It doesn't say in the book; but I would guess this would be good for students from grades 3 to 6.
