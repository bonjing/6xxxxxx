READNFO:

Right here we go .....firstly the video was pretty nice,just a shame about the res size  
Scrolling through we noticed there was some camera movement so we had to crop the file up into 
3 parts ...part 1 and 3 had the same crop needed but part2 was zoomed in a touch more and needed roughly
another 14pixels top and bottom cropped off.
Doing this means we needed to change the AR on part 2 so we could append all files into one avi when we finished,so
the AR does change slightly,but no more black bars half way through.
Once all that was done we increased the contrast,lowed the brightness,lowered the chroma and used a heavy noise filter.
Also we upscaled to 640 x res as we think any higher and the video suffers even more.
Now the audio was ac3 and had a -33ms offset needed.....but considering we had to cut the video up,we had to just resync it
slightly so whilst at it we ran a light hiss removal over it aswell.
