"Parents"

A teenage boy attempting to follow in 
his late fathers footsteps as an 
entertainer is admitted to Princeton 
Plainsboro with partial paralysis. As 
the team searches for a bone marrow 
match, they uncover a disturbing 
family secret. Meanwhile, House looks 
for creative ways to remove his ankle 
monitor so that he can attend a 
boxing match in Atlantic City, and he 
treats a patient who is convinced he 
is suffering from diabetes. Also, 
Taub faces a tough decision when his 
ex-wife Rachel tells him that she 
wants to move across the country with 
their infant daughter.
