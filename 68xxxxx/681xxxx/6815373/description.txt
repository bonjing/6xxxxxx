::Plot::
Directed by the critically acclaimed, Filmfare and National Award winning Nishikant Kamat â€˜FORCEâ€™ is a contemporary action romance and a Hindi reinterpretation of the Tamil blockbuster, â€˜Kaakha Kaakhaâ€™, which achieved widespread popularity among audiences and critics alike. â€˜FORCEâ€™ is produced by Vipul Amrutlal Shah who previously brought cinemagoers screen gems such as â€˜Aakhenâ€™, â€˜Singh is Kinngâ€™ and â€˜Namastey Londonâ€™.At the heart of the action-love story is a renegade cop, played by John Abraham, in relentless pursuit of a ruthless, underworld gangster. He believes that the only way to eradicate crime is to give criminals the bullet â€“ not hand cuffs. Sharing screen space with John is one of the most vivacious and exuberant talents, as Genelia Dâ€™Souza plays Johnâ€™s love interest. The seat-grabbing suspense is perfectly balanced with passionate romance and a melodious soundtrack, masterfully composed by one of the leading Indian music composers, Harris Jayaraj.Yashvardhan is a hardheaded senior narcotics officer who doesnâ€™t play by the book but always ensures that justice is served. In the midst of his most dangerous and significant operation to crack down on Indiaâ€™s drug cartels, Yashvardhan encounters a ruthless enemy who will stop at nothing until he gets his revenge for the damage done to his business by the narcotics team. He also meets the free-spirited Maya, whose love pushes him to make a choice between the life he already knows and the life he could have with her. Yashvardhanâ€™s decision to let happiness and normalcy into his life changes his life forever.
