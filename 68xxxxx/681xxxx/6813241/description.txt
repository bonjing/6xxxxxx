11 11 "Forest Of MagÄ± Oar"  November 11, 2011 (2011-11-11) 

When in the Forest of Magi Oar, the ThunderCats send WilyKit, WilyKat and Snarf to search for firewood. After they return, they start a fire and lay down to rest. Lion-O confronts Tygra on his frustrations with the Sword of Omens not working. Tygra then implies that Lion-O is not the right person for the sword and shows his jealousy towards Lion-O's confrontations with Cheetara, suggesting a later clash between them to win her over. Lion-O then throws a special piece of firewood that releases several assumingly evil spirits around them. After Lion-O and the rest of the ThunderCats cannot defeat them, the ThunderCats meet the Wood Forgers who have a talent of using paper magic in combat. The Wood Forgers lead them back to their home where they have a paper mill set up and tell Lion-O of a monster bird known as Viragor. The ThunderCats come to their aid when the Forest of Magi Oar is threatened by Viragor, and Cheetara loses her staff to the monster. Tygra manages to save her, hinting his 
affections towards her. Lion-O gets captured by the monster and abandons the Sword of Omens. Viragor then explains to Lion-O that he has protected the forest for decades and the Wood Forgers are slowly destroying the forest. Lion-O also learns that he couldn't use his sword against the spirits at the beginning of the episode because it can only be used to defeat evil, suggesting that the spirits were friendly. Lion-O returns on Viragor to tell the rest of the ThunderCats the truth, much to the Wood Forgers' disappointment. They then begin to fight, and after a few minutes, Lion-O and Viragor crash into the forest. Lion-O finally regains use of his sword and defeats the head Wood Forger.
