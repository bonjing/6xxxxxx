Moto 3: The Movie is the next chapter in the most progressive motocross/off-road film series of all time. The Assignment Moving Picture Co. spared no expense during the film's production, and worked with only the biggest and baddest riders on the planet to capture what critics are calling "next level moto cinematography". Like in the first two Moto The Movie features, The Assignment traveled the globe to search for the source of what pushes our beloveed sport into the future, and the result is a film that will leave you aching to ride!
