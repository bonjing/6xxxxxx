Not much to say, it`s quite good synced [for a cam audio which floats like hell], very watchable. Only cam audio was available, so no LiNE, sorry. Big thx to MiSTERE for audio.

Don`t like - don`t download, don`t complain.

In other words, get it or leave it and wait for some LiNE!

Greetings for some of people i know, who can`t understand simple things, kiss ya
