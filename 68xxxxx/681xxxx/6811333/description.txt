A founding member of Guns Nâ€™ Roses and Velvet Revolver shares the story of his rise to the pinnacle of fame and fortune, his struggles with alcoholism and drug addiction, his personal crash and burn, and his phoenix-like transformation via a unique path to sobriety. 
In 1984, at the age of twenty, Duff McKagan left his native Seattleâ€”partly to pursue music but mainly to get away from a host of heroin overdoses then decimating his closest group of friends in the local punk scene. In L.A. only a few weeks and still living in his car, he answered a want ad for a bass player placed by someone who identified himself only as â€œSlash.â€ Soon after, the most dangerous band in the world was born. Guns Nâ€™ Roses went on to sell more than 100 million albums worldwide. 
In It's So Easy, Duff recounts GNâ€™Râ€™s unlikely trajectory to a string of multiplatinum albums, sold-out stadium concerts, and global acclaim. But that kind of glory can take its toll, and it didâ€”ultimatelyâ€”on Duff, as well as on the band itself. As GNâ€™R began to splinter, Duff felt that he himself was done, too. But his near death as a direct result of alcoholism proved to be his watershed, the turning point that led to his unique path to sobriety and the unexpected choices he has made for himself since. In a voice that is as honest as it is indelibly his own, Duffâ€”one of rockâ€™s smartest and most articulate personalitiesâ€”takes readers on his harrowing journey through the dark heart of one of the most notorious bands in rock-and-roll history and out the other side.
