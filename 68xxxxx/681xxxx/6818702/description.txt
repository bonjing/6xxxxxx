I found this on the interwebs and noticed it wasn't seeded anywhere so I figured I would.  I can easily say this is some of The Avett Brothers at their best (also the handful of songs played on SiriusXM JamOn are from this album).  It looks like it was ripped as VBR and the average bit rate is 256 kbps.  Enjoy and seed.
