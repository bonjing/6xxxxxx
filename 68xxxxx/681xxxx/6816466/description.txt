Dylan Moran star of 'Black Books', 'Shaun of 
the Dead' and 'Run Fat Boy Run' is about to 
spread a little happiness with a brand new live 
DVD for 2011. Ageing, religion, kids, relationships 
intertwine with the general absurdities of life. 
Searing observations and sumptuous imagery, 
painted across a large fraying canvas with cruel, 
curmudgeonly 'Moranesque' brush strokes are all 
delivered with Dylan's renowned, shambolic charm...

Simply unmissable.
