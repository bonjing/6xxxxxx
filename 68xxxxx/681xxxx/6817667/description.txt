Madame Beudet is trapped in a marriage that cancels her personality and the film suggests the unfortunate situation of the woman through her husband's brutal gestures: he re-arranges her flowers again and again, he locks the piano, he's mocking her in front of his friend. I'm not sure if the title is sarcastic (Mrs. Beudet is fundamentally unhappy) or if she smiles her dreams to escape from this marriage.She would like a divorce, but a better opportunity seems to arise when her husband leaves home, not before playing his favorite joke: suicide with an unloaded gun. She loads the gun, but is then haunted by remorse. Even more, her husband's image follows her in the night dreams. In the morning, she tries unsuccessfully to remove the bullets from the revolver but her husband changes his mind and heads the gun to her.
