The Wiggles mount the bandstand to host their very own energy-filled, Australian variety show that spans the globe "via satellite." Seventeen catchy songs in varied styles like country-western, old-fashioned ballad, waltz, and "kid pop" feature the Wiggles and their faithful friends Dorothy the Dinosaur, Wags the Dog, Henry the Octopus, Captain Feathersword, the Wiggly Dancers, and a host of enthusiastic children. Interspersed between musical numbers are informative interviews of a real-life doctor, pilot, dentist, New York firefighter, and Australian Olympic gold medalist in swimming--with each interviewee describing the tools used in their particular profession and some specifics of how each individual accomplishes his or her duties. The costumes and staging are bright and fun and the energy and enthusiasm palpable in this 45-minute show that promises to inspire viewers age 1 to 6 to get up, wiggle, dance, and sing along.
