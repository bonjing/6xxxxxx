[b]Thx Hive

Sources:

Video: floppydisk  thx
Audio: misere   thx

Encode:

german video had awesome quality, the first 10 mins are 3 different cams as it seems which are bit overbrightened or glary but after that quality is dvdscr like. good job. just sharpened video and made slight changes in brightness and contrast for some parts. looks very good

for the audio, well its a line, but had some problems, had some weird echo and unsynchronity between left and right channel, fixed that.
cleaned it through. its a lot better now, some words in sentences were already muffled cant do anything about that.
Fixed a couple of oose spots i found while syncing it back to the german video.
check sample.
all in all very watchable now.
enjoy
