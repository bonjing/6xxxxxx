I would just queue up all the shit I wanted to download in GetRight and let it go all night. Had a great feature to hang up the phone when finished, too. Woke up the next morning to fresh content. Thanks GetRight! In fact, I might just go pay for this app now out of appreciation.

Even these days it has cool functionality that is very useful, like the GR Browser. I sound like I work for them or something. Just a fan."
