Neil Delamere, star of RTE's the Panel, 
BBC's Michael McIntyre's Comedy Roadshow 
and Channel 4's Stand Up for the Week will 
have you rocking with laughter with his unique 
mix of quick-fire banter and hilarious storytelling. 
Filmed on his recent sell-out tour, Delamere's distinct 
style of sharp, observational humour and uproarious 
anecdotes have made him a hugely in-demand performer. 
Don't miss this comedy powerhouse in action. Implement 
Of Divilment is an unforgettable comic experience that 
will leave you wanting more.
