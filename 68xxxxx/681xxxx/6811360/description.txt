   Critically wounded and lying unconscious    
   in a Mumbai hospital, ACP Yashvardhan of    
   the Narcotics Control Bureau reflects on    
   his life and his love-affair with Maya.     
   With the assistance of the Commissioner     
   as well as his colleagues, Atul, Kamlesh    
   and Mahesh Pandey, and an informer,         
   Arvind Shetty, he was able to apprehend     
   drug-dealers in Kutch, Gujarat; Jalandhar,  
   Punjab, as well as in Himachal Pradesh.     
   Unknowingly, he paved the way for Vasu      
   Anna Reddy to become the sole drug-dealer   
   and invite his Mombasa-based brother,       
   Vishnu, to join him. An encounter with      
   the team kills Vasu, and some of the team   
   gets suspended. A vengeful Vishnu decides   
   to target the entire police unit as well    
   as their respective families, and vows      
   that he will not rest until he has killed
