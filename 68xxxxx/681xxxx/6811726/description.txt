Dick Grayson was the first Robin, the teen sidekick to the Dark Knight, Batman. Then he became Nightwing and stepped out of Batmans shadow. The story behind that transformation and how it affected Batman, the Teen Titans and Dick himself is explored in this graphic novel. When Batman fires Robin, an angry Dick Grayson is unsure of where to go. On his journey, he receives advice from Superman and aid from Deadman, and makes the decisions that lead him to become a brand new crimefighter.
