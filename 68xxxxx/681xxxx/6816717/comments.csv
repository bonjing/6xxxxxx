evision on the internet and HBO right now. I am going to give the audio a 10 and the video a 4 THIS is why. Unless you're using VLC the constant .5 sec fade from HD to blurry is unbearable. ettv you need to commit to either full HD or a lower quality. I am still watching it because I am grateful that it is up on here and I can watch it but this quality issue is going to ensure I download a better version. No insult is intended here. Just some constructive criticism   thank you nonetheless.
