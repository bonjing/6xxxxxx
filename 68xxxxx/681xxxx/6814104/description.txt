**11/11/11 Update: Added KJ6 Stock Rom to 'Gingerbread Rom\2.3.6\' folder


This is everything that you need to flash the Samsung/TMo OEM 2.3.6 (Gingerbread) rom to your Samsung Galaxy S 4G

* I added instructions for flashing GB and rooting- including screen shots.
* I added 32 bit (along with 64-bit) Samsung drivers.
* Includes 2.3.5 and 2.3.6 Samsung Gingerbread roms
* Root with drhonk's KJ1 kernel. This keeps the wifi working, plus you can adb reboot recovery and flash other roms and do a nandroid backup.


When I flash and root using the methods described in the PDF that is in the root directory of this torrent everything works, and works well.

If you have problems- backup tith Titanium Backup and do a wipe and restore before flashing GB and rooting.
