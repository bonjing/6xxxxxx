What Every Body is Saying - Joe Navarro

Review
"A masterful work on nonverbal body language by an exceptional observer. Joe Navarro's work has been field-tested in the crucible of law enforcement at the highest levels within the FBI. I cannot praise the book enough." -- --David Givens, Ph.D., author of Crime Signals and Love Signals 
Product Description
What you say is often far less important than how you say it. One of the harbingers of success is understanding how nonverbal cues such as body language, dress, and demeanor affect how you are perceived and understood. In this book Navarro, one of the leaders in nonverbal behaviours, demonstrates how to modify your subconscious statements to your greatest advantage and also read what other people are 'saying' nonverbally. These skills will increase your ability to accurately assess moods, decode behaviors, anticipate problems, avoid hidden pitfalls, influence negotiations, and understand the secret motivations of those around you.
