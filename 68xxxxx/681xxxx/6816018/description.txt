The Skygreen Leopards are easily the most structured of any 

band in the Jewelled Antler stable of projects, which is not to say 

that improvisation figures heavily to their sound (oh, it does). 

What you get are loosely-structured summery psychedelic folk 

songs arranged with banjos, bouzoukis, 12 string guitars, tape 

loops, Hammond organ, and a host of other instruments. Their 

third album, One Thousand Bird Ceremony, is a watershed 

effort for the group, and also the perfect soundtrack for the 

summertime. The Skygreen Leopards are Glenn Donaldson and 

Donovan Quinn.
