When you use the key generator and generate a key it says""Congratulations! YOu have successfully activated Macro Expert. From this point on, you have become a legal user of Macro Expert! ""
But if you close Macro Expert It then restart you get
""Macro Expert has been expired, please enter your license code to activate it, if you dont have a license code, please click the below link to purchase""  0 days left, but you can enter the same license code again and it starts working again!  
The loop starts again!!"
