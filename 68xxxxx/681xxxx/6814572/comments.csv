nd download for those of us on limited bandwidth/quota. For a 2 hour video stuffed into 414Mb I'd say the overall quality was great. On my PC VLC played it without a hitch, glitch or twitch. Might not be the best thing for wide screen TV, but on my 17"" PC monitor it worked great. A/V sync was fine. We need more of these. 
A9 V9. Thanks (mange takker) uploader"
