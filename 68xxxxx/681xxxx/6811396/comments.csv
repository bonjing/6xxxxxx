Yes, the folder name was a little confusing - but if you actually looked at the files you'd know he couldn't have ripped an instrumental version, radio edit and a full version from a video. Think before you start abusing uploaders.

Thanks for this torrent. Was the first full rip of the single, and the first rip with an actual quality greater than 128Kbps. Much appreciated."
