Details:

With their new album "Lucent Touch" Jazzamor also presents their new sound. Smooth jazz and electronic music with the bossa feeling in the well known style of Blue Note. Cool and minimalistic at once. "Lucent Touch", the sixth album has become jazzier. Bossanova steps back and lets Jazz have more leeway. However, the drum sounds still occur in the foreground, because Jazzamor can and do not want to hide their electronic side. Even after five releases, it is still difficult to classify the sound of Jazzamor, consisting of the wonderful voice of Bettina Ventzki-Mischke and pianist Roland Grosch. Fifteen tracks where Jazz, Electronic, Bossanova and Latin Lounge jack in the hand-pass.
