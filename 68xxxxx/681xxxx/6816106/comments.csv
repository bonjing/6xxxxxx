I dl'ed the UK Top 40 Single charts and listened to the first 30 songs - they all sounded the same!!! All the same shit! Number 31: Bruno Mars. A little bit better than the others but not much. Lady Gaga on place 37?? She deserves better! No sound that is able to captivate you. Nothing. Nothing. NOTHING!!!
Where are the bands of the 80s and 90s? Is music bound to stay in a constant state of ignorance forever? Shame on the people who can't recognize GOOD music anymore!! PROFIT above all? F*** you all!!! :("
