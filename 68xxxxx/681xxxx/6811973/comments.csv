ts the Wii from USBloader GX as it attempts to play the Wii Motion plus instructional video.

Run the video (I believe it also works if you watch it from your ""Wii Sports Resort"" DVD) once and then try to load the game.

If you enjoy the game support the developers. Titles like these deserve their money!"
