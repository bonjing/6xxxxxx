40s Greatest hits song memories (with Wartime era hits too) Vera Lynn and 
others 320k (musicfromrizzo) many remastered tracks


The 40s was the era when folks sounded sensible when singing a song.
It doesnt matter how big that flac file download is if its all rap music 'cause
all you end up with is rubbish in the minds of our kids (spare me the explicit
lyrics please - case theres no integrity in peddlin that stuff - no matter
what bitrates and speeds you may claim to be able to afford to give away on
our internet networks that are sensible instead with its otherwise use).
Now thats responsible free speech use eh!

enjoy this great music much of it around the wwii years and throughout
the 40s generally speaking
