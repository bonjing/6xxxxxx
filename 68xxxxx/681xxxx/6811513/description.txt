Simple spreadsheet that I use for a checkbook register. You enter date and transaction and it keeps a running balance and can hide/show reconciled transactions. Pretty simple and straightforward. 

If you have a long transaction history, then the first time you use it you may want to download a csv from your bank and edit it to match the columns in the spreadsheet for date, payee/payor, and ammount and copy/paste those transactions into the sheet.
