Information
------------------------------

The Silver Pharaoh Mystery: The treasures of the ancient pharaohs were legendary, but the tomb of the little-known Psusennes I stunned even the most experienced of Egyptologists. Untouched by grave robbers when it was unearthed in 1940, this discovery was overshadowed by the outbreak of World War II. The tomb contained a solid silver casket and riches that rivalled even those of the much-more famous Tutankhamen. But, with little known about his life, how did Psusennes generate such a mass of power and influence? Find out in this one-off special as leading historians reveal the truth about the king, who reigned around 3,000 years ago. Using his position as both pharaoh and a high priest to generate wealth, explore his ambitious scheme to relocate an entire city.
