No wonder his comment got removed.
Just a troll who posts several links on others people torrent like advertising one of his videos on YOUTUBE SUCKAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!"
king twat 'geez!!!

Anybody does that, i wouldn't download it, and i think a good many others will feel the same, it's called having integrity, you obviously haven't got any being as you are spamming other uploadfs of Raw.

One upload, that's all yopu've got, not a regular uploader who takes time to source the shows from scene or other wrestling trackers, uploaders who people trust, one upload and you're going around other uploads like a spoilt kid attention seeking and attempting to hijack downloaders from their pages by linking to your torrent page.

What, exactly, do you expect anybody with an ounce of integrity,  will think about your behaviour, ay?

Moron!!!

FRACKIN' BEHAVE YOURSELF, AY!!!"
