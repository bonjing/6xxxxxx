The classic survey of US foreign policy from 1938 to President Clinton\'s second term
I cannot remember which edition this is, but I think it\'s the 2010 (8th) revised edition.  Either way, written by best-selling authors and history professors Stephen Ambrose and Douglas Brinkley this is a book to pick up and one of three books the pair has collaborated on. Enjoy and seed
