Information
------------------------------

In 2012, the eyes of the world are focused on the London's East End as it prepares to host the Olympic Games. Cutting-edge engineering and design have transformed the Olympic Park. But 150 years ago, the world was watching for a very different reason although the spectacle on display was as high-tech as anything on offer today. The East End was once home to the most advanced shipbuilding industry - and best workers and shipyards - in the world. Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Britain's most famous engineer was about to launch a ship five times bigger than any that had ever been built before, the most revolutionary vessel the world had ever seen: the SS Great Eastern. But this launch was a disaster. Today archaeologists are scouring the banks of the Thames to discover why launching such a big vessel proved a complete disaster.
