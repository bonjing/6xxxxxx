Info:

Few days before the show I got a phone call and an email from ticketmaster 

saying that no cameras will be allowed. The day of the show they were 

really strict about it, I witnessed people getting kicked out for taking 

pictures with their smartphones. Security was very tight, which is why the 

footage is not steady at all times, I was constantly watching out for 

security with my one eye and sometimes hiding the camera as there was one 

guard in front of me who would keep turning back very often. The first few 

songs have no video footage due to security, you can hear the audio though 

with a black screen, the footage resumes halfway through Sorry and gets 

really watcable around If The World.
I did not intend it to be shaky/obstructed, blame the anal security for 

that, I've shot really great video with every other band I taped. I've 

synced BurnBoy's second audio source to the video since I felt it was the 

best sounding one, the original audio has been removed. All in all, this is 

the only GNR Video that has surfaced from the 2010 North American shows. 

Maybe tapers are holding off footage from other 2010 North American shows 

or maybe they don't exist. Whatever the case is, Canada/Japan got the best 

setlists and a shame that very little footage exists.
