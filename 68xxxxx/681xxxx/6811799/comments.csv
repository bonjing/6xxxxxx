Tried a bunch of other solutions and nothing worked... So I finally downloaded iSkysoft iMedia Converter Deluxe here on TPB....http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6841160/iSkysoft_iMedia_Converter_Deluxe_v._1.1.0_%5BIntel_KG%5D
Easy download, easy install... I used it to convert the .VOB files in the Video TS_ folder to MP4 files for Quicktime... Works great!!! Don't worry about the other .BUP and .IFO files in the TS_ folder... They don't hold any content data..."
