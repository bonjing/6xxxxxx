                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Documentary shown ahead of new drama Pan Am, examining how Pan American World 
 Airways kick-started the jet age and left a legacy of affordable travel.      
 Former air stewardesses for the airline recall a life of glamour and luxury   
 every bit as exciting as that of their fictional counterparts, which included 
 celebrity encounters and international romances. Featuring contributions by   
 Robert Vaughn and Mary Quant.                                                 
                                 Enjoy!
