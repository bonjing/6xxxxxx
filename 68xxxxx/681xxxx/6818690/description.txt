I was inspired to record my version of this story when I first watched the movie "Beginners"
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1532503/

In it, it references the story of the Velveteen Rabbit.  I went to look online for an audiobook version of the story and found a version that I have included in this torrent.

The tone was so jarring and harsh, I decided to create my own version which I hope captures the essence of the story.  I did it in the spirit of the movie "Where the Wild Things Are" directed by Spike Jonez.

Recorded on a Nokia 5130 Cell Phone.

If you like it, you can find me in the ID3 tags of the song file.

It's the first time I've done this. I'm not the clearest, but I hope you enjoy it.

I do not claim ownership of the material, just my voice as I read it.

Thank you.
