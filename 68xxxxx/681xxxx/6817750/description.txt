Blood Ties, set in Toronto, Ontario, centres around Christina Cox as Vicki Nelson, a former Toronto Police Service who left the force to become a private investigator after beginning to lose her eyesight, due to a beginning Retinopathia Pigmentosa. Through her work she teams up with the 480-year-old vampire Henry Fitzroy, who happens to be the illegitimate son of Henry VIII. The mutual attraction between them is complicated by Vicki\'s relationship with former partner and lover, Mike Celluci. In the beginning, he doesn\'t believe in the supernatural and thinks that Vicki is losing her mind along with her eyesight. Also in the picture is Vicki\'s assistant Coreen, who was hired because of her knowledge of the occult and to keep her quiet about Henry. Coreen is thoroughly enamored with both the occult and Henry, which can get her into trouble.
