  VIRTUAL JFK investigates one of the most debated "what if" scenarios  
  in the history of U.S. foreign policy: What would President John F.   
  Kennedy have done in Vietnam if he had not been assassinated in       
  1963, and had he been re-elected in 1964? The film employs what       
  Harvard historian Niall Ferguson calls "virtual history," assessing   
  the plausibility of counterfactuals - "what ifs" - and the outcomes   
  they might have produced. The heart of the film deals with the        
  question: Does it matter who is president on issues of war and peace?
