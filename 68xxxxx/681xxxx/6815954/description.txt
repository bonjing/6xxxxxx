Plot Summary:-
After the mansion explodes, apparently due to an attack targeted at telepaths, Professor Charles Xavier and Jean Grey are missing. The X-Men disband and Cyclops begins to suffer from depression. One year later, the MRD (Mutant Response Division) is starting to detain mutants causing Wolverine and Beast to get the X-Men back together. Iceman, Shadowcat and Forge rejoin the team. Rogue joins up with the Brotherhood. The X-Mansion is rebuilt with Angel's wealth. Emma Frost is able to locate a comatose Charles on Genosha in the care of Magneto. On hearing this, Cyclops returns to the team and X-Men go to Genosha to find Professor X. After a short battle with Magneto, they are allowed to take Professor X back with them to the X-Mansion. Professor X contacts the X-Men telepathically from twenty years into the future and informs Wolverine that he is to lead the X-Men if they wish to successfully save the world from The Sentinel Project and prevent the Brotherhood of Mutants and the Acolytes from taking over the world before the future ends up being dominated by Sentinels.
