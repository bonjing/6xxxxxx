Ned is a biodynamic farmer living with his girlfriend, Janet. One day, while Ned is selling at a local market, a police officer asks where he can buy cannabis. Ned, skeptical at first, is moved by the officer's professed desperation due to having a stressful week. Feeling sympathetic, Ned gives marijuana to the officer for free. Insisting on paying, the officer coaxes Ned into charging him twenty dollars. Ned is then arrested for selling drugs.
