This torrent includes the official podcast mp3s released on the www.glennbeck.com website for the radio show. It includes the "4th Hour" with Pat & Stu which is available only to subscribers (ie. it is not part of the regular radio broadcast).

I am travelling abroad and my system at home appears to have crashed, so I am on a slow connection that may not be up 100% of the time, so PLEASE SEED THIS TORRENT after you download for at least a few days.

RESIST WE MUCH! 

SEED WE MUCH!
