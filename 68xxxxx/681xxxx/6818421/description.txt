The MySQL database server continues to enjoy an aggressive development schedule, with new features and enhancements released on a regular basis. Most notably, the changes to version 4 and the forthcoming version 5 are among the most significant in the history of the project, and serve to further extend the already considerable capabilities this popular open source database server offers its millions of users worldwide. MySQL 5 is expected to be released in late spring/early summer 2005.

Pro MySQL provides intermediate and advanced MySQL users with a comprehensive guide to the array of features available in these new versions. Clustering, replication, transactions, and subqueries are just a few of the topics youâ€™ll find in this book.
