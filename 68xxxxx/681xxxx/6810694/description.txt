"Rundgren played every instrument (as well as sang every vocal) on the first three sides of the double LP, while a band accompanies him on the fourth.

In the liner notes, the first side of the album is described as "a bouquet of ear-catching melodies", the second as "the cerebral side", the third as "The kid gets heavy", and the fourth is titled "Baby Needs a New Pair of Snakeskin Boots (A Pop Operetta)".

The first five thousand issues of the LP were pressed on colored vinyl â€” the first half of the album on red vinyl, the second on blue.

The song "Couldn't I Just Tell You" has had a major influence on artists in the power pop musical genre, with music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine of the All Music Guide calling it one of "the great songs that provided power pop with its foundation""
