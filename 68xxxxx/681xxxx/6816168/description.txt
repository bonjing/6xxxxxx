NOTES FROM ME.
I found this on another site and do not take any credit for it. I cant remember where I found it but was surprised when I finally found one without a key gen and that it didnt set my GData Anti Virus screaming I know a lot give false positives but after getting burned a few times by thinking that I refuse to use KeyGens if it comes up positive. Now this is great just install 5.5. I did clean install unsure if you need too.
1. Mount ISO
2. Install Adobe CS 5.5 from Trial DVD (You do not have to input a serial number)
3. After installation is complete close the installer (Do NOT reboot or run any of the Adobe software yet!)
4. Run "Adobe CS 5.5 Master Trial Patcher.exe" and complete.

Now what I found was that when I opened up Acrobat X it asked for serial or to try for 30 days. None of the other programs do this not sure why so I hunted down some serials for Acrobat X and I put one in and it took it and I havent had any issues with it yet. If anyone knows who created this please post it so they get the credit they deserve.
First upload here hope you guys like it.
