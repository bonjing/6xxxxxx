WORKDONE:

Was kindly given the russian source file....but its a small res source 
Anyway for this made a script which contained heavy noise removal,deinterlace and resize.
Once done,dropped it into vdub and then tweaked so more.The black borders at the top,bottom and left side
weren't straight so i needed to use the perspective filter to remove them without losing any video.
After that i increased the contrast alot as it was washed out and also had to lower the chroma down alot.
Only upscaled to 608 as any higher would just cause more issues.
Audio was dropped into adobe and remastered ...cleaning it up and changing the EQ,before finally remuxing.
Check sample for Q.
