Jukebox is the follow-up to 2010â€™s Outta This World from JLS, the UK boyband who shot to fame on 2008â€™s The X Factor competition. Featuring the UK number one single â€œShe Makes Me Wannaâ€, Jukebox is full of dancefloor-filling R&B; and electronic beats, with infectious melodies delivered in JLS' typically smooth, four-part vocal harmonies.
