seasons etc that one is 28.8gb's ""Beavis and Butthead Seasons 1-7 complete""
What i did was picked some of the lowest resoltion videos from the other torrent and downloaded the same files on this one and compared them and the results were suprising i thought. Basicly these videos didn't look any better most of the time !
You got one with lower resolution and higher bitrates and the other the opposite..

Im really scratching my head here wondering why the video quality is so poor on this torrent.
Not sure what was done but i do know that re-encoding videos over & over is a bad idea and i get the feeling these are over proccessed re-encoded and stretched out etc

Anyway if people are gonna download grab a couple of these ones and grab a couple from the other torrent and see how it looks before jumping in with both feet"
