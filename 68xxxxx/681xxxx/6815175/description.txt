Amphibian Adventures for FSX offers six missions flying in Canada and Alaska in Alphasim's HU-16 Albatross, or the Microsoft Grumman Goose. A bonus mission offers a flight for the Aerosoft Catalina, and a second bonus mission for those with the Acceleration pack adds a mission start in the EH-101, and then a transfer to the Albatross.
