,Brickstin,2012-02-14T18:48Z,Did everyone get this torrent ok? Just let me know if you need seeding. 
got about the PAL/NTSC thingy. 

It is NTSC just for the record.. Anyways, I couldn't make any corrections due to the following piratebay error: EDIT - Temporarily disabled !

This is my first time uploading a torrent. Thanks for the help."
