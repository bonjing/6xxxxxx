Parkinâ€™s Macroeconomics is a worldwide leader because it provides a serious, analytical approach to the discipline using the latest policy and data. Parkin trains students to think like economists by offering a clear introduction to theory and applying the concepts to todayâ€™s events, news, and research.

From our global food shortage to global warming, economic issues permeate our everyday lives. Parkin brings critical issues to the forefront. Each chapter begins with one of todayâ€™s key issues, and additional issues appear throughout the chapter to show the real-world applications of the theory being discussed. When the chapter concludes, students â€œread between the linesâ€ to think critically about a news article relating to the issue, demonstrating how thinking like an economist helps make informed decisions.
