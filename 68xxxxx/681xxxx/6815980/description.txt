=============================

The X-Men anime is written by famed English comic book writer/creator Warren Ellis, and borrows story elements from famed Scottish comic book writer Grant Morrisonâ€™s early 2000s story arch for New X-Men, as well as Joss Whedonâ€™s mid-2000s run on Astonishing X-Men.

Synopsis
----------

04 "Transformation - Secondary Mutation" November 11, 2011 
"Transformation - Niji Henshitsu" (Transformation - äºŒæ¬¡å¤‰è³ª)  April 22, 2011

Emma's desire to protect Hisako causes her to develop a secondary mutation protecting them from the attack, while the other X-Men kill Kick. After Hisako is reunited with her parents, she and Emma agree to go to the Xavier Institute to receive a vaccine to prevent 'Damon-Hall Syndrome' in secondary mutations. 
Beast announces that he wants to take Emma back to New York to study her secondary mutation. After much debate, Cyclops gives into the groups wishes. En route back to New York, the Blackbird is attacked by a mutant suffering from 
DHS which Wolverine defeats. Emma recognises him as a student from the Inner Circle's preparatory school. Upon returning to the Institute, Beast tries to investigate the boy's condition, but he shrivels up and dies. Beast concludes that the cause of his secondary mutation was not due to experimentation but some other stimulus. As Beast performs checks on Emma, Xavier reveals Cerebro is still being blocked from TÅhoku. With Emma's secondary mutation on the same level as the boy, though hers is deemed harmless, Xavier suspects something is still going on in TÅhoku which is causing these mutations.
