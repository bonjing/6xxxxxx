The classic 1960s fantasy drama starring Patrick McGoohan as "Number 6".

This is a rip from a region 2 DVD set. The rip was not done by me. Forgive the poor film quality; owners of the DVD set have the same issue. There are reports that the BluRay edition has been cleaned up a lot more.

Video is 640x480 MPEG4 (xvid) @ 25fps, audio is MP3 128kbps

In this torrent:
* All 17 episodes, including the "alternative" versions on the 40th anniversary DVD release (marked "Original Version" by filename)
* Stereo and 5.1 audio tracks for almost all files
* Alternative audio tracks for episodes with isolated music or commentary (as marked by filename)
* NO SUBTITLES, sorry. Again, not my fault

Enjoy!
