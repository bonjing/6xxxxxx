Cream were a 1960s British rock supergroup consisting of bassist-vocalist Jack Bruce,
guitarist-vocalist Eric Clapton, and drummer Ginger Baker. Their sound was characterised
by a hybrid of blues rock, hard rock and psychedelic rock,combining the psychedelia-themed
lyrics, Eric Clapton's blues guitar playing, Jack Bruce's voice and blues bass playing and
Ginger Baker's jazz-influenced drumming. The group's third album, Wheels of Fire, was the
world's first platinum-selling double album. Cream are widely regarded as being the world's
first successful supergroup. In their career, they sold over 15 million albums worldwide.

Cream's music included songs based on traditional blues such as "Crossroads" and "Spoonful",
and modern blues such as "Born Under a Bad Sign", as well as more eccentric songs such as
"Strange Brew", "Tales of Brave Ulysses" and "Toad". Cream's biggest hits were
"I Feel Free" [UK, #11], "Sunshine of Your Love" [US, #5], "White Room" [US, #6],
"Crossroads" [US, #28], and "Badge" [UK, #18].

Cream made a significant impact upon the popular music of the time, and, along with Jimi Hendrix,
they popularised the use of the wah-wah pedal. They provided a heavy yet technically proficient
musical theme that foreshadowed and influenced the emergence of British bands such as Led Zeppelin,
Deep Purple, and The Jeff Beck Group in the late 1960s. The band's live performances influenced
progressive rock acts such as Rush, jam bands such as The Allman Brothers Band, Grateful Dead,
Phish and heavy metal bands such as Black Sabbath.

Cream was ranked #16 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock and Rolling Stone named them
the sixty-sixth greatest artist of all time. In 2010 VH1 also ranked them #61 on their 100
Greatest Artists of All Time.


Royal Albert Hall, London May 2-3-5-6, 2005 is the live recording of the Cream reunion
at the Royal Albert Hall in 2005. As the title implies, the recording includes songs
from their four reunion shows on 2, 3, 5, and 6 May 2005.
