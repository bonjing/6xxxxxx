"Dedication to My Ex (Miss That)" is the third single from R&B; singer Lloyd's fourth studio album King of Hearts. The track features AndrÃ© 3000 of OutKast and is "narrated" by Lil' Wayne. Lyrically, the song is about a girl who had an affair while Lloyd was on vacation. It was released on August 9, 2011.

The clean and radio versions replace the word "pussy" with "lovin'". (e.g. I miss that lovin', that lovin', that lovin', that lovin'). Some critics, including Rolling Stone, compared the song to Cee-Lo Green's "Fuck You" and praised the song's energy, production, singing, song-writing, and profanity.

Seed and enjoy!
