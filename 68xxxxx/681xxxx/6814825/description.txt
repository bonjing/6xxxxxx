First upload... I was sick of trying to find vocaloids songs so this is a collection of what I managed to find.

Includes:
Kagamine Twins (Rin and Len)
Kaito
Hatsune Miku
Gakupo
Megurine Luka
Meiko
Ryuto (Gachapoid)
Lily (and one song by Li, her male counterpart)
Utatane Piko
Nekomura Iroha
and Yowane Haku

Most of the songs are in Japanese, though there are exceptions and those exceptions are English. Some have lyrics in romaji and the translations into English which you can't sing.

Enjoy.
