Information:

Created by and starring comedy double-act Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson, Bottom brings us into the bizarre world of Richard â€˜Richieâ€™ Richard and Eddie Hitler, a pair of repulsive, slobbish flatmates living in Hammersmith.

Equally revolting, vicious and arrogant, they spend their lives avoiding work and instead living in filth, devising hair-brained moneymaking schemes and deluded plans to snare beautiful women.

Mayall and Edmondson, most famous for their work together in 80s classic The Young Ones, used the show Bottom to explore the far depths of comic possibilities offered by squalid bachelor life and to provide plentiful outlets for their trademark slapstick.

The net result was a crude yet often hilarious show in which truly anything could happen in the next half-hour.


Enjoy and Seed!!
