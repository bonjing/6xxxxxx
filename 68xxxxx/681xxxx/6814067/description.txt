Here are 3 of the most popular albums by the Canadian band Toronto.  Lookin for Trouble 256kps, Girls Night Out 256 kbps, and Get it on Credit 192kbps.  I say they are Ipod friendly, because all of the tags and cover art have been added, and they wont show as "unknown song" or "unknown album" on the ipod, which is very annoying!!
I dont need to list all the tracks, they are all there, and if you are a Toronto fan, you know they all kick ass anyways!!
Enjoy these discs, and please seed!
