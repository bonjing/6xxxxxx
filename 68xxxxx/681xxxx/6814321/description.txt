Frederick Wiseman documentary
In three parts of 1 hr 20 minutes each
English language, no subs

i am the same uploader as the 15 Frederick Wiseman Documentaries torrent that is on here as well

A copy of Wiseman's 'La Danse', his film about the Paris Opera Ballet is available at a reasonable price, I would urge you to get a copy. Perhaps if many are bought the rest will start to be released.

I hope you enjoy

If you have copies of any of his other work please leave a comment.

cheers
