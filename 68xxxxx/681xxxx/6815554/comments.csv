Math tutor DVD: Circuit Analysis vol 1-2

and

Math tutor DVD: The HP50g Calculator Tutor

I know that we are many pupils that are looking for this materials right now. I really, really need these courses. If i was able to buy them I should have done that but im not a us-citizen and living with a meager monthly student loan. I will seed so i will bleed, but i feel i need that knowledge! Anything!

Knowledge should be free and not only for the rich!"
