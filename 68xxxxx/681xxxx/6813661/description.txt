Say Sweden and Metal and most people think of Europe. Althoug good and catchy band they where not the first or the best one. Swedish first real heavy metal band was Heavy Load. The band was born 1976 after Wahlquist brothers got together with bassist Dan Molen. 1978 came their debut Full Speed at High Level. The music was heavilly influenced by Zeppelin, Sabbath and Thin Lizzy. I read somewhere on the net someone compared the first record to how Spinal Tap sounds. Dont get me wrong Heavy Load is not Spinal Tap. They where a serious band but there is alot of truth in the ST comparasion. They do sound musicly abit as Spinal Tap with serious lyrics. After a few member changes 1982 came Death and Glory followed by Stronger Than Evil 1983. At that time Load has changed into real Heavy Metal influenced by NWOBHM. With songs like Heavy Metal Angel (In Metal and Leather) And Free, on with Phil Lynott of Thin Lizzy guest stard on bass, gave the band a big breakthru thruout Scandinavia. They started an international career try but never made it after witch they went into hiatus. Its pitty sence they where the real deal. Also famous not only for their music they where for their covers with large Viking influences. One could say they where the first real viking metal band but that is still under heavy discussion.

Bonus is a double live record. Both sides where recorded live infront of a studio audience for swedish radio. On both sides are short interviu with the band. They are in swedish so I am not really sure what they are saying but a friend once told me they are hilarious. Here are all recordings.
