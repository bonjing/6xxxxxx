[/b][/color] Five years ago, astronaut John Crichton attempted to use the Earth's atmosphere to propel his ship, Farscape 1, at great speeds across the solar system.
He went much further though and was sucked down a wormhole to a distant part of the galaxy and into the middle of a battle.
He was rescued by a group of escaping prisoners and taken aboard their living ship.
As the years went by, Crichton has made enemies, powerful and dangerous enemies.
On his journey to find a way back home, he freed other captives who became part of the crew on Moya.
