The Amazing Race
Season 19, Episode 8 - Super Shady - Aired on 13th of November 2011

The six remaining teams set off from the Sunbird Livingstonia Beach in Salima, Malawi and fly to Copenhagen, Denmark, heading to Vor Frelsers Kirke with knowledge there will be another Double U-Turn on the course. After getting a clue to Frederiksborg Slot, the Roadblock forces racers to go inside and learn an intricate Renaissance dance done in three parts. At Frilandmuseet, the Detour has teams choose between getting "All Hopped Up" by leading rabbits through a steeplechase course, or making sure they get six bricks of butter "All Churned Out" and in presentable shape. Directed to the nearby Karlstrup Windmill, teams are given the Pit Stop location: the Havet, docked back in Copenhagen.
