This is a full NTSC DVD of the first 20 episodes of Season One of \"Shaun the Sheep\".  There is currently no US version available in Widescreen so I specially made this to replace the discs in the official pan-n-scan release. This is sourced from PAL DVD\'s but I did my best to convert them. The quality is generally very good.
