Hi, I am a drum & bass and dubstep DJ and I compiled pretty much all the free files in my collection to share with you.

Basically all the files here are safe to play live, you shouldn't get any shit for playing any of these songs without having payed for them.


I tag everything like a mental patient- THERE ARE NO "artist - cd track 2 techno remix" FILES
Some of it is sorted into sub-genres because Iâ€™m a loser, you may agree, you may disagree with some of the distinctions Iâ€™ve made. Iâ€™m sorry if they become a nuisance.


Most of these are legitimate free downloads, some are not, but I tried to justify their inclusion.
If the song is copyrighted, I included it because:
* Itâ€™s out of print (see Decoder, technically those two Pharoahe Monch songs)
* Itâ€™s a mainstream rap artist whom I am not significantly undercutting (just a couple of these songs, seriously, does Dr. Dre even know how the fuck a torrent works?)
* It's from RCRD LBL, whose files are free but not meant to be mirrored. Who cares, there's maybe 4 songs for this


I key my music and write it in the comment section, but take note:
* I DON'T USE THE CAMELOT WHEEL
* I go by musical note, I donâ€™t distinguish major or minor, and a lot of songs are probably mislabeled, but they should fit when you hear them.
* I speed songs up or slow them down and judge the key for a universal tempo, either 175 or 140 BPM.

Some keys have added notations, THIS IS NOT BY ACCIDENT:
^ means it is technically a different genre from dubstep or drum & bass
( ) means it is a semitone higher than the listed key.

So for example, 146 BPM industrial rock tune â€œStarfuckers Inc.â€ reads as ^D#
* The song can be played with dubstep, but is not technically dubstep
* When slowed to 140 BPM (and pitched down in the process), its key becomes D# (I think minor but I donâ€™t differentiate to keep things simple)

And for example, 170 BPM drum & bass tune â€œSurgeâ€ by SPKTRM reads as (E F)
* When sped up to 175 BPM, its key is offset by a semitone
* The song starts in E (I think minor?) and eventually changes to F-something (I probably got this wrong)
