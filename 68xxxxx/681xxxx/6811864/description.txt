Quote:
The Borgias have always been fascinating. Famous for giving us some of Rome's most distinguished dignitaries in the 16th century, but also for their Machiavellian cunning and their skills with poisons, the Borgias are a symbol of Renaissance decadence. Jodorowsky and Manara have made the story of that diabolical dynasty their own, to bring us a forceful saga that combines power, betrayal, death and sacrilege.
