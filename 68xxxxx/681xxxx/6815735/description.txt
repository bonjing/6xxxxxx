And here's the 2003 Venus album Vertigone in FLAC -8 format. All three have now been flacced for your benefit. They're all out of print, by the way.


Rehashing the band description once more:

Venus originally started as a five-member Belgian band in 1997. They achieved moderate success in Europe for ten years, only to disband in 2007. Probably the most famous of their tracks is 'Beautiful Days' (straight off this album), used in advertisements and the ending crawl for the 2004 Enki Bilal animation Immortel (ad vitam).

Of the three albums Venus released, the 2003 release of Vertigone is probably the best one in terms of even quality. My personal fave is Kallenovsky.

After Venus disbanded, one of the founders started another band named Joy. A generic word like that is friggin' hard to Google, let me tell you. I'll FLAC it if I ever get round to obtaining a copy.
