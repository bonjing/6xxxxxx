Torrent content :

1) Cyberlink PowerDirector 10 content pack v1 that was missing in my first torrent for this specific product.
Special thanks to Dobio007 for have letting me know a such information
anyway.
Thx to Cyberlink support also and more especialy to certain very helpfull guys
who try to help a bit to this topic.

The content pack included in my first torrent was supposed combined content pack v1 and v2 all in one together in a single archieve.
After verification it does not seem exactly true.
Look's like it is the content pack v2 only,no more.
This content pack v1 is crucial otherwise you might encountering several possible troubles as well anyway in certains cases or circonstances while using powerdirector 10 in full job.
This time i really hope it will resolve all problems so.

2)True Romance pack which last one is an optional additional complementary
pack for much fun but not crucial anyway.

You will have now all necessary files for the complete retail for Cyberlink
PowerDirector 10.
I cannot do better anyway.
As you can see it is again a consequent torrent near 1 Gb again:
That means the full retail have a full size of approximaly 2,70-2,75 Gb...
Awesome,isn't it ?
Btw the archieve has the same password protection.
For the end,i'm not really happy cause a stupid guy as a stupid idiot might 
have announced my torrent seed on Cyberlink support forum.
Not cool and not nice at all anyway.
Even if i can understand his act...
Therefore please,try to stay discret with my both seeds about this product and don't deceived me as well.
I don't need of publicity,i just share my little gold with each of you and i think it is already not so bad then.
Be mature as well as respectfull.
Ty for understanding
...

Enjoy and gl

regards
