Discription

Biblical Mysteries of Sodom and Gomorrah:
Join the fascinating search for the sin cities. Could they be buried at the bottom of the Dead Sea? \"And Lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of Jordan, there it was well watered everywhere, before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, . . . .\" â€”Genesis 13:10

This compelling NBC prime-time special, featuring scholar Mike Sanders, leads us on an unprecedented exploration to the depths of the salty Dead Sea in the same Delta mini-submarine used to explore the wreck of the liner Lusitania . The viewer almost becomes part of the team in energetic search for evidence of the location of the ancient Biblical cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. To some skeptics the Biblical tale of the two \"sin cities\" is metaphorical, but Sandersâ€™ belief â€” possibly supported by new evidence derived from NASA satellite photography showing anomalies on the floor of the Dead Sea â€” is that the cities not only existed, but their location might be found today. It took years of negotiations for Sanders to obtain clearance from the Israel army, the Jordanians and the Palestinians to search for the ruins at one of the most tension-packed places on earth. However, limited access was permitted, and we join the dive to the sea floor to uncover some compelling evidence buried in the salt. The search is still not over but the initial evidence that the program presents could mark a critical step forward.

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.


RAPtURE (My transportation outta here).

The Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe That The Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn\'t PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)

In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed..

\"And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.

\"Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...

May Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed Long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.
