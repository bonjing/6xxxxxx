POtHS Comments on This one:     The hour draws near.

Description: Mike Hoggard-2010 Prophecy Seminar:
The study of Freemason's Secret Symbols Revealed and Bible Prophecy.  For those of you who have enjoyed Pastor Mike Hoggard's videos, we offer a real treat. There is a huge difference between Pastor Hoggard's studio videos and a live seminar. On January 7, 2010, Cutting Edge Ministries invited Pastor Hoggard to conduct a seminar based on Dan Brown's latest book, "The Lost Symbol." During that seminar, he covered numerous topics that have not made it into any of his current videos.

In this 3-part DVD set, you will see topics such as the true foundations of America's beginnings, the identification of Washington, D.C. as a pagan high place and new discoveries about Bible Numerics. At the end of the seminar, Pastor Mike addresses the issue most people had on their mind: America is very, very close to crossing that Judgment Line with God. The loss of our freedoms is now only awaiting the next 'trigger event' â€” either World War III or the next real terror attack.

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.


RAPtURE (My transportation outta here).

The Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe That The Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)

In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed..

"And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.

"Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...

May Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed Long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.
