 this is how it is on my PC), so I'll share them to help avoid headaches/frustration:

The inventory/spell menus don't come up like they're supposed to when you drag your mouse to the top-right and top-left of the screen like the instruction book says (though the save/restore/prefs/quit menu in the center does), not sure if that's a GOG edition thing or not. Right-clicking the mouse brings up the inventory screen with the spell book, or you can press F5 for inventory and F6 for the spell book.

When you go to a teleporter you have to have the map in your hand already, or you'll have to back-up (a ""back"" arrow near the bottom-right of the screen), access your inventory and get the map, and then go back to the teleporter. For some reason it doesn't let you access your inventory at the teleporter itself. Weird.

If I come across any other quirks, I'll post 'em!"
