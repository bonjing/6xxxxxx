This is the GOG.com revised version of the final game in the Zork series... Zork Grand Inquisitor. In short what this means is that it installs and plays on modern Windows operating systems, including Windows 7 (I'm personally running it on Win7 64-bit) without requiring DOSBox or tweaking! The reason I'm seeding it is because it was a bit difficult to find the GOG version of this game online, and since I appreciated it I figure you guys will too...

Have included a walkthrough in case anyone gets stuck. Enjoy!

The following from http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/zork_grand_inquisitor:

What's cool about it:
* Stunning graphics and enchanting music absorb you into over 30 unique 360â° environments
* Live action video and voice acting by stars such as Dirk Benedict, Michael McKean and David Landerr.
* Visit the famous landmarks that made Zork legendary. Enlist the aid of three fantastic characters on your magic quest through Zork

Overview:
Magic has been banned from the great Underground Empire of Zork. By edict of the Grand Inquisitor Mir Yannick, the Empire has been sealed off and the practice of mystic arts declared punishable by "Totemization" (a very bad thing). The only way to restore magic to the kingdom is to find three hidden artifacts: The Coconut of Quendor, The Cube of Foundation, and The Skull of Yoruk. Join forces with Dungeon Master Dalboz who calls you "AFGNCAAP"( politically-correct initialism for "Ageless, Faceless, Gender-Neutral, Culturally-Ambiguous Adventure Person") and together you travel throughout the Underground Empire's many locations, such as Hades, Flood Control Dam #3 and The Dungeon Master's Lair in an attempt to find the three missing artifacts and bring about the fall of the Inquisition. Zork: Grand Inquisitor is the last installment of the famous Zork adventure series. It uses the same formula as its predecessor: first-person perspective, 360 degree camera rotation, pre-rendered backgrounds, and live actors. Humor and comical pop-culture references accompany you throughout the entire game and guarantee that you will never get bored. So if you are looking for a not so serious oldschool adventure then this gem is for you.

(Head to the site above for more information and user reviews. My personal review is that ZGI is even better than Return to Zork, which itself was badass. This is easier to play, though the puzzles still require some thought, and it seems to have a deal more humor. There's also a Wiki entry here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork:_Grand_Inquisitor. Again, enjoy! +*halofubar*+)
