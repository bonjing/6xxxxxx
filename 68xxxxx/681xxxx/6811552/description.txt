Spy.2011.S01E05.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 88MB]

[/b][/color] Thirty-something Tim (Darren Boyd, Green Wing) has reached a crossroads.
Not only is he stuck in a dead-end job at Computer Universe, but he???s locked in a bitter custody battle with nice-as-nettles ex-wife Judith (Dolly Wells) over son Marcus (Jude Wright), a precocious nine-year-old who is as happy spending time with his dad as a PETA member would be modelling fur coats.
Tim???s world is shaken and most definitely stirred however, when he???s accidentally recruited as a trainee spy for MI5, going from zero to hero.
Well, sort of...
