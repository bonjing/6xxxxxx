Nirvana - Live at the Paramount (DVD NTSC)



Review:

Boasting never before seen footage of a concert at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle, this performance was Nirvana's first big homecoming show after releasing Nevermind and their last American show before leaving for a European tour. It was recorded Halloween night 1991 one month after the release of Nevermind, on the cusp on Nevermind achieving 'Gold' accreditation in the US. The Paramount concert, transferred from 16mm film and multi-track audio, is the only known Nirvana concert shot to film. This remarkable time capsule is now available for the very first time.
