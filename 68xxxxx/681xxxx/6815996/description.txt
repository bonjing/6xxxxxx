Plot

Plot: Eons after the Gods won their mythic struggle against the 
Titans, a new evil threatens the land. Mad with power, King Hyperion
 (Mickey Rourke) has declared war against humanity. Amassing a 
bloodthirsty army of soldiers disfigured by his own hand, Hyperion
 has scorched Greece in search of the legendary Epirus Bow, a 
weapon of unimaginable power forged in the heavens by Ares. Only 
he who possesses this bow can unleash the Titans, who have been 
imprisoned deep within the walls of Mount Tartaros since the dawn 
of time and thirst for revenge. In the kingâ€™s hands, the bow would rain
 destruction upon mankind and annihilate the Gods. But ancient law 
dictates the Gods must not intervene in manâ€™s conflict. They remain 
powerless to stop Hyperionâ€¦until a peasant named Theseus (Henry Cavill) comes
 forth as their only hope. Secretly chosen by Zeus, Theseus must save
 his people from Hyperion and his hordesâ€¦
