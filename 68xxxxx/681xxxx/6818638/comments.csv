I know it makes us angry, but what *should* separate we citizens from corrupt authorities, is that we can think beyond such mindless violence when faced with complicated issues. Our intelligence is our greatest weapon.

One technique employed by authorities is to encourage us to violence providing them with apparent justification for their own misconduct.

Non-violent protest limits their control of us. The people will prevail. â˜®
