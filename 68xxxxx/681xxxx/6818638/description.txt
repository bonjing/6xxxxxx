                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Documentary following undercover police officer Mark Kennedy, who spent eight 
 years as a dedicated activist, having infiltrated the environmental movement  
 and Europe's left-wing extremist political groups. Now, with his cover blown, 
 Kennedy has lost his wife and children, and the friends he made during his    
 time with the protesters have labelled him a traitor. In this Cutting Edge    
 film, he discusses the consequences of his actions, as police bosses claim he 
 has forgotten who he really is.                                               
                                 Enjoy!
