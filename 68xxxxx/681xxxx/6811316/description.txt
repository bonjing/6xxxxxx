In this weekâ€™s conversation with regular guest Bob Chapman of The International Forecaster we discuss the goings-on at the G20 as the Eurocrats rally around their globalist project even as the ground falls out from under them. We discuss the hand over of power in Greece, the accusations of death threats in behind-closed-door meetings, Obama and Sarkozyâ€™s candid remarks about Netanyahu and the strange story of Jon Corzine and MF Global.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
