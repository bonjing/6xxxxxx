Since his debut in 1938 Superman has become one of the most recognisable fictional characters in existence. Now, prepare for a fresh take on Superman, courtesy of at team up between two of comics brightest talents...Imagine Superman comics were beginning again and you could read the first adventures of the Man of Steel - but reinvented from top to bottom to reflect today's world and today's sensibilities. That's Birthright:it's the Story of Superman--from Krypton to Metropolis (via Smallville!) and beyond. Master scribe Mark Waid demonstrates his love for, and knowledge of, the Superman mythos whilst the graceful illustrations of Leinil Francis Yu bring the story to life.

Superman: Birthright is a twelve-issue comic book limited series published by DC Comics in 2003 and 2004, written by Mark Waid and drawn by Leinil Francis Yu.

Originally, this was meant to be a non-canon version of Superman, showcasing his origin and updating him for the 21st century. Soon after, it was decided to make the series canon, and thus it replaced John Byrne's The Man of Steel series as Superman's canonical origin story.This editorial position lasted until the 2005â€“2006 Infinite Crisis crossover event, and the release of the new origin story; Superman: Secret Origin in 2009.
