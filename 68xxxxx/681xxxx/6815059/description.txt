Originally recorded in 1974, New Sounds is considered to be one of the Pacific Northwest's best kept secrets, a regional Holy Grail with copies fetching upward of $1000. Until recently, not much was known about this mysterious blind folk singer from Oregon. This official reissue of New Sounds includes Bob Desper's 1972 debut, a booklet with extensive liner notes and original photos, plus two bonus tracks.
