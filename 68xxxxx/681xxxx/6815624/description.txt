Though this is ostensibly an audio release, as with Dark Side of the Moon, there are a few video elements on this release as well, all presented encoded via AVC and for the most part in 1080i (see the main body of the review for complete details). There's nothing spectacular about the video presentation (it is, after all, made up almost entirely of still frames), but it's really interesting from a historical perspective.
