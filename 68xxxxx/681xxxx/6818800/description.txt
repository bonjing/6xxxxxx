Some really low-budget Cox here. And some fine images of Arizona.

The title refers to an old John Ford/John Wayne western, and the film is rife with cinematic reference.

We follow a couple of actors low on the totem pole and out for some revenge.  It's a road movie, and there's a lot of throwaway dialog regarding cinema and politics. Basically feels like a film that was fun to make, without a heck of a lot of ambition - in a very different way than "Straight to Hell".
