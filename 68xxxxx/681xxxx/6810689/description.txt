â€œThe White Devilâ€ (Harper Collins, 368 pages, $24.99) Justin Evansâ€™ daring tale of an American neâ€™er-do-well teenager adrift in the famed English boarding school Harrow, reads like â€œA Separate Peaceâ€ with murder thrown into the mix.
 
The mystery behind that involves none other than a giant of a literary figure in the form of Lord Byron, himself enrolled at the school centuries before. And Evans smoothly fashions a darkly beautiful tale that turns the alienated, angst-riddled Taylor into an amateur sleuth who must find the killer before other students fall victim to the paranormal madness.
 â€œThe White Devilâ€ reminds me of John Hartâ€™s brilliant â€œThe Last Child,â€ last yearâ€™s Edgar winner for best novel. A similar honor may well await Justin Evans and, if so, it will be the first of many. A wonderful book in all respects.


Enjoy!
