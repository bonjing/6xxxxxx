From Wiki:


The Nixons (formed in 1990) were an American post-grunge rock band, finding some commercial success in the mid-1990s.


The Nixons were founded in Oklahoma City by singer/guitarist Zac Maloy, guitarist Jesse Davis, bassist Ricky Brooks, and drummer Tye Robison. The group released their debut EP Six in 1992 (after a self-titled album, released in 1990) on Dragon Street Records and replaced Robison with John Humphrey, before releasing Halo in 1994 on Dallas-based Rainmaker Records. This album features several songs also included on Foma, their official debut LP, released in 1995 on MCA Records. Foma included the radio hits "Sister", " Happy Song", "Wire", and "Passion". The group capitalized on their success with big tours (about 300 shows a year), including dates with KISS, Slash's Snakepit, Brother Cane,Soul Asylum, Radiohead, and Toadies. Foma eventually peaked at #77 on the Billboard 200.

The group replaced Ricky Brooks with Ricky Wolking and released the self-titled album, "THe Nixons" in 1997 with MCA/Universal, which featured three singles: "The Fall", "Miss U.S.A." and "Baton Rouge". The album eventually peaked at #188 on the Billboard 200. Their consistent gigging ensured a strong cult audience for 1999's Scrapbook EP (featuring b-sides, live and acoustic performances, including covers of Elton John's "Rocket Man" and Cheap Trick's "Heaven Tonight"), which saw the band return to Rainmaker.

Their fourth album Latest Thing, was released by Koch in early 2000. It featured songs co-written by Marti Frederiksen and Jack Blades of Night Ranger fame. The subsequent promotional tour used Ray Luzier on drums and Scott "Scoob" Bush on guitar.

After a brief tour in support of Latest Thing, the Nixons went on hiatus.

Davis, Brooks, and Humphrey reformed in early 2001 as Huver, with a new lead singer, Garin Murdock. The band gigged heavily and reportedly signed a recording contract with Epic Records, but broke up in the summer of 2002 after independently releasing one EP. John Humphrey has gone on to play drums in the band Seether. Ricky Wolking now plays bass for the Dallas-based rock band Edgewater and has recorded a solo album as Honky Mofo. Jesse Davis played in a roots-rock/psychedelic jam band called 4 Points West which released one EP and one full-length album. He currently plays guitar in the Oklahoma City based rock band In Union. In Union released their self titled E.P. in 2011. Davis also has a recording studio in Oklahoma City. Zac Maloy released two albums and an EP as a solo artist, and has since become a songwriter and producer,and relocated to Nashville working with such acts as Carrie Underwood, Our Lady Peace, Supercell, The Daylights, Hanson, Chris Daughtry, David Cook and Bowling for Soup. Maloy also recently opened his own recording studio, Rosewater Studios, in Tulsa. Original drummer Robison is a co-owner of January Sound Studio in Dallas, and has worked as a producer/engineer with Drowning Pool, Cas Haley, and Dennis DeYoung.
