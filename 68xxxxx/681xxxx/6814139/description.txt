This is a package of the works of Stanislaw Lem, easily one of the most original writers of science fiction ever. Each has been proofed and linked with an active table of contents to make the reading easier. 

I've included everything by Lem I could find, but unfortunately was unable to put my hands on a decent e-text of either 'Mortal Engines' or 'Perfect Vacuum'. If anyone has one, let me know, and I'll gladly add it to the queue.
