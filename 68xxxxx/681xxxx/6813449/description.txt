Ass Up Face Down | Mei Mara  + Pics
November 11, 2011 



Normally stocks are constructed to keep a person standing upright, but today PD has decided he wants Mei Mara to remain on her knees. More than that, he wants the position to be as uncomfortable as possible. Keeping her head shifted the way it is lets her see just enough of the room to know how much trouble she is in. That vantage point is not any kind of advantage. It just shows her that she has very good reasons to be very afraid.
