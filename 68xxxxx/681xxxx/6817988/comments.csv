Yeah, I figured that was a little dumb after I posted it.

Too bad... you can learn a lot about a country and it's people from watching their reality shows"
g2, for the same bitrate, produced blockiness and the filesize was bigger, thus wmv was used. further, the constraint of 480i was considered. i would have opted for mkv/h.264 but the interlaced broadcast was also a hurdle.

pasensya na, naumpisahan na kasi. hopefully when the philippines starts to broadcast using at least 720p, files would be smaller."
