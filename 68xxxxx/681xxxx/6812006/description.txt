here it is the latest beta build of vlc media player 1.2.0 pre1-git for
macosx-intel from : November 12 such today so.
This is the intel64 version anyway.

remember : beta build and might be instable as well.
it is not the final version as well as not official yet anyway.

delivered such "as is" and untouched for personal testing purpose only.

Note: VLC's nightly builds for Intel require Mac OS X 10.6 or later

It will not launch on older releases. We recommend to use the latest version available for your release. VLC's actual releases still support Mac OS X 10.5.



vlc-git-intel is the latest VLC snapshot of the unstable branch, compiled in 32 bit mode

vlc-git-intel64 is the latest VLC snapshot of the unstable branch, compiled in 64 bit mode

Enjoy and feel free to post your feedbacks or opininons about this last and
more advanced version.
