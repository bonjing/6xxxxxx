Mathematics Made Difficult is a book by Carl. E Linderholm that uses advanced mathematical methods to prove results normally shown by elementary means. Although the aim is largely satirical, it also shows the non-trivial mathematics behind operations normally considered obvious, such as numbering, counting, and factoring integers.
