Outstanding studio disc by this bad-ass, axe rippin', blues/rock power trio from Australia featuring Michael Vdelli on guitar & vocals. Strong, muscular riffage and way-kool, soul-powered, whiskey-soaked vox rule in the world of Vdelli. 12 tracks of top-shelf, world-class, ass-kickin', hard-edged, powerful, bluesy heavy guitar grooves that will rock your blues into the dirt. Excellently produced by veteran studio ace Kevin Shirley (Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, Bonamassa, among others) who puts a fresh, exciting new "sonic spin" on this amazing power trio riff:machine. If you dig your blues/rock riffage with a killer, groove-induced, guitar heavy edge that rides hard, solid & funky on the big, electric boogie train, tune into the Vdelli disc @ all costs.
