[sebaygo1]


The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events.

The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.

On the Sunday, November 13 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks about the prospect of an attack on Iran now that the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency has released a report accusing the Islamic Republic of working on a nuclear weapon. 

Alex also talks about his latest video documenting chemtrails in Texas and the world-wide secret program to manipulate the atmosphere. The government now admits it has been "testing" the manipulation of earthâ€™s atmosphere with barium salts, aluminum dioxide and other toxic compounds. 

He also covers the silencing of Ron Paul at the Republican debates on Saturday.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
