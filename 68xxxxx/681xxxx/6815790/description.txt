For some people, concern with their body size and shape becomes an obsession and they can develop on eating disorder, Sufferers may starve themselves, exercise too much, or deliberately vomit to purge their body of calories. Nutrition and Eating Disorders, Second Edition examines some of the most common eating disorders, from anorexia nervosa to binge eating.

 Good nutrition is important for a healthy, long, and productive life. To function properly, the body must take in a balanced diet rich in carbohydrates, triglyceride lipids (fats and oils), and proteins. Healthy Eating: A Guide to Nutrition provides people of all ages with guidance for choosing and maintaining a healthy diet, and explores how nutrition plays a role in areas such as sports, weight loss, disease prevention, and human development.
