Description:

Watanuki, who is able to see the spirit world, continues to work for Yuuko at her special shop, in which anything a person desires can be theirs â€“ for a price. Under her subtle influence, Watanuki is becoming more able to accept the burden of attracting the attention of various spirits and other worldly being; but now, he must truly understand just how NOT simple the world really is. Seeing the truth of his muddled friendships with Doumeki and Himawari will merely be the beginning; finding his own place in the world will be the goal.
