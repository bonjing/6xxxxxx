FILM PRODUCTION TECHNIQUE: CREATING THE ACCOMPLISHED IMAGE, Fifth Edition, combines extensive information on video production with a strong emphasis on how motion picture film can be integrated into a project's workflow. An invaluable resource for those with limited background in the field, it equips you with a solid foundation in the basics of film. Exploring cutting-edge technologies as well as traditional techniques, the text covers lighting, cameras, editing, crew organization, and the production process. It uses clear terminology to explain complex topics and also lays out the basic, conventional approach to scene structure in a straightforward and methodical manner. Extremely practical, the text not only illustrates what you need to know to make a film but also it gives a sense of the magnitude of the process--the trials and tribulations, the mistakes, and the myriad intangibles that can make up a production. Diagrams and screen grabs throughout vividly illustrate the inner workings of equipment and the step-by-step procedures to execute specific tasks.
