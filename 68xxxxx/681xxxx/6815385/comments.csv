(Daemon tools, magic disc, poweriso) these all got the sim error message when using the razor 1911 install.exe
^
i extracted the game successfully with winrar and magic iso got decription key error.
 ( When i tryed to extract with daemon, poweriso or simply copy i got corrupt file error)
^
I used Phoenix method step by step below and that didnt work either
Note tho i did not get a tesv.exe when extracting with phoenix.
so i crack it overwrite files n so on this time i get the steam.api error and now i give up.
