comment From IMDB site:
"Details the graphic and shocking, yet undeniably tragic story of Rome's
most infamous Caesar, Gaius Germanicus Caligula" 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080491/ 

This is a movie for grown-ups as it deals wit the nasty business of bestial
inhuman cruelty and sexual desires that have little to do with human sanity
that are in grossly explicit enough depiction. It will upset a sensitive soul
to view this material before they have attained maturity to maintain the required perspective with inner strength which only comes from rightly guided wisdom.


That said, much is made of this movie in denigrating the peoples of Rome and this
is a miscarriage of justice in fact. In my view only one woman of the most obviously clearly supreme Christianly beauty is cast - the Germanic supreme
beauty of Ms. Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla is gifted to us on the screen to 
enjoy.

That said, Germanicus Caligula is in fact a fiend (sic) to the people of Rome
as that is what we see him to be to Drusilla too and to all others that
deserve better human sanity in their midst. No doubt this butchering maniac
was to himself superior in some fashion perhaps - but mainly he is insane with
the mind of a demonic bestial appetite for inane cruelties and what have you.

The true men of Rome must not bear his memory as their own as they bear no resemblance to him in whatever mode of spirit he may choose to employ as they
must remain as pope if they are to remain as Romans in their own hearts in truth.
