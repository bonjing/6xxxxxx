plot

Rahul (Shahrukh Khan) is a dancer and the director of a successful music and dance troupe. He believes that Nisha (Karisma Kapoor), his lead dancer, is his best friend. Nisha acts like his friend, but is secretly in love with him. On the other track of the story is Pooja (Madhuri Dixit) , who believes that someone somewhere is made for everyone and when she will find that special someone God will give her a hint/signal. Pooja is an orphan, living with parent's friends. Their son Ajay (Akshay Kumar) is her best friend.

Nisha injures her foot and Rahul needs a new dancer. He hires Pooja. She and Rahul are increasingly attracted to each other, but they act as if it were not happening. Pooja, unknown to Rahul, is already engaged to Ajay. A romance with another man would be scandalous and a disappointment to her auntie and uncle, who want to see her marry their son. She tries to keep her distance from Rahul and he, puzzled by her mixed signals, does not push matters.

Nisha, her senses sharpened by jealousy, sees it all. Instead of trying to stop the affair, however, she decides to leave India for a while and let matters take their course. She truly loves Rahul and wishes only the best for him.

As preparations for the new show continue, Pooja finally tells Rahul that she is engaged to Ajay and Rahul is deeply hurt. He revises the ending scene of the show to reflect his new unhappiness. Nisha complains that it has an unhappy ending but Rahul refuses to change it, as the story reflects his relationship to Pooja the way he sees it.

In the end, Rahul decides to make one last effort to revive his romance with Pooja. Pooja is torn between love and duty until Ajay, who has realized what is going on, releases Pooja from her engagement, and Pooja and Rahul reconcile.
