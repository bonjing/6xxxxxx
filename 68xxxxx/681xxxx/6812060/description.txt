"Chuck Versus The Frosted Tips" 

As the team is tasked with finding 
one of the CIAs most wanted, Chuck 
(Zachary Levi) fears that the 
Intersect may be going to Morgan's 
(Joshua Gomez) head. Meanwhile Sarah 
(Yvonne Strahovski) helps Casey (Adam 
Baldwin) navigate his relationship 
with Gertrude (guest star Carrie-Anne 
Moss). Elsewhere, Captain Awesome 
(Ryan McPartlin) makes a startling 
revelation about Jeff (Scott Krinsky) 
and Lester (Vik Sahay).

18/Slow
Evolve...or die.

Enjoy :)
