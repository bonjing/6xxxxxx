A Pennsylvania tavern is haunted by a mobster who was
gunned down there 81 years ago; paranormal investigators
hear entities cry, "Let me out," on haunted Mount Misery
Road in New York; the caretakers at an arts center
that was once a hospital experience "phantom smells"
in the old psych ward; an historian visiting a famed

before he hurts someone; and a ghost approaches a woman
at an old California hotel and asks her for change before
disappearing
