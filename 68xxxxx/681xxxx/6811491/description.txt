An inspiring, lavishly illustrated guide to creating a wonderful display of flowering and foliage plants indoors.
Illustrated with 400 photographs in color, this useful, handsome book covers all aspects of selecting, displaying, and caring for houseplants. The indoor gardener will learn how to cultivate successfully a wide range of plantings from the smallest window box to an entire garden room. There is advice about bow to choose the right plant for the right place, listing flowers and foliage that do well in various locations, including sun-filled rooms, cool windows, and shady areas. The authors suggest the best ways to display plants, such as in small and large containers, hanging baskets, and terrariums. The section on care is illustrated with step-by-step photographs that clearly show how to feed, pot, transplant, and prune plants and suggests the equipment that is needed for these tasks. A chapter titled the "houseplant doctor" gives advice on treating unhealthy plants. Finally the A to Z directory of plants includes pictorial accounts of the best plants available and their cultivation needs. This is the ideal book for anyone in the city or the country, in a modest or spacious home who wishes to enjoy the pleasures of indoor gardening.
