,plozano0,2012-03-24T21:46Z,i have waisted over 5 dvd's on this game cuz i have been trying to figure out how to burn xgd3 games. I tried another game and used my same method and it worked! So there is something wrong with your game here. I believe it is missing the .xex file or the .xbe file cuz i cant find them. Please recheck this torrent!
