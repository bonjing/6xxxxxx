George Harrison - Undercover Volume 1 (With Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr)(2 CD)(2003)(The Lost Tapes Bootleg)(HQ Artwork & Disc Scans Included)(FLAC Images+cue+log)











A rare bootleg. Certainly it' s a compilation made â€‹â€‹by a fan (Simon Flybrew) and it seems that the label is Sadie In The Sky Records. It also seems to be the work of Private Copy Records.

Not much information... It's a compilation of the many songs on which George Harrison has participated.
