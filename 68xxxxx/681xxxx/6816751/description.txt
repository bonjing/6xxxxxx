Cache cleaner

Reset outdated cache files to zero
and give your apps some relief.

Cache files were originally intended to help
content load faster. However, when cache
files accumulate, they slow the browsing
experience and waste disk space.
CleanMyMac cleans your Photo Cache, User
Cache and System Cache and speeds your
browsing considerably.
