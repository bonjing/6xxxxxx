I realize that you're trying for a small filesize, but you're sacrificing a lot of quality to get there. You're trying to cram 3x the data into 1.25x the size of your SD encodes.

It's amazing that you were able to get as much quality as you did, but give the show some room to breathe. Give it ~350MB and everyone will be happy with the results.

At the current size, the video is slightly soft and some of the more detailed textures, particularly the fur, got crushed. This isn't standard animation, it needs a higher bit rate to look it's best.

The broadcast 384k 5.1 stream is only ~40 MB larger than your 128k stereo stream. If you feel that's too much, you could always use 6-channel AAC.

Finally, many players don't handle x264 inside AVI containers. Please use either MP4 or MKV.

Once again, thanks for the great work."
