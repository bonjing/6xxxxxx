Book Description
Research into grid computing has been driven by the need to solve large-scale, increasingly complex problems for scientific applications. Yet the applications of grid computing for business and casual users did not begin to emerge until the development of the concept of cloud computing, fueled by advances in virtualization techniques, coupled with the increased availability of ever-greater Internet bandwidth. The appeal of this new paradigm is mainly based on its simplicity, and the affordable price for seamless access to both computational and storage resources.

This timely text/reference introduces the fundamental principles and techniques underlying grids, clouds and virtualization technologies, as well as reviewing the latest research and expected future developments in the field. Readers are guided through the key topics by internationally recognized experts, enabling them to develop their understanding of an area likely to play an ever more significant role in coming years.
