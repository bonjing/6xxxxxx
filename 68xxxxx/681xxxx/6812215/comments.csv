Click on the link below and you can get it from there. It is 100% safe. For this particular episode, and I presume all other Mad Fashion episodes, you won't need to create an account as it is under 250 meg. But, I recommend that you do coz when I start uploading Rachel Zoe Season 5, you won't be able to get it from there!!
It is very easy to do. Just go to http://bayfiles.com/ and create an account (absolutely free)
Don't worry, I will post all torrents once Pirate Bay is working again
