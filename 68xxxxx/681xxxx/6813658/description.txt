Notes: This is a proper off The.Fighter.2010.NORDIC.PAL.DVDR-DREAM
So mr DREAM the p2p group here we are again i just love propering shitty groups :D
DREAMS rel has deadcommands,unreferenced commands and uselessGPRM (Check out /proof)
And on top off it all they for some reason have a modified volume label that is not allowed
 
Enjoy this great movie with a proper rel from a non p2p group
 P.S We keept both dts and 5.1 after seeing that we got a pretty good video bitrate after keeping both

Plot:
A look at the early years of boxer "Irish" Micky Ward and his brother who helped train him before going pro in the mid 1980s.
