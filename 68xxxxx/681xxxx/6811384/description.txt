This has been circulating for years in lossy mp3 as an unmastered version of Californication, but it's in fact a different, alternate mix of the album. This was never officially released and we don't know where it comes from. The lossless version includes 'Gong Li' which wasn't on the mp3 one.

What's the diference between the released mix and the alternate? A few differences on songs, different tracklist, but the most important thing is that it sounds much better because the official mix is highly compressed and clipped.

For anyone who doesn't understand why this is up, californication is one of the loudest and poorest sounding records of all time.Whether on vinyl or cd *I've downloaded and compared rips of both* it is said the vinyl is sourced from the cd master too.This is a pre master flac rip of the album, without the compression and terrible sound.Feel free to download for yourself and compare with whatever version of the album you may have, take note however, there are differences in certain songs as this was not the final version, but nothing extreme or drastically different, just slightly.
