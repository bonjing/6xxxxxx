Whenever I'm not using my computer and it is on (which is most of the time) this torrent alone has access to my 20mb upload."
a bitch and help this torrent survive... or else its not gonna. That's the flaw with making a huge torrent. People like me get their hopes up, and the torrent doesn't last long at all.
