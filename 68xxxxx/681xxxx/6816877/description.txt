                             ============================




This small island s varied landscape, its location in the heart of the Caribbean and its longstanding place at the center of Cold War politics have all combined to preserve some of the richest and most unusual natural environments of the hemisphere. 


For decades, Cuba s wild landscapes lay untouched while its Caribbean neighbors poisoned or paved over their ecological riches. Now, Cuba s priceless treasures are about to face an onslaught. Tourism is already on the rise and most experts predict tourism will double once the US trade embargo ends. 


What will happen to Cuba s stunning biodiversity an island filled with amphibians, reptiles and the most biologically diverse freshwater fish in the region?
