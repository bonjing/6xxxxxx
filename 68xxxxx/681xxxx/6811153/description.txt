There are no more readme files, seems a user from a board that I up to doesn't like competition and had a my blog deleted along with some files.

I posted a new blog link in the torrent (xxx blog) as for now, that is still good.

the boards that I posted on were porn-w.org and intporn.com...I have since stopped posting there, but I assume this A-hole will continue to try to have my stuff deleted.

but I will always continue to post here!
