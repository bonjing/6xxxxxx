Hey all...

I primarily upload to a fairly popular video sharing site (which I won't name... don't wanna "spam" LOL) and I have been for a couple of years now. I am "Googleable" (just Google "AC3 Audio" + AnOkAlias). All of the files that I share are personal rips from my collection and have a minimum of "720x..." resolution with AC3 audio (5.1 or higher if available) and (as of early October 2011) soft-coded English subs (for either non-English (parts of) movies or SDH and are available for streaming or downloading from the aforementioned video site if you prefer either of those. I will always have more titles there... these are mainly the titles that are more of a "p.i.t.a." to have to ReRip... and the most recent 3 will be seeded as often as I'm actively online, for a minimum of 2-3 weeks. After that... it's up to you... though I may occasionally ReSeed a title or 2 as needed.

I really enjoy sharing... and welcome feedback... so lemme know what you think of the quality... and please... help keep 'em going... seed to at least a 1.5-2:1 ratio.

Enjoy!
AnOkAlias
