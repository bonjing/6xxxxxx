  Critically wounded and lying unconscious     
  in a Mumbai hospital, ACP Yashvardhan of     
  the Narcotics Control Bureau reflects on     
  his life and his love-affair with Maya.      
  With the assistance of the Commissioner      
  as well as his colleagues, Atul, Kamlesh     
  and Mahesh Pandey, and an informer,          
  Arvind Shetty, he was able to apprehend      
  drug-dealers in Kutch, Gujarat; Jalandhar,   
  Punjab, as well as in Himachal Pradesh.      
  Unknowingly, he paved the way for Vasu       
  Anna Reddy to become the sole drug-dealer    
  and invite his Mombasa-based brother,        
  Vishnu, to join him. An encounter with       
  the team kills Vasu, and some of the team    
  gets suspended. A vengeful Vishnu decides    
  to target the entire police unit as well     
  as their respective families, and vows       
  that he will not rest until he has killed
