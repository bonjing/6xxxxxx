 On this album, Carlos Johnson was recorded in Buenos Aires by Argentina's aficionado musician, Adrian Flores. But Lefty Dizz never had full solo album in U.S. In 1993, he was on tour in Buenos Aires, and give to Adrian Flores self produced tape, recorded in December 1992, from unknow session in Chicago. This two sessions is on that album. This is pure Chicago blues.
