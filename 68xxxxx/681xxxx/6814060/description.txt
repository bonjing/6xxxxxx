How to see this map on the PC:

Download Basecamp from Garmin website, it's an update but if you haven't a previous version already installed on the PC, simply decompress the executable with Winrar in a temporary folder and launch BCMAIN.msi, then overwrite the original Basecamp.exe with the patched one (search TPB for Basecamp v3.2.2 Patched exe).

Decompress and copy the gmapsupp.img map on a pendrive (Garmin folder)

Start Basecamp, it will recognize the pendrive with the map, select the map.


Enjoy !!
