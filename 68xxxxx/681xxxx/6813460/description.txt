Be, Po, and Sung are young friends who have different styles of living. Be is upset with both his work and love life - but the latter seems to have most influence on him. After his lover left all he does is sit and wait for her return. So Po and Sung send him ten ways of how to cure a broken heart. Po, a playboy surrounded by girls, began to question the difference between sex and love. One day, he meets a girl who he thinks is right for him; will he be right for her? Sung is always hungry for love and for a job â€“ heâ€™s just unsure of what kind, although heâ€™s prepared to try anything. One day, a job leads him to Paveena, his part-time employer. Sung is confident that she is his ideal girl. However, would he fail like every time before?
