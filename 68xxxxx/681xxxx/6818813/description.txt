For true fans of Patrick McGoohan has Number 6 (in the 1967-68 series "The Prisoner"), here is a collection of DVD extras from the 40th Anniversary collection. The ripping was not done by me, but it is very thorough.

In this torrent:
* A few documentaries and interviews, as well as some very interesting photographic records of the production.
* The "musical galleries"
* Various stock film clips
* Textless versions of the opening and closing titles
* The US Video Companion
* Box-art and disc-art

Scripts will be in a separate torrent.
