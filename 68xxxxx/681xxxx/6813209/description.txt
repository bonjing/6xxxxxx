JLA: The Nail is a three-issue comic book mini-series published in the United States by DC Comics. It is a self-contained story by Alan Davis which stands outside of the mainstream continuity of the DC Universe. In this universe, Jonathan and Martha Kent's pickup truck has a tire puncture which is caused by a nail. This prevents them from discovering the spaceship outside of Smallville containing the baby Kal-El, and thus there is no Superman.
