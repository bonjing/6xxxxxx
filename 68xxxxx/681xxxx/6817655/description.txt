Self-Defense Training Camp helps players develop the self-confidence they need to react more efficiently when facing troublesome situations, and allows players to discover ways of protecting themselves from various forms of physical assault. The game combines fitness workouts and self-defense drills into four primary categories critical to successful self-protection: technique, stamina, composure and reflexes. Kinect's innovative tracking technology provides players with immediate feedback on their movements, helping to make the basics of self-defense easy regardless of the player's skill level. These self-defense techniques are taught by an experienced, real-life self-defense coach.

Players will get in shape as they learn new skills with fitness routines inspired by both kickboxing and martial arts. They will also improve their reflexes with a collection of fun mini-games. To help players sharpen their minds as well as their bodies, Self-Defense Training Camp also incorporates meditative forms of exercise helping users learn how to remain calm and composed in stressful situations.
