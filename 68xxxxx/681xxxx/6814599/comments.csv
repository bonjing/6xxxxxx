,Kramanator17,2012-02-10T12:16Z,I've given a link in a previous comment to a torrent that works. My iTunes screwed my folder settings when I updated it and I couldn't reseed this torrent without it deleting my files and starting again. Use the above link instead of mine. I even had to use it at one stage. I've tried to delete this torrent but it won't let me yet.
