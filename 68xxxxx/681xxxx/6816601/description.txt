"The Food Wife"

Marge takes Bart and Lisa on a weekend 
excursion, and when an unexpected restaurant 
detour awakens their taste buds, fellow 
foodies Amuse Bruce and Fois Garth (guest 
voices Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim) 
inspire them to start their own food blog, 
The Three Mouthketeers. The threesome scores 
an exclusive reservation at Springfields 
premiere modern restaurant, but Marge has an 
unsettling dream during which Anthony 
Bourdain, Gordon Ramsay and Mario Batali 
(guest-voicing as themselves) lead her to 
reconsider inviting Homer. And later, Marge 
directs Homer to a different type of cooking 
lab where he gets into a bind with law 
enforcement authorities.
