Details:

Stefanie Jamaica Pschill aka Fawni (born 17 July 1985) is an Austrian singer-songwriter, artist and actress. She currently lives in Hollywood, CA. At the age of seven, Fawni entered the music business; joining a musical group that traveled throughout Europe until her thirteenth birthday. The group performed in both major plays and musicals, and gained solid acclaim throughout the field of aspiring young talent. In her teens, Fawni moved to London where she began to perform, study, act, and sing. She received musical training from several leading teachers and worked on a few small television and film projects as well. She also began to watch and learn from her brother, the famous actor Alexander Pschill, known best for his role as â€œKommissar Rexâ€ in the Austrian P.I. show. A few years later, Fawni left London for Los Angeles on the recommendation of her agent. There she continued training in acting, singing, and dancing. Fawni was soon scouted by Kamil Rustam, a leading west coast music producer, who assisted her in developing her solo career. She has recorded tracks in multiple cities across the world, most recently in Los Angeles, New York, Vienna, London, Palma Mallorca, and Stockholm, working with world renowned producers such as Herbie Chrichlow from the Max Martin Team, DJ Sammy, and King Logan.
