,DOB2152,2012-05-24T13:38Z,"i have done everything right, installed the game, uptated it, copy pasted the contents of the ""dlccrack"" folder into my installation folder(in that order) , but when i go ahead and start the game (using the laucher) it'll tell me to type in the CD key, i type it in but then that message pops up again, with the cd-key already typed in, i hit ""complete"" and then seconds later it pops back up! i do this a million times and unless i hit ""do not continue"" it keeps going on and on! (it is accepted during installation or the installation would not proceed) i tried using Mass Effect.exe  but then i get a message that binw32.dll is missng 
am i doing something wrong here?"
