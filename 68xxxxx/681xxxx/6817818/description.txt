An attempt to go beyond current explanations of Aboriginal drug abuse, which stereotype these people as "victims," this examination focusses on understanding the users' subjective decisions to engage in this behavior. Providing an overview of the use of drugs among Aboriginal people and surveying the extant international literature, this book provides detailed descriptions of the interaction between the setting and the users, examines the substance itself, and canvasses a range of possible intervention programs.
