Audio: Mistere Line + Russian Sourround Effects
thx

VideoEncode:

For the Video DVD was ok, added brightness,sharpness,rgb,denoise.

AudioEncode:

well that was a load of work, line had so many problems, noise,hiss,crackle,crunching,hum, needed me 5h to clean it for good. But it was perfectly in sync, so thx for that.
The Movie had such great special effects and music so making a 5.1 to get all that effects back that were lost in the line is crucial.
After entering the cleaned line back into the russian 5.1 track i noticed that the endcredits had russian commentary in it for one minute. had to fix that too. having a perfect video and audio and then russian voice, not good so i filtered out the voice.
Now everything is nearly retail like.
got very nice
enjoy
