Interested in developing embedded systems? Since they donâ€™t tolerate inefficiency, these systems require a disciplined approach to programming. This easy-to-read guide helps you cultivate a host of good development practices, based on classic software design patterns and new patterns unique to embedded programming. Learn how to build system architecture for processors, not operating systems, and discover specific techniques for dealing with hardware difficulties and manufacturing requirements.

Written by an expert whoâ€™s created embedded systems ranging from urban surveillance and DNA scanners to childrenâ€™s toys, this book is ideal for intermediate and experienced programmers, no matter what platform you use.

    Optimize your system to reduce cost and increase performance
    Develop an architecture that makes your software robust in resource-constrained environments
    Explore sensors, motors, and other I/O devices
    Do more with less: reduce RAM consumption, code space, processor cycles, and power consumption
    Learn how to update embedded code directly in the processor
    Discover how to implement complex mathematics on small processors
    Understand what interviewers look for when you apply for an embedded systems job

"Making Embedded Systems is the book for a C programmer who wants to enter the fun (and lucrative) world of embedded systems. Itâ€™s very well writtenâ€”entertaining, evenâ€”and filled with clear illustrations."
â€”Jack Ganssle, author and embedded system expert.
