
Siouxsie Sioux has always maintained that it was not her intention to create the goth rock movement. 
While that lofty statement may be a little self-serving, it's partly right. The Banshees' post-1982 singles (documented in entirety on Twice Upon a Time) have a lush and expansive sound that directly influenced the goth sound. 
From the opening of "Fireworks" it is immediately apparent that Siouxsie and the Banshees were growing up. By the time of "Peek-a-Boo," the band had learned how to incorporate its early dissonance with its majestic, late-'80s sound. 
The Twice Upon a Time collection is one great step after another, with the only drawback being a poor remix of 1991's "Fear of the Unknown." A solid introduction for the unknowing. (AMG)
