"The Complete Reprise Studio Recordings" contains 20 discs with in total 452 songs, and that means every Sinatra recording on the Reprise label from 1960 to 1988 in chronological order. It features more than 24 hours of music, and is available in both a standard edition, and limited edition in a leather box. This set was nominated for a 1997 Grammy Award for Best Historical Album and Best Recording Package - Boxed.

In 1961, Sinatra inaugurated his own label, claiming the artistic freedom he longed for in the fifties. He then proceeded to do it his way, and this 20-disc set is the painstakingly detailed account of that artistic journey. These recordings are the heart of the heart, the very epicenter of 20th Century popular music; we're talking time capsule material here. From well-known tunes to obscure experiments, from near-rock to bossa nova, with all stops in between, the Reprise years are laid out here in an elaborate but accessible manner.
Given free artistic rein in the '60s and '70s, there was virtually no avenue that Sinatra, restless and curious by nature, left unexplored. There's the sparkling swing of his collaborations with Count Basie and Duke Ellingon, the aforementioned U.S - Brazil summit of his recordings with Antonio Carlos Jobim, the elegant, timeless pop stylings of "Strangers In The Night," even a fling with contemporary electric instrumentation on â€œThe World We Knew.â€ Throughout, Sinatra's artistry is unquestionable. As The Complete Reprise box makes undeniably clear, it takes a brave man to make a career out of taking one artistic risk after another, but it takes a once-in-a-century genius on the order of Frank Sinatra to make those risks work.
