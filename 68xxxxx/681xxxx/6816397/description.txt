ON THE DVD

Get more than 90 minutes of up-to-the minute, studio quality how-to videosâ€“all playable on your DVD player or computer! In this edition, Scott Mueller offers true insider information about several of the key components in a PC, including hard disk drives, power supplies, motherboards, and more.

 

You will see hard drives completely dissectedâ€“even see an open hard drive in operationâ€“so you can observe exactly what happens under the covers. One of the most common causes of failure in modern motherboards, power supplies, and many other PC components are bad capacitorsâ€“otherwise known as the capacitor plague. Mueller will show several real-world examples of this â€œdisease,â€ so you can easily identify and perhaps even repair the problem. Finally, because external hard drives are now commonly used for supplementary storage and backups, youâ€™ll find a complete discussion of several alternatives on the market. This includes tips and tricks for building or assembling your own flexible, high performance and highly reliable external storage drives, with several examples shown. This DVD also contains the complete 19th edition of this book in printable form, plus extensive technical reference material, a comprehensive glossary, and more!
