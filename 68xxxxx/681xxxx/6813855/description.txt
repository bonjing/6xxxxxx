◘◘ Took the source and slapped it straight in for converting. There   ◘◘
◘◘ we filtered the video and ran our own custom encode settings on it.◘◘
◘◘ Finally we ran several sync checks and all appears to be synced.   ◘◘
◘◘ It's not the greatest CAM in the world, video is a bit dark and    ◘◘
◘◘ has a very slight pulse/flicker that is more visable in the bright ◘◘
◘◘ scenes. Audio is better than most CAM but it still a little tinny  ◘◘
◘◘ and hollow. Sample is included. Remember it's free and - Enjoy! ☺  ◘◘
