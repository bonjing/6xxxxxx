Dragon Premium gives you complete voice control of your digital world. Turn ideas into text at the speed of thought. Tell your PC what to do and it does it. Use Dragon to talk your way through your â€œto-doâ€ list -- email, reports, spreadsheets, presentations, social networking, and more - quickly and confidently. With Dragon Premium, you can even be productive on the go. Use your iPhone or iPod as a wireless microphone at your PC, or dictate to a digital voice recorder and Dragon will transcribe the audio files when you return to your PC.

Turn Talk into Text
Say words and watch them appear on your computer screen in Word, WordPerfect, Excel, Outlook, and more -- three times faster than typing -- with up to 99% recognition accuracy right out of the box.

Unlock Your Creativity
Transform ideas into text at the speed of thought; donâ€™t let typing slow you down. Play back what youâ€™ve written for easy proofing.

Work Comfortably
Control your PC in a relaxed, hands-free mode without constantly reaching for your keyboard or mouse. Say goodbye to repetitive stress injuries.

Use Virtually Any Windows Application
Create reports, spreadsheets or presentations; send email, create tasks, or schedule meetings; surf the Web; post to Facebook or Twitter, and more -- using just your voice.

Multi-task Like Never Before
Tell your PC what to do, like â€œSend email to Jon Smith and Raphael Sanchezâ€ or â€œSearch maps for Internet marketing companies in Boston, Massachusettsâ€ to work faster and smarter. Complete multiple steps with a single voice command.

Work Your Way
Personalize Dragon with custom word lists and voice commands that reflect the kind of work you do; set options and formatting preferences, too.

Be Productive on the Go
Use your iPhone or iPod as a wireless microphone for great recognition accuracy without being tethered to your PC by a traditional microphone. You can also dictate into a Nuance-approved digital voice recorder from anywhere, at any time, for Dragon to transcribe later.

INSTALLATION NOTES
==================

View the ReadMe included for a simple, step-by-step install. This is the cleaned/automated \\\"Adrian Dennis\\\" release. (That one had a nasty trojan included, plus poorly written instructions for installing it.) I\\\'ve included a batch file to automated the confusing part, as well as the full manual instructions if you\\\'d rather.

This has been installed and tested on Windows 7 Home/Pro/Ultimate 64-bit. It\\\'s amazing what it can do if you spend just a few minutes training it! I created the torrent, opened my browser, copy/pasted and typed all this text, as well the the process for uploading the torrent... all using it! :-)
