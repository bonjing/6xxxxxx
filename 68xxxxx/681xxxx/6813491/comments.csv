? To be legal you need written permission of Island Def Jam Music Group. Of course, merely being illegal does not make it morally wrong. Because many drugs that are illegal are not morally wrong. How could a naturally existing herb, for example, be morally wrong? If so, then any arbitrary creature or plant in nature could be immoral! But how could you designate that an oak tree, a frog, a whale, a human being, or a mushroom is immoral? You can't. However, in the case of copyright, there is actually a moral infringement in breaching the law. "
