,Nash6989,2011-11-14T06:52Z,good luck with a request.. ive been asking if anyone could find a copy of the damn show trilogy for months.. i must see the 2nd and third.. please! i love you bone.
y important to me that I and many others with me are looking for. As I study electronics i desperately need to request the following:

Math tutor DVD: Circuit Analysis vol 1-2

and

Math tutor DVD: The HP50g Calculator Tutor

I know that we are many pupils that are looking for this materials right now. I really, really need these courses. If i was able to buy them I should have done that but im not a us-citizen and living with a meager monthly student loan. I will seed so i will bleed, but i feel i need that knowledge! Anything!

Knowledge should be free and not only for the rich!"
