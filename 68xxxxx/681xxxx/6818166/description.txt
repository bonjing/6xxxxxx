Rough trade are incredibly pleased to have helped mara (in a small way) to get this album, her second, finally released, a full 7 years after her critically acclaimed debut â€˜the lovelyâ€™. recorded for emi and scheduled for release in 2008, it fell victim to the maelstrom that ensued following terra firmaâ€™s takeover of the label, and was then ensnared in agonising and incapacitating legal treacle. aptly named â€˜floreatâ€™ (which means â€˜let it flourishâ€™ or â€˜let her bloomâ€™) this follow-up to her plaid-produced debut (on matthew herbertâ€™s accidental label) sees her beautiful and unusual mixture of musical magpie-ism go widescreen, including contributions from the royal philharmonic orchestra, an experience which mara describes as â€œsomewhere close to my wildest dreamsâ€. produced with dan carey (hot chip, the kills, la roux) and written and arranged by mara, the album runs the gamut of musical history in the fashion weâ€™ve come to expect of her, from 16th century secular madrigals all the way to modern urban pop, via the fictitious concept of elizabethan ska. sampling and reworking classical and contemporary pieces into her songs of â€œlove n hate, and love gone strangeâ€, she creates a mosaic of iridescent beauty and charm that sounds peculiarly timeless, single-handedly dislodging the stake from the heart of the torch song with her flirtatious, soulful vocals. and whatâ€™s more, c4 newsreader jon snow chose a track for one of his desert island discs! the rough trade exclusive bonus cd was recorded live at the chapel of st barnabas, and also has the added attraction of a duet with willy mason, where the duo come on like a latter day gram and emmylou.
