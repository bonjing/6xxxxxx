This is a full NTSC DVD of the episodes 21-40 of Season One of "Shaun the Sheep".  There is currently no US version available in Widescreen so I specially made this to replace the discs in the official pan-n-scan release. This is sourced from PAL DVD's but I did my best to convert them. The quality is generally very good.
