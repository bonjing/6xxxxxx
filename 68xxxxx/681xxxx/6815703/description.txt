Memory Mass Storage describes the fundamental storage technologies, like Semiconductor, Magnetic, Optical and Uncommon, detailing the main technical characteristics of the storage devices. It deals not only with semiconductor and hard disk memory, but also with different ways to manufacture and assembly them, and with their application to meet market requirements. It also provides an introduction to the epistemological  issues arising in defining the process of remembering, as well as an overview on human memory, and an interesting excursus about biological memories and their organization, to better understand how the best memory we have, our brain, is able to imagine and design memory.
