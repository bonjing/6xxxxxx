Turok Dinosaur Hunter -This is the Valiant series, which took the original Turok as a Native American and placed him in a world full of aliens, demons and more.  

You may recognize Turok from the video games that came out featuring him (N64+)If wikipedia is to believed the game series were based off of Acclaim's subsequent Turok series.
