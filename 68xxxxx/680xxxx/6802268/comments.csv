rude/negative reply... This sites comments are ridiculous. . . I'm included, anyway. . . . . 
You made a statement that may be your lack of account access/can't long on?. If so, you said(spelt) in the part (I'll paste and drop rather then copy it, check against to see my help) here is the sentence, it is the first one in your comment:
(I'll Capitalize the word in question)

""This is an insanely ridiculous way to seeking help, but I can't even create an account on SUPERBAY - it won't accept any password I come up with, something's fucked up!""
SUPERBAY is NOT TPB. If you enter SUPERBAY account info and usernames, etc, etc, it obviously won't recognize them. Are you certain that you THINK you are on or have been sent to TPB and are supposed to be  at or on rather the SUPERBAY TPB rip off Bull shit site."
