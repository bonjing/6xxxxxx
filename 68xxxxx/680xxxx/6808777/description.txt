If youâ€™re a budding spy, what better way to conceal your clandestine activities than to miniaturize your secret agent arsenal? MiniWeapons of Mass Destruction 2 provides fully illustrated step-by-step instructions for building 30 different spy weapons and surveillance tools, including:
* Paper Dart Watch                 * Pen Blowgun
* Rubber Band Derringer          * Mint Tin Catapult
* Pushpin Dart                          * Cotton Swab .38 Special
* Toothpaste Periscope            * Paper Throwing Star

Once youâ€™ve assembled your weaponry, the author provides a number of ideas on how to hide your stashâ€”inside a deck of cards, a false-bottom soda bottle, or a cereal box briefcaseâ€”and targets for practicing your spycraft, including a flip-down firing range, a fake security camera, and sharks with laser beams.
