Arts Documentary hosted by Alan Yentob, published by BBC broadcasted as part of BBC Imagine series in 2011 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

In Jennifer Lebeau's film, Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel talk openly and eloquently about an extraordinarily creative period in their career - the making of Bridge Over Troubled Water. The story behind what was to become their final album has long been shrouded in rock and roll mythology and is told in gripping detail in these rare interviews. Archive footage is used to reveal technical breakthroughs and the emotional feelings the two artists had for each other.
