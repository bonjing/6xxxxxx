Rename Long Filenames that explorer fails on - WinLongRenamerTool v1,0a (coded by psspss)
FREEWARE

ok took me 4 hours to figure it out

here is the 32 bit executable tool that will rename long file names even in multiple sub folders or long folder names

I wont say its bug free but I did some tests on a very long file name inside 2 sub folders and worked like a charm

Ive provided the code so anyone can improve on my work and even compile it for 64bit etc if you download the autoit 3 compiler which is also freeware :)

programs like utorrent can download to mulitple folders
and create a filename that exceeds windows explorers capabilities
when people like descriptive filenames so can use search to find
based on keyword etc (like what I like to do) 

wher you can play rename or move the darn thing.

even though you can have 250 char filename it dont seem to take in to
account the length of the folder names or if its a sub folder etc

its more a problem witn window explorer so this tool gets around it

the problem also exist in latest windows !! (win 7) in fact its probably worse then XP for the problem
