To save his son from ruthless gangsters, a streetwise ex-con finds himself coerced into performing a series of crimes in this gritty thriller. Waist Deep features Tyrese Gibson as O2, a young father and recent parolee whose life on the outside is upended when his young son Junior is taken hostage after an auto-theft gone wrong. After learning that his boy is in the hands of a mob boss named Meat (The Game), O2 is forced to break the law once again to satisfy his demands, and teams up with Coco (Meagan Good), a hooker with ties to Meat, to get into the gangster's inner sanctum and save his son. Waist Deep marked the acting debut of rapper The Game.
