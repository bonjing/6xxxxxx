Allmusic Review:
The Mary Jane Girls were always known as Rick James' protÃ©gÃ©es, because that's what they were. The superfreak dressed 'em up in skimpy outfits and provocative costumes, and had them sing songs very reminiscent of James -- actually, it's probably more accurate to say that the sound was closer to Prince or one of his protÃ©gÃ©s, because there was a heavily Minneapolis vibe to his songs and productions for the Mary Jane Girls. They hit a home run once, with the spectacular "In My House," one of the great urban funk songs of the mid-'80s. They never got that good again, although they almost hit the Top 40 with "Wild and Crazy Love" and "Walk Like a Man." Those three songs, along with a bunch of other singles, R&B; hits, and album tracks are on 20th Century Masters, as good a retrospective as could be assembled on the Girls. It's not totally comprehensive, but it does have anything that anybody would want to hear, and while it won't make a case for the girls or James as a Svengali, it's pretty enjoyable for those that want to hear songs like "In My House," only not as memorable.
