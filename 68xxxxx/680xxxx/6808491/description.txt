    In the third episode of his journey, Iolo Williams         
    explores the largely man-made landscape of Wales's        
    lowlands and some of the 1,700 miles of coastline. As    
    part of his personal pick of the best of Welsh            
    landscape and wildlife, Iolo observes a wood warbler as    
    it performs its song flight amongst the oak trees of      
    Coed Crafnant, he looks at the Dee estuary from the      
    point of view of a local fisherman - meeting some seals   
    along the way - and goes underwater off the Llyn           
    Peninsula to see the variety of marine creatures living   
    just offshore.
