Don't miss this opportunity to see star of 
Comedy Rocks and co-host of ITV2's I'm A Celebrity 
Get Me Out Of Here NOW! in his debut Live Stand-Up DVD. 
The 2010 Edinburgh Comedy Award winning show Smokescreens 
& Castles explores self, family and the consequences of 
Russell's dad buying his own council house. Sociological 
silliness and high energy contortions guaranteed on this 
brand new live stand-up DVD.
