Madonnaâ€™s single â€œGive Me All Your Loveâ€ leaked yesterday, and perhaps to diehard fans it sounds like synthed-up angels singing hallelujahs.

For many of us though, itâ€™s more like the musical equivalent of a bouquet of hydgrangeas. Madonna and manager Guy Oseary quickly responded that the leak was merely a demo and that completed versions of her new tracks wonâ€™t be released officially until the new year.
