,Truther111,2011-11-17T15:25Z,This is a true man of God led by the Holy Spirit.  Thanks very much verifire for sharing the sermon.  The message has special meaning for me.
 I'll try my best.

Still online, but how long? No idea.

@EVERYONE: If you want to have some of my uploads, or any other's uploads that makes sense and helps in some way on this journey toward eternity's dead-line;
MAKE HARDCOPIES!
Time is ticking by the nano-second, and it'll soon be up. WWW2 is here already, just try going to a online bank or something. Google WWW2. It's just a matter of TIME before it replaces WWW. Believe it.
Take to heart these words. You might be very glad one day if you did, and regret if you don't.

In love,
V.
