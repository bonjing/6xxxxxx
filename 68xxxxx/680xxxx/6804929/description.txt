Hi there..

I downloaded these audio sermons from two different sources.
The first was given in 2002, and the other in 2003.

The one from 2002 does have a rather low sound quality, but it is the one you need to listen to. I threw in the other one as a verification of the message preached, and even though the sound is better, the message is nearly identical to the word with that from 2002. But the 2002 tear down strongholds like they are made of plywood.

I had almost forgot what happens inside when a man of God delivers a message from the Lord. A message like this is you can hardly find these days.
This message will change you if you are willing to take the heat that comes to the honest man upon receiving it.

I hope this message finds all of us willing, but that is a thing yet to be seen.
And visible it will become; in your life and all around you.

If you are willing.

Isa 1:16) "Wash you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes. Cease to do evil.
17) Learn to do good. Seek justice, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.
18) Come now, and let us reason together, says LORD, though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
19) If ye are willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land.
20) But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the Sword, for the Mouth of LORD has spoken it."

"Personally I've found the hope of deliverance and enlightenment through Yeshua Ha'Mashiach to be the greatest mystery and riddle, shrouded in the shadows of shame, but revealed to those who seek the Truth, no matter the cost."
