Hasbro Family Game Night 4: The Game Show makes living rooms worldwide feel like a TV game show set. Based on the popular TV show and expanding the popular Hasbro Family Game Night franchise in a new way, this game offers re-*******d versions of five classic games.
Families and friends will literally be jumping into action with Connect 4 Basketball where the first team to shoot four balls in a row of one color wins. They can also scramble to re-arrange virtual word tiles in Scrabble Flash -- the longer the word, the better the score. Teams will push hard to achieve a bulls-eye or block their opponents with enormous on-screen game pieces in Sorry! Sliders, while Yahtzee! Bowling will have families chasing down scoring combinations as they "roll" giant bowling balls and knock down pins. Players with a sharp ear and fast reflexes will dominate in Bop-It Boptigon as players are challenged to execute the right movement at the right time at an ever increasing feverish pace, and the Monopoly Crazy Cash Machine doles out big prizes to those who come out on top of Family Game Night.
