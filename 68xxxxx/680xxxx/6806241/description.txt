A unique fusion of philosophy and metaphysics set against the backdrop of contemporary culture.

Have you ever wondered if the world is really there when youâ€™re not looking? We tend to take the reality of our world very much for granted. This book will lead you down the rabbit hole in search of something we can point to, hang our hats on, and say this is real. Along the way Jim Baggott presents the important arguments concerning the nature reality as examined by the worldâ€™s greatest thinkersâ€”from the philosophers of ancient Greece to modern scientists and social theoristsâ€”and takes on materialism, perception, and progress in a refreshingly new and entertaining way.

Jim Baggott has done a real service to the community of questing souls. He gives a lucid, thoughtful, and helpful account of one of this centuryâ€™s great conundrums. (Times Literary Supplement)

Baggott has an entertaining style, with clever use of analogies and diagrams. The bookâ€™s realist honesty shines like a beacon through the fog of contemporary mystical speculations. (New Scientist)

Reading this book is like having an informal, intimate conversation with and informed thinker. Enthusiastically recommended... (Library Journal, starred review)
