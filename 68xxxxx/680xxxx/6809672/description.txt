::Plot::
Latif Yahia (Dominic Cooper) is an Iraqi forced to act as a fedai ("body double", or political decoy) for Uday Hussein (also played by Cooper), the playboy son of Iraqi president Saddam Hussein (Philip Quast). Uday is a sadistic psychopath who arbitrarily kills people, and rapes and kills young women after kidnapping them from the street. Latif tries to stop him, but this only causes aggression from Uday toward Latif, and Latif's attempt to run away also. However, Uday does not kill Latif, because the latter is the best double that could be found.
