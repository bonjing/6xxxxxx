Allmusic Review:
It's hard to believe that there wasn't a U.S.-released Salt-N-Pepa best-of until the trio got its entry in the 20th Century Masters series. (A Blitz of Salt-N-Pepa Hits: The Hits Remixed does not count, and 2000s The Best of Salt-N-Pepa wasn't distributed in the States.) Released in 2008, this disc doesn't contain anything from Salt-N-Pepa's last album, 1997's Brand New, but it features almost every significant single from their first four. That said, two of the best tracks from Blacks' Magic, "You Showed Me" and "Do You Want Me" (a number seven rap single that seemed nearly as ubiquitous as "Push It" for a couple months during 1991), are missing -- bound to be an issue for some. Do give the compilers some credit for tapping "My Mic Sounds Nice."
