"The Hot Dog in the Competition"

The Jeffersonian team identifies the 
remains of a competitive-eating 
champion, just days before the start 
of the Gluttony Games, a premiere 
eating competition with a $10,000 
prize at stake. The remarkable work 
of new squint - and former juvenile 
delinquent - Finn links obscure 
evidence found in the belly of a 
snake with laws of physics that 
helps solve the crime. Despite his 
brilliance in the lab, Finn is met 
with hostility and skepticism, 
leading Cam to question her 
decision to give him a chance to 
start anew. Meanwhile, Booth is 
caught off-guard by an announcement 
Brennan makes about their baby. To 
diffuse the tension between them, 
the couple agrees to experiment by 
putting themselves in each other's 
shoes.
