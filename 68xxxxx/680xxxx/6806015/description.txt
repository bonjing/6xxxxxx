DMB begins this Memphis show with One Sweet World during a light rainfall. Before the song's end, the rain stops and the clouds begin to clear. Dave tells the audience that he had hoped the rain would stop so they could see some satellites and the band then launches into a notable version of Satellite. Additional highlights include Angel From Montgomery with Boyd singing lead and All Along the Watchtower which features a quiet interlude that sounds like distant thunder. Watchtower comes screaming back in full force with LeRoi's saxophone.
