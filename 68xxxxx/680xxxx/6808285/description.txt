  Spring arrives in the polar regions, and the sun appears after an     
  absence of five months; warmth and life return to these magical ice   
  worlds - the greatest seasonal transformation on our planet is        
  underway. Male Adelie penguins arrive in Antarctica to build their    
  nests - it takes a good property to attract the best mates and the    
  males will stop at nothing to better their rivals! But these early    
  birds face the fiercest storms on the planet. In the Arctic, a polar  
  bear mother is hunting with her cubs. Inland, the frozen rivers       
  start to break up and billions of tons of ice are swept downstream    
  in the greatest of polar spectacles
