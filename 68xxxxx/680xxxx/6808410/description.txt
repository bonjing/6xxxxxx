Hey folks! If youâ€˜re like me, you love to have TonS of different choices to choose from, when creating or decorating your Sims, or their home. So I went and downloaded every Sims 3 Store Update torrent, from the first (June 2009), to the most current as of this upload (November 2011). Not being a fan of Sims3packs, I downloaded all .package files. But as we all know, package files can tend to slow your game down, and lower your FPS. The more of them you have, the slower your game may play. So one day I came across a tutorial on merging .package files to help speed up your game. As I was doing most of my mods, I figured, hey, why not combine ALL of the Store Update packages, into one!! Well, I didnâ€˜t exactly know the work that laid ahead of me, but after several hours, my Frankenstein is complete! I typically dont upload torrents, but I worked so hard on it, I figured why not share!? So here it is. [b]Sims 3 Store Updates dating from June 2009, to December 2010, rolled into ONE SINGLE .PACKAGE FILE!! All the items minus the lag! Hope you all enjoy!

Note: If you want to learn how to merge .package files, try Googling it. I believe Mod The Sims has the Tutorials. Youâ€˜ll need the program s3pe.

[i]This torrent contains Sims 3 Store Updates 1-19 .package files. Dating from June 2009, and ending at December 2010. There are a few hundred new items for your sim and their home!! Enjoy![/i]

[b]ALWAYS BACK UP YOUR SAVE!!! [/b]
 [i]Instructions to do so:[/i]

1. Go to the following folder:
  
  Windows XP: C:\\Documents and Settings\\\\My Documents\\Electronic Arts\\The Sims 3\\
  
  Windows Vista/7: C:\\Users\\\\Documents\\Electronic Arts\\The Sims 3\\
  
  Mac OS: /Users//Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 3/

2. Locate the Saves folder. Find your save folder. It will be listed as the same name you save it as when you save in game. Right-Click the folder and select Copy. (Make sure to select Copy and [b]not[/b] [s]Cut[/s])

3. Now Paste the folder in a location of your choice. The location is not relevant, so you may save it anywhere you please. Your save is now safe and backed up. If any issues with this file, or any other files you install should arrive, simply replace the current corrupted save folder, with the Folder you just copied. You will obviously still lose anything you did in game from the point you backed up your file. But at least not all will be lost!!
  
[i][b]INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:[/b][/i]

Before you can put the .package files in your game, you\'ll need to set up your game to accept custom content. From patch 1.12 and up, this is very easy!

1. Go to The Sims 3 Folder in My Documents: **[u][i][b]NOT[/b][/i][/u] in Program Files!**
  
  Windows XP: C:\\Documents and Settings\\\\My Documents\\Electronic Arts\\The Sims 3\\
  
  Windows Vista/7: C:\\Users\\\\Documents\\Electronic Arts\\The Sims 3\\
  
  Mac OS: /Users//Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 3/ 

2. In this folder, create a new folder titled Mods . Open the new Mods folder. Insert the Resource.cfg file that was included in this torrent, INTO the Mods folder.

3. Now while still in the Mods folder, create a new folder titled Packages. Place the Sims 3 Store Updates 1-19 (2009-2010).package file inside the new Packages folder.

And thats it folks!! You\'re done! All content will now show up in game! Also, you have now set your game up for any other mods! Anytime you download mods from sites like Mod The Sims, or any .package files, simply place them inside the Packages folder you just created, and that\'s it!! The mod or object will now work in game!! (Please note, modding your game is at your own risk. While files like this one will cause no harm, downloading conflicting, outdated, or corrupted core mods, or other type of mods, may damage your game. Always make sure to back up your save when adding mods, and keep mods up to date.)
