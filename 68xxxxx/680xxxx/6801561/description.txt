Perfectly capturing the wit of P.G. Wodehouse's novels, this impeccable series traces the insane shenanigans of Bertram Wooster and his faithful butler Jeeves. Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie are simply perfect in the roles of the steadfast butler Jeeves and his dapper master Wooster. Set against a 1930s backdrop of Hooray Henries and splendidly indomitable aunts, Jeeves battles against Wooster's relentless list of prospective brides to hilarious consequences! This is a simply enchanting series which has been digitally re-mastered and with over 19 hours will not fail to entertain.


Enjoy and Seed!!
