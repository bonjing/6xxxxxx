The Garden of Jane Delawney is the debut album of British folk rock band Trees. Whilst nearly every song on the album appears to be a traditional folk song, this is actually only the case for about half of them, the others having been penned for the album by front-man Bias Boshell. The title track is a particularly good example of his apparent talent for writing songs that sounded like they had existed for hundreds of years as folk songs.
