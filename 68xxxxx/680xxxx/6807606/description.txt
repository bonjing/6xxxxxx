TIBCOÂ® Architecture Fundamentals is the core book for understanding and using the TIBCO product suite. It focuses on the TIBCO ActiveMatrixÂ® product suite and a handful of the other most commonly used components, including the TIBCO Enterprise Message ServiceTM and TIBCO BusinessEventsTM. The book provides a sound basis for applying TIBCO products to solve the most common integration and SOA challenges faced by architects and developers. In addition, it lays the foundation for the more advanced books to be added to the architecture series.

 

Designed to make the material as accessible as possible, the book starts with concrete problems architects and developers face every day, showing how to solve these problems with combinations of TIBCO (and selected third-party) products. In the context of specific design scenarios, it also discusses key concepts and decision trade-offs. To accomplish its practical aims, the book 

    * Provides useful techniques for discussing and documenting architectures
    * Presents reference architectures (design patterns) for solving common SOA and system integration problems
    * Describes each problem and solution from both business process and technical perspectives
    * Supplies an overview of the typical solution roles played by different TIBCO products 

The book largely avoids the code-level detail already available in the product manuals, concentrating instead on blueprints for solving whole classes of problems.
