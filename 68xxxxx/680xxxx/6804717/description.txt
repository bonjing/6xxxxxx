This is a video power hour. It features sixty ~1 minute clips of music videos with short clips in between. Drink when the numbers show up in the bottom corner. It's got a quick intro so don't freak out just because the drinking doesn't start until ~1 minute in.

File format is .mkv for ripping efficiency and file size. If you want to play it on your xbox or something, mencoder is a good gui for creating good quality copies of other file types (avi, mpeg, whatever).

I won't list every song b/c that would take too long and ruin any surprise factor. For the purpose of deciding if you'll like the general vibe of the power hour, here are some of the artists featured (it's a mix of genres):

Red Hot Chili Peppers
Vampire Weekend
AC/DC
Hall and Oates
The Dandy Warhols
MGMT
Reel Big Fish
Tom Petty
Beck
Weezer
The Beatles
Gorillaz
Sublime
Jamiroquai
The Raconteurs
Gnarls Barkley
Kool and the Gang
Wolfmother
Led Zeppelin
Fatboy Slim
Flogging Molly
The Hives
OK Go
Tenacious D
Queen

And that should give you a good idea of the musical style.

Drink somewhat responsibly.
