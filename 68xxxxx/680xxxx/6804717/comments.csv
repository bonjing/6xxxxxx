Tried to delete the first file after I thought I screwed up the upload. Clicked red ""x"" in corner, got the warning, clicked ""ok."" Not sure if there is a delay in removal, or if I should've done something else in order to delete it.

Now that I (sort of) know what I'm doing, I shouldn't have any more double posts. Sorry again for the trouble."
