Obviously you're already quite capable of securing a copy of the Director's Cut if you're here. I'm considering all purchases to be donations. There are almost no transactional fees... unlike the (inexpensive as possible) DVD where the purchase price goes almost entirely to duplication and shipping.

So if you ""buy"" a download, whether or not you actually download it, the 2012 version will be better for it by about $3.

I'm open to any feedback on price. I figured $3 is what I'd like to pay per movie for a 1280x720 MPEG-4 DRM-free copy. And since it costs basically nothing to me I'd lower the price if I thought more people would donate. However, I suspect transactional friction out-weights the increased interest in any price under $3. Tell me if you think I'm wrong!

Thanks, -Gord"
