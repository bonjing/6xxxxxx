Intro:       THORIUM REMIX 2011 starts with a 5 minute TL;WL summary,
             to hold you over until you find your Ritalin.

Summary:     Thorium is readily available & can be turned into energy without
             generating transuranic wastes. Thorium's capacity as nuclear fuel
             was discovered during WW II, but ignored because it was unsuitable
             for making bombs. A liquid-fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR) is the
             optimal approach for harvesting energy from Thorium, and has the
             potential to solve today's energy/climate crisis. LFTR is a type
             of Thorium Molten Salt Reactor (Th-MSR). This video summarizes
             over 6 hours worth of thorium talks given by Kirk Sorensen and
             other thorium technologists.
