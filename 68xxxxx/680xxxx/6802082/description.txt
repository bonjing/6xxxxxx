Tales From The National Parks - Series 01 - TVrip - Xvid


The National Parks are Britain's most treasured landscapes, but they are increasingly becoming battlefields. They were designated 60 years ago as places for everyone, but is that still the case? In this series the award-winning filmmaker Richard Macer spent a year amid conflicts in three different parks, on a journey to discover who they are really for. 

In each park (the other two are the Peak District and Loch Lomond) the stories are very different, but there is something that unites them all - fiercely divided communities who are prepared to fight in order to preserve their right to enjoy the countryside. In each film Macer has secured access to the National Park Authority - an organisation which looks after the landscapes and decides upon planning matters. In all these stories the Park Authorities have a key role to play in trying to find amicable solutions to the problems which confront them.
