The ambition that inspired rapper and MC Baba Brinkman to transpose his performance piece â€œThe Rap Canterbury Talesâ€ to the printed page was his desire to resurrect Chaucerâ€™s brilliant stories from their vellum mausoleum into visible and audible contemporary forms that would once again delight and edify both live listening audiences and readersâ€”a rebirth of what poetry should be in its essence, and once was. Since Chaucer has become an unassailable icon of print culture, and hip-hop is an unassailable icon of contemporary digital cool, he saw this radical new fusion of content and style as the perfect medium to deliver Chaucerâ€™s astonishingly timeless message to a younger generation growing indifferent to the delights of â€œarchaicâ€ literary forms.

This fusion has produced, with both texts reproduced here on facing pages, one of the most exciting and extraordinarily fertile literary documents of our age.

The raps are presented hereâ€”along with Chaucerâ€™s original Middle English, Brinkmanâ€™s explanatory introductions, and his brother and stage manager Erikâ€™s illustrationsâ€”as the best possible way of telling the story of how these stories came about, and what they were meant to do.

A hugely successful hit at the Edinburgh Festival, Brinkman has worked with the London and Cambridge school systems, rekindling an interest among both performance-poetry fans and students in the work of â€œthe father of the English language.â€
