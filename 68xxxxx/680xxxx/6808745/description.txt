Tom Woods will be hosting today's show.

Tom's first guest is Dr. Steven Lantier, anesthesiologist and co-director of the Oklahoma Surgery Center, on how his facility is able to offer medical procedures far below market rates, and what the government can learn from their example.

The second guest is Pat Buchanan, MSNBC contributor and former Republican presidential candidate, on his new book, Suicide of a Superpower: Will America Survive to 2025?

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included

torrent named:

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
