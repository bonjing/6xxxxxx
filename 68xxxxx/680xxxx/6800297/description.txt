I guess I'm out to FLAC all the Venus long plays. Here's another, The Red Room from 2006 in FLAC -8 format.


Copying the band description from another torrent:

Venus originally started as a five-member Belgian band in 1997. They achieved moderate success in Europe for ten years, only to disband in 2007. Probably the most famous of their tracks is 'Beautiful Days' (off the album Vertigone), used in advertisements and the ending crawl for the 2004 Enki Bilal animation Immortel (ad vitam).

The Red Room, released in 2006 turned out to be the final Venus long play. It sounds markedly different from the earlier pop-indie albums of the band.
