Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On this Tuesday, November 8 edition of the Alex Jones Show: An exclusive interview with Jesse Ventura, who will talk about further details of his lawsuit case against the TSA. 

Alex also talks with broadcaster, film-maker, and former equities broker Max Keiser about the Greek debt crisis and its ramifications for Europe and the world economy as a whole. Keiser has made a number of predictions that have come to pass, including the 2008 collapse of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the break-down of Iceland's economy in 2008, and that sub-prime mortgage-backed securities would be the cause of recession in 2008. 

Alex covers the latest breaking news and runs down the latest on the prospect of war in the Middle East as speculation continues over an Israeli attack launched against Iran.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
