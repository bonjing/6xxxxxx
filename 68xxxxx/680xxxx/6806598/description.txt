A Hard Nights Day: A History Of Stiff Records
45 Classic Singles

MP3 VBR 0 with full ID3.1 and ID3.2 tags

Another long-deleted classic compilation from my collection, this is a 2CD overview of some of the brilliant, classic, eclectic and in a couple of cases downright weird singles that Stiff Records released in its heyday.

Among the hits by Ian Dury, Elvis Costello, Madness, Jona Lewie, Lene Lovich and Department S, you'll find the first Stiff single, Nick Lowe's So It Goes, and what's often hailed as the first Punk single - New Rose by The Damned.

Check out some great covers - Dave Stewart's sparse electronic collaborations on It's My Party and what Becomes Of The Brokenhearted (both surprise smash hits), Kirsty MacColl's definitive version of A New England by Billy Bragg, Rachel Sweet's B-A-B-Y and Lene Lovich's I Think We're Alone Now.

A classic "two fingers to my former record company" song (see also Workin for MCA by Lynyrd Skynrd, and EMI by the Sex Pistols) is Mercury Poisoning by Graham Parker & The Rumour.

Finally there are quite a few "radio hits", songs that got lots of airplay but somehow failed to make much of a dent in the charts, including Loud Music In Cars, Furniture's Brilliant Mind, and The Untouchables' Free Yourself.

If you like this then let me know, and the 4CD Stiff Box Set could be next!

Remember if it's Stiff it's a hit!
