""This is the end of today's lesson.  When you continue with the next unit tomorrow, please begin with track number 2.""

This is confusing.  It seems to be saying to go back and listen to lesson 2 again. In fact, I originally took this to mean I should repeat all the lessons 2-5!  Wrong!  It means track 2 on that CD, that is, Lesson 6.

Just do them all in order, and only repeat if you're not getting at least 80% of the answers right."
