Lethal Weapon 3 is a 1992 American action film directed by Richard Donner and starring Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci, Rene Russo and Stuart Wilson.
It is a sequel to Lethal Weapon and Lethal Weapon 2, and it is part of the Lethal Weapon film series.

LAPD Sergeants Martin Riggs (Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Glover) arrive at an evacuated building believed to have a bomb in it.
Against orders, they go inside to investigate the bomb. Riggs decides to deactivate the bomb himself instead of waiting for the Bomb Squad to arrive.
Unfortunately, he causes the bomb to detonate and the whole building to collapse.
This causes them to be demoted to uniform duties, which upsets Murtaugh because he only has seven days until retirement.
While on street patrol, the two stumble upon the attempted hijacking of an armored car and successfully put a halt to it, although they only manage to catch one of the two would-be hijackers.
For their efforts in stopping the raid, Riggs and Murtaugh are reinstated as Detectives by their superior, Captain Murphy (Kahan).
Murphy introduces internal affairs Sergeant Lorna Cole (Russo) to the two detectives and informs them that the suspect they have in custody from the hijacking is a known associate of former LAPD Lieutenant and suspected arms dealer: Jack Travis (Wilson)...
