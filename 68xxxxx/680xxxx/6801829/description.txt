Hmm....Crack for this is not working as it is suppose to yet so there some problem with saving your graphic setting, for example your resolution won't save properly and make mw3 looks like shit-fare3 well here is a temporary fix for this problem until the proper crack is released..

1-Copy "config.cfg" into players2 folder
2-Open "config.cfg" with notepage and search for "seta r_mode" and change resolution to your liking( You can't change it in game menu since it will just change every other setting to a shitty one..


In this setting:

-8 multi-sampling instead of 4
-Improved image quality and physic
-Anysotrop to 16x max and 8x min
-some other..

Well I hope this help, and happy gaming:)
