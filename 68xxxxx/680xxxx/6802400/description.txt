Doctor Who - Complete - 1st Doctor - William Hartnell (1963â€“1967)

First Doctor

The first incarnation of The Doctor was portrayed by William Hartnell. During Hartnell's tenure, the Doctor visited a mixture of stories set in the future and in historical events that had no extraterrestrial influence, such as fifteenth century Mesoamerica. In his last story, The Tenth Planet, the Doctor gradually grew weaker to the point of collapsing at the end of the fourth episode, leading to his regeneration.
