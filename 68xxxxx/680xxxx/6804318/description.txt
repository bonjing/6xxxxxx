        Baghdad, the playground for the rich and infamous, where anything can 
	be bought - but for a price. This is Uday Hussein's world and with his 
	depraved lust for debauchery and immorality, he helps himself to 
	whatever turns him on. When army lieutenant Latif Yahia is summoned to 
	Saddam's palace, he is faced with an impossible request - 
	to be Uday's 'fiday' - his body double, or have his family condemned to death. 
	In a world entrenched in betrayal and corruption, knowing who to trust 
	becomes a matter of life or death for Latif, as he battles to escape from 
	his forced existence.
