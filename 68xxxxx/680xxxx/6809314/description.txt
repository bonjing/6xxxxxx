Not many people would feel comfortable up on stage sitting all alone in the spotlight, but for Cody Diekhoff it's just another day at the office. Also known as the Chicago Farmer, central Illinoisan Diekhoff is continually making a name for himself as one of the Midwest's strongest songwriters. 
Somethin' Else is a small collection of some new songs mixed with a few well-traveled Chicago Farmer classics. "For Dad (Pool Song)" is a celebratory ode to Diekhoff's late father and sets the EP's tone with its introspective spirit, yet the EP's revelry is constant. Fans may recognize "It's Alright," "Mackinaw Girl," and "Queen," but can pleasantly be surprised to hear those songs freshly minted with the Henhouse Prowlers' support. "Victoria Walker" is a meditation on racism and childhood in the grand tradition of protest songs, similar to Bob Dylan's "Only a Pawn in Their Game" by way of Neil Young's wail and John Prine's off-putting friendliness.
