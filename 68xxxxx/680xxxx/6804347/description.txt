This is from the WB DVD Archive that they create it made to order only.  It is in widescreen and I have not altered the image quality.  It is my first Torrent. 

It contains the VOB, IFO, and BUP files.  There is a JPEG of the dvd cover as well.

The case says that this disc will play on some dvd players, but not all, and it may not play on PC's.  I had no problem playing it on my Xbox360 or ripping it on my laptop. So I doubt you will have any problems.

PLEASE SEED THIS ONCE YOU DOWNLOAD!!!! I have crappy wireless and I don't know how reliable it will be if I seed it.

Synopsis:

George Segal, Jacqueline Bisset and Robert Morley top the bill of fare in this food- and fun-filled mystery garnished with wit. Segal plays a glib fast-food tycoon and Bisset is his ex-wife, a pastry chef who may become the last course in an enigmatic killerâ€™s banquet of death. Morley has a tasty field day as an acerbic gourmet magazine publisher whose cascading series of chins and stomachs bear witness to his love of fine dining. But the mogulâ€™s doctors have ordered him to give up his favorite dishes â€“ and one by one the chefs who create those dishes are slain in the manner of their specialties. Phillipe Noiret, Jean-Pierre Cassel and Jean Rochefort give delicious support, as does a mouth-watering array of wild mushrooms, plump pigeons, shiny artichokes, rich chocolate and more gastronimical delights. Dig in!
