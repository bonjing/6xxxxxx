Skrewdriver - 1st White Rider Studio Session 87 contains extremely rare songs recorded during Skrewdriver\'s first \"White Rider\" studio session. As incredible as these songs are, Ian and the boys were not satisfied, so they went back into the studio a few weeks later and re-recorded the tracks for the officially released \"White Rider\" album. No fan of Ian Stuart or Skrewdriver will want to leave this compact disc out of their collection, it\'s an absolute must-own!
