                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Family and friends pay tribute to the funnyman, who was one of Britain's      
 best-loved stars of stage, TV and film for more than 50 years - and also      
 became a cult figure in Albania, where his films were ruled to be acceptable  
 entertainment during the country's long years of isolation during the Cold    
 War. Including contributions by Norman's son Nick, singer Vera Lynn and       
 actress Honor Blackman.                                                       
                                                                               
                                 Enjoy!
