This is a full backup of the KarlaTurner.org memorial website.   The internal links are broken and you will need to click each actual file to view the individual articles etc.

If circumstances permit I will post a fixed version of the site later.

Please keep seeding so this doesn't die out, the information is too important.  Also please search out and save the video files from YouTube and post them elsewhere.
