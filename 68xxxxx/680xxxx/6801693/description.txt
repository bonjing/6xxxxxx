                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Three British families experience Greece's financial crisis first-hand,       
 discovering the tax, pension and work practices that have landed the country  
 in so much trouble. Participants include a 54-year-old hairdresser, who would 
 already be entitled to retire on a pension equivalent to 90 per cent of her   
 final salary, because her job is on a list of 600 defined as hazardous. 
      
                                 Enjoy!
