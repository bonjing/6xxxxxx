The Lost Notebooks of Hank Williams is a studio album by various artists.
Country music singer Hank Williams died at age 29 on January 1, 1953. Police
officers found in his car along with his body the lyrics for songs yet to be
recorded. In 2006, a janitor of Sony/ATV Music Publishing found on a 
dumpster of the company the notes and tried to sell them to different road
shows failing, the unfinished lyrics were later returned to Sony/ATV, that
handed them to Bob Dylan in 2008 to complete and record them. Dylan recorded
the album with the collaboration of various other artists. The album was
