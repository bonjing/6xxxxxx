In 1768 King George III of England orders an ambitious expedition to the Pacific Ocean to observe the transit of Venus and to see the mythical Southern Continent. James Cook, an unknown petty officer, is controversially appointed as commander, choosing an unlikely collier to carry him and his men into dangerous and unknown waters. After sailing to Tahiti, where the eclipse proves disappointing, Cook proceeds to chart the coasts of New Zealand,various Pacific islands and Australia beginning a glorious adventure spanning the oceans of the world.Made principally on location, using a full-size replica of the 'Endeavour' (built for the Australian bicentenary), this has a salty atmosphere lacking from many historial 'sea dramas'. Michell's performance as the titular Yorkshireman has also been praised for its complexity
