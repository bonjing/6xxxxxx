Information
------------------------------

Topical programme which taps into the nation's obsession with the weather, predicting what another extreme cold snap would spell for Britain's economy as it puts the science of weather forecasting to the test and asks the experts what we are in store for between now and spring. Can forecasters give us advance warning this time around? How does the 'olde' weather lore compare with the supercomputers? And what are we doing across Britain to prepare ourselves as we head into winter?
