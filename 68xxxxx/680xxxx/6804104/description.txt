Hi there..

Due to strange circumstances my 'verifire' -account is off limits to me, and I've gotten no help from staff here, so I made this '_temporary' account to be able to write a comment explaining this.

The rest of my uploads are here:

..Buuut I've just got to let you have this upload, even though my account seems hijacked.. ..or should I say captured on open seas..? ;-)

Anyway; the book is just too good. But all of Gray's material is mindblowing, so that's no surprise..

"Sir Edward Clarke, K.C., wrote:

{Quote}
"As a lawyer, I have made a prolonged study of the
evidences for the events of the first Easter Day. To
me the evidence is conclusive, and over and over
again in the High Court, I have secured the verdict
on evidence not nearly so compelling."

(Wilbur M.A. Smith, A Great Certainty in This Hour of World Crises.
Wheaton: Van Kampen Press, 1951, p.14)"

And that sort of sums it up, but not quite.
Read the book if you're alive. If not, it's your loss, and I don't want your loss..
