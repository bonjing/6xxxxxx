I thought long and hard about resurecting my Jam collection of studio albums form the closet.Now that after some 20 years or so I had forgotten how influential this group was and has been on my life.I have listened to them all again and it has evoked some stirring memories.If there is a positive like of this group I will put the rest up.

In the City was the debut album of British mod revival/punk rock band The Jam. It was released in 1977 by Polydor Records and featured the hit single and title track "In the City".

Weller's guitar style on the album is very much influenced by Wilko Johnson and Pete Townshend.

The album includes two cover songs, "Slow Down" and the theme to the 1960s television series, Batman, the latter of which had also been previously covered by The Who.

Upon the album's release, In The City received all-round positive reviews. Phil McNeil from the NME said Weller's songwriting "captures that entire teen frustration vibe with the melodic grace and dynamic aplomb of early Kinks and Who". Brian Harrigan of Melody Maker was equally impressed, proclaiming that "[t]he Weller composed songs are anything but an embarrassement, he has a deft touch that places his material on a much higher plateau". In the Record Mirror, Barry Cain wrote, "[a]rmed and extremely dangerous The Jam stalk the decrepit grooves. If you don't like them, hard luck they're gonna be around for a long time. It's been a long time since albums actually reflected pre-20 delusions and this one does".
