,surr3pt1t10us,2012-05-08T02:37Z,I downloaded this file and tried using it on a file  to get the password. While running the brute force attack my computer rebooted and now I can't install ANY operating system onto it; Linux or Windows. I have tried everything and either the screen will go blank or my PC restarts.
