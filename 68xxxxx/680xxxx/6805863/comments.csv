ostb25 - Should I follow you around and ask you why the things you do take so long?  I have a life buddy... uploading the show is not always my top priority.   Some days it will be late as I am busy but it always goes up the day of the show and I have never missed one.

Cut my some slack ass wipe.  Jesus christ."
