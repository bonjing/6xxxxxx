OpenOffice Calc is the most powerful and widespread open source spreadsheet application in existence. It is the only real alternative to Excel. Jacek Artymiak is widely regarded as the authority on OpenOffice Calc. He takes you, step by step, from the interface and handling Calc files to working with data sources small and large.

Beginning OpenOffice Calc allows you to gain confidence in the considered use of statistical formulas, but does not assume familiarity with another spreadsheet application.
