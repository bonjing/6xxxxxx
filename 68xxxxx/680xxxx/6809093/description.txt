"Wednesday's Child"

When a young boy is found dead at an upscale 
preschool, Jane (Maria Bello) and Calderon (Kirk 
Acevedo) work to find out if it was an accident 
or homicide. Rivera (Elizabeth Rodriguez) calls 
on Duffy (Brian F. O'Byrne) to keep her company 
while working a robbery case. Meanwhile, Jane 
uses a personal experience from her past to 
solve the crime.
