If I'm not at the table playing looking at my own cards, watching without seeing what they're playing is like watching paint dry, and frankly there's nothing to learn from it. For example: I always play a tight game. I can read the cards and other players very well and I usually win. However, I rarely bet the pot blind that much, but after watching this season I started changing that. Better to get players out of it before the flop, right? I still pay to see the flop sometimes, even if I have garbage, but I won't do it if someone else goes in too deep beforehand. "
