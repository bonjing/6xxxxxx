\\\\\\\"The first comprehensive expose on damage dogs and their families suffer from excessive crating, both in puppy mills and private homes. Caged Love reveals that many owners who buy their dogs rhinestone collars and call them â€œbabiesâ€ also lock them in cages for 18-23 a day. And although â€œcrate trainingâ€ is proven to cause hundreds of physical, emotional and social problems and is a poor method for behavior and housetraining, dog industry â€œexpertsâ€ and related special interests, motivated by $50 Billion in greed, are attempting to persuade America that â€œdogs love cratesâ€. Free of emotional bias, Caged Love reveals the true risks of home dog crating. The book details scientific and neurologic research, expert opinions and true case studies that demonstrate predictable symptoms caused by excessive crating. These include: fear, aggression, lower IQ, â€œkennel crazeâ€, â€œdoggie autismâ€ (dislike of touch and failure to bond with humans) and even the tendency to attack.
