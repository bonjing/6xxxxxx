Today weâ€™re moving Trillian 5.1 for Windows out of the labs and into release status! Trillian 5.1 is the first version of Trillian to be officially â€œplugged into Skypeâ€ courtesy of the great new SkypeKit for Desktop. This means you can run Skype directly inside of Trillian without having to keep the original client running! Trillian 5.1 also features a modernized activity history viewer, the ability to send pictures on all services, and a bunch of other great features and important bugfixes.

Trillian 5.1 introduces:
Native Skype integration.
A refreshed chat history design.
The ability to send images on all chat services.
AIM and ICQ plugin updates.
Twitter user streams and other misc new features.
A host of other minor bugfixes and improvements.

UPDATE: Another build, 15, to fix this morningâ€™s AIM/IMAP crash.
