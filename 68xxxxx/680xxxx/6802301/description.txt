Native Instruments Massive 1.3

Tested and working.

This is not an update. It is the complete synth so please uninstall any previous versions.

What's new:
- New preset browser with 4 columns: Bankname, Type, Subtype, Mode
- Changed preset file format - files are now called .nmsv
- Batch file conversion from .ksd to .nmsv added to File menu
- Import option for single .ksd files added to File menu
- File open/save only works with .nmsv files files from now
- Plugin states will be recalled in host, but saved in new format
=&gt; reopening projects saved with Massive 1.3 will require 1.3 or higher

The new file-name extension means that you'll have to batch convert all the ksd patches. This does not delete or change your old ksd patches - it leaves them intact. Run the batch convert in stand-alone mode.
