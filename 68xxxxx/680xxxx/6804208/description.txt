Antarctica, 1931: An expedition team is found dead at the foot of a mad and mysterious mountain range. Only a young student is missing. The polar researcher Lynn Morgan follows his tracks to find out what has happened to him. Has he fallen victim to insanity?During their trek to the other side of the mountains, Lynn and her mentor, the renowned Professor William Dyer, make a discovery that seems to bring all previous beliefs into question: A fallen thousand-year-old city, its monumental structures and epic secrets frozen in eternal ice. None of Dyerâ€™s hypotheses can explain the cityâ€™s existence: Who or what haunts this place? Is it the creation of an unknown primitive people? Ancient Spirits? Or worse... A stunning adventure based on the masterful novel by H. P. Lovecraft. An expedition into a mysterious past. Take a dive into this fantastic journey and discover the terrors lurking around in the Mountains of Madness.
