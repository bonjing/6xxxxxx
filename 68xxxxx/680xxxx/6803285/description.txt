MYRIAD WAREZ -- Understanding Finance Collection v. 1.0

MYRIAD WAREZ presents a new set of projects. We are releasing collections of 
books, journal articles, and other documents on a range on important topics in
pure and applied mathematics. Each collection will have a wide selection of 
literature, much of it from behind paywalls or brand new MYRIAD scans.

Our first release in this series is on Understanding Finance. Everyone cares 
more about finance nowadays - and we're making sure that you can get hold of
the information you need to study and understand it properly.

Whether you're learning stochastic calculus to get a job in finance, trying to
grok the system from the outside in order to bring it down, or just curious 
about all the stories in that section of the paper you used to flick past, 
you will find something here for you.

The 'introductory' folder has some basic books that tell you what finance is,
what the stock market is, what derivatives are, and some of the economics you
might need to understand all of this. If you got this far, check out the 
encyclopedias and dictionaries of financial terms in the 'reference' folder.

The 'financial_system' folder has much more detail about the workings of Wall 
Street, financial markets, and financial products. Check out the subfolders on
'banks' with articles about Goldman Sachs, quants and the shadow banking system,
and 'derivatives', which has a lot of technical and nontechnical information
about credit derivatives.

The folder '2008_crisis' brings together a lot of information about the credit
crisis, its causes and effects. One ideal starting place is 'The Giant Pool
of Money', the transcript of an NPR radio show about how mortgages were 
mis-sold to consumers and investors alike. There are sections on auto industry
bankruptcies, banks, quants and default correlation. Check out the articles 
taken from ProPublica which have gone further than anyone else to unpick the
deals between banks and hedge funds that fueled the mortgage boom.

Last but definitely not least is the 'math' folder. Here we have a huge number
of books and articles on many aspects of financial math, at all levels from
introductory to recent research into advanced financial engineering. Along
with subfolders on stochastic calculus, Monte Carlo methods, statistics, 
credit derivatives, there is a huge collection of books and articles about
various aspects of Brownian motion. Check out the 'heterodox' section which
includes Mandelbrot's papers on finance and another book discussing how his
ideas differ from mainstream financial theory.

We are growing this collection actively and look forward to releasing many more
books and papers in future versions to have the most useful torrent possible.
Please send us any book scans, articles from behind paywalls, or other
documents you have that could belong in the next version of this torrent. 

Full list of files is in 'filelist'.

MYRIAD WAREZ is the world's foremost release group for mathematical warez.
