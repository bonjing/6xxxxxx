Curley Bridges Keys To The Blues
Recorded: April 16 1998
Released: June 17 2011
Label: Electro-Fi Records
Format:Mp3@320



"Keys to the Blues" is Curley Bridges' first release as a frontman since he all but gave up recording in 1961 after receiving his one and only royalty check for just $62.20. Thankfully, Bridges, who played piano and sang with the Motley Crew from 1953 to 1966, was recently persuaded to reconsider. "Keys to the Blues" will make you glad that he did. From the moment the band comes crashing in on "You Talk Too Much," right through to the closing bars of "Three Oâ€™clock Blues," this is an album that will keep you interested and entertained throughout.
