Energetic- Electric Blues that begs you to react!! Energized audiences, moving and shouting along with the newly rediscovered voice from the Chicago Blues scene.

In a time when musical groups come and go as quickly as the rapid-fire images on MTV, three Chicago area men have stayed true to their blues roots for over 38 years. While Blue Plate Special has consistently brought new contemporary blues songs to the worldwide blues community, what hasnâ€™t changed is their friendship, collaboration and passion for the Blues. This Chicago based trioâ€™s sheer enjoyment in performing together shines through each and every night!!

Since the release of their 3 most recent CDâ€™s 1998's â€œNo Place To Fadeâ€ 2000's The Blues Ainâ€™t Pretty and 2007's Can You Dig It !â€, Blue Plate Special has had 24 songs hit the #1 chart position on Blues Radio stations around the world !!


This album is so shithot that even thermite could not raise the temperature higher!!!


If you love blues and you don't download this one...then you're a waste of fuckin' space.
