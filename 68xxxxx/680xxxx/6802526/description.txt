    It is one of Wales's busiest holiday resorts, where        
    people work hard during the summer to feast or famine     
    in the winter.                                           
    This new series follows a week in the life of the         
    people who make Tenby tick. Malcolm and Pat take on the    
    challenge of a coach party of holiday makers and their    
    hotel renovation. On the beach the lifeguards are in     
    action as they treat a casualty with a weever fish        
    sting. Traffic Enforcement Officer Barbara Powrie tries    
    to keep the streets traffic free and the firemen of       
    Tenby put on a carnival for the holiday makers to enjoy.

     We noted that the HD version has a different duration    
     to that of the SD version, we can only assume the BBC   
     have re-edited this for the HD transmission as we have   
     no transmission errors.
