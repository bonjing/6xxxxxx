the other deluxe version on this site is mislabeled/missing files, heres a legit release from scene group!!
as always SUPER FAST DOWNLOAD

NOTE: i swear i heard there would be 2 more bonus tracks my guess is those are ITUNES bonus tracks, and as u can see itunes leaks are hard to get until closer to legit release, i have thought uploaded the raw itunes regular version of this cd thou, lets wait week or so till we see more tracks
