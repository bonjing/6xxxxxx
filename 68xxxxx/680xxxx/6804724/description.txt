Plot

Somethings can't be buried. Every once in a while a thriller comes along that gets under your skin, churns your guts and leaves you gasping for air Chopper did it. So did Two Hands, Lantana and Noise. Now Australia has produced a new thriller that packs the same raw emotional punch. First time feature Director Nash Edgerton and his brother- writer and star- Joel Edgerton, have crafted an intense, brooding and provocative film noir laced with moral corruption and lit with a slow burning fuse... What happens when seemingly good people do bad deeds, how far will they go to protect what's theirs, to what extremes will they resort to bury the truth? Featuring a powerhouse ensemble cast, the Edgerton Brothers take you to a dark and gritty world where no-one is who they seem and everyone has a price
