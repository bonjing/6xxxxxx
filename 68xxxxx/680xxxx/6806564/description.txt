The malformed mayhem continues as a group of reality game show contestants descend into the West Virginia wilderness in order to participate in an apocalypse-themed game show, only to be brutally killed off by a deranged clan of redneck cannibals. Dale Murphy (Henry Rollins) is a former special forces soldier who now hosts a reality game show in which contestants must struggle to survive in the wilderness with few resources and only their wits to guide them. After the members of the group are split up into partners, they are sent into the woods to locate supplies that have been strategically hidden by the show's producers. Should they fail to achieve this and various other tasks, they will be sent back to civilization in shame while the others vie for substantial cash prize. But the cameras aren't the only things watching as the competition heats up, because within these woods dwells a terrifying secret. Later, as the day goes on and the body count begins to multiply, both the contestants and the hard-nosed host must fight to avoid becoming the catch of the day for a family of hungry backwoods cannibals.
