For you Grizzly Bear fans out there, this is a little gem.
This album was released a few years ago only on vinyl.
However, a few demo CD's were made available to some Record Stores.
After some hard digging, I located a copy on Ebay.
So, this is NOT a vinyl rip. 
The original demo CD encoded in FLAC.
Pristine quality.
Enjoy and please SEED !!!
