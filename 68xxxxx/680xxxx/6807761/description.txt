The understanding of electron density as the carrier of all the information of a multielectronic system is implicit in the theorems of density functional theory. Information theoretical based measures giving a quantitative understanding of statistical complexity of such systems is shaping up as a new area of research in chemical physics. This book is the first monograph of its kind covering the aspects of complexity measure in atoms and molecules.
