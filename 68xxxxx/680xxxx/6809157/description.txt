"Getting to Know You"

When Whitney (Whitney Cummings) and 
Alex (Chris D'Elia) go on a double date 
with Roxanne (Rhea Seehorn), Whitney is 
surprised to learn that Alex had a full 
life before he met her. In an effort to 
do more things together, they decide to 
play a friendly game of basketball, but 
things go awry and a sore loser emerges 
shocking the gang. Meanwhile, Lily (Zoe 
Lister-Jones) thinks that she will win 
Neal's (Maulik Pancholy) mother over by 
embracing his Indian heritage, but she 
takes it to a whole other level.
