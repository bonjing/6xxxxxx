I have finally found all of them, and tidied them up.

Gridlock and Blindfaith are retail (Bought myself)
Chart Throb was a retail azw file converted to ePub
This Other Eden and Melton appear to be retail but I had to give them both a table of contents.

All the rest I have found around and tidied up, fixing some of the mistakes and etc.
Stark
Dead Famous
Past Mortem
The First Casualty
Blast From The Past
High Society
Inconceivable
Popcorn

-- a result of me being a perfectionist
I have not yet proof read all of these thoroughly however, I doubt any spelling errors are major.

Also I can't remember where I found the high quality covers but I can't find better than those anywhere else.


Enjoy and Seed!!
