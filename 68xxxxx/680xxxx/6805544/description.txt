AllMusic Review
by Matt Collar
Spanning what is largely considered blues vocalist Jimmy Witherspoon's most fertile and important period between 1945 and 1951, Urban Blues Singing Legend is a superb four-disc box set that features most of the iconic post-war blues artist's best cuts. Witherspoon was a versatile performer who could move deftly from robust jump blues "shouters" to more laid-back and urbanely soulful ballads. Here you get both sides of Witherspoon as he is backed by such equally legendary musicians as tenor saxophonist Ben Webster, pianist Bill Doggett, and others. Included here are such tracks as his 1949 R&B hit with Jay McShann's band "Ain't Nobody's Business, Pts. 1 & 2" as well as such live hits as "Big Fine Girl" and "No Rollin' Blues" from the '50s., Urban Blues Singing Legend is easily the definitive collection of one of the definitive artists of postwar rockin' blues.
