I remember Godfall mostly for the Artwork and Covers (Talent Caldwell and the sadly deceased Micheal Turner, respectively). It's a pity that the Superman writing became so very... let's call it obscure in a way. (I'm thinking about that ""Camelot Falls"" stuff...)
Apart from some of the Batman/Superman stories, ""For Tomorrow"" by Azzarello and Lee was the last Superman story I could get into."
