his book is the perfect starting point for any newcomer to the field of forensic science. It examines the entire process of conducting forensic science, from the collection of evidence at the crime scene, through the examination of that evidence, to the presentation of scientific findings in court. The book is scientifically rigorous but written in a friendly and engaging style making it the ideal companion for undergraduate students beginning a forensic science course; as background for MSc students; as a reference for related professions such as lawyers or police officers; or simply for the casual reader who wants to learn more about this fascinating area.
From the Back Cover

From reviews of the first edition:

'I recommend this book to all first-year forensic science students, but it also has something to say to those in more advanced years and even postgraduates. Lawyers, scene of crime investigators and police officers should also find this book of considerable interest.' 
Professor Brian Caddy, Former President of the Forensic Science Society â€“ review for Education in Chemistry, Royal Society of Chemistry

'The authors convey serious messages in a rigorous but accessible and engaging manner. I would thoroughly recommend this text as an educational resource for all those teaching the early stages of courses incorporating forensic science and as an insightful and well-organised summary for those they teach.'
Professor Robert Hillman, Leicester University -  review for Higher Education Academy, Physical Sciences Centre
