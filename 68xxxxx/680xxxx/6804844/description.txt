           Somethings can't be buried

           Every once in a while  a thriller comes along that  gets under
           your skin, churns  your guts and  leaves you gasping  for air.
           Chopper did it. So did Two Hands, Lantana and Noise.

           Now Australia has produced a new thriller that packs the  same
           raw emotional punch. First time feature Director Nash Edgerton
           and his brother- writer and star- Joel Edgerton, have  crafted
           an  intense, brooding  and provocative  film noir  laced with
           moral  corruption and  lit with  a slow  burning fuse...  What
           happens when seemingly good people do bad deeds, how far  will
           they go to protect what's  theirs, to what extremes will  they
           resort  to bury  the truth?  Featuring a  powerhouse ensemble
           cast, the  Edgerton Brothers  take you  to a  dark and  gritty
           world where no-one is who they seem and everyone has a price.
