 Zechs Marquise, which began in 2004, are based out of El Paso Texas.  The band have been relentless touring machines and have gained a reputation for quirky, energetic, and music-focused performances.  They are currently touring the US in support of RX Bandits and Dredg.  While the bill might seem a strange fit, Marquiseâ€™s unique prog-groove sound melds quite well with the lumbering neo-prog of Dredg and is a nice counterpart to RX Banditsâ€™s ska-punk sound.Zechs Marquiseâ€™s sophomore release is entitled Our Delicate Stranded Nightmare, a perfect prog album title.  The record was originally released digitally through Alpha Pup Records, but the band decided to release the physical CD through their own label, Rodriguez Lopez Productions.Our Delicate Stranded Nightmare is comprised of 15 tracks which are interesting, unique, winding, and occasionally a little dull.The stronger tracks are dense sonic experiments, with an infectious, memorable underpinning of hazy funk-ified rhythms.  Some songs get too â€œnoodlyâ€ and esoteric for some ears, even those, like mine, attuned to the complex patterns of shifting time signatures and start/stop tempo changes.  The songs donâ€™t venture into prog-length journeys; the longest track clocks in at a reasonable 8:03.  The music has a uniquely melodic feel at times, though comparisons to The Mars Volta are going to be inevitable.  All in all itâ€™s a decent if not explosive release.
