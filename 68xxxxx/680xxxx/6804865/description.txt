        One day, your luck runs out...

        1902... the Australian Federation is one year old. 12 year-old
        Tom's beloved father Nat has dragged him and his sister  Sarah
        to an isolated farm at the  edge of the bush. But Nat's  dream
        of living off the land has  died and he is losing his  grip on
        sanity.  When  three  ex-soldiers arrive  at  their  cabin one
        night, Tom, like his father, believes they are providence.

        "Your mother always said  never turn away strangers,  they may
        be angels in disguise..."

        But  their presence  becomes more  menacing when  one of  them
        reveals he has a secret: he's found gold. As the lure of  gold
        infects everyone around him, the cabin becomes a psychological
        battleground in  which Tom's  loyalty is  put to  the ultimate
        test.
