Release Notes....: There is a pretty decent glitch at 1:30:35 which was 7 frames in length.  There is
                   some dialog loss from the commentators but who really gives a shit what they're
                   saying most of the time anyway, right?  There is no loss of game play which is
                   most important.  We waited 4 days hoping someone else would pre from a clean cap
                   but it doesn't look like that's going to happen.
