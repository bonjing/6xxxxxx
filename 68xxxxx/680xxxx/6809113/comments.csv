re it to then you can't have played a lot of games. 

The game is like a cross between Diablo and The Witcher. It's basically hack'n'slash, and the loot, weapons, and armor systems are similar to Diablo. The view of your character is similar to The Witcher, the timing and type of your attacks matter, and you can block and dodge.

This is a great game for co-op play (Tunngle baby), but slightly bland and generic for single player. "
