  How does a worldwide recession affect a waster, a workshy scrounger,  
  a freeloading sponger like Rab C Nesbitt? In a hard-hitting,          
  face-to-face interview, John Sergeant travels to Govan to             
  interrogate the man behind the string vest. Supported by clips of     
  Rab's finest and funniest moments, as well as testimonials from his   
  closest friends and family, John gets under the skin of one of        
  Britain's best-loved layabouts.                                       
                                                                        
  A short film of Gregor being interviewed in character as Rab C        
  Nesbitt.
