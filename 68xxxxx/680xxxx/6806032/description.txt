Song of the Petalars

While traveling through the woods, the ThunderCats come across a group of Petalars - small plant-like creatures whose lifespans are only one day. Lion-O befriends the young Emrick as he and the others try to figure out a way out of the woods and return the Petalars to their home. Meanwhile, Slithe and his lizard army are hot on the ThunderCats' trail to eliminate them.
