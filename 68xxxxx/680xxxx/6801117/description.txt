This high definition video is formatted using AVCHD for DVD. The video is uncropped 1080p AVC X264 obviously re-encoded from the VC1 source. The audio is DTS without the HD. The added overhead for the DTS HD material would have taken away much of the video quality since the DVD disk only holds about 8GB. The DTS sound quality is great, and the H264 video is spectacular. It will play in most BluRay Disk players if burned to a double layered DVD-R disk using UDP2.5. Copy the BDMV folder and its contents into the root of the compilation. Don\'t forget to tell the buring software to use UDP 2.5! You can also burn to a BD disk if you prefer.
