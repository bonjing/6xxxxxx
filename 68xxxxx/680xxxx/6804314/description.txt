This entry in Cave's long-running top-down shooter series boats the
same classic 2D top-down shooter gameplay, gigantic explosions
massive bossess, and an arcade-style long view. Once again, the
DonPachi Corps is sent out to combat swarms of enemies. Players can
choose to be one of a number of "Elemental Daughters" in the game, and
there are a variety of gameplay systems including power-ups (weapons
can be switched at a button press between Normal and Boost mode) as
well as Hype-Counters and Laser Counters
