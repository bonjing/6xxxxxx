                                I Am David (2003)


This is the story of 12-year-old David, who alone manages to escape from Communist concentration camp. With no other possessions than a compass, some bread and a letter he has been instructed to deliver to an address in Copenhagen, he finds himself for the first time in his life on the other side of the barbed wire fence. Where Copenhagen is he does not know and therefore also that he has to cross half of Europe to get there.

Alone and destitute, with no other knowledge about the world than to say the sentence "My name is David" he goes on a journey through Europe
