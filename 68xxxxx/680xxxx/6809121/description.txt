Ridin' Dirty (1996)





Southern gangsta rappers Pimp C and Bun B formed UGK (aka Underground Kingz) in the late '80s and signed to Jive Records for their major-label debut album, 1992's Too Hard to Swallow. After second album Super Tight..., UGK hit the R&B charts with 1996's Ridin' Dirty, which ascended to the number two spot. Dirty Money followed in late 2001. Pimp C began serving at three-year jail sentence in early 2002, putting UGK on ice until 2007, when the double album Underground Kingz appeared.
