    Iolo looks at Wales's mineral wealth, finding out how      
    it has been exploited and how it has affected the land    
    and the creatures who live there. With stunning          
    location photography, he goes underground to explore an   
    impressive disused quarry that at its height employed      
    500 men, sees how lapwings are thriving amongst one of    
    the largest industrial sites in south Wales, and shows   
    how the abandoned railway lines and canals of the         
    industrial era are now wonderful wildlife habitats.
