Theresa (Stormy Daniels) and Sam (Marcus London) have been married for almost ten years and lately things haven't been as they once were. He seems distant and she suspects there is someone else. At the nudging of her best friends (India Summer and Raylene), Theresa hires a beautiful escort (Andy San Dimas) to tempt her husband and test his faithfulness. But even her wildest suspicions could not prepare Theresa for the outcome of this decision. Follow award-winning writer/director Stormy Daniels on this twisted tale of torrid affairs, deceit, and of course wicked sex!
