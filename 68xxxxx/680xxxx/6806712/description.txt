Unzip this file directly to the root of a USB drive and then double click either "START-EDUKE32-HRP.cmd" or "START OLD DUKE3D.cmd". You should be able to play either game out of the box (or off of the USB) on ANY Windows machine. They run on my home 64-bit 7 install and my work XP box.

The zipfile contains:

* A "dosbox" directory which contains a version of dosbox that has been tweaked for portable use and to play this game.

* A "duke3d" directory which has two sub-directories- "DUKE3D" and "eduke" which contain the respective Duke Nukem 3D program files.

* "autorun.inf" just so you get the Duke icon with your USB drive in "My Computer".

* The two batch files mentioned above- "START-EDUKE32-HRP.cmd" & "START OLD DUKE3D.cmd" You should only need to clock one of these to play.

I used the shareware "DUKE3D.GRP" file out of respect for the developers. You can download the full version from the 3drealms web site for less than $6, or be a cheap-ass pirate and get it from this site (TPB). Here is a link for the $5.99 download:
