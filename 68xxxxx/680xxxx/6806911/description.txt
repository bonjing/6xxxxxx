Book Description
Pro DNS and BIND 10 guides you through the challenging array of features surrounding DNS with a special focus on the latest release of BIND, the worldâ€™s most popular DNS implementation. This book unravels the mysteries of DNS, offering insight into origins, evolution, and key concepts like domain names and zone files.

Whether you administer a DNS system, are thinking about running one, or you simply want to understand the DNS system, then this book for you.
