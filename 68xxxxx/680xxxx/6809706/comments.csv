Secondly, at the point where the carriage carrying prisoners is supposed to stop and everyone get off, the horses keep walking into the wall and we never get off. I have tried several times starting a new game, have not tried any different cracks (yes I did copy the Razor1911 crack folder to the program files properly). Could anyone please give me a link/instructions to fix this?iwant to play this game very badly!! Thank you"
