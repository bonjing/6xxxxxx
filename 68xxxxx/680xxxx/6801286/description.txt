Rescatux is a GNU/Linux rescue CD that comes with Rescapp, a nice wizard that will guide you through your rescue tasks. It can restore Grub to the MBR update a Grub configuration, perform filesystem checks, fix a Windows MBR, and more. Features that can indirectly assist the rescue process include chat programs to let you reach human online help, a share log (automatic pastebin), and a share log that uses formatting appropriate for posting on a forum.

Some comments about the release:
This release does not add any new useful options compared to Rescatux 0.29 so you are not advised to renew your Rescatux disk if you already have Rescatux 0.29.
This is the first release of the Rescatux 0.30 series. It is a beta because there are some many changes in the UI. Please comment your experience on the Rescatux forum. Please say your word at Super Grub mailing list or try to find us at Rescatux chat.

Programming with Python is very fast as it is an interpreted language I can debug at run time. Python is also very powerful because I can write in an object-oriented way. And QT seems to me one of the best UI toolkits. If I am foolish enough I might switch from LXDE to Razor-QT andâ€¦ you know whatâ€¦ I might drop Iceweasel (Firefox) to include Rekonq.
