with Catherine Austin Fitts. 


Collateral fraud in the housing market; the black budget; financing of a breakaway civilization; privatization of advanced technology; $12 trillion leveraged buyout of the country; a financial coup d'etat; debt used to re-engineer governance systems; Uruguay round of GATT; $4 trillion missing from the federal government; pension funds the biggest financier of federal government; blackmail of congress; private defense contractor control of databases.





================================================

"Guns & Butter" investigates the relationships among capitalism, militarism and politics. Maintaining a radical perspective in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, "Guns & Butter: The Economics of Politics" reports on who wins and who loses when the economic resources of civil society are diverted toward global corporatization, war, and the furtherance of a national security state.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
