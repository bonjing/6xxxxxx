                                    Sleepy Hollow (1999)



The Masterful storyteller Tim Burton weaves together an atmospheric, magical version of this classic horror story.

Influenced by the British film studio Hammer and its neo-expressionist horror films from the 50 - and 60's, is Tim Burton at the boundary between reality and fantasy in this exceptional production. Johnny Depp is Ichabod Crane, an eccentric investigator determined to stop the Headless Horseman.
