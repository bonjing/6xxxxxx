Lifes.Too.Short.S01E01.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 108MB]

[/b][/color] In Life's Too Short, Warwick Davis plays a fictional version of himself where he is desperate, conniving, fame-hungry and self-centred, but always gets his comeuppance.

He runs a talent agency, Dwarves For Hire, for small people but is always taking the best jobs for himself.
Warwick is taking part in the documentary to help raise money to pay off his huge, looming tax bill.

Being a "showbiz dwarf" creates many an unusual situation for Warwick and he is constantly trying to use this to his advantage - it's just a shame that nobody recognises him without his costumes...
