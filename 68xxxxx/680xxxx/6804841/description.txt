    James Tresswick and Mark Vincent are victims of a brutal bully Gary      
    Parker who has maltreated both boys, marking their bodies and            
    spoiling their young lives. In their last year of high school, James     
    and Mark find a way to stop being victims. They're going to kill         
    Gary; Wandering alone around an isolated forest - the suspected site     
    of the disappearance of a local girl - 17 year old Mark strays upon      
    an adult male filling in a trench. It's suspicious and tantalizing.      
    Mark returns with his friend James and Chasley Keys and they bring       
    shovels to exhume what will probably be rotting garbage or someone's     
    dead pet - or so they tell themselves. They find the ghostly white       
    body of a woman. She's a tourist - a Canadian backpacker. The            
    "trench" is a grave. The "adult male" is her killer. And they've got     
    him by the balls. Responding to Mark's intimations James floats an       
    idea to seek out "the sicko". It'll be a bit of fun. He's confident      
    the guy lives in their suburb; Mark saw his car parked on a trail;       
    Mark knows what the car looks like; Mark knows what he looks like. It    
    can be done. Chasely goes along with it. No surprise. James has done     
    all her thinking since they started a relationship. Mark agrees          
    because he's got a thing for Chasely and he'd like to appear a bit       
    more like her boyfriend, but mostly Mark agrees because he carries a     
    culpable secret. They find the car and the killer 24 hours later.        
    He's got the same house as everyone else and a kid and a wife. Jeez,     
    it's anticlimactic. Then, in Chasely's bedroom, as the girl cleans up    
    the latest damage done to Mark's face by an animal called Gary           
    Parker, James floats another idea; What if the killer were contacted     
    and told the name of a guy that they'd like to see dropped in a hole     
    of his own? He's their secret, isn't he? They kind of own him, don't     
    they? If he thinks they might let him go he'd do anything, wouldn't      
    he? What could go wrong? James, Mark and Chasley are about to cross a    
    line of no return as serial killer Ian Wright lures the vulnerable       
    teenagers into his violent world.
