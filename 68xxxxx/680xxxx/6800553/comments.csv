[T],Tyr3ll,2011-11-24T12:24Z,"guys,this version is the final version of vlc 1.1.12 !
videolan.org decided to bypass this version as it fixs principaly
most of security bugs included in vlc 1.1.11.
We should not see this new version of vlc 1.1.12 as official on the net anyway then.
Unless they decide to dot it but not confirmed anyway.
The last build is absolutely this one anyway.
project and development have been stopped since this date so : november 7
videolan.org started now to work on the new build version of vlc 1.1.13 but no stable build for the moment anyway.
Will up next new stable beta build when it will be available.
If you need that i seed again,let me know and i will.
regards"
