Itâ€™s time to take care of Drizzyâ€™ s upcoming sophomore LP. It leaked a few hours ago and tis prolly the most anticipated album of the month. The long-awaited project features Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne, Andre 3000, The Weeknd, Rick Ross and productions from Boi-1da, Lex Luger, The Neptunes to name but three. Have a good one.
