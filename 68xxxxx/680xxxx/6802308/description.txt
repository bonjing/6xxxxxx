Dave is one of a group of contemporary Canadian artists who are raising the bar in the modern folk & singer/songwriter genre â€“ many of the memorable albums of 2009 have come from Canadian artists that include Catherine MacLellan, Alana Levandoski, Dala & Jory Nash; Gunningâ€™s â€˜Weâ€™re All Leavingâ€™ is an album to add to that list of excellent albums.
The title comes from a co-write with Karine Polwart that they wrote together in preparation for Karineâ€™s involvement in the Darwin Song Project; her version is one of the highlights of the Darwin CD and will undoubtedly find its way onto a future solo album, and Daveâ€™s version is presented here as a beautiful and alternative interpretation of a powerful song.
Thereâ€™s a theme of collaboration across all 11 tracks as he shares the writing credits with some of the most respected Canadian artists around including James Keelaghan, David Francey and Rose Cousins.
There are quiet acoustic tracks, a good number of band tracks and itâ€™s all held together by strong melodies across every song.  The band include guitars, upright bass, Hammond & piano, drums and mandolin and it all comes together into an album with a classic North American feel.
The songs have a loose theme of the impact of urbanisation on people and the impact this can have on individuals and communities - there are a number of songs that touch on this including the powerful â€˜Before the Morning Sunâ€™ and â€˜Ashen Townâ€™ (a memorable co-write with Francey), and the final track â€˜Sorry for the Cityâ€™ is a thought-provoking piece of songwriting.
â€˜Weâ€™re all Leavingâ€™ is a perfectly balanced album, itâ€™s a packed full of thoughtful and thought-provoking songs, but itâ€™s equally full of hooks and varied instrumentation that give the songs an immediacy â€“ this is an album that gives back to the listener in many ways.  Unreservedly recommended.
