Mahal is a 1949 Indian Hindi film directed by Kamal Amrohi and starring Ashok Kumar and Madhubala.

Produced by the famous Bombay Talkies studio, it is also the movie which launched both playback singer Lata Mangeshkar and leading lady Madhubala into super-stardom. The songs, particularly \\\"Aayega Aanewaala\\\" sung by Lata Mangeshkar, are perennial favorites. Rajkumari sang two other well known songs from the film \\\'Mein woh dulhan hon\\\' and \\\'Yeh raat phir na aayge\\\'. The lyrics were written by Nakshab. 

The movie was a groundbreaking supernatural suspense thriller and one of the earliest known films dealing with reincarnation. Mahal became one of the biggest box office hits of 1949 in India and paved the way for Indian gothic fiction.

This is classic in real sense of the word. A tight suspense from beginning to end. Mahal is one of the greatest films ever made in Bombay filmdom. Adding to the suspense is all time great song \\\'Aayega aane wala...\\\'. See it for a very young Madhubala and highly expressive Ashok Kumar. Kamal Amrohi has not made any better movie than this one. Though his \\\'Daira\\\' is another great hidden classic. He is primarily remembered for \\\'Pakeezah\\\'. Very few films gained the status this film achieved. This is certainly one of the ten best from Bollywood. The story has twisting end which will certainly surprise you and you will never be the same again. Most of the movie was shot indoors, one can easily tell that comparing it to modern standards, yet the directorial perfection is amazing. A must see.
