This is an update to my earlier compilation of J.G. Ballard's literary storehouse. Besides the addition of 'Empire of the Sun', I also went back and re-formatted the Complete Short Stories so that it has an active Table of Contents (otherwise you're scrolling through 800 pages of short stories, which just sucks).

Billennium
Cocaine Nights
Concrete Island
Crash
Empire of the Sun
High-Rise
Kindness of Women
