Book Description
This complete guide to setting up and running a TCP/IP network is essential for network administrators, and invaluable for users of home systems that access the Internet. The book starts with the fundamentals â€” what protocols do and how they work, how addresses and routing are used to move data through the network, how to set up your network connection â€” and then covers, in detail, everything you need to know to exchange information via the Internet.

Included are discussions on advanced routing protocols (RIPv2, OSPF, and BGP) and the gated software package that implements them, a tutorial on configuring important network services â€” including DNS, Apache, sendmail, Samba, PPP, and DHCP â€” as well as expanded chapters on troubleshooting and security. TCP/IP Network Administration is also a command and syntax reference for important packages such as gated, pppd, named, dhcpd, and sendmail.

With coverage that includes Linux, Solaris, BSD, and System V TCP/IP implementations, the third edition contains:
