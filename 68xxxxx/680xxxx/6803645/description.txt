Supergame II: May 25, 1972, Nassau Coliseum
-------------------------------------------

The NBA threatened to fine and/or suspend any NBA player who participated in Supergame II, but this did not stop the NBA Players Association from assembling another powerhouse team: seven Hall of Famers, six of whom are on the Top 50 List. Hall of Famer and Top 50 player Jerry West was unable to play because his kids were sick and his spot was filled by his Los Angeles Lakersâ€™ teammate, fellow Hall of Famer Gail Goodrich. Paul Silas replaced injured Hall of Famer Dave DeBusschere. The 1972 ABA team featured three Hall of Famersâ€”Barry, Erving and Dan Issel. Before the game Larry Fleischer, NBA Playersâ€™ Association counsel, said the two teams were â€œthe finest collection of basketball talent ever assembled on one floor.â€ Elgin Baylor coached the NBA and Wilt Chamberlain was the team captain; Al Bianchi and Daniels filled those roles for the ABA.

Erving was not fazed by the prospect of competing against the NBA: â€œFor me, coming off my rookie season, I was kind of feeling my oats and feeling like I could play against anybody, anywhere, at any time. I had played in and around New York in the pro summer leagues, so I had a lot of confidence in my ability.â€

The only existing tape of the 1972 game consists of 90 minutes of black and white footage from the TVS national broadcast. There are technical problems throughout the recording, mainly with the audio. Don Criqui handled the play by play, while Hot Rod Hundley and Hall of Famer Cliff Hagan provided color commentary. The ABA ball was used in the first half and the NBA ball was used in the second. The ABAâ€™s three point shot was only in effect in the second half.

Supergame II showcased a defensive intensity that differed completely from the way All-Star Games are generally played: in the first quarter alone Donnie Freeman drew a charge on Archie Clark and the ABA nearly forced a shot clock violation before a foul call bailed out the NBA.

Erving entered the game late in the first quarter with the ABA leading 22-14 and he provided an immediate spark, scoring from the left block after a pass from Gilmore. Later he displayed his open court skills, dribbling between his legs without breaking stride, driving hard to the basket and making a double-clutching shot in traffic.

He seemed to be in two places at once when he stopped a 4-on-2 fast break by the NBA. Erving picked up Robertson at the free throw line, forcing Robertson to dish to Clark on the left baseline for what seemed to be a wide open jump shot. Instead, Erving took a big step to meet Clark, swatted the shot out of midair, recovered the ball in the corner, took a couple dribbles upcourt and whipped an outlet to Daniels, who passed to George Thompson for a layup plus the foul. Thompsonâ€™s free throw put the ABA up 47-30 with 7:35 left in the first half.

By the third quarter the NBA closed the score to 60-59 and Criqui noted, â€œJulius Erving led the ABA to a breakaway in the second quarterâ€”they went up by 19â€”but heâ€™s been on the bench throughout the later part of the second quarter and has not played here in the third quarter.â€ With about two minutes left in the third quarter and the NBA leading 81-78, Erving returned to the game. Erving closed the third quarter with a fantastic drive against Hawkins from the right wing, dribbling between his legs, than spinning and going between his legs again. Once Erving got clear of Hawkins he elevated over Bob Lanier and made a bank shot.

Sadly, the fourth quarter footage is missing and presumed to be destroyed. The game closed in dramatic fashion. Barry hit a three pointer with 13 seconds left to cut the NBA lead to one. The ABA fouled Clark, who made the first and missed the second attempt. A wild scramble for the rebound ensued. Barry emerged with the ball and launched a desperation three pointer. His game winning attempt fell short and the NBA won 106-104. Lanier scored 15 points and was selected game MVP.

The Mind Boggling Dr. J Dunk
----------------------------

Silas will never forget a particular fourth quarter play from the 1972 game: â€œThe one defining moment was, I had the ball and Doc stole the ball from me and went down and slammed this thing harder than I had ever seen anybody slam the ball in my life.â€ Prior to the game Silas knew little about Erving: â€œZelmo Beaty, who I had played with in St. Louis and Atlanta, had jumped leagues and when I saw him he was telling me about Docâ€”that he wasnâ€™t a good shooter but he just went by everybody. He just took up the slack, penetrated around and dunked on everybody. And Iâ€™m wondering how that happened. How could it happen? He developed a consistent shot, but it took time for him to do that. He was special.â€

Daniels had seen some great dunks before, including one by Hawkins over Danielsâ€™ Minnesota Muskiesâ€™ teammate Sam Smith in the 1968 ABA playoffs, but nothing quite like Ervingâ€™s flight in the 1972 Supergame: â€œHe leapt from behind the free throw line, hung in the air for two or three seconds it seemed and dunked it. It was an absolutely amazing dunk and you had to see it to really appreciate it. Telling you about it does not do it the justice it deserves.â€

Erving recalls, â€œI stole the ball and got Oscar Robertson and Archie Clark caught back on defense and Archie went for the steal, which made me pick the ball up. I was around the top of the key, coming in transitionâ€¦I took a step and a half and went airborne from somewhere around the foul line, just inside the foul line. I noticed Oscar Robertson was there and just looking at me like, â€˜What does this kid think he is going to do?â€™ He figured that I was going to come out of the air before I made it to the basket, but I got all the way to the basket and I dunked the ball and the ball bounced up into his hands and there was a certain expression on his face at the timeâ€”as well as Archieâ€™sâ€”almost like it was a moment. And I just ran back downcourt, but later on a lot of people talked about that play.â€

In many ways Ervingâ€™s dunk symbolizes the ABA and the Supergames in one spectacular athletic flourishâ€”it was amazing and yet no footage of it exists. Fortunately, Ervingâ€™s free throw line dunk to win the 1976 ABA Slam Dunk contest was captured for posterity.

The 1973's NBA vs. ABA ASG (31 may) was cancelled. Also the 1974's NBA vs. ABA ASG (18 may in Providence, Rhode Island) was cancelled too, the 1972's ASG been the last game ever.
