Happy Feet Two is a 3D musical adventure game for the entire family inspired by the whimsical Antarctic world of the animated film. In the game, new dangers are threatening the penguin nation, and it's going to take everyone working - and dancing - together to save them from extinction. Players use dance moves to recruit penguins with unique abilities that help advance the adventure, stun opponents and enemies, as well as manipulate the environment around them to solve co-operative puzzles.
