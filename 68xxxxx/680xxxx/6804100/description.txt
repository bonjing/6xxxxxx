For Math Aficionados From All Walks of Life
THE LITTLE GREEN MATH BOOK is based on a simple but powerful observation: Individuals who develop outstanding math and numeracy skills do so primarily by mastering a limited number of the most important math principles and problem solving techniques, which they use over and over again. What are these recurring principles and techniques? The answer to this question is the basis of this book. 

The book's four chapters include: (1) Basic Numeracy Ingredients, (2) Wonderful Math Recipes, (3) Favorite Numeracy Dishes, and (4) Special Math Garnishments. Thirty principles of math summarize the common themes behind classic math problems and each problem is rated according to a three-tier system â€“ one chili (mild), two chilies (hot), and three chilies (very hot).
