    Renowned chef Raymond Blanc thinks it is a tragedy that    
    so many of our native orchards are disappearing and is    
    determined to try reverse this trend. One of his         
    favourite fruits is the British plum, many varieties of   
    which are now seriously under threat. He meets farmers     
    who are struggling to sell their plums, many of which     
    lie rotting on the orchard floor because there is no     
    longer a viable market for them, and die-hard lovers of   
    plums who, like him, are determined to revive the          
    fortunes of this classic British fruit. In the Revival    
    kitchen, Raymond creates a range of amazing dishes that  
    are so mouthwatering that they make you want to go and    
    plant your own plum tree.                                  
                                                              
    Michelin-starred chef Angela Hartnett's campaign is to   
    persuade us to cook with turkey outside of the            
    Christmas season. She wants to reverse the perception      
    of turkey as an over-cooked, dry meat that we only eat    
    once a year and encourages us to embrace the             
    slower-reared heritage varieties of turkey that produce   
    succulent, tasty meat. Angela is determined to get us      
    to be more experimental with turkey and cooks up some     
    tasty treats to prove just how versatile this healthy    
    and affordable alternative to chicken really is.
