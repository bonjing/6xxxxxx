                         = THE TRUTH BEHIND THE CRYSTAL SKULLS =
                         =======================================




The crystal skulls has been a great mystery for many years.Are the really hidden powers inside them? Has Aliens left them behind as proof of their existens? Do they have information that will save humanity and prevent apocalypse?


Many believe these skulls were carved thousands or even tens of thousands of years ago by an ancient Mesoamerican civilization. Others think they may be relics from the legendary island of Atlantis or proof that extraterrestrials visited the Aztec sometime before the Spanish conquest.


Crystal skulls are not uncommon or terribly mysterious. Thousands are produced every year in Brazil, China, and Germany. But there are a handful of these rather macabre objects that have fueled intense interest and controversy among archaeologists, scientists, spiritualists, and museum officials for more than a century.


There are perhaps a dozen of these rare crystal skulls in private and public collections. Some are crystal clear, others of smoky or colored quartz. Some are actual human size and of very fine detail, while others are smaller and less refined. All are believed to originate from Mexico and Central America.

UPLOADER NOTE:
==============

Back to old skills:


Since there were none proper avi file(s)out, i took the time to edit a proper release and share it with you all.On my uploads you'll never find rared files or 
mkv crap ,that can hide anything inside.Clean old good avi files and when possible 
with srt(subtitles) included.
