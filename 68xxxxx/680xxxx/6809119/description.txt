"Pam's Replacement"

Pregnant Pam (Jenna Fischer) recruits Dwight 
(Rainn Wilson) to prove that Jim (John 
Krasinski) finds the office's pretty new temp 
(guest star Lindsey Broad) attractive. 
Meanwhile, Robert California (two-time Emmy 
Award winner James Spader) shocks Andy (Ed 
Helms), Darryl (Craig Robinson), and Kevin 
(Brian Baumgartner) when he asks to join 
their band.

Evolve...or die.
