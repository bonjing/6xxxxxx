"New album from the already known funeral ambient project from US. This given album is a new level for the project, playing very heavy funeral doom metal. Slow, viscous, strong, dark, cosmic and deep atmosphere." - Gris records.

"Starts off Funeral and deeply painful for those who have lost, but turns slowly more self-centred, Esoteric and death-like. Slow, atmospheric, distant tortured almost ambient vocals fit perfectly with distant tortured almost ambient music. More wind blowing through catacombs than riffs." -Reviewer (Beerman).
