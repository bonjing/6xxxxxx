Falco - Der Kommissar [Ridiamoci Sopra 1982].VOB


HQ very rare promo music video performance at the Ridiamoci Sopra Italian TV show in 1982. "Der Kommissar" is a song first recorded by Falco in German in 1981, Originally written by producer Robert Ponger for Reinhold Bilgeri, Bilgeri turned it down as he felt the song was too soft, so Falco reworked the song for himself instead. 

It reached the top of the Charts in many countries, but only reached #74 in the US Cash Box Charts in 1983 and did not even chart in the UK, but Falco would break through with major hits in those countries two albums later, with "Rock Me Amadeus" and "Vienna Calling" in 1986. 

It was covered a year later by After the Fire and reworked in 1983 by Laura Branigan. After The Fire's version (promo posted:) featured English lyrics by the band's Andy Piercy. The song peaked at #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. 

Johann (Hans) Holzel (19 February 1957 â€“ 6 February 1998), better known by his stage name Falco, was an Austrian pop and rock musician and rapper. He had several international hits: "Der Kommissar", "Rock Me Amadeus", "Vienna Calling", "Jeanny", "The Sound of Musik", "Coming Home (Jeanny Part 2)" and posthumously, "Out Of The Dark". 

He is the first and only artist to date whose principal language was German to score a number-one hit in the United States with "Rock Me Amadeus". His estate claims he has sold 40 million albums and 20 million singles to date, which makes him the best selling Austrian singer of all time.
