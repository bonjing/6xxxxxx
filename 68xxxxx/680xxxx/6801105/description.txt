This is my first torrent upload! Apparently no other torrents of this movie exist at all. I found it in pieces on a file sharing site. The quality is good. It has the option to play normally in English (there are English subtitles that you can disable) or Italian voice over.

The file is a .iso image of the original DVD. That means you'll either have to have a DVD burner on your computer to create a DVD with this file or a mounting program. You can use Daemon Tools Lite. It lets you take a disc image like this and store it on the computer instead of a CD or DVD. Just Google and download the free version.

At some point I might try editing this torrent to be smaller and a better file format. But at least it isn't five separate password protected .rar files anymore. 

A lot of people have been looking for this movie. I'd really appreciate seeding. And if you feel like taking a stab at improving the torrent and uploading your own, feel free.


Thanks for popping my upload cherry, everyone!
