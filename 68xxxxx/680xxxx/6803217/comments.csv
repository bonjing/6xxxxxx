I went to the doctor on his advice to get my ears checked and he was all like ""just because some guy on the internet complained that the audio book he got for free wasn't to his specific standards?"" then he called me a retard and kicked me out of his office. Whatever you do, do NOT get your ears checked if you don't have a problem listening to this for free, it's really embarrassing"
