[/b][/color] Maria Bello as tough-as-nails Detective Jane Timoney.
Timoney finds that being a homicide detective in New York City is tough enough and having to contend with a male-dominated police department to get respect makes it that much tougher.
She's an outsider who has just transferred to a new precinct dominated by an impenetrable clique of a boys' club.
Timoney has her own vices too -- with a questionable past -- and she tends to be forceful, rude and reckless.
But she's also a brilliant cop who keeps her eye on one thing: the prime suspect.
