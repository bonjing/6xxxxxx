                    The little girl in the house at road's end (1976)



Rynn has just moved into the tiny coastal town. She is only 13 years old and lives alone in the big, lonely house by the road's end. Where is her mother? Where is her father? And what is she hiding in the basement?

In the darkest November, she objudet visit. First of its obstinate and wicked landlady. Late of the area's notorious pedophile. And then, of a kind, but very curious police. All they come with their questions. But Rynn does not like questions.

Not everyone will leave the house alive ....


Enjoy!!!
