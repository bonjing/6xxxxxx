It looks like only WEB -DL is ok.   "
led."" Please. Please. Please start disabling this feature before exporting you capture. it does not help. it only hurts. your awesome video uploads are shit without good audio. all quiet parts are WAY TOO LOUD. please disable ""normalize audio"" or ""audio leveling"" options. the original sound design and mix are already awesome. they do not need us ""pirates"" to ""fix"" them. thanks for the upload, though! we appreciate the effort."
