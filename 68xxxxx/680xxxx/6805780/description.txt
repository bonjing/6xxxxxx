Californiaâ€™s â€œfirst cityâ€ might seem like a sleepy and quaint little oceanside town, but Monterey, California knows how to party. Located on the California coast smack dab in the middle of the state, Monterey isnâ€™t just known for its historic buildings and world-class aquarium. From Alvarado Street, with the densest collection of bars and pubs in the area, to the many vineyards along the outskirts of town, you wonâ€™t have to wander far to find a drink.
