Wizards.Of.Waverly.Place.S04E25.Rock.Around.The.Clock.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 176MB]

[/b][/color] Wizards of Waverly Place follows the Russo children, Alex, Justin, and Max, who on the surface appear to be completely normal, but beneath the sibling rivalry lies their secret.
They are all wizards in training! They use their powers to do most of their tasks.
Whether it's washing the dishes or making dinner, or even getting back at a fellow sibling, whatever the reason, it'll always have hilarious consequences.
Even though they all train and study, once they turn 18, only one of them will get to keep their wizardly powers.
