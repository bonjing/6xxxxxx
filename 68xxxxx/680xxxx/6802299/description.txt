this is definitely the biggest collection of RHCP on the internet. Everything they've ever recorded (albums, b-sides, singles, famous shows, rare tracks, bootlegs, etc) in .mp3 format, some albums are in .FLAC and furthermore, some are VINYL RIPS, converted to both FLAC and MP3 for perfect quality. Scans of CD booklets included, everything's organized, just drag and drop into itunes. Also there's master tracks from almost every album. There's a shit ton of video here too,. almost every professionally filmed concert, and every last music video they ever filmed. Pretty big download here
