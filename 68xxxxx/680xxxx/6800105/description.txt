Finding Birds in Estonia
by Dave Gosney

This DVD shows you what a fantastic place Estonia is for birds, especially in spring when you can enjoy the spectacle of thousands of geese as well as forests, reedbeds and meadows full of bird song. 

In this DVD you will visit most of Estonia's best birding sites and get an idea of just how good they are, either for migrants such as geese and seaducks or rare breeding birds such as Citrine Wagtail, White-backed Woodpecker, Great Snipe and Greenish Warbler or a wealth of commoner species such as Wryneck, Icterine Warbler and Red-breasted Flycatcher. 

Learn about the sites - covers no fewer than 27 of Estonia's best birding sites including Matsalu Bay, Spithami, Nigula, Sorve and the areas around Tartu. 

Enjoy the birds - sit back and enjoy footage of 80 species, including all the species mentioned above, filmed using high-definition digital video cameras. "Estonia was so full of birds that this film is longer than usual", says Dave Gosney.
