"Heartbreak Hotel"

During the investigation of the murder of 
an Atlantic City casino owner at an 
abandoned warehouse, strong leads emerge 
for the team in both New York and Atlantic 
City. As Beckett and Capt. Gates work the 
New York leads together, Castle naturally 
chooses to join the detectives for the 
road trip to "America's Playground," 
hoping to help solve the case while 
throwing an impromptu bachelor party for 
Ryan. Richard Burgi ("Desperate 
Housewives") guest stars as Charlie 
Turner, the slick business partner of the 
victim.
