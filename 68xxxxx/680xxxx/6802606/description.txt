Book Description
Get Started Fast with HTML5 Online Game Programming!

HTML5 will transform web and mobile gaming. As new browsers rapidly adopt it, HTML5 will do everything â€œlegacyâ€ technologies such as Flash and Silverlight have doneâ€”and much more. In Learning HTML5 Game Programming, pioneering developer James L. Williams gives you all the knowledge, code, and insights youâ€™ll need to get started fast!

Williams combines detailed explanations of HTML5â€™s key innovations with examples, including two case study applications that address the entire development process. He guides you through setting up a state-of-the-art HTML5 development environment; making the most of HTML5â€™s canvas tag, SVG vector graphics, and WebGL 3D; and targeting diverse mobile and social platforms. Itâ€™s all here: from the essentials of online game design to the nitty-gritty details of performance optimization.
