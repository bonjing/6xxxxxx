ZZ TOP  GREATEST HITS THE VIDEO COLLECTION
Label: Warner
Released: 2004
Format: avi

This video features 12 of ZZ Top's most memorable music videos. Their unique sound was matched only by their distinctive appearance in those clips-long beards, wild suits, custom vintage red ford and the trademark arm swing.

At first glance, the three men who make up ZZ Top--the stoically silent, bearded look-a-likes Frank Beard and Dusty Hill and curly-haired front man Billy Gibbons--appear to be American rednecks with a little extra cash and access to musical instruments. However, the three men are actually acclaimed and hugely successful rock stars, whose Southern blues-influenced rock has proved appealing to millions of Americans. Along with being expert musicians, ZZ Top have also become cultural icons, their music videos representative of a certain slice of car and girl-loving Americana, as exemplified especially in "Legs." This  compilation contains 12 of the band's videos. Included is the acclaimed Eliminator trilogy of "Gimme All Your Lovin," "Sharp Dressed Man" and "Legs," along with "TV Dinners," "Stages," the group's rendition of the Elvis Presley classic "Viva Las Vegas" and so much more.
