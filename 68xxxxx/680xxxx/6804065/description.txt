Julian Fellowes' hit drama Downton Abbey returns to
DVD for a second series with all the regular cast
including Dame Maggie Smith, Hugh Bonneville, Elizabeth
McGovern, Brendan Coyle, Joanne Froggatt and Dan Stevens.
Returning to Downton Abbey in 1916, we see the effects of
The First World War on the lives of the Crawley family and
the servants who work for them. The new series sees the
return of all the much loved characters whose intertwined
lives are rendered more complicated by wartime and its impact
on the great house itself. And when the storms of war have finally
cleared, will the way of life known by all the inhabitants of
Downton have changed forever?
