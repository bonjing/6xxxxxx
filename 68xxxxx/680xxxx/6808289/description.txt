The Lancaster At War

History, War Documentary hosted by Struan Rodger, published by PBS in 2010 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

'The Lancaster At War' is a vivid account of the aircraft that became the mainstay of Britain's Bomber Command in the struggle to defeat Nazi Germany.

The programme tells the operational history of the Lancaster - daring daylight raids deep into the enemy's homeland, the epic Dambuster's mission, precision attacks on Hitler's 'V' weapon sites, the paralyzing of German forces prior to D-Day and missions of mercy that will save thousands from starvation in Occupied Territories. And, in a campaign that remains controversial to this day, it plays its part in the destruction of the cities and industrial centres of the Third Reich.

Surviving Lancaster aircrew give frank and candid personal accounts of their part in an aerial battle of attrition that will claim the lives of 55,000 aircrew.
Archive film, some of it unseen in colour, along with material specially shot for this production, graphically illustrate the capabilities of this remarkable aircraft, its development and its war-time missions.

'The Lancaster At War' describes the aircraft that played a major role in the defeat of the Nazi regime and the courage and determination of Bomber Command aircrew that fought a grim battle in hostile skies, a struggle that can only be understood by confronting the reality of total war.
