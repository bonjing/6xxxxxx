Reload by Warren Ellis
The story of Reload begins with the assassination of the President of the United States and continues to get more intense. The assassin is incredibly well trained, and someone in the government seems to be covering for her. (And it's not the reason you think.) One secret service agent is stuck between stopping the assassin, who continues to attack government agencies, and the government he's trying to save.
