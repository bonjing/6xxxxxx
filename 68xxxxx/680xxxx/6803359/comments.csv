This torrent is FAKE. Do not download and please stop seeding it. As already posted in another comment, this torrent contains one ""part"" of the download. The torrent contains a readme in the original rar that tells you to go to another site to get the other part, which no longer exists (and used to be a pay site).

This torrent was a huge waste of time, I was mislead by the number of seeders like everyone else."
