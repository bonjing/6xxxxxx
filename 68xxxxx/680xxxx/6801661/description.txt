K is the debut album by Kula Shaker, released September 16, 1996. When it was released, it became the fastest selling debut album in Britain since Oasis's Definitely Maybe. The album reached the #1 position in the UK charts, however in America it stalled at #200 in the Billboard charts.

The track "Grateful When You're Dead/Jerry Was There" is a homage to Jerry Garcia and his band The Grateful Dead. The Grateful Dead's psychedelic rock style is an influence on Kula Shaker's first and second albums. The hidden track after "Hollow Man" is a recording of A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, speaking about his own guru.

The cover art (by comic-book artist Dave Gibbons) consists of various images related to the letter K, including: John F. Kennedy, Lord Kitchener, Karl Marx, Gene Kelly, Katharine Hepburn, Ken Dodd, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Danny Kaye, Kal-El (Superman), Boris Karloff (as Frankenstein), Krishna, King Kong, Martin Luther King, Jr., 2 Knights (a pair of Keys on one of them), a Kettle, Kali, the Kaiser, Nikita Khrushchev, Grace Kelly, the number 11 (symbolizing K) and Rudyard Kipling's book Kim.

In 1998 K was placed at number 44 on Q's 100 greatest albums of all time list. In 2011, K once again made into a Q Magazine list for the 250 Greatest Albums of All Time.
