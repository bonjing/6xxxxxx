I downloaded a few iso files today and I can't get them to load with Wii Backup Fusion so I can load them onto my HDD.  Fusion won't recognize them as valid files.  Hoping this version of MW3 will work.  My drive died 2 days ago as I was prepping wii with soft-mod but now I can't copy my copy of MW3 so I'm stuck grabbing a torrent... I do seed back by the way using a 1.5 ratio per download."
