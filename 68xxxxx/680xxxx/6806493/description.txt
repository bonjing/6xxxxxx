Whoopi Goldberg first found fame while performing a one-woman show on Broadway in the beginning of the 1980s. Two decades later she celebrated that anniversary by performing in a new one-woman show featuring many of the same characters from that original production. This DVD captures one of those performances. Over the course of the program Goldberg revisits one of her most famous creations, the stoner Fontaine.
