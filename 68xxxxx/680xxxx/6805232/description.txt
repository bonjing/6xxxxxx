 I couldn\'t find any Surface of Eceon or Yume Bitsu on the PB so I offer this selection which is the complete Surface of Eceon and the associated groups and members; Yume Bitsu, Landing,Kinski and Paik.

 Surface of Eceon (or Surface of Eceyon), is a supergroup of sorts whose music has been described as ambient space rock. This unit, which has a penchant for the phantasmagoric, includes members of from Landing and Yume Bitsu, two notable psychedelic rock groups.
