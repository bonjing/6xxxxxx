Plot:

Sue, Cheryl and Lexi are three college freshmen who have been best friends since they were born on the same day. They do something special every year for their birthday, but on their eighteenth, they set out to lose their virginity. They throw a large poolside party at Sue's house hoping to "pop their cherries" before the day and night is over. But they find that losing their virginity is easier said than done as all three of them embark on a series of raunchy and hilarious quests to do so.

Cheryl sets out to "make it" with her long-term boyfriend Jake. But after she catches him cheating on her with another girl, she embarks on a string of unsuccessful hook ups, one of which include trying to seduce the local blind kid Frank whose seeing-eye dog has an encounter with her instead. Next, Cheryl tries to make her boyfriend jealous by hooking up with a friendly college guy, named Eric, but he leaves when she is only trying to seduce him as "revenge sex" against her boyfriend.
