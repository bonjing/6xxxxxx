Who the fuck do you think you are? This isn't fucking communism, asshole. You think you're entitled to a free copy of a game just because the company is successful? Just because that company constructs solid games? What a piece of shit human being you are. Have fun voting whatever country you live in into socialism.

I don't have a ""guilty conscience."" I recognize torrenting Skyrim for what it is - stealing. Doesn't mean I don't torrent stuff every once in a while. But to ignore the fact that this is and always will be (as far as downloading items meant for the sole purpose of generating revenue) blatant theft. How you can ignore that easy-to-understand and obvious fact is beyond me. 

Stealing is stealing, relativity has no weight on the matter.

Leave your simple-minded statements out of this.
Piracy is not stealing. Everyone can play a game by not paying for it, like when they borrow it from friends. It's not like you will complain about, that, either, so just shut it.
Besides, their are multiple people who don't have a lot of money and need to cut their spendings on something. Don't judge any pirates, you punk.

Also, why the fuck do you drag Communism into this? Do you like playing the stuck up misinformed capitalist? I bet you can't even define Communism. However, like I said. Leave it out of this. This is no place for politics. If you have a problem, GTFO out of these comments with your hideous walls of text."

A response would be appreciated. Kind of lost here.

It may differ slightly, depending on your system, but basically you go to your audio devices. For example, on Vista you can just right-click your volume icon in the taskbar and click on Audio Devices. You can also just go to the configuration screen and click on Audio Devices. This should bring you to your list of sound devices. Here you right-click your active sound device, probably your speakers. Then you go to the advanced tab. Here you will want the drop-down bar at the top. There you set your frequency to 24 bits, 48000 Hz.

This fixed it for several people on a forum, it also fixed it for me, so it should help you and others too.

,Cerpan,2011-11-11T09:29Z,@ubandog44 Thanks for the reply. I just tried everything again and found out that when I used 7-zip to extract the ISO from the files that it was corrupted or something. I didn't know it because the file size of the ISO was what it was supposed to be. Tried again this time with winrar and it's working. 
,Saint666xp,2011-11-11T09:31Z,"woot ! thank you  Bethesda Softworks for Fucking pc gamers.  i think all they care about is console revenue. 

the interface make me want to punch babies,
Graphics are meh. 

feels like im playing a console game,  makes me sad.

I can only hope the modding community can save this.

Razor1911 kicksAss tho, thanks for the upload"
,Evaine,2011-11-11T09:34Z,"Heres detailed instructions on what to do to play this game. First and foremost, this download is legit. I can confirm this. Everything you need is here. 
1. ONCE you download the file, you will need to MOUNT the ISO to a virtual drive. This is made possible with a program such as Daemon Tools.
(the file you've downloaded is basically a ""virtual DvD"" and you need a ""Virtual drive"" to play the virtual disc.)
2. After step 1, you will go into ""My Computer"", right click your virtual drive (should see SKYRIM_EN) and select ""Open"". Fifth icon from the top of the list should be ""Install"". You double click this and it will prompt the install. You Install.
3. Once installed a window with a single shortcut should pop-up. Disregard this and close. What you do now is go BACK INTO the ""virtual drive"" go into the folder titled ""Razor1911"" which should be the top folder, and copy all the FILES INSIDE THE FOLDER! (Do NOT copy the FOLDER, but the FILES INSIDE THE FOLDER)
4. You should have copied the 4 files inside the ""Razor1911"" folder, now you go to where you installed Skyrim. Should be in ""PROGRAM FILES"" on your hard drive. You open the folder titled ""The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim"" and you will see a list of more files. 
5. Last step to take is to paste the 4 files you copied earlier into that list. It will ask if you want to OVERWRITE the current files, and you will say ""YES!""
6. Once you have overwritten those files, you will double click the ""Launcher"" file in your ""The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim"" folder.If you followed my instructions, you should already be in that folder. The game will start up, and SUCCESS! You did it!

Hope that helps. "

This torrent works and has everything you should need. Just copy the Razor crack files out of the ISO and paste them after you get the game installed. Those crack files should replace the original game files to allow you to play it.

The only issue I had was crashing to desktop until I changed my audio to 24k 44100hz, which has helped many others as well. There will also be an update to the crack file (124MB from what I've heard), but this will work until then for most people."

I'm probably just stupid, but help would really be appreciated. Also, I think I speak for a large percentage of tpb community in that someone should provide more specific step by step instructions."

,xxZoyerxx,2011-11-12T00:01Z,"*IF YOU WANT THE GAME TO WORK THE READ*

1.INSTALLED THE SHIT AND COPY THE CRACK INTO THE INSTALLED FOLDER. (you find the crack inside your mounted isofile, the map is named like ""Razor1911"" or something... copy all thoose files inside there and paste them into the installed folder and replace ofc :)  )

2. DOWNLOAD THE (222.85 MiB) The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Update 1 Repack-RazorDOX
UPLOADED BY DibyaTPB.

TAKE A COP OF COFEE, IT DEPENDS OF YOUR ""INTERNET SPEED""

3. COPY THE FILES IN THAT UPDATE FOLDER AND PASTE THOOSE FILES INTO THE INSTALLED FOLDER(Skyrim folder) AND REPLACE ALL THE FILES OFCOURSE!

4. CHANGE YOUR SOUND QUALITY TO (24 BIT 44100 HZ)  OR (16 BIT 44100 HZ )

5. NOW PROBABLY WHEN YOU START THE GAME YOU PRESS THE NEW GAME AND THEN AT THE LOADING SCREEN  IT JUST TURN OFF THEN LOOK AT THIS MAGIC SENTENCES:

YOU GO INTO THE INSTALLED FOLDER (The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim) THEN YOU LOOK UP THE FILE LOW.INI AND OPEN IT THEN YOU MAKE A BACKUP OF THAT MOTHA FACKING FILE.

YOU OPEN THE HIGH/MEDIUM/VERYHIGH.INI IT DEPENDS WHAT GRAPHICS YOU WANT TO USE. YOU COPY EVERYTHING IN (HIGH.INI) IF IT IS THOOSE GRAPHICS YOU WANT TO USE. 

AND DELETE EVERYTHING IN THE LOW.INI AND PASTE THAT YOU COPIED IN THE ""HIGH.INI"" INTO THE LOW.INI AND THEN SAVE!!! YOU MAYBE NEED TO REPLACE THE NEW LOW.INI WITH THE OLD WHICH ARE IN THE INSTALLED FOLDER IF YOU DONT REMEMBER..

THEN WHEN YOU START THE LAUNCHER YOU PRESS OPTIONS AND THEN CHOOSE  LOW ON DETAIL.

THEN YOU GO INTO ADVANCED/VIEW DISTANCE AND PUT DISTANT OBJECT DETAIL TO ""LOW"" YOU MUST TO THIS!!!!! 

I THINK YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE YOUR GRAPHICS AFTER YOU HAVE DONE ALL THIS, BUT REMEMBER IT MUST BE ON ""LOW"" AT DISTANT OBJECT DETAIL.

HOPE YOU ALL GET THIS TO WORK

There is no Crack Dir, the name of the directory was Razer 1911 you will find this folder when you navigate to the mounted drive and explore the contents.

The folder and shortcut you saw was only the directory of the start menu that holds the shortcut. It pops up automatically when the games is finished assuming you will want to play and that way you dont have to go looking for the shortcut.

Copy the 4 items from the folder named Razer 1911

Paste them here(default directory, i use windows 7 so here is mine, just make sure you stick with the default directory when installing if you can.) C:\Program files (x86)\The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim

,Afinfas,2011-11-12T16:15Z,"Thanks for a surprisingly fast release. On the day of the release and it was already there. Fast torrent also cause we have a lot of seeds...8888 at the moment, unbelievable.
WORKS Guaranteed! I played a couple of minutes already and didnt encountered any errors until now. But i have to say that im a bit disappointed with the game so far. Doesnt look so fluid and intuitive like Oblivion. And no, its not from my PC, i just got a new one yesterday with high Specs. Im running it in Ultra. The game menu to select weapon and stuff is quite complicated but maybe it comes with the time.

I just got completely fascinated to see how they made Water look like real water!!! WTF Very nice.
But yeah, is difficult to get over Oblvion...it was an exceptional game, difficult to beat!

Anyway...thanks again for the release. Dont forget to download also the patch.

Its very easy to install, just follow the instructions that come attached. And turn off internet while you make everything. Like that you make sure thereÂ´s no problems with activations and stuff.

Ok, gonna play a bit more to see if i get used to it! ;)
Im seeding all the time.

I though in buying the game but...until it doesnt convince me i will stick to this. When it does then maybe iÂ´ll buy it, if itÂ´s worth it. :)

ENJOY GUYS!!!"

I love trouble shooting and I see many others are having the same problem as you.

1. Try deleting the game including the skyrim files in the ""My Games"" folder.

2. Restart your PC.

3. Install again using my tut or someone elseâ€™s for that matter.

4. Be sure that you have done everything correctly and you have even tried changing your audio options.

If none of this helped, post your operation system here and the community (and me ;P) can see if there is an ""connection"" between the problems.

I HAVE noticed, however, with ATI cards that there is quite a bit of mouse lag. To get rid of this (which is a Vsync issue) do the following: 

VSync is automatically on and can't be disabled from within the game. This not only reduces FPS, it also introduces mouse lag. To disable VSync in Skyrim, add iPresentInterval=0 to the bottom of the [Display] section of the Skyrim.ini file in the \Users\[Username]\My Documents\My Games\Skyrim directory.

Also, make sure to get the latest atiumdag.dll (Google this) for ATI cards.

No real problems for GeForce cards that I know of yet.

Excellent game - just wasted my whole Saturday playing it."

I fixed my flash problem. I had to do some tinkering and ask the PirateBay gods for help, but i got it working. Go download the http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6809702/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Update_1_Repack-RazorDOX repack and copy the items from there into your install folder. I also tinkered with the resolution settings and uninstalled and reinstalled the game while triple checking that I completely copy and pasted the items from the razor 1911 file.

 Good luck mate..."
,snakkred,2011-11-14T06:30Z,"Just finished downloading and seeding all I got. Quick question, am I suppose to make a Steam account when it asks while it's installing? Completely confused on that, I try and start the game with the Skyrimlauncher provided that I copied into the game directory, but it's saying unable to find INI file."
,snakkred,2011-11-14T06:39Z,"NVM! Found my answer waaay back on page 6. 
Reposting to keep info fresh all thanks to ""Evaine""

Heres detailed instructions on what to do to play this game. First and foremost, this download is legit. I can confirm this. Everything you need is here. 
1. ONCE you download the file, you will need to MOUNT the ISO to a virtual drive. This is made possible with a program such as Daemon Tools.
(the file you've downloaded is basically a ""virtual DvD"" and you need a ""Virtual drive"" to play the virtual disc.)
2. After step 1, you will go into ""My Computer"", right click your virtual drive (should see SKYRIM_EN) and select ""Open"". Fifth icon from the top of the list should be ""Install"". You double click this and it will prompt the install. You Install.
3. Once installed a window with a single shortcut should pop-up. Disregard this and close. What you do now is go BACK INTO the ""virtual drive"" go into the folder titled ""Razor1911"" which should be the top folder, and copy all the FILES INSIDE THE FOLDER! (Do NOT copy the FOLDER, but the FILES INSIDE THE FOLDER)
4. You should have copied the 4 files inside the ""Razor1911"" folder, now you go to where you installed Skyrim. Should be in ""PROGRAM FILES"" on your hard drive. You open the folder titled ""The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim"" and you will see a list of more files. 
5. Last step to take is to paste the 4 files you copied earlier into that list. It will ask if you want to OVERWRITE the current files, and you will say ""YES!""
6. Once you have overwritten those files, you will double click the ""Launcher"" file in your ""The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim"" folder.If you followed my instructions, you should already be in that folder. The game will start up, and SUCCESS! You did it!

Hope that helps."

,Tezukann,2011-11-14T10:56Z,"for everyone asking about ANYTHING to do with steam, if you have done the install right, you will never have to open or even touch steam. you can launch the game directly from the install folder.

if your still having problems, reread the instructions, and read again

now for a seperate problem

****IS YOUR GAME CRASHING AS SOON AS IT STARTS UP?****

go to you sound properties and in your advanced tab change your sound to 24 bit 44100 KHz and it will no longer crash and you can play

new problem

*** ARE YOU STUCK ON THE MAIN MISSION WHERE YOU HAVE TO TALK TO ESGERD AND HE DOESNT HAVE A VOICE AND NEVER OPENS THE DOOR?""****

simply download the ap ""OBMM"" (oblivion mod manager)run it as an adminstrator and go to you skyrim data folder (located inside skyrim instal directory) and extract voiceextra.BSA or whatever is closest to that

another one:

*** DURING THE ALDOINS BANE QUEST, AFTER YOU READ THE ELDER SCROLL DO YOU GET STUCK AFTER THEY KILL THE DRAGON AND AFTER THEY DO THE SHORT DIALOUGE AND THE NPCS STAND THERE FOREVER?***

after you read the eldor scroll, simply dont touch the mouse or press any buttons until you hear aldoins voice"
,Tezukann,2011-11-14T10:59Z,"new one

*** WHEN TRYING TO MOUNT THE IMAGE, DOES IT SAY YOUR MISSING A DLL OR SOME SHIT?****

you do not mount the iso thats in the folder with all the other files in it. open WinRaR and open one of the files that have like ""001"" extension or whatever. click it ONE time and then click extract file. whenits done extracting THATS the image you mount, not the first one you see."

1. Search the net and download the UNIVERSAL EXTRACTOR and install it.

2. Copy all the contents of the ISO file into a directory on your local drive.

3. Right-click ""install.exe"" and click ""uniextract here"" you will be given 3 types of extraction, choose the 3rd one and if you do it correctly, you will have a new ""install.exe"", and a file called crack.exe!

4. Double-click install.exe and it should already work and the installation will continue!

I myself use this site as a trial to buy.  Nothing worse than spending $$$ on something, only to find out that it sucks, is too buggy, or just isn't what you need.

I have seen a lot of ppl on here saying that they never will purchase these things, and basically screw you.  Cool Story Bro!  To each their own!  Whatever!  The world is filled with contributors, and takers.  If we all constantly take w/o contributing, eventually there will be nothing to take.  So pretty much do what you want.  I myself like to support good projects.  Even if it means breaking a few rules to find the worthy products.

Now to the game.  As with all PC games, there are always 1st day bugs.  I haven't had the audio problem, or crashes.  This upload worked like a charm.  +1 to your upload.  I have noticed that the game has a problem with the loading screen taking forever.  I just ctrl-alt-del out and then it loads up the cell fast.

If you have a problem with the Esbern guy and his quests.  I used the BSA extractor from Oblivion to fix it.  Here is the link that describes how to.  http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/615805-the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/60963102

After a few patches, the game will be phenomenal.

if your still having problems, reread the instructions, and read again

now for a seperate problem

****IS YOUR GAME CRASHING AS SOON AS IT STARTS UP?****

go to you sound properties and in your advanced tab change your sound to 24 bit 44100 KHz and it will no longer crash and you can play

new problem

*** ARE YOU STUCK ON THE MAIN MISSION WHERE YOU HAVE TO TALK TO ESGERD AND HE DOESNT HAVE A VOICE AND NEVER OPENS THE DOOR?""****

simply download the ap ""OBMM"" (oblivion mod manager)run it as an adminstrator and go to you skyrim data folder (located inside skyrim instal directory) and extract voiceextra.BSA or whatever is closest to that

another one:

*** DURING THE ALDOINS BANE QUEST, AFTER YOU READ THE ELDER SCROLL DO YOU GET STUCK AFTER THEY KILL THE DRAGON AND AFTER THEY DO THE SHORT DIALOUGE AND THE NPCS STAND THERE FOREVER?***

after you read the eldor scroll, simply dont touch the mouse or press any buttons until you hear aldoins voice

new one

*** WHEN TRYING TO MOUNT THE IMAGE, DOES IT SAY YOUR MISSING A DLL OR SOME SHIT?****

you do not mount the iso thats in the folder with all the other files in it. open WinRaR and open one of the files that have like ""001"" extension or whatever. click it ONE time and then click extract file. whenits done extracting THATS the image you mount, not the first one you see."
,Adroidx,2011-11-15T00:26Z,"Hey guys, it might be a stupid question but I've tried everything already!

I'm playing Skyrim on my Macbook Pro i5 (bootcamp) and everything is working perfect except for the spells.
If I cast for example a fire spell, i see a very light fireflare but not the real deal like i'd supposed to see.

It's pretty annoying since I can't see spells like ""Show me the way"".

I dl'd this, AND the RazorDOX update.  I installed the game, then put in the update before I started playing it.  I have not had a problem.

There are a few issues that need to be patched.  Nothing that is game breaking though.  If you know how to use Google, you can find the 1 fix for a quest bug  Not to mention I posted a link to the forum I found the fix for it at.

As far as the red triangle thing, I have no clue lol.  They posted on the TES forums that ATI has not issued an update for graphics drivers yet.  Do not run Crossfire!  NVidia has updated drivers since the day before release."

,bigolcalooby,2011-11-15T07:21Z,"I can't believe how many people, file sharers included, misuse the word ""stealing."" 

When you steal something from someone, that something is gone; they no longer have it in their possession. When you download copyrighted material, you're just copying something. The original is not lost.

At most, you could say that copyright infringement causes a potential loss of potential profit. I say that because it's not even guaranteed that the file sharer would have been able to buy the product to begin with. That's why it's only a potential loss of potential profit.

However, would you really go so far to claim that losing something that you never had to begin with equates to theft? Do you believe that whenever someone walks past you on the sidewalk and does not give you all of their money (which would be money that you could have had), that that is theft? 

I wouldn't. Now, I'm sure there are a few definitions of the word ""stealing"" that fit copyright infringement. But I will say that those definitions are misleading to begin with. When you tell someone that someone else stole from you, the first thing that they will likely think is that someone took something from you and you no longer have said something in your possession. That is why it is misleading.

Whether or not you think copyright infringement is ""harmful"" is a completely different matter. At least call it what it is--copyright infringement. And even that depends on the country that you live in.

(Although, I also think it's a stretch to say that the potential loss of potential profit equates to actual ""harm."" But that is a story for another day.)"

,Tezukann,2011-11-15T11:12Z,"*** DO YOU HAVE LAG? ***

Skyrim, contrary to what many people are thinking right now, is not a very demanding game. Simply put, if you can run oblivion, youll more than be able to run skyrim, do to it being very well optimized.

You'll only need a very medium machine to be able to run it on high settings with AA and AF off on a decent res (1024x800) or so

by medium im suggesting a computer ranging from 500-600$ of recently made computers (if you bought your computer a few years ago when you had bought it chances are when i say medium i would mean high end computer back then, probably around 1k or so)
only two reasons; your hardware needs to be more powerful

having said that, theres two things thatll give you lag right now. not saying that every person would have either/or these problems as there may be some that affect less 1% of people who have the game

First thing you need to do, make sure you drivers are up to date

if your AMD/radeon user, google ""AMD autodetect"" and use that to find your best driver for you video card.

not aware of a intel/gforce official autodetect software such as the amd has, so i suggest you go to gforce official website and browse for your best driver available. 

check for ram and cpu driver updates as well, but dont be fooled into downloading a driver detect software that detects if theyre out of date but makes you pay for downloading the drivers!

updating drivers may result in FPS in ALL your games, not just skyrim (not just 5 or 6 fps, im talking about 20 - 30 fps.  the mmo rift, for example, many people experience a 30fps boost after downloading their best drivers)

if that doesnt work, then most likely your video just isnt powerful enough (and possibly your other hardware)
"
,Tezukann,2011-11-15T11:17Z,"**NOTE**

note that if you go to your windows control panel> device manager> and right clicking a part and using the ""update driver software"" that it may not be accurate. check the official websites yourself. 

a lot of users have out-of-date drivers because windows is telling them they already have the most recent drivers"

System:
i7 2630QM, 2-2.9GHz.
6B RAM.
High end graphics card.


I mount the .iso via Daemon Tools, no problem. I install via ""install.exe"" (no sign of any installer.exe). It does not seem to encounter any problems while going through this installation process, but once the installation has apparently finished, it open the intended install location folder, in which there is nothing but a shortcut to the game (which does not work, error: Application load error 5:0000065434). This occurs every time I attempt installation, and the error message appears whether I copy the crack to the folder or not.

It's rather infuriating to follow the instructions and it still not to work, so if anyone knows how to solve this, please let me know. I'll try to keep checking here in case anyone replies."

If so, you probably just need to change the audio out to DirectX while you play the game. I have an old M-Audio Delta 44, which uses ASIO or DirectX. Sometimes I have to manually change the audio ""device"" in an application (such as VLC) from ASIO to DirectX because the app doesn't support ASIO."

,bllorx,2011-11-16T00:19Z,"--- Before anything else, DOWNLOAD the patch: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6809702/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Update_1_Repack-RazorDOX ---

1. Open whatever folder you chose to save the download to. You'll see a 'rzr-skrm' folder, open it.

**NOTE: If you already know how to open an ISO, skip this step.**
2. The 'rzr-skrm.iso' file is a ""virtual"" copy of the physical DVD; so, obviously it needs a ""virtual"" DVD drive. You need a program that can create virtual DVD drives to load virtual DVDs in ISO file format. I used MagicDisc. Daemon Tools would also work. There are probably torrents for both apps here on TPB.

3. After loading the ISO, open 'Computer'/'My Computer' and RIGHT-CLICK on the virtual drive and select 'Explore'. Don't double-click on the drive. Depending on your settings, Windows would autorun the ""disc"", which launches the wrong installer. 'Explore' opens the ISO in a window so you can see the files in the ISO.

4. In the ISO, you'll see a 'Razor1911' folder and a bunch of files. IMPORTANT: Double-click 'INSTALL.EXE' to start the Razor installer. DON'T click/run 'setup.exe'. Leave the ISO drive window open. The 'Razor1911' folder contains the crack files you'll need to copy after install is finished.

**NOTE: ** If asked for SID during install, click 'Browse' and go to 'Computer'/'My Computer' and single-click on the ISO drive to select it as the location of the SID. You shouldn't need to browse into any of the folders or select any files.**

5. During the installation, it asks where to install the game. If left at the default, make note of the folder location so you know where to paste the cracked files AND the patch files into. After the install finishes, open that folder.

6. Go back to the ISO drive window and open the 'Razor1911' folder. Select and copy EVERYTHING in the 'Razor1911' folder (press CTRL+A to ""select all"", then CTRL+C to copy everything selected). 

**NOTE: The next step overwrites some original/non-cracked game files. If you're paranoid, back these up by copy/pasting into some other folder -OR- rename to something like 'SkyrimLauncherOriginal.exe' BEFORE pasting.**

7. Go back to the game install folder, paste the copied files (CTRL+v). [Unless you moved/renamed those identical files as mentioned above,] Windows will show a message saying the destination has files with the same name. Click on 'Overwrite'/'Replace'. DON'T RUN THE GAME YET.

**NOTE: Leave the game install window open, you're going to paste the patch files into it. Close the ISO window, or use it for the next step.**

8. Open the folder where you saved the patch mentioned in Step 1, then open the 'The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Update_1_Repack-RazorDOX' folder.

9. Again, you'll select/copy EVERYTHING in the patch folder/paste into the game install folder, then overwrite/replace when prompted. (YES, this overwrites some of the crack files pasted earlier; this step is just to make instructions easier. Feel free to skip pasting the first set [in Step 7] if you're keeping track of which files are involved.)

10. All done! In the game install window, double-click on SkyrimLauncher.exe to start the game."
,bllorx,2011-11-16T00:22Z,"@wesely666 : Does it always crash at the same part of the game, or just randomly after about 10 mins? If it's random, it's probably your hardware (video card overheating? Not enough RAM? etc)."

Anyone? (I'm playing on a 15 inch Macbook pro i5 with bootcamp)

And the second problem has to do with the dual wielding. (Especially magic)
I cant fast change with my right hand, when something is in it, it stays there. I can only switch the magic on the left, but if I for example have Ice in my right hand and fire in my left hand, i cannot make it double fire.
I first have to wield a sword in my right hand, drop it, and switch to fire then.

Anyone knows how to fix these problems?

Thanks!"

Sounds like your using wrong audio channels settings for your actual audio device. Are you using headphones or stereo system?
If you try to play unencoded surround through stereo it may be playing back left/right channels through what is suposed to be front left/right or some such type of thing.
Check all your game/operating system/driver settings according to the actual device specifications."

,Shin_Mazinger,2011-11-16T17:26Z,"To give some people some insight because no one is answering..this does work with Win 7x64. Do not run any installer other than Razors. If you ran Steams, it will mess up the install. When you install from Razor installer, NOT the setup.exe, it will unpack to the default drive. It looks like it doesn't actually install to Windows as it took like 1 minute to unpack the contents to the C drive, that is why there is no uninstall from Add/Remove and why you get compatibility warning after install, telling you it may not have installed correctly. I got the same scenarios. It installs and runs from the folder. To remove you will have to manually uninstall it. I already searched the registry and do not find any keys relating to Elder Scrolls. This looks like it runs from the folder directly and not as an actual install in Windows. "

When you log out the settings do revert back to default. You need to right-click your skyrim shortcut (properties->compatability tab->Run This program as administrator) Windows doesnt seem to save your settings, so running ur game as admin will save your setting pref !

Tried this as well as right clicking icon and selecting Run as Admin. Unfortunately running as Admin will not let me remap keys to mouse controls, such as sprint to mouse 4 or sneak to Mouse 3. When you go to remap, it doesn't accept the mouse press, it just sits there waiting for a key remap. It will map to other keyboard keys or mouse 1 and 2. So run as Admin doesn't work right."

I have had Steam for years, still have it installed and it doesn't interfere with this game or any others I have installed. You must not be executing the right .exe. Do not start setup.exe, that will prompt a Steam install. Execute the Installer.exe with the ""R"" in the icon."

,Shin_Mazinger,2011-11-17T17:58Z,"@MuzzLFC
Ok I do know for some reasons, permissions on Windows 7 are screwing things up for some people. If you installed without ""Run as Admin"" then there should be no permissions. When you click the icon to run the game, it should just run.

I NEVER use a virtual drive to mount and install. Use Winrar, get the free version, and extract the .iso file into a folder to your desktop or another storage drive. The Windows UAC could be interfering with the install.You will now have every game file extracted. Open the Installer.exe, do not right click and Run as Admin, just run it. Let it unpack and go through the directx part. When done, copy all the contents from the Razor folder to the default install path. I suggest you also download the Razor repack, either the 200mb or the zipped 128mb one. Copy the files from the repack to the game folder.

""Skyrim has an issue with sound hardware that may cause a crash as soon as you get into the menu. 
If you get this problem, go to your hardware and sound config and drop down to 24 bits, 48000hz.

The problem should then be solved.

The torrent itself is fine, always quality from Razor 1911.""

Not a fix for me. I have that problem on XP. Im running an Emu0404 soundcard and it wont start up no matter what settings im using. And if i switch over to the onboard soundcard there is no option to change the sound sample rate."
,t0bao,2011-11-18T00:13Z,"@Agfafa
How to fix crash problems after seeing the Skyrim logo:

1. Go to your control panel

2. Press on sound.

3. Find your speaker and right click it and choose properties.

4. Go to advanced and choose 24bit, 44100 Hz (studio quality).

5. Press save/use.

6. Open Skyrim and VOLEA!

You can copy this and paste it if someone elves experiences the same problem.

the crack is located in the iso you downloaded. its the 4 files inside the razor 1911 folder. you copy those and place them into the installation folder.

the installation folder is usually 

C:\Program files\The Elder Scrolls V skyrim

or if your 64 bit

C:\Program files (x86)\The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim

paste them in that folder and copy over all the files."

The way to solve this is to actually change your sound settings to 24 bit etc. But this feature is absolutely unavailable on XP.

,zhfyisafe,2011-11-20T07:22Z,"Hi people,

I registered just to comment because I think it's important. I was one of those people having problems with installing the game, it would give an error message about elevated privileges so I would run it as administrator then it would say it could not find the simpack.dll file. Also, it would ask to install adobe flash player - this is a virus.

I didn't realize it was a virus until later. Now I'll explain how I installed the game. I moved the simpack.dll file from the install dvd to my windows directory. Next, the razor install program wanted zlib1.dll so I moved that over too. Finally the install program game up, but now it couldn't find the sid file and it did not ask me for a directory either - the program just crashed.

I was frustrated that I could not find any comments that helped in my situation but I had to press on because this is Skyrim. I discovered that if I ran the install program not as administrator and left the error message up, a copy of the install program is placed under AppData\Local\Temp\IXP000.TMP. I copied this folder and upon closing the error message the IXP000.TMP was deleted automatically. Evidence of a virus: the razor install program (install.exe) I copied from the temp folder is 370 KB, the same program from the install dvd is 615 KB. And the install program I copied does not run adobe flash installer like the one from the install dvd does.

Anyway, after copying the files: install.exe (370 KB), setup.dat, simpack.dll, zlib1.dll, the sim, sis and sid files to a separate directory I was able to install without a problem - at the end the install program seemed to crash but the game installed alright. After that I download and used Skyrim Update 1 and the game played perfectly.

When not playing the game and browsing the web I noticed the virus right away - I was getting popups from nowhere. Anything that used Javascript didn't work right. PING.EXE was running up to 99% of my processor. So I reinstalled Windows 7 64-bit. But I made the same mistake - running the infected install.exe program from the Skyrim install dvd.

I tested the Skyrim install files I copied, the not infected install.exe I copied is able to install Skyrim without mounting the install dvd. So I'm going to reinstall Windows again and install Skyrim from that.

This is a request for comments. I want to know about your install.exe filesizes and if you experience that weird adobe flash installer (don't do it). Check your temp directory for the IXP000.TMP too please."

,j0nnyboy,2011-11-21T11:29Z,"A reminder to buy this game, From a Pirate:

""I'm from a generation of gaming where demos were standard, anti-piracy involved typing a line from the manual, and game modding or alterations were encouraged by the developers.

Times have changed, for better or worse, and I've found myself adapting to retain my old habits. Games are pirated before purchasing, in an attempt to determine what is worth more than viral hype. DRM is cracked even with legitimate copies to avoid gameplay interruptions or limitations. Modding is a black-art and to be frank it's becoming more difficult. There's less spirit and imagination in most modern games and companies, while a few newer ones remind us of times that were fantastic (Shadow of the Colossus, Skyrim).

I've set the stage above to mention something that is always the source of controversy: If you pirated the game, like I initially did, and ended up enjoying yourself, I urge you to pay for the game just as I now have. Not because it is the Right Thing To Do, but because if you want to encourage the behavior and quality of what Bethesda offers then the most vocal method is with your wallet.

Bethesda is usually light on DRM and quick to resolve DRM-related issues, including the removal of CD/DVD checks on older games. The company has always been a fond supporter of the modding community and to this day encourages everything from new mechanics to new items, or even a complete rebuild of the world itself.

Are they perfect? No, every company has skeletons in the closet. Is Skyrim perfect? Of course not, it has issues that need ironing out. But both carry the spirit of the older generation of gaming and development that brought us depth, support, understanding, immersion, and our fondest memories.

So, at the risk of the upcoming debate, I say again: If you enjoyed Skyrim, and what Bethesda stands for as a company, pay for the game and show them that this is the direction we want for the future of the next generation."""

Thanks :)"
,chip211,2011-11-21T15:47Z,"i found the solution to the rat quest bug

BUG: in the quest ""The Cornered Rat"" you'll find Esbern behind a closed door. When you interact with the door it will start a conversation with Esbern where he is ultimately suppose to open the door and let you in. The problem is that his dialog is bugged and his voice doesnt play causing his text to scroll past very quickly, then after the dialog, he doesn't open the door.

SOLUTION: In your install directory there is a file ""\Data\Skyrim - VoicesExtra.bsa"". You need to download the BSA Unpacker tool made for Morrowind. It will still work properly for the Skyrim BSA files. Use it ant extract the contents of that BSA to the same directory that the BSA file is. You'll end up extracting the files and they'll be placed in the directory ""Data\sound\voice\skyrim.esm\maleuniqueesbern"". After that, you're done. Just start the game up and try again."

How the hell do you change your sound settings?
Xp does not have this feature! Im running 2 different cards and both of them wont let me change a thing. My normal sound card simply gives you a ""sample rate conversion quality"" Nothing more then a slider that goes from Bad quality to best and does not tell you a sample rate. I tried running the game on each of the settings and nothing.

My next card Emu0404 has 44100 and 4800 yet the game does not work on Either of these settings! So unless I have to go out and buy an entire new PC I wont buy this game and I would have wasted it if i did otherwise."

There will be 2 values to modify h 480 and w 640
just modify the numbers to set the screen how you want, enjoy : ) * didn't set my to 1600x900 because the windowed mode has a bar at the top which is an inch or so big so in turn I couldn't see the bottom inch of the screen so I used something slightly smaller."

,chuckdm,2011-11-22T05:48Z,"In addition to my earlier comment...

Just wanted to add that the AI in Skyrim (I forget what they call it, bit it dynamically creates quests, locations, even enemy combat tactics on the fly) works amazingly well.  The primary story missions are fairly scripted, but everything else seems to regenerate every time you play.  Two examples of this:

1. There's a quest to recover a sword that's a family heirloom.  Out of 4 playthroughs (partial, haven't finished the game yet) it has been located in 3 different places.  The two times it was in the same  place I still had different enemies - once archers, once mages.

2. On my first playthrough attempt I went with a destruction magic user.  I quickly found out most of the enemies I fought would throw up wards, forcing me to cast two separate spells and time my release carefully.  When I started my second playthrough, I went with a simi-warrior using heavy armor and dual wielded conjured swords.  Most of my enemies started battles by blocking with their own weapon to counter my blows, especially power attacks.  This meant I had to do several basic hits and expend their blocking before I launched a power attack.  I've since used some cheats and now have a character with maxed all skills and heavy armor, using a combination of the conjured swords and bows, and (usually) fire spells, or whatever is best for the specific battle.  Nevertheless, many enemies are proving adaptable and I have died 3 times in just over 4 hours - with cheats, the best heavy armor in the game, maxed skills, and level 1 (so mobs are generated for a level 1 character.)  Yet, this game is a freaking blast.

So yeah, torrent it all day, but please, buy this like I did.  Best money I've spent on a game since Mass Effect 2."

any ideas?"
,eddyrayy,2011-11-22T09:59Z,"@wetstes001

Heres detailed instructions on what to do to play this game. First and foremost, this download is legit. I can confirm this. Everything you need is here. 
1. ONCE you download the file, you will need to MOUNT the ISO to a virtual drive. This is made possible with a program such as Daemon Tools.
(the file you've downloaded is basically a ""virtual DvD"" and you need a ""Virtual drive"" to play the virtual disc.)
2. After step 1, you will go into ""My Computer"", right click your virtual drive (should see SKYRIM_EN) and select ""Open"". Fifth icon from the top of the list should be ""Install"". You double click this and it will prompt the install. You Install.
3. Once installed a window with a single shortcut should pop-up. Disregard this and close. What you do now is go BACK INTO the ""virtual drive"" go into the folder titled ""Razor1911"" which should be the top folder, and copy all the FILES INSIDE THE FOLDER! (Do NOT copy the FOLDER, but the FILES INSIDE THE FOLDER)
4. You should have copied the 4 files inside the ""Razor1911"" folder, now you go to where you installed Skyrim. Should be in ""PROGRAM FILES"" on your hard drive. You open the folder titled ""The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim"" and you will see a list of more files. 
5. Last step to take is to paste the 4 files you copied earlier into that list. It will ask if you want to OVERWRITE the current files, and you will say ""YES!""
6. Once you have overwritten those files, you will double click the ""Launcher"" file in your ""The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim"" folder.If you followed my instructions, you should already be in that folder. The game will start up, and SUCCESS! You did it!

Hope that helps."

Don't bother arguing with me now, I'm doing a Game production and designing course, and we looked at skyrim for a bit. Yes this is an amazing game but it is flawed, and people pirate  because of several reasons, my reason is I don't have the money to buy the game right now,  but as soon as I do I will buy it as I want to support companies like this, so people who moan about piracy... on pirate bay are in my opinion.. un-educated.

So , what i did was , 

- Transfer the ISO file to another pc ( using network lan , hdd , dvd, usb , or what ever you want to use ) 

- Instal the game there (I've installed it on my ''old'' laptop win 7 32 bits , and it went flawless.)

- I didn't use the crack only transferred the instal folders to my new pc

- Then i used the update patch ( to be found on piratebay)

- And after that EVERYthing went perfectly !

error: application load error5:0000065434

please help
"
,eddyrayy,2011-11-23T04:04Z,"@Boxchan and everyone else who doesn't seem to be able to use common sense and/or read previous comments, i'll post this for the like millionth time.

Heres detailed instructions on what to do to play this game. First and foremost, this download is legit. I can confirm this. Everything you need is here. 
1. ONCE you download the file, you will need to MOUNT the ISO to a virtual drive. This is made possible with a program such as Daemon Tools.
(the file you've downloaded is basically a ""virtual DvD"" and you need a ""Virtual drive"" to play the virtual disc.)
2. After step 1, you will go into ""My Computer"", right click your virtual drive (should see SKYRIM_EN) and select ""Open"". Fifth icon from the top of the list should be ""Install"". You double click this and it will prompt the install. You Install.
3. Once installed a window with a single shortcut should pop-up. Disregard this and close. What you do now is go BACK INTO the ""virtual drive"" go into the folder titled ""Razor1911"" which should be the top folder, and copy all the FILES INSIDE THE FOLDER! (Do NOT copy the FOLDER, but the FILES INSIDE THE FOLDER)
4. You should have copied the 4 files inside the ""Razor1911"" folder, now you go to where you installed Skyrim. Should be in ""PROGRAM FILES"" on your hard drive. You open the folder titled ""The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim"" and you will see a list of more files. 
5. Last step to take is to paste the 4 files you copied earlier into that list. It will ask if you want to OVERWRITE the current files, and you will say ""YES!""
6. Once you have overwritten those files, you will double click the ""Launcher"" file in your ""The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim"" folder.If you followed my instructions, you should already be in that folder. The game will start up, and SUCCESS! You did it!

Hope that helps.

Now will someone please help me with my problem. my drivers are completely up to date, my sound quality is set to 24Bits (i even tried lowering it), and i did download the update for the game, however i'm getting lag that's making the game more than unplayable, and all the fog is showing up as giant squares that are nearly filling the screen. i can't seem to find a surefire solution to this so any help would be much appreciated because i can't play the game until i fix this ):"

,Pottu,2011-11-25T17:13Z,"im v7 user, dont know how it works on earlyer versions.

Have steam installed. (Dont copy&past the crack files to Steam directory.  Past them to your installed Game directory)
Have up todate drivers.
Read the intall info text.
i use Daemon Tools to mount the iso file.
get the update 
The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Update 1 Repack-RazorDOX
i use the unziped version. 222.85 MiB (233675883 Bytes)

if you get file missing. might be that you have interrupted the dl to early eg. 99.9%,
allways wait fully out whit the dl.
and hopfully keep it going for as long as you can.
if problem. delete it and dl again

Give SkyrimLauncher.exe admin rights
run it as admin when you start the game file.

when your game start but then stops (or are just thinking, nothing happend).
 That can be that your AntiVirus dont have the rights to run the file. 
you need to give the righs to run the game file.
i got this also when my L4d2 update and my AV ask again to let L4d2 file run.
(it stops, nothing happen, just thinging in loading screen) i [alt]+[tab] to windows and allow it to pass and game starts again.
if you dont get the choice menu up. just check the allowed program list if its blocked or not.

block the game to enter internet by blocking it whit firewall
(i pull the cable from my router also.)

lower the game option grafic qualitÃ©/resolution if its to heavy for your card to handle.
eg:
Antialiasing and Anisotropic Filtering ""off"" for best preformence.
then work your way up to the propper stats that your card can handle.

if your garfic card uses Anti-aliasing mode. use Adaptive Multi-Sample AA, its balanced mode.
in your grafic card ability you have also ""Antialiasing and Anisotropic Filtering"" put them to Application managed as you ""tweak"" them in the game start option menu
vertical sync ""off"" unless program says it needs to use it
just things like that that helps you to find good balance.

if you get problem. uninstall and restart pc and install it to different direction (not realy nessesery but i do like that.)

hope this gives you some ide where to start looking up for your issues.

,Cel2ic,2011-11-25T22:10Z,"@ wizzmann:

quote: ""I don't get it. The crack.dir does not show up, it does not exist. I mount the img and there is no installer.exe. There is a steam setup, a .sim and a few .sids, then just a bunch of junk then a resources folder. Why am I not seeing a crack.dir?""

This bit of information I'm about to tell you will likely help you with future torrents as well.

When you mount the img file (using Daemon or something similar), right click on the disk icon in My Computer and click Explore (win xp) or Open ""win 7""

You will see the contents of the virtual Skyrim CD. Included in those contents will be a Razor folder -- that is your crack folder.

(In other torrents, sometimes it will be labeled something else, like ""crack"" or ""skidrow,"" etc...)

Good luck!"

,dovakin,2011-11-27T13:18Z,"Heres detailed instructions on what to do to play this game. First and foremost, this download is legit. I can confirm this. Everything you need is here.
1. ONCE you download the file, you will need to MOUNT the ISO to a virtual drive. This is made possible with a program such as Daemon Tools.
(the file you've downloaded is basically a ""virtual DvD"" and you need a ""Virtual drive"" to play the virtual disc.)
2. After step 1, you will go into ""My Computer"", right click your virtual drive (should see SKYRIM_EN) and select ""Open"". Fifth icon from the top of the list should be ""Install"". You double click this and it will prompt the install. You Install.
3. Once installed a window with a single shortcut should pop-up. Disregard this and close. What you do now is go BACK INTO the ""virtual drive"" go into the folder titled ""Razor1911"" which should be the top folder, and copy all the FILES INSIDE THE FOLDER! (Do NOT copy the FOLDER, but the FILES INSIDE THE FOLDER)
4. You should have copied the 4 files inside the ""Razor1911"" folder, now you go to where you installed Skyrim. Should be in ""PROGRAM FILES"" on your hard drive. You open the folder titled ""The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim"" and you will see a list of more files.
5. Last step to take is to paste the 4 files you copied earlier into that list. It will ask if you want to OVERWRITE the current files, and you will say ""YES!""
6. Once you have overwritten those files, you will double click the ""Launcher"" file in your ""The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim"" folder.If you followed my instructions, you should already be in that folder. The game will start up, and SUCCESS! You did it!

Hope that helps.

ive played this game for little over a week done the main story if u follow these details it will install and play its not as complicated as it looks just follow it step by step.

this will help u if u follow it dont get excited and try to run it before u crack it and for those of u struggling with the esbern quest there is a downloader just google the quest name and ul find a unloader that unpacks a lot of the voices as they wont be fully unpacked in the install its not a problem with this version its the same in the retail version 

also if u own one use the xbox controller to play this it makes the games interface easier to navigate and easier to use"

You install the game by running the setup, after you installed it you have to open the Iso file with a program called Poweriso. Then you will see a folder called crack. Then you should go to the folder where you installed Skyrim, and drag and drop the files from the crack folder to your installation directory. Press Copy and Replace and then you are good to go! This should stop any startup error."

,Hellsheroes,2011-12-03T23:09Z,"Heres detailed instructions on what to do to play this game. First and foremost, this download is legit. I can confirm this. Everything you need is here.
1. ONCE you download the file, you will need to MOUNT the ISO to a virtual drive. This is made possible with a program such as Daemon Tools.
(the file you've downloaded is basically a ""virtual DvD"" and you need a ""Virtual drive"" to play the virtual disc.)
2. After step 1, you will go into ""My Computer"", right click your virtual drive (should see SKYRIM_EN) and select ""Open"". Fifth icon from the top of the list should be ""Install"". You double click this and it will prompt the install. You Install.
3. Once installed a window with a single shortcut should pop-up. Disregard this and close. What you do now is go BACK INTO the ""virtual drive"" go into the folder titled ""Razor1911"" which should be the top folder, and copy all the FILES INSIDE THE FOLDER! (Do NOT copy the FOLDER, but the FILES INSIDE THE FOLDER)
4. You should have copied the 4 files inside the ""Razor1911"" folder, now you go to where you installed Skyrim. Should be in ""PROGRAM FILES"" on your hard drive. You open the folder titled ""The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim"" and you will see a list of more files.
5. Last step to take is to paste the 4 files you copied earlier into that list. It will ask if you want to OVERWRITE the current files, and you will say ""YES!""
6. Once you have overwritten those files, you will double click the ""Launcher"" file in your ""The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim"" folder.If you followed my instructions, you should already be in that folder. The game will start up, and SUCCESS! You did it!

Hope that helps.

I've skimmed through the 50+ PAGES of comments and haven't found any sort of fix. Sorry if there was one and I happened to skim past it. I know I would really appreciate, as well as MANY other people who have voiced the same problem, if anyone could kindly give us any ideas on how to fix it that isn't ""update your graphics card"".

,mot1ve,2011-12-05T21:07Z,"Heres detailed instructions on what to do to play this game. First and foremost, this download is legit. I can confirm this. Everything you need is here.
1. ONCE you download the file, you will need to MOUNT the ISO to a virtual drive. This is made possible with a program such as Daemon Tools.
(the file you've downloaded is basically a ""virtual DvD"" and you need a ""Virtual drive"" to play the virtual disc.)
2. After step 1, you will go into ""My Computer"", right click your virtual drive (should see SKYRIM_EN) and select ""Open"". Fifth icon from the top of the list should be ""Install"". You double click this and it will prompt the install. You Install.
3. Once installed a window with a single shortcut should pop-up. Disregard this and close. What you do now is go BACK INTO the ""virtual drive"" go into the folder titled ""Razor1911"" which should be the top folder, and copy all the FILES INSIDE THE FOLDER! (Do NOT copy the FOLDER, but the FILES INSIDE THE FOLDER)
4. You should have copied the 4 files inside the ""Razor1911"" folder, now you go to where you installed Skyrim. Should be in ""PROGRAM FILES"" on your hard drive. You open the folder titled ""The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim"" and you will see a list of more files.
5. Last step to take is to paste the 4 files you copied earlier into that list. It will ask if you want to OVERWRITE the current files, and you will say ""YES!""
6. Once you have overwritten those files, you will double click the ""Launcher"" file in your ""The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim"" folder.If you followed my instructions, you should already be in that folder. The game will start up, and SUCCESS! You did it!

Hope that helps.

Thank you so much!

I've written out comprehensive install instructions for all you other nubs out there.  Feel free to improve them.

1. Delete any Skyrim files you might have installed incorrectly.  Thereâ€™s probably a folder in Program Files called â€œThe Elder Scrolls V Skyrimâ€.  If so, delete it.  But make sure not to delete the original file you downloaded!)

2. Download MagicDisk (itâ€™s free!) http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-magicdisc-overview.htm
Use MagicDisk to mount the .iso file on a virtual drive (probably drive E, but I donâ€™t think it matters)

3. Go to My Computer, the virtual drive should appear (as if you had inserted the Skyrim disk)
Right-click the Skyrim drive and select â€œExploreâ€ 
(double-clicking the drive might set off some sort of auto run that you donâ€™t want)
 You are now inside the mounted iso.  Look for an install.exe and use it to install the game.

4. Once the game has installed, go back inside the mounted iso.  Here you should see a folder called â€œRazor1911â€, open it.  (this is the crack)
Here you should find four files, copy them.
Go to Program Files and look for a folder called â€œThe Elder Scrolls V Skyrimâ€
Paste the copied files into this folder.  It will ask if you want to replace the files in that folder.  Click â€œYes to allâ€

5. You can now launch the game from SkyrimLauncher.exe in the â€œThe Elder Scrolls V Skyrimâ€ folder in Program files.  

Enjoy Skyrim!

Find the disc image and open it in Damon Tools, push the 'mount' button and it mounts and automatically starts the install procedure. Lastly, what's with all the goofy symbols everywhere making it half impossible to read?

,Chuckfist,2011-12-08T11:42Z,"@ Mouze14 umm...dual-core running XP...don't be proud of that. First, try to stay clear of the ""minimum requirements"" you have minimum shit, you play with minimum shit. If you don't want to sacrifice quality, then upgrade your computer to quad-core, get an i5 or i7. Get 6gb or more ram, get a decent graphics card..which, by the way, you should have mentioned thus can tell what you card is capable of doing, get the fuck off XP. The system structure of XP is crap and sluggish. Vista is shit. Get windows 7.
To reduce lag, since you don't want to lose quality, with the shit you are using, you can try closing non essential background apps. ""end process"" apps you don't need and remove them from startup or under RUN under regedit.
In my view, that is a dumb question to ask ""reduce lag without losing quality and running game with hardware of minimum requirements"" :D"
,Arakhtos,2011-12-08T12:57Z,"Hi ok im having a problem with this torrent if any1 has any solutions please post them.

so i have been reading that most people are having problems once they have installed it i am having problems trying to install it below is the order i try install it in.

i don't extract the iso from the zip i go straight to daemon tools then virtual drivers click the one that is supplied mount the skyrim iso a install window pops up i click install then i click where i want to install it to and then click next after about 5 seconds of installing a message pops up saying: Make sure you are using the correct decryption key, then has a ok button below i click ok then after about 10 seconds another message pops up saying : There is no disk in the drive. Please insert disk into drive F:.
then has 3 buttons cancel, try again and continue i tried clicking all 3 same message appears straight after even cancel i need to spam like 30 times before the thing closes then comes up with a please insert the disk called ""disk 2"" with buttons retry and cancel both close the installer

note i also installed steam before i tried installing skyrim would this be the problem?"
,druidlock,2011-12-08T13:10Z,"So I mounted ""rzr-skrm.iso"" using Daemon Tools. I run ""Install.exe"". The Razor1911 Installer pops up. I click ""Install"". At Skyrim - Meshes.bsa (1.42Gb), I get an error ""Make sure you are using the correct decryption key"". I click ""OK"". At Voices.bsa (1.36Gb), I get an error ""There is no disk in the drive. Please insert a disk into drive G:."". I noticed the virtual drive ejected itself :S. Re-mounting does not work.
I also tried copying the who DVD to a local drive and running it from there (can't eject my local drive lol), but the file ""The Elder Scrolls V- Skyrim_disk1_3.sid"" cannot be copied as the virtual disk ejects itself.
If anyone can provide information as to how I can resolve this issue, I would greatly appreciate that.

Cheers"

1. ONCE you download the file, you will need to MOUNT the ISO to a virtual drive. This is made possible with a program such as Daemon Tools.
(the file you've downloaded is basically a ""virtual DvD"" and you need a ""Virtual drive"" to play the virtual disc.)
2. After step 1, you will go into ""My Computer"", right click your virtual drive (should see SKYRIM_EN) and select ""Open"". Fifth icon from the top of the list should be ""Install"". You double click this and it will prompt the install. You Install.
3. Once installed a window with a single shortcut should pop-up. Disregard this and close. What you do now is go BACK INTO the ""virtual drive"" go into the folder titled ""Razor1911"" which should be the top folder, and copy all the FILES INSIDE THE FOLDER! (Do NOT copy the FOLDER, but the FILES INSIDE THE FOLDER)
4. You should have copied the 4 files inside the ""Razor1911"" folder, now you go to where you installed Skyrim. Should be in ""PROGRAM FILES"" on your hard drive. You open the folder titled ""The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim"" and you will see a list of more files.
5. Last step to take is to paste the 4 files you copied earlier into that list. It will ask if you want to OVERWRITE the current files, and you will say ""YES!""
6. Once you have overwritten those files, you will double click the ""Launcher"" file in your ""The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim"" folder.If you followed my instructions, you should already be in that folder. The game will start up, and SUCCESS! "

To un-gray the ""Data Files"" text on you're launcher you must Add ""bEnableFileSelection=1"" to launcher section in your ""skyrimprefs.ini"" file.

Mine was located in: (example)
c:/Your User/My Documents/My Games/Skyrim/Skyrimprefs.ini


Edit said INI file by adding bEnableFileSelection=1 after [LAUNCHER] and you will be able to enable ""Data Files"" on the Razor's release.

,angelicfeces,2011-12-19T01:00Z,"Got it up and running and played it to see if it worked, and it did, but the menus would fuck up and not allow me to change anything when I was making my character. As long as I made my character fast and before it would mess up, everything seemed fine. Hopefully there won't be any more happenings like this.
I also noticed that saving through the menu is a little buggy. I would click ""Save"" and it would bring up the menu for a few seconds and just exit it. Again, I can get past it if I just work fast enough."
,icey04585,2011-12-19T01:25Z,"ok i figured it out what u gotta do for those who are having the same issue as me is u must mount the image using a program like poweriso or daemon tools... anyways mount the image then go to my computer and right click the mounted drive should be maybe drive (J) (mine was since the programs Poweriso and daemon tools adds ""Virtual Drives"" J being 1 of them) and click open then double click on the install icon you see it should be the 5th one down and has a R1911 as the icon. then after its done installing (it will look like its frozen during installation quite a few times but its not just let it go it takes like 10-15 mins) find the razor1911 file and open it there should be 4 things in it. 1 says tesv the other says skyrimlauncher and the other 2 are atimgpud.dll and binkw32.dll... left click and drag to highlight all 4 then right click and click cut then go back to your ""my computer"" and double click on the (C) drive and find program files x86 and find the folder named The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim. open the folder and paste all files u just cut into them. then double click on the the skyrimlauncher and BAM the game now works. the problem i posted earlier wFLASHw is fixed when its done this way. so all of you having the issue where u see the box that shows ""Play"" ""Options"" ""Data Files"" Tech Support"" and ""Exit"" and u click play but all it does is reload the same damn box... do what i said above and your issue will be FIXED! this is also whats being said by extremezone in the description but i skipped the step where he said to go into the install folder (the one in the program files x86 folder is the install folder) cuz i thought the way i was opening it was pretty much the same and it wasnt. THIS IS FOR VISTA X64 idk if it works this way for other OS's best of luck with it and have fun with the game."
,icey04585,2011-12-19T01:29Z,"@xbadaboyx ^^^^^do what i just said above it should work then

@ angelicfeces when i was making a character if i moved the persons face it would sometimes stop me from changing any features for the selected category. for exmaple like Head, or body, or race... what u have to do is go back up to the top and click on another category to allow it to become unstuck and u can then continue adjusting the different features but as for your other issue idk i havent had an issue yet with the game except that."

I have burned the torrent onto a disk and have started to download it onto my computer but it has stopped downloading or at least it looks like it has stopped. On comment said it takes about 10 mins for the download but this has been about and hour.  The spot that it has been stuck on is Meshes.bsa (1.42 GB). Any suggestions? Did I burn the torrent wrong, do I even have to burn the torrent on to a disk, can I just open it on my computer right from the torrent file?

p.s. This is my first time torrenting a game."
,below90hz,2011-12-19T06:03Z,"Downloaded the pirate version game, it is awesome. So I just bought it. Please buy it people if you like it. Console games are killing true PC games with watered-down graphics and lets-make-the-game-super-easy-with-tips-every-10-seconds-baby-shit. This game isn't like that, BUT the graphics aren't even giving my system a mild workout with all settings maxed on Ultra. That's on a GTX 560 ti.

I'm tired of paying $200-$300 for a video card only to play a game that can run on consoles with hardware from 2005. BUY THE GAME and give game developers a reason to cater to us PC gamers once again.

(Personally I think game developers would make more money if they'd simply embrace thepiratebay, but they aren't going to, so we gotta give them a reason to wanna make games for us again.)"

Strange problem here: game installs fine and starts normally. However after the initial cutscene where you create your character, when I'm finished the mouse won't work neither on OK nor on cancel. Have to kill game in taskmanager.
Kind of copy protection?

Many people get confused during installing these kind of things, but I always repeat the same process and it works everytime. This is another way you can do it without virtual drives.

1. Download this torrent.
2. Download PowerISO
3. Open the torrent file once it's complete, with PowerISO.
4. Make a folder in your drive/desktop called ""Skyrim"" or ""The Elder Scrolls V - Skyrim"".
5. Go into PowerISO and press CTRL + A to select all the files. 
6. Click the 'Extract' button at the top of PowerISO.
7. Direct it to your 'Skyrim' or 'The Elder Scrolls V - Skyrim' folder.
8. Once it's extracted, go into the folder and run Install.exe
9. Once it's installed, go into the Razor1911 folder and copy everything inside it.
10. When you have copied everything, go back to your skyrim folder and inside your skyrim folder there will be ANOTHER skyrim folder. Double click on that and paste the crack files in there.
11. Overwrite and run SkyrimLauncher.exe

TIP: Create a desktop shortcut by right clicking skyrimlauncher.exe and clicking send > to desktop (create a shortcut). You can then rename it Skyrim and it's just like having the real thing.

TIP 2: Close all the open files you had, and close powerISO.

Hope that helped anyone who was struggling! :)"

1. Download and install an ISO mounting program, I would suggest Daemon Tools Lite, which you can get here:http://www.disc-tools.com/download/daemon

2. Run Daemon Tools Lite, and in the window that opens, click the ""add image"" button on the bottom left. Find and select the .iso file that you've downloaded. Double click the new ""image"" that appears.

3. IF YOU ARE PROMPTED TO RUN AUTORUN.EXE OR ANYTHING OF THE SORT, DON'T. Open up ""my computer"", and right-click the newly added virtual drive. Select ""open"" or ""explore"".

4. Find and run ""Installer.exe"". When you are prompted to select the  SID, find and select the file from the virtual drive. 

5. Allow the game to install.

6. Still in the virtual drive, open the RAZOR1911 folder, and copy everything inside.

7. Find the install directory the game was installed in, and paste all the cracked data into the main folder.

8. Run the game through ""SkyrimLauncher.exe"".

theres 2 very simple ways to resolve this :

1. re-download the latest DirectX package 
2. find yourself a decent registry cleaner or go to www.dll-files.com and download their registry repair app, its only a free trial unless u fancy paying $19.99 for the full version but with the free trial you can fix 115 registry problems free, this means replacing 115 missing dll files and thus, your game now works just fine ;)

Hope i helped :)"
,JonathanBG,2012-01-03T04:51Z,"Instructions for the confused:

Download MagicDisk (itâ€™s free!) http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-magicdisc-overview.htm
Use MagicDisk to mount the .iso file on a virtual drive.

This shows you how to use MagicDisk to mount iso files.
http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-magicdisc-mount.htm

If you go to My Computer, the virtual drive should appear (as if you had inserted the Skyrim disk)

Next, run Install.exe 
I know you can find it inside the mounted iso file but it might run just by double-clicking the drive. It might asks you for an SID file you have to select it on your dvd drive. 

Once the game has installed, go back inside the mounted iso. (Be wary, double-clicking might start the installer again). Inside you should see a folder called â€œRazor1911â€ (this is the crack). Inside you should find four files, copy them.

Go to Program Files and look for a folder called â€œThe Elder Scrolls V Skyrimâ€. Paste the copied files into this folder (this will replace the original files in the folder)

You can now launch the game from SkyrimLauncher.exe in the â€œThe Elder Scrolls V Skyrimâ€ folder in Program files.

Now double click The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim or SkyrimLauncher and click PLAY. 

If the start screen comes up and closes immediately do this next step. Right click your sound icon on your taskbar and click playback devices.  If your speakers are default right click it and click properties. Then click the advanced tab and click the long button to select a sound quality below 24 bit 192000 Hz (Studio Quality).

,Seatown3,2012-01-07T19:52Z,"After messing around with it I finally got it to work. 

1. Download this torrent.
2. Download PowerISO
3. Open the torrent file once it's complete, with PowerISO.
4. Make a folder in your drive/desktop called ""Skyrim"" or ""The Elder Scrolls V - Skyrim"".
5. Go into PowerISO and press CTRL + A to select all the files. 
6. Click the 'Extract' button at the top of PowerISO.
7. Direct it to your 'Skyrim' or 'The Elder Scrolls V - Skyrim' folder.
8. Once it's extracted, go into the folder and run Install.exe
9. Once it's installed, go into the Razor1911 folder and copy everything inside it.
(This is where I got messed up and figured out what to do)
10. When you have copied everything, go to computer, program 86x (if you have win7), skyrim
11. Overwrite the two .ddl folders, skyrim launcher and tsev folder. DO NOT COPY PASTE EVERYTHING INTO THE 2ND SKYRIM FOLDER!

I tryed it the way apple juice said and it just had me at the play menu. But when I copied it into just the first folder you open and not the 2nd skyrim folder it worked! Hope this helps everyone."

Heres detailed instructions on what to do to play this game. First and foremost, this download is legit. I can confirm this. Everything you need is here.
1. ONCE you download the file, you will need to MOUNT the ISO to a virtual drive. This is made possible with a program such as Daemon Tools.
(the file you've downloaded is basically a ""virtual DvD"" and you need a ""Virtual drive"" to play the virtual disc.)
2. After step 1, you will go into ""My Computer"", right click your virtual drive (should see SKYRIM_EN) and select ""Open"". Fifth icon from the top of the list should be ""Install"". You double click this and it will prompt the install. You Install.
3. Once installed a window with a single shortcut should pop-up. Disregard this and close. What you do now is go BACK INTO the ""virtual drive"" go into the folder titled ""Razor1911"" which should be the top folder, and copy all the FILES INSIDE THE FOLDER! (Do NOT copy the FOLDER, but the FILES INSIDE THE FOLDER)
4. You should have copied the 4 files inside the ""Razor1911"" folder, now you go to where you installed Skyrim. Should be in ""PROGRAM FILES"" on your hard drive. You open the folder titled ""The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim"" and you will see a list of more files.
5. Last step to take is to paste the 4 files you copied earlier into that list. It will ask if you want to OVERWRITE the current files, and you will say ""YES!""
6. Once you have overwritten those files, you will double click the ""Launcher"" file in your ""The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim"" folder.If you followed my instructions, you should already be in that folder. The game will start up, and SUCCESS! You did it!

Hope that helps.

this will help u if u follow it dont get excited and try to run it before u crack it and for those of u struggling with the esbern quest there is a downloader just google the quest name and ul find a unloader that unpacks a lot of the voices as they wont be fully unpacked in the install its not a problem with this version its the same in the retail version 

also if u own one use the xbox controller to play this it makes the games interface easier to navigate and easier to use"

,hahahahohoho,2012-01-17T08:10Z,"I downloaded this game on 10-11-11, but was the STEAM DVD. It was a pain but worked too.

Then I got this game the second day (11-11-11), with this extremezone torrent. Perfect like a charm.

First that all, YOU MUST HAVE to install DX and VCRedist, included in the folder after installation to update your OS. I'm running it with WindowsXP SP3 x86.

Patch used 1.3.7.0. No Mods.
Gameplay time: Over 260 hours, no crashes, no saves lost.

Computer Specs:

Pr i3.
4Gb RAM DDR3 (3.17Gb).
GPU Radeon HD 4550 1Gb DDR2.

As you can see is a cheap CPU but this can run Medium-High but in 1024x768 res.

A better CPU will work better, I'm not fan of ULTRA FUK Details because something bad will happen, always.

Extremezone me gusta!
Support TPB Viva la revolucion!"

,dark_illusions,2012-01-23T03:55Z,WayneCM - the answer to that is simple. go into the launcher and have it find your video settings auto cuz the game will do that if u set it to an aspect ratio or something your pc dont work with like for example mine works with 16:10 ratio but the game wont load up if i set it to 16:9 ratio so it might just be your video settings in game so try the launcher thing

Make sure to do that to the skyrim folder in your 'C:/' drive AND your mygames-->Skyrim folder.

Firstly the notes say run isntaller.exe which is wrong.  It should read install.exe.  Secondly I was having problems running install.exe after mounting the image - either i would see the console pop up (referred to as the black window) for a second or I would get an ""element"" error.  To get around this I had to extract the ISO to a folder on my desktop called ""SKYRIM_EN"".  It would not work properly extracted on another drive or from a mounted image.  Hopefully this will save people some hassle and wont have to spend too much time readin through hundreds of posts like i did.  PS.  If you like the program, buy it.  We all deserve to be paid for our jobs."

3. Right Click and chose OPEN.
4. Double Click On 5th file from Top - Install.exe and Dont Touch Setup option
5. Installation begins and takes 10 Minutes
6. After installation, a window opens with Skyrim Shortcut. Ignore and close
7. Again go to My Computer - Virtual Drive. Right Click and Open.
8. Open Folder RAZOR1911
9. Copy the four Files Inside
10. Open the install Directory. My Was C:/Programme Files(x86)/The Elder Scrolls V

13. Play

,ksteven,2012-01-27T10:40Z,"@samseed

Main reason i see people modding right from the would be bug fixes and graphical overhauls.

Those sort of things don't change gameplay, and would also improve frame rate. Also the UI overhaul. It just makes the game look MUCH nicer and play better to fully enjoy the game. Keep in mind the biggest mods out there right now don't affect gameplay or spoil the game in any way, but make it better."

I advise you do the same.

Besides, I'm only playing the torrent to see if I like this and if it will have a lasting appeal. If I really like it (which I currently do), I'm going to buy it off Steam. So I can live with a few bugs for now, if I find any."

Daemon tools makes an imaginary disk, as if you actually have one in your computer and then downloads from it onto your computer. It's just a pretend disk, and once you download from it you no longer need it.

the crack named ""Razor"" i copied it to the drive C: skyrim folder, then, after that, i replaced it right..

then i played the game..

howevr, when i start new game, while riding on the caravan or wheel something the guy on my front opens his mouth however, no subtitles and no audio heard.

another is that, when it reaches the stopping point the guy in front of the masked man, always redo his movements such as moving his head right to left, then right to left, and over and over..

and lastly, the characters on the caravan or on the wheel truck, wont go down, even for 30 minutes of waiting, they won't move out..

can anyone give me a clear definition of what's going on with my skyrim? Thank you.

plus there's no fucking way i'm buying it twice.

i do just want to say, in regards to the drama in the beginning of the comments, why even get on tpb? if your too stupid to even understand the beauty of free file sharing and are actually repeating the idiotic hollywood banter that capitalists shove down your throat... go away.

as a musician, there's no better form of advertisement then just having it available at all times via torrent. the same amount of people are going to buy it if they like it and you end up with a much larger fan base. fuck all this intellectual property rights shit as the argument against piracy. 
the growth of the internet is no less than a part of human evolution at this point. imagine if the government put together a wifi project creating free wifi hotspots on every telephone pole or something. the world would fucking rule if the internet was omnipresent.

anyway, back to the matter at hand... Skyrim. If anyone has actually got this working on windows 7,  please help me out with some detailed step-by-steps or at least troubleshoot a bit with me.

,Zenden2RS,2012-02-12T01:34Z,"If you get the error after installing and trying to run the game, you must move what is inside the Razor1911 folder into the Skyrim folder (like C:\Program Files\The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim\).


YOU MUST COPY THESE FILES OR IT WILL NOT RUN!
It's working for me.
I mounted with Daemon tools lite, then installed from that virtual drive, copied the files (right click open on the virtual drive from my computer) and copied the files to said directory."

,LordPadriac,2012-02-13T00:43Z,Big thanks to the original cracker and the uploader! Followed the instructions and it worked like a charm - but then you do need to know how to read and follow instructions for that to work.

,haveaquestion,2012-02-16T22:48Z,Could anyone tell me why I have a small screen on my game? And how I could make it bigger? 
,Halofire,2012-02-17T00:58Z,"Thank you so much for this! I would love to buy it, I really would, but I'm a high school student right now, too busy for a job, and all the money I got for the holidays ended up going towards buying a replacement screen for my laptop after the old one broke... As I also lack an XBox 360 or PS3, PC gaming is my only option. I'm installing the game now, as well as seeding.

As to all of the people complaining about Torrenting this file, the argument that Bethesda is making a lot of money off of the people buying it is very true. You say that they deserve every penny, and no doubt that's true. If I had the money, I would have bought this game instead of downloading it from the internet. I'm sure there are other reasons people have for not being able to buy the game. Some of them might not be very good, but that's just how life is, especially with internet. It's bound to happen whether you complain about it or not. The internet is a place where people connect and share ideas, pictures, music, everything. Games too. It might not be right that we share games that aren't ours to share, but it can't be helped. It'll happen anyways. I still think it's nice to know that somewhere, someone was considerate enough to, after buying the game, allow other people to play it too. And especially with Torrenting, when they're also sacrificing their own bandwidth so that people can get it. It's good to know that there are still people online who care about the rest of us, when there are so many trolls around."

,kleeenx,2012-02-20T09:14Z,"To all those that are having problems with loading STEAM after you Install. Read the instructions properly...
Clearly states to COPY the entire cracked directory into your install folder. Which means, wherever you placed your .iso file, copy all of that newly created data and copy it to wherever you installed the game. Should help anyone who missed that part.
Also, my first Razor torrent, but will be back. Great download speed, will be seeding back for a couple of days."

,dlsnrk,2012-02-21T13:34Z,"@swiss_nut22
Have you tried installing the latest update? Update 5 by reloaded, you can find it here. That enables it for me.

Could anyone check if they see that color difference between face and body ingame? It'd really help."
,cnduffey,2012-02-21T20:12Z,"I solved the problem when installing Skyrim where part way through the installation this error appears: Error unpacking! Make sure you are using the correct decryption key.

First I deleted all files associated with previous attempts at installation.  The I used a registry cleaner (Win Utilities Professional) that I had previously downloaded from giveawayoftheday DOT com.  I searched for it on PB, but didn't find it.  Perhaps any registry cleaner will work.  I also ran the Registry Defrager module in Win Utilities Professional.  After that I remounted the ISO and installed without any problem.

For those who like lists:

1. Delete previous installation files

2. Run a registry cleaner

3. Run a registry defrag

4. Mount / Install

Hope this works for others!  Cheers.

For people who are nooby like me:
1. Mount image (I use MagicDisc)
2. Start installer Razor1911 and choose a disc with enough space +-8GB and wait until it's done. (Not the Steam installer)
3. Open file Razor 1911 and copy content (Ctrl+C)
4. Open the file location where you installed the game and paste (Ctrl+V) replace items.
5. Play the game ^^

Make sure your graphics card and processor can handle the game. If you have issues, set quality to lowest and see how high you can play before you get issues.

,klearlycanadian,2012-03-14T11:34Z,"Modders

People who have the DATA selection greyed out in the skyrim launcher, here is how you fix it.

1. Find the SkyrimPrefs.ini (use windows find file if you have to) its usually under My document/MyGames/Skyrim
2. Open this file with notepad (or right click choose edit)
3. Look for the line:
[Launcher]
bShowAllResolutions=0
uLastAspectRatio=2
4. Add the following line below:
bEnableFileSelection=1
5. IMPORTANT: save and close notepad. Go back to the file and right click the file, choose properties and make sure you check READ ONLY. click apply and ok.  Bethesda games have a habit of resestting ini (config) files when the games are loaded. Depending on if you ever click default anywhere or whether the game ever crashes.

Hope that helps.  It makes a lot of sense to me that it should."

1.After downloading, mount the ISO file
2. Go to the drive and make sure to click open, not double click.
3. Run install exe, once it finishes, open the Razor1911 folder in the mounted drive and copy its contents into the install folder. Make sure to hit Copy and Replace for all prompts
5. Run the launcher in the installed skyrim folder.

Finished :)"

Download Bittorent or Utorrent..
Then Download PowerISO.

When The Torrent's Done Downloading Open PowerISO Then You'll See It Also In Your Taskbar.. Right Click It... Then Locate Where You Have Downloaded The Torrent.. Inside The Folder Should Be An ISO File.. Click That File And It Will Be Mounted Onto That Drive. Then After That Go To ""My Computer"" Then Right Click Whichever Drive You Mounted It On And Click Install. Then Pick The Location Where You Want The Folder To Be. Then When The Installation Is Done. Open Up The Drive Where You Mounted It Before.. Then Open Up The Folder That Says ""razor.."" Then Copy All 4 Files and Paste Them In Your The Elder Scroll V Skyrim Folder.. Then Click Copy And Replace. Then Start It Up..

Good Luck Matee "

,ShimanoOO,2012-04-12T10:05Z,"Hey Dudes and Dudettes.

This is for everyone who has the issue involving

SKYRIM LAUNCHER KEEPS RELOADING WHEN YOU CLICK 'PLAY'

My solution:
When copying the crack folder (Razor1911) to the download folder (Generally LocalDisc>ProgramFiles>TheElderScrollsVSkyrim)

DO NOT COPY THE ENTIRE FOLDER. ONLY COPY THE CONTENTS OF IT.

When it asks what to do about there being more than one of some files, CLICK COPY AND REPLACE to all.

Finally open 'SkyrimLauncher' and click 'Play'

Hopefully this works for everyone else because i nearly gave up.

I also changed my sound preferences in the control panel to 24bit 48000 (under 'advanced') as suggested by a few other people but i'm not entirely certain whether that maters or not. I guess if it still doesn't work after copying the crack folder properly try the sound thing.

Good Luck!"

,chonadamms,2012-04-13T08:41Z,"For all those ppl that have problem with launching Skyrim after they cracked the game correctly:

(Launcher starts but when you click on Play nothing happens)

Here is the solution:

Problem is with the Microsoft visual C++ redistributable . If you have some previous versions (from 2008 or later) remove them and install the one that comes with Skyrim, its in the install dir called VCRedist.

When you install that ver of the Microsoft Visual C++, restart your computer and then try the launcher. It will work.

This is the same problem I had with Oblivion launcher. It was always asking for the specific ver of the Microsoft Visual C++

,agathecosta,2012-04-25T02:50Z,"Sorry TPB users for Ironymon's ignorance, i believe I am in the right place to ask questions about WINDHELM as it is the 2nd gamebreaking bug this torrent has. 

I searched Google to fix the first game-breaking bug that was ESBERN not opening the cellar door because of missing dialogs. Esbern fix here follow instructions:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6904111/Skyrim_Esbern_Fix_%28PC%29_-_BSA_Unpacker

Can anyone confirm that WINDHELM crashes to desktop also. There's posts on Google about it but no definitive fix. Problem seems to be all platforms. Until a fix occurs alot of users of this torrent will remain stuck at ULRIC"

,avpke,2012-04-30T13:46Z,"@ocelot2: 
This is how you enable mods, found it somewhere in the comments:
1. Find the SkyrimPrefs.ini (use windows find file if you have to) its usually under My document/MyGames/Skyrim
2. Open this file with notepad (or right click choose edit)
3. Look for the line:
[Launcher]
bShowAllResolutions=0
uLastAspectRatio=2
4. Add the following line below:
bEnableFileSelection=1
5. IMPORTANT: save and close notepad. Go back to the file and right click the file, choose properties and make sure you check READ ONLY. click apply and ok. Bethesda games have a habit of resestting ini (config) files when the games are loaded. Depending on if you ever click default anywhere or whether the game ever crashes.

@k-torrent: the crack is in Razor1911 folder. Copy everything from that into the Skyrim folder and replace."

,Zeroev,2012-05-01T19:12Z,"Found this earlier in the comments:
Heres detailed instructions on what to do to play this game. First and foremost, this download is legit. I can confirm this. Everything you need is here.
1. ONCE you download the file, you will need to MOUNT the ISO to a virtual drive. This is made possible with a program such as Daemon Tools.
(the file you've downloaded is basically a ""virtual DvD"" and you need a ""Virtual drive"" to play the virtual disc.)
2. After step 1, you will go into ""My Computer"", right click your virtual drive (should see SKYRIM_EN) and select ""Open"". Fifth icon from the top of the list should be ""Install"". You double click this and it will prompt the install. You Install.
3. Once installed a window with a single shortcut should pop-up. Disregard this and close. What you do now is go BACK INTO the ""virtual drive"" go into the folder titled ""Razor1911"" which should be the top folder, and copy all the FILES INSIDE THE FOLDER! (Do NOT copy the FOLDER, but the FILES INSIDE THE FOLDER)
4. You should have copied the 4 files inside the ""Razor1911"" folder, now you go to where you installed Skyrim. Should be in ""PROGRAM FILES"" on your hard drive. You open the folder titled ""The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim"" and you will see a list of more files.
5. Last step to take is to paste the 4 files you copied earlier into that list. It will ask if you want to OVERWRITE the current files, and you will say ""YES!""
6. Once you have overwritten those files, you will double click the ""Launcher"" file in your ""The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim"" folder.If you followed my instructions, you should already be in that folder. The game will start up, and SUCCESS! You did it!
Hope that helps

,carnFX,2012-05-27T19:28Z,"@13Matthews

Have you downloaded a virtual drive? If you haven't done it yet, go to Google and search for a free one. I use Virtual CloneDrive.
After you've installed your virtual drive, right-click the game file (.ISO) in the directory and you'll see an option to ""mount"" it to your virtual drive. Click that option and you should be seeing the game's installer start up just like it would have if you put a real game disc into your real disk drive. Hope that helps"
,Dartania,2012-05-28T01:47Z,"Its asking me for a product key. I don't think I installed this properly. I dont have the ability to Mount or Burn image. Also, Which img? I dont see any img files other than the icon file. "

,tehphilosopher,2012-05-30T18:32Z,"On another note, I take it there is no way to get the new patches and game updates unless we have an official copy in Steam? Or is there a workaround for that?

@SuperNoobster, your not copying everything in your Razer (crack) directory into your install directory. Uploaders just saying crack dir and not the actual name of the dir confuses people sometimes."

I installed Nexus Mod Manager in order to put mods in this game. I got an error message saying there's a missing file called skyrim.esm

Do I have to buy the game to get this file or is there another way around it? 

Thanks in advance."

Upgraded that and now its flawless. @RoyalOD, usually with torrents of games, Mods tend to cause problems in general, especially with a game like Skyrim. The more content the harder it is to mod:D . Buying the original game guarantees that...I'd check the mod site it's self and forums. . Save some asshole making a rude comment at you :D"

 You have to run it as an administrator. I did that to me also. Just right click on it and click on run as admin. It should work then."

How can I fix it?"
,RoyalOD,2012-06-03T05:33Z,"@Evelynwn
I did that. I still got the same error message :( 

@mjb1784
I checked their forums. Some people have said to to go to steam and click check file integrity. But I don't want to risk it and saying that I pirated it D:

I already have this game on PS3 anyway. I just want to play Skyrim again for fun plus the mods. 
Any other solution would greatly be appreciated! Thanks! :) "
