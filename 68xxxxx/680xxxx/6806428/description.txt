GAME iNFO
Years after taking Stilwater for their own, the Third Street Saints have
evolved from street gang to household brand name, with Saints sneakers,
Saints energy drinks and Johnny Gat bobblehead dolls all available at a store near you.
The Saints are kings of Stilwater, but their celebrity status has not gone
unnoticed. The Syndicate, a legendary criminal fraternity with pawns in
play all over the globe, has turned its eye on the Saints and demands tribute.
Refusing to kneel to the Syndicate, you take the fight to Steelport,
a once-proud metropolis reduced to a struggling city of sin under Syndicate
control. Take a tank skydiving, call in a satellite-targeted airstrike
on a Mexican wrestling gang, and defend yourself against a highly-trained
military force using only a sex toy in the most outlandish gameplay
scenarios ever seen, igniting a city-wide war that will set Steelport on fire.
Saints Row: The Third gives you control of the Saints at the height of their
power, and you live the life to show for it. Now Steelport is ripe for the
taking, and it\'s up to you to make the city your own. Mold the skyline based
on your choices, outfit your crew in classy gangster gear or furry costumes,
and make life-or-death decisions that will change Steelport, and the Saints,
forever. This is now your city. These are now your rules. Strap it on.
Over The Top - Like a lapdance from a porn star, the action is naughty, fun,
and better than anything you\'re getting at home.
City of Sin - Disrupt and dismantle the Syndicate stranglehold on weapons,
cybercrime, and sex trades. Discover the secrets of Steelport, where there
is action on every street corner, for better or, more likely, worse.
Weapons of Crass Destruction - It\'s one thing to defeat your enemies.
It\'s another to humiliate them. Hover jets, human cannonball cars and
sex-toy warfare are all part of the fun.
Co-op Madness - Give naked skydiving a try, landing in your partner\'s flaming
pickup as you make a suicide run toward a heavily armed Syndicate brothel.
Steelport is more fun with a friend.
Initiation Station - Create, share, and download the most outlandish
characters every seen, from washed-up celebrities to naked ninja pirates.
Inside every sinner, there is a Saint.
