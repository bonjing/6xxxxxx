Ive not seen thw TV show yet, but Ive been watching the PPVs all year. If anyone out there has heard of ROH but hasnt given it a try, ill say it is def worth your time.

I like TNA iMPACT and all, but I do prefer ROH. It cant really compare to WWE, since they are 'sports entertainment' (WWE has got much better in the last 3 months or so as well though) and really selling a different product. ROH is pro wrestling old school style.

And Jim Cornette is in it! :face lol"
