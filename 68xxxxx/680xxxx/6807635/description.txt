Don't spend time reading about theory, components and old ham radios - that's history! Industry veteran, Louis Frenzel, gives you the real scoop on electronic product fundamentals as they are today. Rather than tearing electronics apart and looking at every little piece, the author takes a systems-level view. For example, you will not learn how to make a circuit but how a signal flows from one integrated circuit (IC) to the next and so on to the ultimate goal.

This practical application-driven viewpoint and breadth of coverage is unprecedented. This book touches upon TV, audio, satellite, radio, wireless communication, and networking. All of this content is brought to life through hands-on projects that you will enjoy whether you are a hobbyist, student, or engineer.


    * A fresh look at how electronics work

    * Learn about the inner workings of your HDTV, cell phone, and video game console
