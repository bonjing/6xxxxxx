                           DESCRiPTiON 

 James Holland presents an analysis of the 1943 air attacks by the RAF, in     
 which 19 Lancaster bombers ventured into the industrial heartland of Germany  
 to destroy three heavily defended dams with the new bouncing bomb. He argues  
 that the raid was the best-executed and most important of all time and        
 explores whether its true impact has been underestimated - and if the result  
 should have been even greater.                                                
                                 Enjoy!
