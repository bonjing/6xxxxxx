The teen dance boy bands B2K and IMx star in the teen dance musical You Got Served, directed by boy band manager Christopher B. Stokes. Best friends Elgin (Marques Houston of IMX) and David (Omarion of B2K) lead a crew of street dancers (including B2K members Raz-B, Lil Fizz, and J-Boog). They must come up with the best moves in order to defeat the challenging town in the local dance contest called the Big Bounce. Group dynamics are tested when David tries to date Elgin's sister Liyah (Jennifer Freeman). Meagan Good plays Liyah's friend Beautifull. Standup comedian Steve Harvey plays dance battle organizer Mr. Rad. Hip-hop star Lil' Kim appears in a cameo and contributes to the soundtrack.
