This rocks... anyone know where I can get the first two? (and the rest)

All I come up with everyfuckingwhere is the Pandemonium releases (for 1&2) and they're good flicks but NOT the sticky video releases 

(and Pandemonium is too fucking stupid to know that an mfm AIN'T a fucking GB)

I find most of the rest of the Sticky Video releases pretty much everywhere in .avi except 1&2 (but would like to get the full DVDs if possible) 

I'd settle for the older ones in .avi over 1.2 gb if I could get them as #7 and below are all about 700 kB or so... it seems

(I've been lazy and haven't checked the private trackers yet)"
