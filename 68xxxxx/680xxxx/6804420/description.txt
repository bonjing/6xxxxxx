[/b][/color] Jonathan Ames, a young Brooklyn writer, is feeling lost.
He's just gone through a painful break-up, thanks in part to his drinking, can't write his second novel, and carouses too much with his magazine editor.
Rather than face reality, Jonathan turns instead to his fantasies moonlighting as a private detective because he wants to be a hero and a man of action.
