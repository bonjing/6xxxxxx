Cyber Update Nov.2011\US-16898  Isis Love, Gia DiMarco, Emma Haize, Serena Blair and Lyla Storm


Welcome to Tag Team Tuesdays. Totally non-scripted, all in front of a live audience, all broadcast live to members. Today's update is RD 2 of 4. This was October's live match now edited for your enjoyment!

At the end of the 1st round The Yellow team of Gia DiMarco & Lyla Storm had a 30 point lead. By the end of the 2nd round, the Blue team of Serena Blair and Emma Haize held a 5pt lead.

It's starting to get personal. The girls are going to war, and the action is intense. The team that gets angry is going to be the team that wins. Which team wants it more?
