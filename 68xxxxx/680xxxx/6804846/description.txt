This is an un-rar'd version of the one upped by F10000/QUASAR.  I went out and found that damn first rar file that wouldn't download, and none of those links worked on the old torrent page.  On top of that, I UN-F'N-RARRED THE DAMN THING!!!!

FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PEOPLE, STOP RARRING FILES THAT DON'T NEED IT!!!  Which is ALL OF THEM!!!!!

The rar'd version saved 30MB of data transfer.  That's ALL.  And then you need at least twice the space to un-rar the damn thing!  It's just STUPID.  Ok, rant over.  Please seed this and keep it alive as long as you can, so that people don't have to try to search for that one file that was nearly impossible to find.
