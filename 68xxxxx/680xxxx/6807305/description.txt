The information source for the vehicle repair market with the original data of the parts manufacturers.

Founded in 1994 by companies of the automotive aftermarket industry and the German Association for Spare parts (GVA), TecDoc Informations System GmbH has established itself as the leading supplier of electronic spare parts information on the European market.

TecDoc furnishes the free vehicle spare parts market with current and comprehensive data for identifying and ordering parts â€“ for both, PC as well as CV â€“ directly from the databases of the cooperating automotive aftermarket manufacturers in a standardised catalogue form.

The core tasks of TecDoc are still the standardising, gathering and distributing of data as well as the development of the necessary data technique.
