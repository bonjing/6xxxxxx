Summary

During a field trip to a military base, dim-witted
teens Beavis and Butt-head wind up sending drone planes
on a Middle Eastern mission because they think the
state-of-the-art equipment is just a video game for them
to play

Release Notes

This is one of the rare cases of a show being produced
in 4:3 HDTV. There are several indicators of this being
true HD and not just upconverted PDTV, such as 5.1 audio
(MTV is always 2.0 on PDTV), and perfectly filling the
4:3 area with no additional cropping needed, when other
PDTV shows always have additional crap at the edges that
needs to be removed
