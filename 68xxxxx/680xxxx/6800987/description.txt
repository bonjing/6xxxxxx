GIL SCOTT HERON PIECES OF A MAN
Label Flying Dutchman
Original Year 1971
Format: Mp3@320

Gil Scott-Heron's debut album presented a groundbreaking young poet of the streets, prefiguring hip-hop and bearing few precedents. While that record focused on vocal recitations and percussion, though, Scott-Heron's second album, Pieces Of  A Man, brought things to another level. Here Scott-Heron emerges as an affecting singer and melodist. With his musical aide-de-camp Brian Jackson, he proffers fully fleshed-out musical arrangements that encompass blues, jazz, and R&B. The striking ballad "Lady Day and John Coltrane" makes a particularly compelling case for Scott-Heron and Jackson's jazzier inclinations. At the same time, Scott-Heron's urgent proto-rapping is still present, as is his powerful social message, most notably on the rabble-rousing "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised," which would become one of his signature songs. While his first album was an unforgettable bolt from the blue, Pieces Of  A Man is where Scott-Heron truly came into his own.
