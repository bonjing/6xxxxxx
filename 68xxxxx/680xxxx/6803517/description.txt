                The War in the Fields.
                Mykola Allen, Lou Broadbent, Carolyn Pickles, Mark
                Benton, Seline Hizli, Susan Cookson. Period drama
                series. When Iris has a near fatal miss on Vernon's
                farm, Connie throws down the gauntlet: it's land
                girls versus farmers! Whilst Finch has to protect his
                hidden treasure, a visiting local dignitary makes
                Ellen a tempting offer. Meanwhile Esther is desperate
                to keep her secret from the local gossips.
