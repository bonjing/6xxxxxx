Description: The Incredible Change-Bots is an affectionate parody of The Transformers in all its incarnations: Saturday morning cartoon, plastic action figure, Hollywood blockbuster. On the distant planet of Electronocybercircuitron, two groups of sentient machines compete for control of the planetâ€™s dwindling energy resources: the peaceful Awesomebots and the war-like Fantasticons. (As in the original Transformers series, both the Awesomebots and the Fantasticons can assume the form of vehicles and household appliances from big rigs and cement trucks to microwave ovens and calculators.) Electronocybercircuitron descends into civil war, forcing both groups of robots to flee the devastation. After fighting erupts on their escape vessel, the Awesomebots and Fantasticons crash land on Earth, where two groups go their separate ways to regroup for another battle.
