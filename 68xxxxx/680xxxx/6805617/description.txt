Twenty one years ago June Tabor and Oysterband collaborated on the classic Freedom And Rain album â€“ frequently regarded as one of the Top 5 Folk albums of all time.

Over the intervening years they have occasionally performed together at gigs and in 2010 were invited to reunite for fRootsâ€™ 30th birthday party at the Roundhouse. They all came off-stage determined to make a belated follow-up. The magnificent Ragged Kingdom arguably surpasses the earlier recording.

â€œStriking gold by fusing the contemporary and traditional is at the heart of the folk process. Ragged Kingdom raises the alchemy of that process to the highest level.â€ The Independent

â€œThis was worth waiting for.â€ â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… The Guardian

â€œGlorious.â€ â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… MOJO

â€œOysterband provide tough textures and lyrical twists, while June Tabor could sing the washing instructions on a duvet and make it sound as profound as the Gettysburg Address.â€ The Word

â€œâ€¦one reunion that works so magnificently, it even overshadows the magical memories of their previous collaborationâ€¦â€ fRoots
