There is another version of this book that has been floating around the torrent sites for a time now.  That version has individual folders for each CD and separate tracks contained therein.  I had downloaded it, and when I went to ""chapter"" it, I found to my dismay that there is a small bit of data missing from the beginning of each track, making the transition from one section to another very noticeable and annoying.  Something had to be done.

To rectify this, I decided to soldier up and purchase the book in order to ""chapter"" my own version.  The end result is the following torrent.  I'm sorry that it took me this long to release it; I've been making traveling arrangements to see friends and family for the Thanksgiving holiday here in the United States and couldn't find the time.  Nevertheless, it is here now, and I hope you all enjoy it.  Oh, and all files are properly tagged and contains the album art of the book.  Also, thanks for whoever posted up the ebooks that I added to this torrent.  Definitely a team effort!  :)

Enjoy!
