"American Girl"

While Harry is on vacation, her trip takes 
a frustrating turn when the small town of 
Langford, Ohio impounds her Mercedes Benz 
for violating their "Buy American" law. 
Harry, with Oliver at her side, challenges 
the town's law and is pit against a young, 
homespun attorney and the engine behind 
the law, Langford's mayor, Franklin 
Chickory. Meanwhile, Adam represents the 
Chens, a Chinese family whose daughter was 
stolen because of China's one-child policy 
and adopted by American parents. With 
Cassie's help, Adam hopes to win custody 
for the Chens.
