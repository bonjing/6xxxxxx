This is the version that has been on MySpleen for some time. I've decided it's about time it got shared with the masses, because that's what torrents are for. This is the HBO version, well-preserved on a high-quality tape (perhaps Beta or U-matic) and remastered carefully as a labor of love by the original seeder. This is the best I have ever seen this cut of the film look. Here it is for all to see.

(Also, let it be known that the optimum aspect ratio for this rip is not 1.33:1, but roughly 1.37:1, compared against images from official releases. A file has been included that describes the correct aspect ratio to 31 decimal places, which is realistically more than anyone needs. Those viewing on computers may stretch the film accordingly.)
