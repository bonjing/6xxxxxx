                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Channel 5 continues its Remembrance Day commemoration with the story of the   
 RAF's Second World War Bomber Command crews, whose mission was to destroy     
 Germany's industrial heartland through thousands of nightly raids. Although   
 they played an important part in weakening the enemy war effort, the attacks  
 came at a cost, with 55,000 of the 125,000 airmen killed, and 10,000 taken    
 prisoner - with some sent to Buchenwald concentration camp. Here, survivors   
 reveal how they came close to death while held there. 
                        
                                 Enjoy!
