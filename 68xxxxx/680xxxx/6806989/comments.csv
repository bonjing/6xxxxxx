I'm not trying to be rude, but it means I have to MOVE the file, and that prevents me from being able to seed it later.
I have ALL the files I download in specific files.
This for example will be x:\TV Shows\Psych\Season 6\Psych S06E05 Dead Mans Curveball.avi
which means, that I have to cut it from the folder that is created because of your extra files, and rename it, thus not allowing others to download it from me."
