None of the files I will be uploading are mine, the credits go to others. 

All the files can be found on bittorrent sites. 

All have been re-encoded to create dvd5

To everyone who don\'t hit and run but keep on seeding - THANKS.

D4 = 14 episodes

"There is currentily no word from Disney on the release on a third DVD boxset volume which should have episodes 52-65."

D4 consists of the last 14 episodes (52-65)and were 165MB avi files.20 min shows compressed to 165MB speaks for itself.The quality is fine in the slow scenes but in the action scenes the lack of bitrate shows.
The menu etc matches vol.1,vol.2 and vol.3 to make a complete matching set.
This disc will be updated if better quality files are ever found.
Also this disc has to be watched on tv, the pc doesn't play it that well. 

This is a 4 disc set

Enjoy
