Unbelievably this cracking vintage recording comes from a reception at The Bocce Club in Rhode Island back in 1978 - to celebrate the wedding of Joan and George Nicholas â€“ recorded on a reel to reel tape recorder by Dick Koulbanis with one microphone!

And what a band was assembled for the evening: legendary harmonica player Big Walter Horton, Johnny Nicholas, Ronnie Earl (then known as 'Youngblood') with the great rhythm section of Michael 'Mudcat' Ward on bass and Ted Harvey on drums, as well as Anthony Giarossi (later Geraci) on piano and a couple of guest spots from Sugar Ray Norcia, phew what a line-up!

The 75-capacity club was filled with 150 guests and they were treated to a superb set of classic blues captured here in all its glory - kicking off with a Sugar Ray vocal on 'Everyday I Have The Blues', before Big Walter Horton's signature instrumental, with obligatory killer tone - 'Walterâ€™s Boogie'. He then takes a vocal on a sweet 'Trouble In Mind' and a spirited romp through 'My Babe'.

Johnny Nicholas's 'Cold Chills' is a nice mid-tempo shuffle with some great guitar work, before the pace is taken down for the lengthy 'Thatâ€™s Why Iâ€™m Cryin'', featuring Sugar Ray Norcia again, this time on lovely chromatic harmonica; before things rock again on the self-explanatory 'Bocce Boogie' - you can just imagine the packed dance floor and the beer flowing!

The rest of the set contains mainly blues standards - from Robert Nighthawk's 'Sweet Black Angel' to Big Joe Williams 'Baby Please Don't Go', and even a touch of jazz on 'Don't Get Around Much Anymore'. Itâ€™s frightening how good these musicians were thirty years ago and easy to see how they are still at the top of the blues tree.

The closing 'Breakinâ€™ With The Earl' is one of those jazzy shuffles that builds as it goes on and what Ronnie Earl became famous for, and is complete with band introductions before some of that trademark guitar work and nice piano from Anthony Giarossi, a lovely ending to a fine release that comes highly recommended.

The real deal, the blues the way it's supposed to be played, the way it's supposed to be enjoyed, in a setting that is, and has been, home to the blues throughout it's history, in the juke joints, lounges and bars.
