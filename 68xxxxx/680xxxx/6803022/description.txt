AllMusic Review
by Cub Koda[/b][/color]
A budget  sampling from Copeland's five Rounder albums from the 1980s. All in all, a nice cross-section and a good introduction to this artist's later work. Special bonus points for including his collaboration with African musicians on their closer, "Kasavubu."
