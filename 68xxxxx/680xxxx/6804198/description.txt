A Perfect Spy 
BBC 1987 
John Le Carre


A Perfect Spy is a BBC miniseries adaptation of John le CarrÃ©'s spy novel of the same name. It follows the career of the British MI6 spy Magnus Pym from his early days as a schoolboy to his eventual disappearance as a suspected agent of the Czech secret service.


A Perfect Spy is the tale of Magnus Pym, a long-time spy for the United Kingdom. After attending his father's funeral, Pym mysteriously disappears. His fellow secret agents (not unreasonably) suspect he might have betrayed them â€” throughout most of his career, Magnus worked for the Czechoslovak secret service. Although intrigue, wit, and suspense compose the novel, the story of Magnus Pym is partly an unadorned recollection of Magnus' childhood and memories of his father Rick Pym.
