Due to a growing marital rift between Jamuna and her husband, she decides to leave him. He does not permit her to take their son, so she arranges his abduction, and disappears from her husband\'s life. Years later, Jamuna\'s son, Mohan, has grown up, and together they live a middle-class existence. One day, Mohan meets with Mona and both are attracted to each other. But Mona\'s guardian would like her to marry Biharilal alias Difu, who is foreign returned and comes from a very wealthy family. Mona and her friends embark on a trip to Srinagar, and Mohan follows her there. Then Jamuna\'s overjoyed husband announces the return of his son, Mohan, back to his household. When Jamuna gets this news, she is shocked beyond words as the man claiming to be her son, is none other than an impostor named Ramesh. She will have to come out of hiding, admit to abducting Mohan, in order to bring the truth to light
