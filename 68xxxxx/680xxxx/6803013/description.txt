When Jimmy Johnson's first album, Johnson's Whacks hit the streets at the end of the seventies, he was heralded as being part of a new blues generation that could actually write fully-realized, mature songs (as opposed to borrowing or stealing jukebox standards). The bass-driven funk rhythms are definitely products of their time-any current bar band would have thumb popped these songs to excess, but Larry Exum's bass work still sounds tasteful this close to the new millennium ... And each time you think you know where one of these songs is going, Johnson throws in a chordal progression that sounds appropriate.
