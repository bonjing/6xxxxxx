War Documentary hosted by Robert Harris, published by PBS, US Office of War Information in 1945 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

A documentary account of the allied invasion of Europe during World War II compiled from the footage shot by nearly 1400 cameramen. It opens as the assembled allied forces plan and train for the D-Day invasion at bases in Great Britain and covers all the major events of the war in Europe from the Normandy landings to the fall of Berlin.

Introduced by then General Dwight D. Eisenhower and using footage filmed by military photographers, this documentary recounts the historic events from the D-Day invasion to the end of the war. The pre-invasion preparations focus on work in munitions and heavy equipment manufacturing. The D-Day invasion itself is explained in detail as is the unsuccessful Operation Market Garden, the failed northern thrust into Holland in the fall of 1944. This is followed by the Battle of the Ardennes in December/January and the eventual crossing of the Rhine and the march into Berlin.
