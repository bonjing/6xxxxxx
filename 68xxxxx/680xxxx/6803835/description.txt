Carina Round - Girl and The Ghost (Puscifer Remix)

This is the b-side to Carina Round's single The Last Time, released as a download if you buy the vinyl single. Not sure exactly what involvement merited the "Puscifer Remix" in the title, as Maynard Keenan (Tool, A Perfect Circle, Puscifer) does not sing on this track, but the music does sound like it could be on Conditions of My Parole, the newest album for which Carina (also currently a touring member of Puscifer) was involved.
