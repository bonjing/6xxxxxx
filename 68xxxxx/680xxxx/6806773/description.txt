Nature Documentary hosted by Austin Stevens, published by Discovery Channel broadcasted as part of DC Austin Stevens Adventures series in 2008 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Austin ventures through Florida's Everglades in search of a giant alien invader. Burmese pythons are thriving in this area... and Austin wants to see them in action.

Despite their growing numbers (pythons have no natural predators in the Everglades) these colossal predators are extremely difficult to find.

Austin paddles through alligator-infested swamps, navigates razor-sharp sawgrass, and takes an airboat ride with a native-American - all to locate a potential python site. When he sees a baby python born in the wild, Austin has proof the species is multiplying. And he knows he's hot on the trail of pythons. Finally, Austin reaches the Cypress swamp where he locates a ten-foot python that he must wrestle under control.

Also in this episode, Austin catches an enormous Florida snapping turtle, tackles a feisty alligator, and meets up with a possum in distress.
