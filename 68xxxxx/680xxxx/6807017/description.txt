[b][color=blue]::Plot::[/color][/b]
  [b][i]Bloodsport tells the story of an Canadian man named Frank Dux (Jean Claude Van Damme), who was trained from his youth in the ways of Ninjutsu by a Japanese master of the art, Senzo Tanaka (Roy Chiao). Primarily to honor his mentor out of gratitude and respect for having been allowed the training in place of Senzo Tanaka's deceased and only son, Dux leaves for Hong Kong to participate in the Kumite â€” an illegal and underground, freestyle, single-elimination and occasionally deadly full-contact martial arts tournament to which the world's best martial artists are clandestinely invited every five years.
The movie begins with the preparation for the Kumite somewhere in Kowloon Walled City. Then a number of fighters are shown preparing for the Kumite with their own individual training regimens (from climbing trees, bashing coconuts, to breaking large ice blocks and boards). Frank Dux is then shown kicking a speed bag in an Army gym. An officer informs him that the commanding officer found out about Dux's involvement in the Kumite and wants to speak to him. Frank tells him he wants to take a shower first, only to go AWOL instead.
Dux goes to the Tanakas' house to say goodbye to his mentor and remembers back to his training days. A flashback sequence shows a younger Frank Dux being goaded by two schoolmates to steal a sword in Mr. Tanaka's house. As Mr. Tanaka and his son Shingo return to the house, his schoolmates run away, leaving Dux behind. Shingo easily subdues Dux, but Mr. Tanaka calls him off and sends him back to his studies. Tanaka then tells Dux that the sword cannot be stolen; it must be earned. Dux explains that he was not stealing, but trying to put the sword back in its rightful place. Tanaka uses the sword and cuts off the bill of Dux's cap, who does not flinch during the ordeal. Impressed by his "fighting spirit", Tanaka explains to Dux's parents that he intends to train their son in exchange for not reporting him to the police. Despite being used for a "punching bag" by Shingo during training (at one point Shingo insults Dux by calling him a "round-eye"), Dux saves Shingo from two bullies at school. Shingo confides in Dux that one day he would make his father proud by going to the Kumite. After Shingo's death years later, and despite initial resistance to the idea, Tanaka agrees to train Dux as a member of the Tanaka Clan.
Back in the United States, two military law enforcement agents (Army Criminal Investigation Division) (Norman Burton and Forest Whitaker) are summoned to track down and arrest Dux for desertion.
After arriving in Hong Kong, Dux befriends fellow American contestants fighter Ray Jackson (Donald Gibb) and Victor Lin (Ken Siu), the latter of whom acts as a manager/liaison for Jackson and Dux. Lin explains that the tournament is "anything goes," and that there are three ways to win:
Knock your opponent unconscious.
The opponent submits and shouts "mattÃ©" (explained as the equivalent of yelling "uncle").
The opponent is thrown out of the fighting area.
In order to prove he is part of the Tanaka clan, Dux is invited to perform the "Dim Mak" (the Touch of Death or Death Touch). Dux executes this move to perfection and his invitation is honored. Jackson and Dux soon become great friends, with the older Jackson acting as a big brother of sorts to Dux.
Dux eventually becomes involved with a female American journalist, Janice Kent (Leah Ayres), who is attempting to investigate the secretive Kumite event. Dux believes the Kumite is for the fighters only, and not for the people who read newspapers. As the tournament progresses, Dux beats all of his diverse opponents, including Syrian fighter Sadiq Hossein (Bernard Mariano), Muay Thai kickboxer Paco (Paulo Tocha), and sumo wrestler Pumola (David Ho). He advances to the third and final day of the tournament to face the defending Kumite champion, Chong Li (Bolo Yeung) â€” a man with the tendency to cripple and sometimes outright kill his opponents on the platform, and who has also hospitalized Ray Jackson during the second day of the Kumite. When Dux gets the upper hand during the fight, Chong Li blinds him with a handful of quicklime, but Dux trains his senses to overcome the handicap and makes Chong Li shout "mattÃ©" to become the first Western winner of the Kumite. The film closes with Dux returning to the United States and statistics detailing the real-life Frank W. Dux's alleged achievements (such as the fastest KO) are shown.[/i][/b]
