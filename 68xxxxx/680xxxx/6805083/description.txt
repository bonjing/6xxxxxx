Jobs, who passed away on October 5, 2011 at the age of 56, co-founded Apple in 1976. He stepped down from that role in August 2011, bringing an end to one of the greatest, most transformative business careers in history. Over the years, Jobs gave countless interviews to the media, explaining what he called ?the vision thingâ€?his unmatched ability to envision, and successfully bring to the marketplace, consumer products that people find simply irresistible.
