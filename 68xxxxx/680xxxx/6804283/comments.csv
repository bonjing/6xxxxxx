----------
1. Select all the zips and extract to one folder, this will merge them together, and produce a .bin and .cue file.
2. Open up a disc mounting program, I used PowerISO which you can find on here. But there's also some free ones if you search it.
3. Mount the .bin to a drive, if you don't understand, just read the help, it's easy.
4. Run the drive you've just mounted, it will install, and you can run it just like any other program afterwards.
-- Hope this helped."
