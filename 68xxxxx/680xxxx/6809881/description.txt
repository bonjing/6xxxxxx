Dink (styled DINK), was an alternative/industrial rock band formed in Kent, Ohio in 1992. The band\\\'s sound was considered unique for its time, combining elements of industrial, Hip Hop (rapped vocals and extensive use of samples), hard rock, and electronic dance. Dink\\\'s members included Sean Carlin (guitar, vocals, programming), Rob Lightbody (vocals, guitar), Jer Herring (guitar, vocals), Jeff Finn (bass), and Jan Eddy Van Der Kuil (drums).
Dink released one self-titled album, also mostly self-produced, in 1994 on Capitol Records. The album featured one song produced by Skinny Puppy\\\'s Dave \\\"Rave\\\" Ogilvie. The song \\\"Green Mind\\\" was a hit, featuring some play on MTV and in the films Fear and Double Dragon, and reached #1 on the alternative dance charts. The band\\\'s next two singles, \\\"Angels\\\" (which was featured in the film Bad Boys during the Club Hell scene) and \\\"Get On It\\\" also topped the alternative dance charts, repeating the chart success of \\\"Green Mind.\\\" Dink toured briefly with bands such as Pop Will Eat Itself, KMFDM and Lords of Acid to further promote their debut.
Dink recorded a follow up album, also on Capitol in 1995, and some of the songs would be released on the EP Blame It on Tito, which was released in 1996. The band then recorded additional songs for a second album to be released in late 1997/early 1998, but was dropped by Capitol due to the changing musical climate. This led to the band\\\'s break up in 1998.
Many fans blame Capitol for not recognizing the changing climate or speculate it was due to the lack of a coverboy frontman.
