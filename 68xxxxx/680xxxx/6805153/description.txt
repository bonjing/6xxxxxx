1)  Timbuktu 
Few names conjure as much mystery as that of Timbuktu. For centuries, Europeans heard legends of a mythical city in the heart of the Sahara, the source of endless caravans of gold. But it took 500 years to find it, and by then the glory was gone. Host Hunter Ellis combs the deserts of Timbuktu to find the source of its great power, wealth, and mystery.

2)  Angkor Wat the Eighth Wonder 
Travel deep into the heart of the Cambodian jungle to discover a magnificent stone temple that was built on a scale unparalleled in human history. Join us as we use the latest technology to unravel the secrets of this ancient temple and solve the mystery of why it was suddenly abandoned in the jungle.

3)  Lost Treasures of Petra 
The "red-rose" city of Petra stands as one of the most glorious and mysterious archaeological sites on earth. Created over 2,500 years ago, the ornate Petra cityscape was literally carved into the rose-colored walls of Jordan's Shara Mountains. The builders of Petra, the Nabataeans, were thought to be some of the wealthiest people ever to inhabit the Middle East, but they, along with their riches, simply vanished. What was Petra and could the Arabian site be still hiding precious treasure? Join host Josh Bernstein as he examines Petra's only surviving parchment manuscript, and goes underneath the ancient "Treasury" in search of hidden riches.

4)  Giants of Easter Island 
Ever since Easter Island was first discovered, this tiny pinprick of land in the middle of the Pacific Ocean has baffled scientists. How did the ancients who peopled this place even find it? Josh sets out to unveil the mysteries of the island and it's giant, haunting stone heads. Delving into the world of ancient Pacific Islanders, he relearns the lost art of Polynesian navigation, recreates the techniques of Easter Island masons, and participates in dangerous ancient rituals - all to solve one of the greatest enigmas of our time: the mystery of Easter

5)  Island Kings of the Stone Age 
Carved from single boulders of basalt, the giant stone heads of the Olmec have amazed and mystified archaeologists for more than 150 years. Hunter Ellis explores how a primitive civilization-- Central America's first--moved mountains to make these monumental works of art... and reveals new insights into this most mysterious people of the Americas.

6)  Lost Empire of Genghis Khaan 
Genghis Khaan and his Mongol Horde created the largest land empire in recorded history, and they did it in less than seventy years. How were Genghis Khaan and his army able to achieve this military dominance on such a grand scale? What ultimately became of the great Empire of the Khaans? Join host Josh Bernstein as he builds a ger on the Mongolian steppe, fires arrows from horseback like a Mongolian warrior, and uses DNA science to trace the genetic legacy of the military genius, Genghis Khaan.

7)  The Aztecs of Blood and Sacrifice 
The Aztecs were the largest civilization to ever rule Mesoamerica. Archaeology and modern science are now shedding new light on the blood rituals they practiced. Join host Josh Bernstein as he travels to Mexico City to investigate and use forensic science to examine the bones of sacrificial rituals. Next he'll try his hand at the weapons of the Aztecs, sample the potions of the priests and even cut through flesh using the technology of the ancients.

8)  Lost Cities of the Amazon 
Ever since the first Spanish explorers told tales of cities in the middle of the jungle-choked Amazon, explorers, archaeologists and treasure-hunters alike have been searching for them, and many have died trying...including the most famous Amazon explorer Col. Percy Fawcett. Now, Digging for the Truth is mounting its own expedition, and a striking new discovery will be revealed. Josh Bernstein accompanies University of Florida's Michael Heckenberger deep into Brazil's Mato Grosso region. Following Fawcett's trail to the point of his last known location, they then take buses, planes, trucks and river boats five days deep into areas of massive deforestation until they finally reach the untouched jungle. There, among a people called the Kuikuru, they discover the archaeological evidence that points - not only to the existence of huge cities in the jungle - but also to the fact that their descendants are still very much alive today

9)  The Iceman Cometh 
In "The Iceman Cometh", Bernstein sets out to solve a 5000 year old mystery. The frozen man discovered in 1991 had been the object of much speculation - especially after it was discovered that he was probably murdered. The exploration of the Iceman's clothing and weapons is awesome. Bernstein also had some hair-raising adventure along the way with the blizzard and near-crash of the helicopter. Iceman's clothing and weapons is awesome.
