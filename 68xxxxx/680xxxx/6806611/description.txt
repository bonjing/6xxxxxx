in the tradition of the Fallout series of role-playing games,
Fallout Tactics is a squad-based, third-person tactical combat
game with RPG character development and a mission-based story
line. Fallout - A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game is the sequel
to Fallout. It's been 80 long years since your ancestor, the
