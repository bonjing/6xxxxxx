The.Jury.2011.1x02.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 188MB]

[/b][/color] The Jury is a compelling, character based series which focuses on the everyday people who find themselves at the centre of one of the most controversial criminal re-trials of their time.
 It is gripping, dark and emotionally charged and the jurors are forced to face the complexities of their own lives as they are caught up in the experiences of being a key player in such a high profile Old Bailey trial.
