My Dying Bride has been the leading light of doom metal since their debut album As the Flower Withers was released on Peaceville Records back in 1992. Influenced by acts such as Celtic Frost and Candlemass, the bandâ€™s heavy atmospherics have carved a huge worldwide following over the years and they remain at the pinnacle of the genre.

Following the release of Evinta earlier this year, in which the band marked 20 years of existence with a release of symphonic compositions re-imagining past MDB themes, My Dying Bride present their latest chapter in the form of new release â€˜The Barghest Oâ€™ Whitby.

This single track, 27 minute epic represents the epitome of poetic grace and funeral soundscapes from one of gothic doomâ€™s most celebrated acts. With a masterful blend of pounding guitar riffs, and sombre atmospheric passages, My Dying Bride takes you through the chilling tale of a supernatural entity hell bent on revenge.

The Barghest Oâ€™ Whitby was recorded at Futureworks Studios, Manchester with long-time production partner & engineer, Mags. The release is the first to feature violin/keyboardist Shaun Macgowan, and sees the return of Shaun â€œWinterâ€œ Taylor-Steels to the drum-stool for this recording. The cover artwork for The Barghest Oâ€™ Whitby also appears courtesy of vocalist Aaron Stainthorpe.
