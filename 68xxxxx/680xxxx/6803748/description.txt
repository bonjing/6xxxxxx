So what is so good with this upload?

Improved Mafia 2 performance with the APEX clothes fix Some of you with even mid-high range video hardware might find slowness, stuttering and other framerate related issues while playing Mafia 2.You get a massive framerate boost without losing too much visual quality. The game uses dynamic clothing (realistic clothing simulation) not only for the main character but for all NPCs as well. This is a very CPU and GPU intensive task and can take up quite a lot of resources.this should greatly improve frame rate.

***Thankfully, all this allready fix and done By my friend Chevy87swe!!***

2.Use WinRAR for extract files
