IMDb Info

Ned lived a happy life growing organic vegetables on a farm with his hippie
girlfriend and his dog named Willie Nelson, but an unadvised incident with marijuana
at a farmer's market lands him in jail. When he gets out of jail, he is off to live
with his sisters. While Ned is still happy, his sisters are much less so after he
manages to screw up one marriage, one job opportunity, one budding relationship and
one domestic partnership. He sees those problems as breakdowns in communication,
but his sisters see him as an idiot.
