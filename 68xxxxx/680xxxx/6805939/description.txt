Protein Synthesis and Ribosome Structure
	

	
Knud Nierhaus, who has studied the ribosome for more than 30 years, has assembled here the combined efforts of several scientific disciplines into a uniform picture of the largest enzyme complex found in living cells, finally resolving many decades-old questions in molecular biology. In so doing he considers virtually all aspects of ribosome structure and function
