Most of these are very good quality although some are just ok like Lies My Teacher Told me.  If there are some that aren't great quality comment and I'll look for better versions.
If you want this in a different format like mobi you can use Calibre to convert it.
Enjoy and seed.

Also to dougietrotter thanks for putting it up on Demonoid. Really quite a pleasant surprise
