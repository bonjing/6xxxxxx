There are tons of people, like me, who enjoy these smaller sizes!! They're easier to store, quicker to download, and quicker to put on your phone/mp5 players........the quality is great on BoB's uploads, but if you just HAVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE to have some insanely large version, for your super perfect monitor, than whatever - that's your prerogative........but not all of us have to think like you, so keep your snobby bullshit to yourself!

I hope uploaders like Tonyisaac don't get discouraged from uploading after listening to these snobby quality-geeks, and there ""like omg, why would re-encode something blah blah BLAH"" -_-"
