Allmusic Review:
Crystal Waters\' edition of 20th Century Masters is, like many entries in the series, essentially a greatest hits, and, in many senses, it\'s every bit as good as the 1998 collection The Best of Crystal Waters, since it contains all the singles that most listeners could want. And while that collection has a different, possibly more listenable track selection, this is still very good and very enjoyable, and nearly interchangeable with that collection. It all depends on what track listing seems more enticing, or what price seems more enticing.
