  A very funny, slapstick comedy that tells the story of Pondo Sinatra, a backwoods hayseed who\\\'s college ambition, is to get some ass. His bumbling ways, can\\\'t even be helped by his best friend and room mate Studly. Filled with a fantastic soundtrack, that makes the movie worth watching alone. Great sounds from The buzzcocks, The untouchables and The Fleshtones. They don\\\'t make em like this anymore!

Starring Matthew Causey & Tim Carhart
