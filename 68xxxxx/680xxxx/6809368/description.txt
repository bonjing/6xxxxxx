         During a field trip to a military base, dim-witted            
         teens Beavis and Butt-head wind up sending drone planes       
         on a Middle Eastern mission because they think the            
         state-of-the-art equipment is just a video game for them      
          to play.

         This is one of the rare cases of a show being produced        
         in 4:3 HDTV. There are several indicators of this being       
         true HD and not just upconverted PDTV, such as 5.1 audio      
         (MTV is always 2.0 on PDTV), and perfectly filling the        
         4:3 area with no additional cropping needed, when other       
         PDTV shows always have additional crap at the edges that      
          needs to be removed.
