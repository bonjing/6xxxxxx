Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

Alex talks with Dan Cofall, the host of the Wall Street Shuffle radio program on CNN 1190 AM. Cofall's bio describes him as a "Midwest native-turned-Texan" who is "a gun-loving, Federal Reserve-loathing, central bank-despising, big government-detesting, motorcycle-riding gold bug." Alex also talks about the move toward war in the Middle East as Israel prepares to attack Iran and the implosion of Greece as the debt contagion spreads.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
