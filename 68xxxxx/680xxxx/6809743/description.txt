How To Use:

Burn the iso image using the software you like at a slow speed 
say about x4 or x8

as this CD is bootable.
Install as you would an original CD from system bootup.
leaving the disk in the drive and reboot pc. 
booting from cd rom drive first before harddrive

If you have xp installed already your advised to backup 
your drivers first before install. example using driver genius.
as only "MassStorage 11.09 txt mode (sata + raid)" 
and "basic xp drivers" are on this cd-r disk
