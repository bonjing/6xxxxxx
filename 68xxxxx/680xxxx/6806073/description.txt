On August 18th, 1990 Whitesnake headlined at the premier UK festival, the legendary Monsters Of Rock at Castle Donington, now known as Download. An incendiary musical chapter of the band that featured Steve Vai & Adrian Vandenberg on guitars, bassist Rudy Sarzo, drummer Tommy Aldridge & singer David Coverdale; a high octane performance, firing on all cylinders. Every effort has been made to bring the very best out of what is an incredible, never before seen, visual treat capturing one of the most musically intense line-ups of Whitesnake performing in front of over 70,000 people.
