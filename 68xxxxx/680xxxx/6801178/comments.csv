I downloaded this whole thing and when I tried to put it into wbfs manager it couldn't read the iso. so I open it up in winzip and there's nothing inside. I can't really remember if thats normal, but I'd already seeded almost a gig, So I don't see how I didnt actually download anything. but I wasnt getting any errors from winzip. So I'm thinking, cycle redundancy check error. So I start the torrent over and instead of checking it, It starts downloading again. Is it cause of the magnet links? It kind of sucks to have to download it all over  again. "
