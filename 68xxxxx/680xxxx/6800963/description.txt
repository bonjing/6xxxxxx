OK, This one obviously didn't come out of any blu ray box but felt it was 
necessary to present to anyone curious about the beginning quality of SBS media that just never caught on.  Tried it in the 30's had no way to make money from it.  Tried it in the 40's then the same thing happened....some people hung on though.  Tried it in the mid 50's again and it died once again there was no way for them to get it to the public aside from small venue's and some 3D theater's...  Since the 50's 3D has come in waves, about every 10 year and huge every 30....back to the future 3D etc. from the mid eighties....Now I have a 3D TV and a 3D Phone and 3D Glasses, Play a Nintendo 3DS....
