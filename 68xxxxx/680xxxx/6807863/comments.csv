download and put this into your ""the elderscrolls"" folder thats in your programfilesx86. then go to your ""my documents"" and then ""my games"" then ""skyrim"" and open ""skyrimprefs.ini"" (make sure you have admin privs on) and find [Launcher]. under that, make sure that ""bEnableFileSelection"" is set to 1. if its not there, make a line and create it. save and exit. start up this file you downloaded and apply mods. you can also make it fullscreen and tamper with the textures and quality if you like"
