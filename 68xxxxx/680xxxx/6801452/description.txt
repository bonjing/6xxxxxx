P C & Kristin Cast - House of Night 1-8,All Formatts,KK


House of Night is a thrillingly engaging book series that follows 16-year-old Zoey Redbird, who gets â€œMarkedâ€ by a vampyre tracker and begins to undergo the â€œChangeâ€ into an actual vampyre. She has to leave her family in Tulsa and move into the House of Night, a boarding school for other fledglings like her.
   
Itâ€™s within the schoolâ€™s walls that the heart of the action takes place as Zoey meets new friends, finds love, comes to terms with how her life will be different now and begins to realize her awesome new powers.
   
Hereâ€™s the deal though: Yes, Zoeyâ€™s a vampyre now. But sheâ€™s still a teenager â€“ with all the humor, angst and confusing feelings any other teenager has.
