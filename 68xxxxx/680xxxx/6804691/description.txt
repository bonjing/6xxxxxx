Usually I make one upload containing the playlists of that month. However this is not very Handy. Creating playlists take time and come along the month. This month I had a little catching up to do so that did not fit to nicely. So the first eight playlists of November may contain some outdated tracks (but sound awfully well).

To make it easier I decided to release the lists one by one. The parts have a continuous number to check completeness. @1 in front of the playlist title still means Easy listening, @2 Rocky and @3 Alternative.
