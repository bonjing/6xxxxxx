ttom of the settings... and it really let me know... BEFORE THIS..

2 Hours of strong gameplay later and so far this has never frozen/lagged (which it was doing.. before the updates) or had any issues with multiple saves/load files (killed a dragon and all went normal so.. it's perfect)... BUT I gotta say whatever they did to code for dual core really helped the little guy A LOT this update has litterally changed the overall game experience for me.. (no more lagzzzzzzz.. omfg) ty ty uploaders!!! 

Guys if you dont own a ""powerhouse"" desktop tower jump on the updates!!! (its the unpacked version so ALL you do is litterally copy/paste into your game folder.. no unpacking or reordering.. its soo easy)

*No I did NOT get update 2 (I got update 1 + 3 so far)

Did I say ""Thanks to the uploaders yet??"" (because yeah.. thx!)"
