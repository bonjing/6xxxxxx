  03 . JAZZ  &  SWING  

     Dixieland music, sometimes referred to as Hot jazz, Early Jazz or New Orleans jazz, is   the earliest style of Jazz music  which developed in New Orleans at the start of the 20th century, and was spread to Chicago and New York City by New Orleans bands in the 1910s.
 The style combined earlier brass band marches, French Quadrilles, ragtime and blues with collective, polyphonic improvisation. While instrumentation and size of bands can be very flexible, the "standard" band consists of a "front line" of trumpet (or cornet), trombone, and clarinet, with a "rhythm section" of at least two of the following instruments: guitar or banjo, string bass or tuba, piano, and drums.Well-known jazz standard songs from the Dixieland era, such as "Basin Street Blues" and "When the Saints Go Marching In", are known even to non-jazz fans.

     Harlem Stride Piano, Stride Piano, or just Stride, is a jazz piano style that was developed in the large cities of the East Coast, mainly in the New York, during 1920s and 1930s. The name "stride" comes from the left-hand movement "striding" up and down the keyboard. Pianist James P. Johnson, known as the "Father of Stride", created this unique style of jazz along with fellow pianists, Willie "The Lion" Smith, Fats Waller, and Luckey Roberts. 
Other notable stride pianists include Art Tatum, Thelonious Monk, Johnny Guarnieri, Don Ewell, Louis Mazetier, Donald Lambert, Cliff Jackson, Dick Wellstood, Butch Thompson, Pat Flowers, Bernd Lhotzky, Joe Turner, Claude Hopkins, Ralph Sutton, Hank Duncan, Dick Hyman, Mike Lipskin, Stephanie Trick, Morten Gunnar Larsen, William Turk, John Gill, Seth "Fingers Flynn" Barkan, and Mark Birnbaum

     A jazz band (or jazz ensemble) is a musical ensemble that plays jazz music usually without a conductor. Jazz bands usually consist of a rhythm section and a horn section. The rhythm section of a jazz band consists of the percussion, double bass or bass guitar, and usually at least one instrument capable of playing chords, such as a piano, guitar,The horn section consists of wind and brass instruments, which play the melody and main accompaniment. Typical horns found in a big jazz band include 4 to 5 trumpets, saxophones (2-3 altos, 2 tenors, and a baritone), 3-4 trombones, and a bass trombone.

     With the end of prohibition in the United States, a more 'danceable' form of jazz music arose, giving birth to the 'Swing Era'. Swing music, also known as swing jazz or simply swing, is a form of jazz music that developed in the early 1930s and had solidified as a distinctive style by 1935 in the United States. Swing uses a strong anchoring rhythm section which supports a lead section that can include brass instruments, including trumpets and trombones, woodwinds including saxophones and clarinets or stringed instruments including violin and guitar; medium to fast tempos; and a "lilting" swing time rhythm. Swing bands usually featured soloists who would improvise a new melody over the arrangement.   Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman, Count Basie, Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, and Duke Ellington's bands are some of the most famous. Except for Duke Ellington, all those bands were primarily dance bands, with big swinging backbeats.            Many of the great post war jazz singers sang with these bands in the infancy of their careers..

03.02.  Vocal Jazz

         Voice has been a part of jazz since the beginning. Almost every instrumental jazz style has its vocal equivalent. Louis Armstrong revolutionized music with his horn and natural singing style. The entrance of Billie Holiday into the world of jazz singing in the early 1930s was a revelation. She approached the voice from a radical angle, explaining, in her own words. Lena Horne and Ethel Waters used standard songs as a means for personal expression and how they phrased their lines influenced others well past the Swing era. The lush voices of Billy Eckstine and his protege Sarah Vaughan worked in the Bop idiom that they helped create. While Ella Fitzgerald could front a full string orchestra with an amazingly pure voice, she could also scat (improvise wordlessly on a melody) better than even Mel Torme, who epitomized the 1950s Cool West Coast scene with his sophisticated, light swing. Betty Carter took singing further out by abandoning the narrative of lyrics and influencing arty Post-Boppers








03.02 Post-war jazz   (1950s and 1960s)

             The birth of Rock & Roll as a distinct genre, and a new generation of teenagers having different tastes than their previous adult audience caused a significant decline in Jazzâ€™s popularity. Many of the singers that had worked with the great big bands of the swing era were now solo artists, in the prime of their careers and many had achieved fame internationally. Sarah Vaughan, Mel TormÃ©, Lambert, Hendricks & Ross, Billy Eckstine, Joe Williams, Dinah Washington, Tony Bennett, Anita O'Day, Chris Connor, June Christy, Billie Holiday, Nina Simone, Dakota Staton, and Carmen McRae all greatly advanced vocal jazz at this period.
