"Move Goat (Malawi)"

Teams race through Malawi where a puzzling 
patriotic Roadblock causes one team to fall 
behind. Also, with a Double U-Turn on the line, 
teams must choose whether to sabotage their 
fellow Racers for a chance at first place.

(Rules are unclear if a show such as this would
be 'reality' or 'competitive reality'. Due to
this being a literal race involving lots of
running and high motion we went with 
'competitive'.

22/Slower
Evolve...or die.

Enjoy :)
