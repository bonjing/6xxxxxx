Plot..........: Stephen and Ian are ruthless drug lords who are in the 
                middle of a war with their rival Billy Rae Douglas. One 
                night Stephen and Ian escort two girls home with them 
                whom actually seem to be stranger than they are. The next
                morning they wake up and the girls are gone and Stephen 
                and Ian are not feeling so well and soon find out their 
                lives have been changed forever. They find out that the 
                girls were actually Angels that infected them with a 
                vampire type virus. In exchange for immortality, Stephen 
                and Ian along with the other hordes of Vampires, are to 
                kill off the human race so that the Angels can take back 
                what should have been theirs. The Vampires begin their 
                slaughter until the Demon world steps in to put an end
                to the Angel's plans, for the Demons are satisfied with 
                the way the three worlds co-exists.
