Years after taking Stilwater for their own,
the Third Street Saints have evolved from street gang to household brand name,
with Saints sneakers, Saints energy drinks and Johnny Gat bobblehead dolls
all available at a store near you. 

The Saints are kings of Stilwater, but their celebrity status has not gone unnoticed. 
The Syndicate, a legendary criminal fraternity with pawns in play all over the globe, 
has turned its eye on the Saints and demands tribute.
