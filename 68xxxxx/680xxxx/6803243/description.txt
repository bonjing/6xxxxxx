CDlinux is a compact distribution of GNU/Linux. The name is a synonymous of â€œCompact Distro Linuxâ€. It is small in size, yet rich in features.
You can use CDlinux as your â€œMobile OSâ€. Install it onto a USB key, take it anywhere and turn any PC/Mac that supports booting from USB to your own workstation, with the same user interface. CDlinux ships with an up-to-date version of the Linux kernel, Xorg, Xfce, and many popular applications, like Firefox, Pidgin, GIMP, and even Java and Wine. Just work anywhere like at home.
You can also use CDlinux as a handy admin/rescue tool. For this purpose, the much smaller â€œstandardâ€ edition is enough. The standard edition bundled with a lot of popular admin/rescue tools, like parted, partimage, partclone, testdisk, foremost, ext3grep, e2undel, e2fs/jfs/hfs/ntfs/reiserfs/vfat/xfs tools, and much more. Enough for your routine admin/rescue work. 
CDlinux has good i18n/locale support. Currently de_DE, en_CA, en_GB, en_US, fr_CA, fr_CH, fr_FR, ja_JP, ru_RU, zh_CN, and zh_TW are fully supported. And users can easily configure CDlinux to support their own locales.

This is a development release. Built with our new, gcc-4.6 based toolchain. In fact, every bit in 0.9.7 was rebuilt from scratch. And almost all components were upgraded to their latest stable version.
Our tests show that, this release is already quite stable and ready for general use. But to ensure long-term production use, more tests and fine-tunings are still needed.
Major user noticeable changes in 0.9.7 are:
      SquashFS-4: 0.9.7 now uses the new squashfs 4 filesystem. As a result, your old .md files won\'t be recognized by default. If you want to convert your squashfs 3 .md files to squashfs 4, please use \'unsquashfs3\'and \'mksquashfs\'(shipped with 0.9.7).
      Hybrid ISO: You can \'dd\' the 0.9.7 ISO image onto a USB stick, and boot from it.
      Amount: CDlinux\' own hotplug solution to replace hal/udisks. It\'s (hopefully) simple and stupid, and may needs more fine-tunings.

The package upgrade list is huge, some major ones:
      linux-3.1
      glibc-2.14.1
      gcc-4.6.2
      xorg-server-1.11.2
      firefox-8.0
