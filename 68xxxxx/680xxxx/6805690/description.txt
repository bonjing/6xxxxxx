Stone inherits and develops the artistic principles of The Second Circle â€” the previous work of the director and his colleagues â€” playwright Yury Arabov, director of photography Alexander Burov, sound director Vladimir Persov. However, in this new work the visual component, based on the traditions of Russian impressionism, is even more active. The black and white image is far closer to a monochrome water-colour as the creators never forget to soften the black deepness of shadows.

As far as its dramatic intonation is concerned, Stone is undoubtedly a Russian film, but not only due to the fact that we can recognize Anton Chekhov in one of the characters and not only because the action takes place in the house where a famous Russian family once lived.

This is a profoundly lyrical film because of its special \'chamber\' atmosphere and the modesty of emotions: quiet intonations, permanent sadness, and a feeling of the deeply tragic nature of life. Stone is a film that would never search for the audience: its voice is too quiet. This film will meet with its audience only if the audience searches for it.
