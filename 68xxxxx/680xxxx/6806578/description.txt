Rogue is an upcoming dubstep star artist, winning over thousands of YouTuber\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s with his tracks within only a month.
Rogue started building a fan-base at the start of October 2011, and is an internet outlet of musical creativity from the mind of 20-year-old writer/producer, Joel Hunt - which tends to fall under the Electronic/Dubstep genre. 
During the first month of fan-base building, Rogue has :

This is an unofficial release; He does not have any albums released yet as he is new to track releases. Without a doubt, he could well be the new Skrillex.
~ Please keep in mind~ 
These tracks are either free downloads or ripped from youtube/converted. This album was created fan based to get his name out there.
