ztv, ettv, vtv, and others should realize that downloading 350 or 550 mb files is getting very expensive as well as a pain for storage , so they should try and do what

are doing, instead of avi making mkv ,flv or mp4 files of smaller sizes (almost half).
it will also help the uploaders since it will cut down on storage and download time.peace"
