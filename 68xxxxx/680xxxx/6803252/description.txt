Colin Murray introduces highlights and reaction from three Premier League matches which include the 
London derby between Fulham and Tottenham Hotspur. Fulham boss Martin Jol will have approached 
this match with relish given he was manager of Tottenham for three years. Still a hugely popular figure 
among Spurs fans, the Dutchman will put sentiment to one side as he bids to end Fulham's dismal run 
in league fixtures between these sides. The Cottagers have only beaten Tottenham in one of their last 
10 league matches, but they triumphed easily against Harry Redknapp's side 4-0 in the FA Cup last season. 
The other fixtures include struggling Bolton hosting Stoke at the Reebok Stadium and Wigan travelling to 
the Midlands to play Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux. As always there will also be a review of all 
the goals and incidents from Saturday's matches - with the analysis led by MOTD2 regular, Lee Dixon.
