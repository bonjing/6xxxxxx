Mainwaring is under pressure. At the ceremonial church
parade he is the only one without a medal to wear - even
Pike has a boy scout badge.

Ridiculed by Captain Square, he has no option but to
challenge the Eastgate platoon to a series of initiative
tests. With the vicar, the verger and Mr Hodges as judges,
the platoon races to hoist their flag from the church tower.
