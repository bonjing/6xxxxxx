Burn.Notice.S05E18.480p.WEB-DL.x264-mSD [MKV 276MB]

[/b][/color] Covert intelligence operative Michael Westen has been punched, kicked, choked and shot.
Now he's being burned, and someone's going to pay! When Michael receives a "burn notice", blacklisting him from the intelligence community and compromising his very identity, he must track down a faceless nemesis without getting himself killed in the process.
Meanwhile, Michael is forced to double as a private investigator on the dangerous streets of Miami in order to survive.
Fully loaded with sly humor, Burn Notice is a fresh spin on the spy genre with plenty of precarious twists to keep you guessing and enough explosive action to keep you riveted!
