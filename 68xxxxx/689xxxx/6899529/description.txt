                Christmas Episode.
                A Victorian comedy adventure in the style of Charles
                Dickens. Jedrington Secret-Past is a happy family man
                with a successful business until on Christmas Eve
                Malifax Skulkingworm, a lawyer with a flinty heart
                and an evil hat, tells him he owes a massive debt he
                never knew of, and imprisons his family and shop in
                London's most notorious debtors prison, the Skint.
                What is behind Skulkingworm's sinister plan? Will
                Jedrington rescue his family in time for Christmas?
                And is there more to the name of Secret-Past than
                meets the eye? All will be revealed in a tale of
                hidden wills, brave urchins, giant clocks, misery,
                joy and treacle.
