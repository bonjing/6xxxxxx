This pack was collected rendered and compiled by me and Ive added a couple of motorbike renders by my mates Flashs, Cojogo and Slinkyf so Ta Muchly lads :) 

Like all Photoshoppers and peeps on the computer I took the wallpapers from as many different places as I could using our friend Google. Afterall thats what we Photoshoppers do isnt it lol Then I ruined my eyesight in rendering them for many hours for peeps to hopefully use in their grafix works later.

I\'d like to thank all the sites and all the members on them that post these stocks and wallpapers so all of the grafix makers can come along and take them like what I done ;)  There is a complete list of all such sites on our sites for further information.
Ta Muchly peeps :)

Im sure you will find this pack well worth the downloading and if you need ANY other Photoshop resources, need help or advice with anything grafix related or just fancy joining a photoshop forum to be with like minded peeps who have a laugh while making things then come and see us at one of the sites below. You will be more than welcome to join in.

Love and peace
