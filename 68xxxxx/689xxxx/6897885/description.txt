  The second Scrappy Races competition sees the return of the Chaos     
  Crew from Doncaster, who are joined by the Cops and Bodgers from the  
  Home Counties, London-based motorcycle maniacs the Knuckleheadz, and  
  Scottish engineers the Tartan Scarlets.                               
                                                                        
  Episode3 - Hill Climb                                                 
                                                                        
  The teams have a mountain to climb in this week's Scrappy Races.      
  They have just eight hours to tweak their street-legal roadsters      
  into vertigo-inducing hill climbers that can race up a precipitous    
  1:2 hill in the Yorkshire Dales.                                      
                                                                        
  As they come into the contest, Knuckleheadz are neck and neck with    
  reigning champions Chaos Crew as they scale the leader-board. But     
  Cops and Bodgers and the Tartan Starlets are right behind them,       
  looking for their first wins.
