 Families from around the world who were devastated by the year's economic 
 turmoil talk about their plights and discuss how they are dealing with the 
 run-up to Christmas. Featuring the stories of a bankrupt Greek businessman 
 who set fire to himself, and middle-class Americans living in tents.
                                        
                                 Enjoy!
