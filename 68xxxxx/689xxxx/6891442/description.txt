The Razors Edge (album)

The Razors Edge is the 12th Australian and 11th international studio album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, released on 24 September 1990 on Atco Records. It is the only studio album to feature drummer Chris Slade, and includes "Thunderstruck" and "Moneytalks," which are among AC/DC's most well-known tracks. The album reached #2 on the US Billboard 200 and #4 in the UK, a smash commercial success that returned the band to the popularity of its glory years between the mid-1970s and early 1980s. The album has been certified 5x platinum (5 million copies sold) in the US, and was re-released in 2003 as part of AC/DC's remasters series. The album was produced by Bruce Fairbairn. Malcolm Young, having completed his rehabilitation for alcoholism, once again played rhythm guitar and co-wrote (with his brother Angus) all the songs on the album.
