  The second Scrappy Races competition sees the return of the Chaos     
  Crew from Doncaster, who are joined by the Cops and Bodgers from the  
  Home Counties, London-based motorcycle maniacs the Knuckleheadz, and  
  Scottish engineers the Tartan Scarlets.                               
                                                                        
  Episode4 - Fire Fighters                                              
                                                                        
  On the banks of the River Tyne, the intrepid bodgers have to convert  
  their roadworthy road hogs into ice cool fire trucks. They have just  
  eight hours in a Newcastle scrapyard to fabricate and forge their     
  way to becoming the winners.                                          
                                                                        
  There's everything to play for as the Knuckleheadz are only a point   
  behind leaders Chaos Crew and a win for either Cops and Bodgers or    
  Tartan Starlets could lift them right up the leader-board.
