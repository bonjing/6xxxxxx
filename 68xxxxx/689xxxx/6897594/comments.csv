/V quality. Haven't downloaded the full title yet, but just wanted to say it's very cool when uploaders include either some screenshots or, better yet, a sample of the actual flick. froggie100 did both and, from an early glance, uploaded a HQ new release. Thanks for going above and beyond man...you have this pirate's sincere appreciation!"
