As Christmas is coming, the vicar is hosting a bazaar
to raise money for comforts for troops. With Mrs Mainwaring
unable to attend after an unfortunate incident with the bath
enamel, the Captain is determined to win her one of the three
oranges that Hodges has put up for auction. However, the
Warden is equally determined that he doesn't.
