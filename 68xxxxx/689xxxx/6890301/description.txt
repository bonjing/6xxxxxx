Hit is a 2003 compilation album of songs by British musician Peter Gabriel. It reached #29 in
the UK album charts and #100 in the US. Disc one is labelled Hit and disc two Miss, reflecting
the first discs containing several of Gabriels biggest-selling singles.

The two-disc set is different in the UK and US because of the second disc. The second disc in
the US spans fourteen songs by Gabriel, whilst the UK second disc features fifteen songs. Only
some of these appeared on the US version. The UK version collects at least one track from every
studio album by Gabriel, including soundtracks, except for Birdy, which is the only album not
represented by a track.

The album is an alternative to Shaking the Tree, Gabriels previous greatest hits album that
was outdated at the time of Hit\'s release by thirteen years. Gabriel has not released any
greatest hits albums since.
