Art work for the box and the two thin-packs in the collection included with
film one.
Each film comes with art work for the DVD and I have also included a separate
cover for each film. Theese covers have the same front image as the thumb-nail
pictures on the box backside. (Information on audio and subs on theese covers
does not match this release).
