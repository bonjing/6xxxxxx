DVDSCR... SCR is short for screener.... a screener is a preview sent out by Production Companies to the Media. Generally they are of lower quality and often contain watermarks or stamps indentifying ownership. Don't save this version. Wait for the aired one.
Secondly EZTV is a Bot.... Bots can't answer questions. A bot is a software application that runs automated tasks over the Internet.
Here's the EZTV website, which tells you what was and is going to be posted....

Hope these few bits of info help you out in some small way.
Merry Christmas. Bart."
