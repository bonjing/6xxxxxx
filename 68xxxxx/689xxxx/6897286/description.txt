We were happy to donate a dvd of this movie to the local library
after making a DivX version of it for you which we posted here earlier.

Although it offers better res and bitrate, the xvid we found here seems to seed
much better - so we purloined it and swapped out the audio track with a 
192k version from the dvd we had purchased and added a whole bunch of subtitles
for you so that we could justify the offering since it did come from khutumi (tpb)
who is happy to be seeding this movie too with 128k audio instead. Oh well its 
not a huge difference - so grab whichever appeals to you more.

this xvid is 496 x 352 whereas our divx is 720 x 480 at 800k video 160 audio

Sorry, no German subtitles or Swedish etc were to be found at the time
of this posting. Better luck next time I hope!


This movie tells a great deal of the personality types that
worked with Hitler, the insane rantings of a scorched earth policy that saw
Hitler turn against Germans in an ugly way  and about the conscience in those like
Speer who refused his orders when they could.
