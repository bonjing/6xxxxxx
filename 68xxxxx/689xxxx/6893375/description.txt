Inventive and beautifully delivered material, suffused with Campbell s
creative and vibrant handling of language and storytelling (Northings.com)

Elegant, simple and emotive songwriting . . . stunning (Sunday Mail)

Whimsical and undefinable (Highland News)

Named for a character in an eerily vivid dream, Abagail Grey is theshape-shifting creative guise of Scottish singer-songwriter Claire Campbell.
Both a classically-trained pianist and a traditional fiddler, with influences ranging from Leonard Cohen to Chopin, the Beach Boys to the Jackson 5, she distils these disparate flavours into deceptively catchy, delicately off-kilter folk-pop ballads, gaining a fast-growing fanbase on both sides of the Atlantic.
