  This manic four-part series takes five top Scrapheap teams and gives  
  them five weeks to build five freakish, monster, mutant motors at     
  home. These basic rigs are then taken on a fantastic, hairy race      
  across England, Scotland and Wales.                                   
                                                                        
  Episode4 - Water Race                                                 
                                                                        
  The intrepid teams of metal-mangling road runners have made it to     
  the end of the series. After building their Scrapheap monsters and    
  driving them more than a thousand miles across this green and         
  pleasant land, the five favourite funsters arrive in bonny Scotland   
  for a watery challenge.                                               
                                                                        
  Here at Loch Lomond, they have just eight hours to convert their      
  road-going revellers into seaworthy speedboats ready for a 200-metre  
  dash on the waves. Is this the most bonkers race of all? Of course -  
  it's the final of Scrappy Races!
