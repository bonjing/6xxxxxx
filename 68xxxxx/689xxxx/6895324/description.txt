Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol is a musical adaptation of Charles Dickens' famous short story A Christmas Carol starring the character Mr. Magoo. Aside from the 1950 marionette special The Spirit of Christmas, it was the first animated holiday program ever produced specifically for television, originally airing in December 1962,[2] and the only one until the stop-motion Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer was first shown in December 1964. The special also inspired the 1964 TV series The Famous Adventures of Mr. Magoo.[3] It featured the voice of Jim Backus as Magoo, with voice over appearances by Paul Frees, Morey Amsterdam, Joan Gardner, and Jack Cassidy.
