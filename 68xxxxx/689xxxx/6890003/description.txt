Review for Allmusic.com

by Steve Huey

The Cramps' humor has always relied on trashy tastelessness, but even at its most offensive, it is usually delivered with a wink, preventing it from degenerating into mindless vulgarity. Unfortunately, Look Mom No Head! doesn't do a good job of retaining this balance, as the flat performances and lack of intensity and energy fail to supply the irony necessary for the Cramps' music to work well. Sleaze without fun is simply embarrassing.
