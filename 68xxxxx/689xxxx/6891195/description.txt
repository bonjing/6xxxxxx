Â Â Â Â Â Not much to say here, just that no one has provided the more recent episodes in a portable device friendly version that isn't freaking huge (and didn't bother to normalize the audio).  Works great with most newer digital TVs, computers, and many portable devices.  Sorry, until VLC is released again for the newer iPods and iPads, these aren't really compatible.

NOTE:  There was a slight inconsistency in the previous released files that did not cause any issues with any players, except VLC.  This has been corrected, but it does change several bytes in the files, so, the previous files will not match the internal checksums of these newer files.  Don't just point this torrent at the previous files, unless you don't mind replacing the ones you already have (at a loss of bandwidth).

Enjoy,
