This is a rip of a VHS tape.  It's Billy Idol's Charmed Life and Other Vital Videos including Cradle of Love and L.A. Woman (both directed by David Fincher).  I bought this tape to have a clean copy of L.A. Woman, a song that I think Billy did a fine job with and a video that shows David's remarkable work.  Also included are Prodigal Blues, Mony Mony, and Hot In The City.  Scans of the front and back cover are included in the torrent.  See them for full details.  I've also pulled out L.A. Woman into a separate file in case that's all you're after.  You'll have to strip out the other videos yourself.

The VHS tape is coded to a single file, DivX compatible, 640x480, about 2kbps, with MP3 audio.  The tape was NTSC with 3:2 pulldown so, inverse telecine was applied and the resulting framerate is 23.976 fps.  File plays fine in mPlayer, DivX player, Windows Media Player with DivX codec installed, etc.  Enjoy!
