Big Gun

\\\\\\\"Big Gun\\\\\\\" is a song by AC/DC. It was released as a single in 1993 and can be heard on the soundtrack to the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie Last Action Hero, as well as during reruns of the Savage Nation talk show as bumper music. It was later released on the 2009 box set Backtracks. It became the band\\\\\\\'s first No. 1 on the Album Rock Tracks chart in 1993.

AC/DC has only played the song live once during 1996 rehearsals but never at an official show, even though it is considered a fan favourite.


Last Action Hero is a 1993 American action-comedy-fantasy film directed and produced by John McTiernan. It is a satire of the action genre and its clichÃ©s, containing several parodies of action films in the form of films within the film.
