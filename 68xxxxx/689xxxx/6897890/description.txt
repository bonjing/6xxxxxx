  The second Scrappy Races competition sees the return of the Chaos     
  Crew from Doncaster, who are joined by the Cops and Bodgers from the  
  Home Counties, London-based motorcycle maniacs the Knuckleheadz, and  
  Scottish engineers the Tartan Scarlets.                               
                                                                        
  Episode1 - Road Race:                                                 
                                                                        
  The first test for the teams is proving their hog is truly            
  roadworthy, and then they race head-to-head to decide who takes the   
  early top spot on the leader-board.
