Live it up today, your time is up tomorrow.  In the Year of the City 2274, humans forsake the ravaged outer environment by living in a vast, bubbled metropolis.  There, computerized servo-mechanisms provide all the needs and everyone can pursue endless hedonism.  Endless, that is, until Last Day.  That's when anyone who's 30 must submit to Carrousel, a soaring, spinning trip to eternity and supposed rebirth.

The screen's first use of laser holography provides some of the sci-fi kicks in this post-apocalyptic saga honored with a Special Achievement Academy Award for Visual Effects.  Michael York plays Logan 5, a government Sandman authorized to terminate Runners fleeing Carrousel.  Logan is almost 30.  Catch him if you can.
