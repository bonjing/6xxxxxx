This pack of over 220 Fractals and Lens Flares were collected by me over the time Ive been into Photoshop and put together hopefully to save you some time and maybe give you some inspiration for your future photoshop works.

They can all be found individually on both sites Im on as well as many many others images of all types whether theyre renders, stocks, wallpapers, c4d's etc. 
As well as all other grafix resources you will need for your photoshop addiction.

Im sure you will find this pack well worth the downloading and if you need ANY other Photoshop resources, need help or advice with anything grafix related or just fancy joining a photoshop forum to be with 
like minded peeps who have a laugh while making things then come and see us at one of the sites below. You will be more than welcome to join in. 
Just bring your imagination.

Love and peace
