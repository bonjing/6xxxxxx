Lost Planet takes place in the year known in the game as T.C. -80 on the 
fictional planet of E.D.N. III. After the Earth's conditions become too hostile 
for humans due to war, global warming and pollution, a fictional interstellar 
megacorporation named Neo-Venus Construction (NEVEC) plans to colonize E.D.N. 
III, a new Earth-like planet in grip of a brutal ice age. NEVEC discover that 
E.D.N. III is inhabited by an aggressive and territorial insectoid alien species 
named the Akrid, which come in all shapes and sizes and generate their own 
precious thermal energy. 150 years after a great war was fought in which the 
humans lost to the Akrid, the plot of the game revolves around Wayne Holden, a 
soldier who attempts to overthrow NEVEC, who still vie for control over E.D.N. 
III, and help colonization efforts for the remainder of the human race by 
destroying the Akrid, all the while attempting to survive both betrayals and the 
extreme conditions of the planet.
 

The game is played through a third person over-the-shoulder view. Players are 
allowed to switch between first person and third person at any moment. Players 
either travel on foot or ride various types of mechanized suits called Vital 
Suits (VSs). VSs carry heavy weapons such as chainguns and rocket launchers. 
They can pick up weapons lying on the ground and fire multiple weapons at once. 
On foot, players are able to use a grappling hook to pull themselves up to 
normally hard-to-reach places, or to hook onto a VS and hijack it. Driving VSs 
and using certain weapons requires thermal energy. Also, the planet's cold 
temperature causes the characters' thermal energy level to continually decrease. 
Players can replenish their thermal energy level by defeating enemies or 
activating data posts. Data posts also allow players to use their navigational 
radars to see incoming enemies. Each of the 11 levels is accompanied by a boss, 
which can be either a VS or a large Akrid.
