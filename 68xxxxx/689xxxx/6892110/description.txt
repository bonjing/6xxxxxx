Serie Informatie:
Jessica Day is an offbeat and adorable girl in her late 20s who, after a bad breakup, moves in with three single guys. Goofy, positive, vulnerable and honest to a fault, Jess has faith in people, even when she shouldnâ€™t. Although sheâ€™s dorky and awkward, sheâ€™s comfortable in her own skin. More prone to friendships with women, sheâ€™s not used to hanging with the boys â€“ especially at home.
