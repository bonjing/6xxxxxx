  Taking part in the third series are Maximus, a trio of Bath boat      
  builders in a camper van; the Chainsaw Clan, three Scottish forestry  
  engineers driving an old timber lorry; the Rally Dragons, a trio of   
  rally racing enthusiasts from Caerphilly in a Ford Capri; and the     
  Staffordshire Bulls, three farmers from Stoke in an old pick-up.      
                                                                        
  Episode4 - Boulder Dash                                               
                                                                        
  The teams have just two stages left to determine who will win the     
  rally. They must convert their racers to push a large metal boulder   
  along a track to the top of a hill.
