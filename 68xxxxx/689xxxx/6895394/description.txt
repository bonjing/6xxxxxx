OVERVIEW


The aim of this mod is to bring the world of "A song of Ice and Fire", by George R. R Martin to life, without making any serious changes to the standard Mount and Blade: Warband gameplay.

As I am the only person working on it, it does not currently contain any "original" models nor textures. The new armors and miscellaneous items that you might find in-game are all OSP, with the odd recoloring and retexturing.

As it is also a work in progress, I imagine that there will be a few bugs. I have eliminated most of them myself, and have not experienced any crashes while playing for quite some time. But still, it's currently a beta, remember that. 


To install this modification, simply extract the file "A Clash of Kings" into your steam/steamapps/common/mountblade warband/Module folder.
