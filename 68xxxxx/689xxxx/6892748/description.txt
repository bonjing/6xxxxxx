My own rip from the Three Bats Live DVD.
Wanted to have the audio version in my car, but couldn`t find it anywhere.

too bad it`s 128kbps mp3 but still sounds ok.
going to rip it in better quality when I have time.

tracklist here:

I`ll seed it for a while (fiberspeed) but you have to take it over after a few days :)
