I repacked this installation because when I downloaded it myself the instructions were horrible, files were all over the place, and there were about 3 steps of the install I could remove to make it easier on you.

That said, I've done all the preliminary "copy this file to that" and "extract this to here" garbage for you.  You just have to follow some simple instructions now, which is how it should be.

Enjoy!

P.S.  Normally I would give credit to the original individual who offered this up to the public but the version I downloaded had already been repacked several times (and was still a mess) so I'm not gonna give credit to them, and they didn't give credit to anyone so I can't give credit to the actual person who deserves it.  I'm sure you know who you are though.
