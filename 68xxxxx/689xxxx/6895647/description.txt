    Corey Barker, Executive Producer of PlanetPhotoshop.com and one of     
    the Photoshop Guys of Photoshop User TV, brings you this handy and     
    inspiring volume in the Down & Dirty Tricks series. Yes, this book     
    is an insane collection of some of the most mind-blowing Photoshop     
    effects youï¿½ve ever seen in one place. Ever wonder how that movie      
    poster was created, or how they created that cool magazine ad, or      
    maybe even how to take a seemingly mundane photo and give it the       
    Hollywood treatment?

| |     So little hate, so much time. With time, comes even more hate,      | |
