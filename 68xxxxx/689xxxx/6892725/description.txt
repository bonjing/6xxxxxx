  Is it possible for professional musicians from the BBC Concert        
  Orchestra to make beautiful sounds out of garbage? This documentary   
  aims to find out. For the first time ever an entire orchestra of 44   
  instruments will be built from just scrap. The quest to build an      
  orchestra of instruments out of rubbish is more than just a musical   
  spectacle - in the construction of these instruments we delve into    
  the history of instrument making and the science of music, why        
  different instruments are made the way they are, why some designs     
  have not changed for hundreds of years and why, when played           
  together, the sound of an orchestra is unlike anything else on earth. 
                                                                        
  Inspirational conductor Charles Hazlewood leads the challenge and     
  charges a group of the UK's top instrument makers with the mission    
  of transforming junk, broken furniture and the contents of roadside   
  skips into an orchestra of instruments.                               
                                                                        
  The BBC Concert Orchestra - a team of virtuoso performers - will put  
  their reputations on the line by using these instruments to stage     
  what they hope will be a flawless performance of Tchaikovsky's 1812   
  Overture at the 2011 Proms. But will the scrapheap orchestra pass     
  muster at the mother of all classical musical festivals?
