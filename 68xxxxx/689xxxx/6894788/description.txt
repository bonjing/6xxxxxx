       "Hot in the City" is a 1982 song by Billy Idol, released on his self-titled album. It charted at #23 in the U.S. and #58 in the UK. A re-release of the song in the UK in 1988 reached #13.There are two versions of the video. The first version (the 1982 version) starts off with a girl walking into a record store. She picks up a Billy Idol record and the song starts to play. The video features scenes from New York City, interspersed with stock footage of nuclear bomb tests. The second version  was banned by MTV because it showed Idol's girlfriend Perri Lister nailed to a cross toward the end of the video. The later version was included on the DVD edition of The Very Best of Billy Idol: Idolize Yourself.
