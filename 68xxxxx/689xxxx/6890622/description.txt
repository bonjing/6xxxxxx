The following files are not fully compliant to the PDF Version 1.6 standard and some illustrations or graphs will not be displayed correctly in Adobe Reader or Acrobat. I recommend using PDF X-Change Viewer (freeware) by Tracker Software at  http://www.tracker-software.com/product/pdf-xchange-viewer for (almost) trouble free reading.

eBook #1: \"Understanding Flight, 2nd Edition\" by D. F. Anderson and S. Eberhardt (c2010)
eBook #2: \"Principles of Flight for Pilots\" by P. J. Swatton (c2011)

Description and table of contents:
#1  http://www.mhprofessional.com/product.php?isbn=0071626964
#2  Google the string \"wiley swatton flight productCd-047071073X\" (w/o quotes)

Small bookmarked PDF files, both packed in the same 7-Zip archive for optimised transfer. The 7-Zip \"unpacker\" to restore the files to their original PDF format (and size) after download is available at  http://www.7-zip.org/download.html (Win & Mac; freeware).

Comment: Written for pilots (intuitive description) but pictures and illustrations will certainly be of interest to students enrolled in aerospace/aeronautical engineering (mechanical?)


Once your download has finished, _please_ seed this torrent as often and for as long as you possibly can.
