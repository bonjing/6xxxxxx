The Swing Thing is a 90-minute film tracing the story of swing music, from the jazz clubs of the 1920s,
through the heady days of the Rat Pack and Sinatra to modern stars like Harry Connick Jr and Michael Buble.

Swing sparked a youthful cultural revolution eighty years ago and went on to produce some of the most
iconic stars of the 20th century: Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller, Frank Sinatra and
Dean Martin. Today it is still topping the charts and remains one of the longest-lived and most
successful forms of popular music.

As the band leader Artie Shaw said, â€œSwing is a verb, not an adjectiveâ€ It is something you do.
An action, a rhythm, an energy, an attitude. Swing is the thing which, for over 80 years, has created
the greatest singers, musicians and records and which simply refuses to go away.

Narrated by Kenneth Cranham, The Swing Thing combines commentary and archive footage of some of
the finest swing performers and performances of all time. It also examines the impact swing music
has had on American society: as a youth movement, a force for sexual liberation and a challenge to
the countrys racial divide.
