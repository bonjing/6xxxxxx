::Plot::
Orphaned at a young age, former officer with Goa Police, Arjun Vishnu Bhaagwat, now lives alone, though he has a sweetheart in gorgeous model, Priya.
Amidst reports of police extending their search for missing prostitutes, specifically the Caucasian daughter of a high-profile Russian Diplomat, Arjun is hired by a gangster, Sameer, and for a fee, must not only locate missing call-girls but also their abductor.
Unable to get any clues, he than enlists the assistance of Sameer to recruit a bait, Reshma, who comes from an impoverished family, for the killer. Shortly thereafter Reshma goes missing, and Arjun loses contact with her. Guilt-ridden,
he decides to use all possible resources to try and locate her before she herself becomes included in the official 'missing persons' list.
