Martin StÃ¤Ã¤f (born 13 November 1978), aka Liquid Stranger, is a Swedish-born electronic musician, described by Generation Bass as â€the epitome of Transnational Dubstep covering everything from Latin, Asian, Eastern European and Jamaican Dancehall dubs.â€ Martin StÃ¤Ã¤f is known for his experimental approach to composition where he merges genres to create a unique style of music. Martin Woods of Chillbase describes Liquid Stranger's music as a â€œunique blend of Ambience, Big Band Jazz, Dubstep and Psychedelica drizzled over electronic Dub Reggae grooves.

The Liquid Stranger Project: 2003â€“2009

Martin StÃ¤Ã¤f launched the Liquid Stranger project in 2003. His intention was to have one alias that would encompass all his musical output. Consequently, he has produced a wide variety of music under the name Liquid Stranger. At first, StÃ¤Ã¤f's plan was to keep his identity a secret. He never did interviews or showed his face on stage. StÃ¤Ã¤f states: â€After a while it became quite tricky. in fact, Interchill finally ruined this idea by writing my name on the record sleeves.â€ Liquid Stranger's creative output ranges from suggestive Ambient soundscapes to movie scores, pop, dub, infernalia, drill n bass, and electronica.

The first release under the name Liquid Stranger was the song Environmental Meltdown, featured on the compilation Global Psychedelic Chill Out - Compilation Vol. 4 by Spirit Zone Recordings.

When asked in an interview why he moved away from the trance scene, StÃ¤Ã¤f replied: â€I never really switched per se, I have always made tons of different types of music. During the time I toured with Necton, I produced various stuff like Ambient, Electro and Drill n bass. What excites me is the fusing of genres. I have no fixed style that I stay with too long, I do not like boundaries.â€
