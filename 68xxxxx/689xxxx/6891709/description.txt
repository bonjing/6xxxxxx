Your Computer Magazine June 1981 - April 1988 (incomplete)

** Note: This is a repack of a collection previously available. It is 
** identical except that the PDF's are now approximately half the size!

Your Computer was a multi-format title published by a variety of
companies (IPC, Business Press and Focus Magazines that I know of). It
covered all 80's micros, initially towards a serious and hobbyist
reader, but increasingly towards the gamer through it's lifespan.

These PDFs are the complied collections of page scans available on
www.worldofspectrum.org . They've been OCR'd to allow text searching and
copying - this should prove very useful for the Sinclair archivist who'd
like to have their own local searchable archive. They look great on most
PDF readers, including the iPad.

Several issues are missing from the collection, and in some cases
individual pages. The missing issues are:

Jul 83, Sep 83, Nov 83, Aug 86, Nov 86, May 87, Aug 87-Sep 87, Mar 88

Individual missing pages: Oct 83 (1-4, 59-62, 87-90, 93-94, 99-108,
119-138, 149, 157-158, 167-168, 199-202, 257-260), Jun 87 (page 55-56)

Some of the issues are pretty poor quality scans and the OCR is a bit
rubbish as a result. If anyone knows of any better quality scans
anywhere, please let me know.

More OCR'd scans will be periodically available - please check
retropdfswordpresscom for more information.

Thanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum site
(www.worldofspectrum.org), and ADJB and everyone else on the WoS forums
for help and advice.

90's style "greets" to anyone formally or currently involved in the
Amiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat
Will, mUb and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD
Grapevine. Nostalgia ain't what it used to be ;)
