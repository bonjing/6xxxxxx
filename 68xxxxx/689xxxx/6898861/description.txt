Antic Magazine Issues 01-88 (April 1982 - June 1990) Complete

Antic was a US-based magazine devoted to the 8-bit Atari range -
mainly the Atari 400 / 800. It was published bimonthly at first, then
monthly after the first year.

These PDFs are the complied collections of page scans fromThey've been OCR'd to allow text searching and
copying - this should prove very useful for the retro archivist who'd
like to have their own local searchable archive. They look great on most
PDF readers, including the iPad. Kudos to the original scanner: these
are lovely clean and clear scans, so the OCR has (hopefully) worked
really well.

The file size is slightly larger than the combined size of the original
JPG images, but the image quality has been preserved.

More OCR'd scans will be periodically available - please checkfor more information.

Thanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum siteand everyone on the WoS forums for help and
advice.

Amiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat
Will, mUb and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD
