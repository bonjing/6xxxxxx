IMPORTANT NOTE: no video in this torrent!

This is the entire Harry Potter collection for blind people in MP3 format. All of the eight movies are audio described by Di Langford. The quality of the first three movies isn't great, because I had to take the audio from VHS tapes.

Please seed after you have finished downloading, because it's the only audio described Harry Potter torrent available. If anyone has any requests, I have loads of audio descrbed movies in MP3 format on my laptop, so feel free to request movies and do post a comment!
