It's been done this way for years, the idea being if you download a 700MB file and there's corruption you need to download the whole thing again, however if a rar file is corrupt you just re-download that file. 

It's not a big deal when it comes to BitTorrent because it does it's own verification and re-downloads a piece if it's corrupt.But most files on BT originate from usenet and it's seen as bad behavior in the community to download a file, uncompress it then re-upload it. "
