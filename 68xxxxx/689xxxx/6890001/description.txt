    Directed by Harry Kerwin

    Late-bloomer Ralph Higbee (WILLIAM KERWIN, billed here as 'Thomas        
    Wood') doesn't get hip to the birds and the bees until he's closing      
    in on 40, and still running around his Mommy's house in his 'jammies,    
    spying on the cute Japanese maid who spends most of her time             
    massaging her juggs. But when Mommy croaks, Ralph is left to discover    
    the 'evils' of the opposite sex all by his lonesome.                     
                                                                             
    After years of one sexy debacle after another, Ralph pulls up a          
    barstool in a Miami bar at two in the morning and gets macked on by a    
    gorgeous tart named Gigi (INGRID KERR) who tells him she likes to        
    'play all kinds of naughty games.' Ralph shoos her away and begins a     
    fascinating yarn about his multiple failed marriages that serves as a    
    testimonial to why an average-looking aging nebbish like Ralph Higbee    
    might be hesitant to get involved with a savvy barfly like Gigi....      
                                                                             
    It all begins with his adventures with buxom 'hippie' BUNNY WARE         
    (Strange Rampage) who turns him on to drugs and an orgy -- a             
    harrowing nudity-packed experience that causes him to curmudgeonly       
    lament 'these modern hippie kids with the balling and the pot... it's    
    just too much for ol' Ralph!'                                            
                                                                             
    Falling for the milky-white melons (and the 'dynamite beef               
    stroganoff') of a blonde named Josephine, Ralph makes her Wife Number    
    One. But, soon enough, she's humping her swimming instructor whom        
    Ralph attacks with a sword. Worse, she has Ralph buy her a pet           
    gorilla (!?) who bathes her and gropes her naked bosom. Eeeeeeep!        
    You've got to see how this freaky little bit of cinema obscura plays     
    out....                                                                  
                                                                             
    Amanda, Wife Number Two, hires private detective GENE BURK (Mundo        
    Depravados) to spy on Ralph in the hopes of a fat divorce settlement.    
    When absolutely adorable stenographer BONNIE LAURANT drops in to type    
    up some documents, the sneaky dick forces the two to have sex at         
    gunpoint. Bonnie's nerdy secretary get-up and her banana-shaped tits     
    are the predominant focus of interest here, and poor Ralph ends up       
    with a slap in the kisser before it's all over....                       
                                                                             
    Then it's on to George, Wife Number Three. She seems downright           
    perfect except for a vicious jealous streak and... well... that          
    name....                                                                 
                                                                             
    Director HARRY KERWIN shot My Third Wife George in his home state of     
    Florida. It's a really well acted and occasionally weird little time     
    waster which is lighthearted and quirky without being excessively        
    stupid -- a rare quality in this genre indeed. Bill Kerwin was           
    Harry's brother, and he appeared in a number of H.G. Lewis classicks     
    (such as Blood Feast), as well as most of Harry's films. Also in         
    attendance is musician-actor CHRIS MARTELL (The Gruesome Twosome),       
    while the mysterious stranger stalking Bill is none other than BRAD      
    GRINTER (billed here as 'Duke Moberly'), director of those other         
    shot-in-Florida hits Flesh Feast and Blood Freak. Brad and Bill          
    teamed up again for Harry in the nudist epic Sign of Aquarius in         
    which the two let it all hang out.
