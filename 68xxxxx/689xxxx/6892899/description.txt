The Immortals

At least three double lifes produce confusion â€“ an easygoing and sexy story of competing ambitions for life and for art.

Wolfgang is dealing a double life, secretly and successfully: living at the same time with ambitious, but unsuccessful author Claudia and with elegant-lascivious Birgit. Meanwhile his clueless friend Heinrich tries to make a match between Wolfgang and young waitress Anna. But Wolfgang is ignoring her advances kindly â€¦ At his lonesome dwelling place, a garage, where he is dealing only with art, music and his cars, a tender relationship with the girl Lora is growing.

Heinrich discovers, that his girlfriend Magdalena is working for an erotic massage studio behind his back. Lotte tells him about her latest novel-project: the story of a double life that two young women are dealing with a clueless lover â€“ beyond all jealousy, bound only to art and to an ambitious perspective on life. When Heinrich tells Wolfgang about this novel, Wolfgang is getting suspicious: Is his own challenging concept of lifestyle being turned against him, used as a tawdry literature-research?
