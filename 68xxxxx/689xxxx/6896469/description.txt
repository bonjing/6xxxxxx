I just made this compilation of Time Team 2011 as a tribute to the person who made the 1994 - 2010 compilation. I used the IMDB episode guide to sequence the episodes and added the missing 2010 episode as wel but kept its name as S17E13 ( In some listings this is S18E11). I also put in the specials as I see it. It could be argued that S18E12 and S18E13 are also specials, but I stuck to the IMDB episode guide. Sequensing the specials is based on the folder Time Team Specials 01-45 in the 1994 - 2010 compilation. 

If you enjoy Time Team buy their books and DVD's to support them. Season 18 will be available as a 3 dvd box set from the 6th of Februari 2012.


Enjoy and Seed!!
