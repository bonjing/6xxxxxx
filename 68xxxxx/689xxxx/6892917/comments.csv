because i did several trials to make it work. there are good guides written in the comments but for some reason people cant find the ""register later"" option in the activation.

i believe this is because it's not properly patched yet.(modified version of the people who commented the guide THNX!):

Install Vegas but do not open. Run keygen as admin.
Change the drop down button at the top to Sony Vegas Pro 11 for 32Bbit
Hit generate likes 6 times
Then click patch.
2 folders need to be patched.
navigate to the folder it is installed (eg C:Program FilesSony)
there are 2 subfolders which is (Shared plug-ins) and (vegas pro 11.0)
you need to patch both folders. patch the shared plugins first.
in my case,when i click patch,nothing happened.so i re-selected the folder then only a patch process bar appeared.
do the same for the vegas pro 11.0. i also had to do it twice because for some reason on the first patch click,nothing happened.so i navigate to it again and then click.patch bar seems to appear after that.
Now DO NOT CLOSE KEYGEN.open up vegas pro.
Then put in serial from the keygen.
Then choose register later and put the activation code in.


remember to run the sony vegas installer and keygen as ADMIN.

hope that helps :)"
