Fail!
It has come to my attention that the installer (kiwi) on turtle-0.9.4 has problems and does not properly boot.
The mistake was simple and the solution is simple and I will make another release in January to fix this.
The live-cds can still be used and the system can still be manually installed, but the automated installer will not function in turtle 0.9.4.
