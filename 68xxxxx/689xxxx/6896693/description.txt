This is an old XviD we found on the net initially years ago - its full screen
picture formatted. Its from the ntsc dvd and we have included subtitles from
the DVD which I converted for you in an earlier divX version offering.
As such - it is the longer movie version at 2hrs 13mins and so the subtitles
offerings are not as popularly to be found as the fuller range of the pal DVD 
version offerings we have posted for you here earlier too.


We swapped out the 128k English audio for 192k and added 192k french audio
too so that its a dual language offering for those who would like this combination


srts are included for french Spanish and Portuguese along with close captioned
english subtitles which you could use as a template for other language
subtitles offerings you could create too perhaps.



Enjoy this great movie with the unforgettable scene where we learn that a gal of
Ms. Julie Andrews' spirit is never to be deprived the best there is in the house - 
including at chez louis - amen!

some great mp3s from the soundtrack cd we donated to the library are included
