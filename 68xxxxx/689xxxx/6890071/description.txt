THE HUMAN APE: ON THE VERGE OF EXTINCTION (Legal Torrent, read LICENSE file)

IMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1715217/

The documentary features a group of human species with their own culture, 
tradition, language, identity, religion, healing practices and civilization, 
but are on the verge of near-extinction.

The modern world noticed them less than a decade ago, in the remote foothills 
of the Himalayas in central Nepal.

At the best of their times, about 300 years ago, they were reportedly 400 
in number. When first noticed in 2000, they were 75. Now, their population 
has dwindled down to mere 59.

Because of their nomadic lifestyle, characterized by their disinterest in 
farming and loving to live in temporary fences in deep forest in solitude, 
they are literally heralded as \\\"The Human Apes\\\".

The UN, UNESCO and the government of Nepal recognized this group as the 
most vulnerable among the 57 endangered ethnicities in Nepal, yet little 
has been done to preserve and sustain this ethnic group and their 
civilization.

It took a decade of research to make this documentary. Due to the armed 
conflict and volatile political situation in Nepal, it is made with the 
resources collected and research carried out from 2000 to 2009.

Technical Note: The entire movie is completely made with free and open 
source softwares including the operating system. Technical aspects 
including the Ken Burns effect and Foley audio were meticulously handled 
by three youngsters, aged 17 15 and 11 during summer vacation in 2009.
