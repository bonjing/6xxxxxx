NOTES:

 - If you are using either Windows Vista or Windows 7, you may have some
   problems with colors in the game. There is a .bat file provided that
   can fix this problem: StarCraft (Win7 Color Fix).bat.

 - To play the game using the fix, simply double-click it. You may want
   to edit the file using Notepad to match the location of StarCraft.exe.
   The default location is "C:\"Program Files"\Starcraft\Starcraft.exe".

 - There are Bonus Maps in the Utilities folder that contain several maps
   from the StarCraft Compendium website's Maps of the Month. Some are
   ordinary multiplayer maps while others are trigger maps that play
   using the "Use Map Settings" option.

 - The Bonus Maps also contain the sequel to the Enslavers veteran
   campaign and the Precursor campaign from the StarCraft demo. Copy
   them in the campaign folder in your StarCraft directory's maps folder.
   Play them in-game with "Use Map Settings".

 - The Sound Utilities available can extract in-game sound effects into
   a Sounds folder that will be located in your StarCraft directory. These
   will require at most 92MB, and will allow you to change the sound
   effects used in the game.

 - StarCraft's intruction manual in PDF format is also included in the
   Utilities folder and can provide you with some basic knowledge of
   game mechanics and multiplayer, and also give some backstory behind
   StarCraft's three races.

 - All Cheats including the hidden Radio Free Zerg cheat are also
   available.
