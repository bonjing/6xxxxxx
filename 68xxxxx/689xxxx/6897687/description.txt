The Alex Jones Show
Sunday, 18 December 2011


[sebaygo1]


The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events.

The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.

This LIVE Sunday edition serves as a red alert, a warning that America is slipping into a Soviet-style nightmare. In this special broadcast, Alex urges listeners to realize the grave choice we must all make-- to face up to the harsh realities happening around us, or ignore it and allow the country and globe to slip into total tyranny. It is all happening now -- from a Pentagon-led takeover of the Internet and bills authorizing the clamp down of free speech online to a military takeover in the homeland, emboldened by NDAA legislation authorizing the indefinite detention of Americans without trial and a martial law emergency response grid. Preparations are in place to launch World War III and totally supplant the Constitutional basis for legitimate government in the free world.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
