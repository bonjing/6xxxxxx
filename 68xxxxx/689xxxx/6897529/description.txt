Dressed in Persian clothes, chased by hooligans,
famous Indian-born Rockstar, Jordan, barely     
makes it to a Czech stadium to perform before   
a huge crowd. It was not too long ago that he   
was just an awkward uninhibited collegian       
wanna-be musician with a name of Janardhan      
Jakhar, who was ridiculed everywhere. His       
family wanted him to be inducted in their       
business but he refuses. He is counseled that   
music comes after experiencing pain, so he      
decides to woo Heer Kaul, the hottest girl      
on the college's 'Chicklist' in order to be     
rejected by her and thus experience pain.       
Initially he does face rejection from the       
sophisticated and cultured Heer, but quite      
surprisingly they subsequently become close     
friends, and he finds that underneath the stiff 
upper lip, there is a woman who is full of life
