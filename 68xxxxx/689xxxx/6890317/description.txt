Ivy is quite nervous today, and she should be. As we make her try on the different panties she brought with her for the photo shoot she must be thinking "why the hell did I agree to do this?" - and I wonder that too. Ivy is about as girl-next-door as it gets. She comes from a good but strict home (ah! There's a clue...), wants to study psychology, is smart and well-spoken, and other than a little playing around at parties, Ivy stays faithful to her boyfriend(!). So why did she decide to do her first (and last?) porno today? No idea, honestly. Money, I guess, but there's usually more to it. Maybe it's her way to gauge her attractiveness to the world, or maybe she's trying to do a psych profile on guys who shoot porn in their spare time. Or both. Either way, here she is, demonstrating her panties for us while pretending this is all normal to her. We choose a pair (like it really matters) and I take the pictures. That's always fun because you get to see the "newbieness" of the girls. She doesn't quite know how to pose or what looks good in a photo, but she learns quickly and enjoys the attention. You can see that Ivy is already getting wet (check out the pics), always a good sign.
