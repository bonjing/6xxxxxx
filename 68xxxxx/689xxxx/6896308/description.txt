Ballbreaker

Ballbreaker is the 13th Australian and 12th international studio album by the Australian hard rock band AC/DC, released in September 1995. It was the band's first studio album in five years, since The Razors Edge (1990). The album featured the return of former drummer Phil Rudd, who had been fired from the band in 1983 as a result of drinking and drug problems and a fight with founding rhythm guitarist Malcolm Young. The album was produced by the prolific producer Rick Rubin. Rubin had briefly worked with the band in 1993 to produce the song/single "Big Gun" for the soundtrack to the movie Last Action Hero.

Production started at the Record Plant Studios in New York City, but the band became dissatisfied with the sound there and moved to Los Angeles' Ocean Way Studios.

Two weeks into the US leg of the Ballbreaker World Tour, four gigs were cancelled so that Brian Johnson could attend his father's funeral. During the tour, MTV cartoon characters Beavis and Butthead appeared in the intro during concerts. Five of the album's songs were played live: "Hard as a Rock", "Boogie Man", "Cover You in Oil", "Hail Caesar", and "Ballbreaker".

Ballbreaker was re-released in 2005 as part of the AC/DC remasters series. The album is currently certified 2x platinum by the RIAA in the US, for sales in excess of 2,000,000.
