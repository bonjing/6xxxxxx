The Orator (O Le Tulafale) is a contemporary, dramatic feature film written and directed by Tusi Tamasese and shot on the island of Upolu in Samoa. The story of the film is a universal one of love, honour and courage. This is cloaked in the language, setting & events that are authentically and uniquely Samoan.
