Hi everyone! This ISO file is \"Windows 7 Ultimate Service Pack 1\" (x86) and is Retail, which means that it\'s a clean version of Windows 7 Ultimate. This is only for 32-bit, so if you install this on a 64-bit computer, you may have some issues during the installation. This is a bootable ISO image file, so you can burn this on a DVD and USB Flash Drive using the program, \"Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool\" directly. This file has no hacks, cracks, serials, drivers, hotfixes, and updates. (Don\'t worry, I\'ll give you a serial for this operating system.) So, before I upload this, I started seeding it with, \"uTorrent\". So, please comment if you are having issues with this file during the installation. Also, please seed, thanks! To make sure, I will tell you the system requirements for Windows 7. Enjoy and have fun!
