when i was trying to install, i was having this error saying ""Windows installation encountered an unexpected error. Verify that the installation sources are accessible, and restart the installation"".

i did mounting it using Daemon tools and even use the Win USB/DVD tool. However when i create a partition, it says setup is unable to install.

I don't know if I did something or whatsoever reason why I am getting this errors.

Thanks!"
