Open up toast titanium, make sure Data at the top left is selected then click mac only directly below that.

3 - 

Drag Symphobia 2 Library Part 1.pkg into toast titanium where it says ""drag files and folders into this area"", then drag Symphobia 2 Library Part 2.pkg into the same area, then click save as disk image button (which is slightly to the left of the big red button) save as Symphobia Disk 1 then click ok. A save disk image as box will appear, select desktop if not already selected then click save. Wait for it to create the disk image.

Close toast titanium ( no need to save) then reopen toast titanium and do the same as step 3 but this time drag Symphobia 2 Library Part 3.pkg and Symphobia 2 Library Part 4.pkg into it and then save as Symphobia 2 Disk 2. When done close toast without saving then repeat again to create the 3rd disk image with the 2 remaining packages ie part 5 and part 6.
