Notes: the Italian AC3 5.1 DVD track is a fake 5.1, surround left and right channels are mute
which means that there are only Center,Left,Right,LFE active for a 3.1 track; so a proper 5.1 track 
had to be reconstructed. Proper SR and SL channels were professionaly generated and LFE channel 
from English DTS-HD MA 5.1 track was used for best results. 
The French AC3 5.1 DVD track is just a 5.0 track, the LFE channel was completely missing on the 
DVDRip found on the 'net, unless those weren't done properly, no access to DVD9 ISO to check. So as
with the Italian audio track the LFE channel from English DTS-HD MA was used for best results. 

Regarding the custom menu, due to MultiAVCHD bugs and limitations don't use "setup" on titles
other than the main movie, it would lead to a crash on most players. Otherwise all titles play fine.
And for language audio and subtitles selection just use your player remote controls menu and buttons
to switch, it's easier.

Additional Notes: the BluRay was decrypted using DVDFabPro in BluRay 3D SBS mode. So the 
stream should be 3D SBS. Due to lack of 3D equipment tests couldn't be performed, in theory 
you should be able to watch it in 3D mode (at half horizontal resolution) by manually selecting
Side-By-Side mode on your player/tv set/projector.
