Awake & Aware - Volume 2F
=========================

A conglomeration of several political activist documentaries together on one "movie" DVD. This is an attempt at packing the biggest "punch" in one DVD title. I call the DVD's, "Awake & Aware" after a similarly titled conference in LA September 2009. Enjoy and please spread around :)

P.S. a few mentionables in the DVD:

Japan Earthquake & Tsunami, March 11, 2011
Week One of Japan/Fukushima Disaster, March 2011
Nuclear Industry Commentary on Japan, by Arnie Gundersen
