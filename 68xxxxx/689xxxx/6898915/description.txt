brain first and if necessary your sledgehammer. Dead Block is a 3rd person
zombie themed arcade game with a unique mix of action, humor and strategy

Set in the US during the idyllic 1950s, Dead Block takes players to
a simpler time when a gallon of gas cost a few pennies, the "golden age
of cinema was in full swing, and that new (and apparently insanely evil
craze called rock n' roll swept the nationand caused an apocalyptic
musical plague to turn the deceased into the walking dead

As one of three survivors of the shuffling zombie onslaught  Boy Scout
Mike Bacon, construction worker Jack Foster, and no-nonsense meter maid
Foxy Jones, each with their own unique "Smart Bomb" attack  players will
fortify their area by boarding up windows and setting a variety of unique
unlockable traps, collect items and power-ups, take on zombies one-on-many
with a variety of upgradeable weapons, and even rock them to shreds with
awesome guitar power
