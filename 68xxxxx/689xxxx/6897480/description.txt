                Drama set in post-World War II Britain and based on
                the award-winning novel by Michelle Magorian.
                Troubled 15-year-old Henry lives in a fraught
                household with his mum, stepfather and grandmother.
                Henry has always believed that his father Joseph died
                during the war, and he puts his dad on a pedestal
                while his relationship with his mother is fractured
                and difficult. Then his father appears out of the
                blue, turning the whole family's lives upside-down.
                Henry sees his dad's unexpected return as an
                opportunity to make up for lost time but, as events
                unfold, he starts to realise that the absent father
                he had idolised might not be worthy of hero status.
