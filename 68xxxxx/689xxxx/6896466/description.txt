If you use bittorrents, eDonkey, Gnutella or any other P2P network, then you are likely being scanned by investigators. 
In an effort to trap and prosecute people for abusing copyrighted movies and music, investigators often pose as P2P downloaders. 
While they themselves share and download copyrighted files, these "posers" also scan and log your IP (internet protocol) address. 
Your computer IP address then becomes ammunition for civil lawsuits, where you may be sued for copyright infringement.

with peerblock you're more safe to not get caugh by anti-p2p organizations :)
