                                Allen Gregory
                           +++ HDTV (XviD/MP3) +++
                            The Complete Season 1


The Series follows Allen Gregory De Longpre (Jonah Hill), a pretentious seven-year-old being raised by his father, Richard, and his father's (surprisingly heterosexual) life partner, Jeremy, and Julie, an adopted daughter. Allen Gregory must start attending a public elementary school due to the effect of the recession on his family's finances. Richard also pressures Jeremy to secure employment due to the financial issues, although Richard avoids divulging information to Jeremy as to why they need additional income.

Allen is enamored of the school principal Judith Gottlieb, much to her disapproval. She protests but is forced to accept his behavior due to pressure from the school superintendent who is friends with Allen's father.
