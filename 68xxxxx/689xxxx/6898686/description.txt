In this Christmas special, James and the team try to create their own Christmas miracle, by making it snow. Oz Clarke is dispatched in a small plane armed with a salt shaker to see if cloud seeding really will produce the desired effect.

Back in the Man Lab, James invents a Christmas tree decorating blunderbuss, he discovers the easiest way to wrap presents and he attempts to transform the tired Christmas cracker by making his own - with shocking results. Along with a military-planned Christmas dinner preparation campaign, this is the one Christmas show no man can afford to miss.
