 Inspired by the folk tales passed on from one  
 generation to another, 'Dus Tola' is a simply  
 told story of victory of goodness over greed.  
 The story is set in Sonapur, a quaint little   
 town that has its share of eccentrics. Shankar 
 , the local goldsmith, is head-over-heels in   
 love with his neighbor's daughter Suvarnalata  
 much to the chagrin of her father Daya Shastri 
 Shastri is bent upon finding her a suitable    
 groom from Dubai and cover her with gold at
