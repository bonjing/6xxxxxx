For anyone that might be slightly retarded and having trouble activating Pro version:

1. Acquire the software via Torrent Client

2. When complete, open the destination folder of the acquired software

3. Double-Click OR Right-Click and Select ""Open"" on the 'pds_install.exe' file.

4. While that file is installing, open the 'key.txt' file with your preferred Notepad application (I prefer EditPad, or Notepad++)

5. At the end of the installation make sure either the box is checked to open the software, or open the software after the installation is complete. 

6. After the software is open click on the ""Help"" tab, the click ""Register...""

7. Now Copy/Paste the Name and Serial in the correct places.

8. Enjoy your FULL version, and thanks again to Anacondaz!
