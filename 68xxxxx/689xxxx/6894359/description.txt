Infernal Restraint\Bound Thing 2  Claire Adams  + Pics


Most people consider alarm clocks to be a necessary annoyance. Most people are not Claire Adams. For her the morning wake-up call is a painful experience. Electrodes are run to her chest so that PD can make sure she is alert and ready for the day ahead of her. It will not even be the worst part of her morning. Not by a long shot. He has a lot of electrodes and she has a lot of places to put them. She is going to become more alert by the minute.
