Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Friday, December 16 edition the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with James Lane and Chris Emery, the director and producer respectively of A Noble Lie: Oklahoma City 1995, a documentary that takes a fresh and in-depth look at the circumstances surrounding the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and the government\'s deeply-flawed investigation. 

NOTE :: Director/producer James Lane has requested that we wait at least until after April 19 to distribute via BitTorrent. He is trying to recoup costs for this film, and continue work on the next project.

The movie itself is outstanding, and you can order a copy at http://FreeMindFilms.com. The case it makes for prior knowledge is a slam dunk. It also has a lot of material not covered in other documentaries. 

From: James Lane, Wednesday, December 14, 2011 --
We think that this movie has the potential to
reach main stream audiences. We are planning a national ad
campaign to run at that time. In addition this will give us
time to recoup our costs, which was 80% out of our own
pockets, and hopefully have enough for our next production.
If we can fund these movies ourselves then no one has any
control over our content.

Alex also covers the latest news, including a run-down on last night\'s Republican debate in Iowa, the increasing public (and U.S. armed forces) support of candidate Ron Paul as the Iowa caucus approaches, and other breaking news stories on the economy and the prospect of war.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the \"big 
 picture.\" A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you\'ve researched it yourself.
