
The More than Complete DC-Now More Completerer!

This fifty-third alphabetical installment is:  DC from X-Z

What's This?
     It's a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh! Â®Â©)â„¢, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and M.C. Gaines among others.
       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those "Pre-DC" comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC super-heroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heroes are Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and among many others. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will be some "Post DC" comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c. 925gb in total. It will take as long as it takes, but it's nearly done. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.

=================================

     Since this is the final torrent of the A-Z postings, the final fill torrents are coming soon. I'd really like to know of anything I forgot, skipped, screwed up, or omitted with malicious intent.
     If you think just maybe you know something I should have included, that any idiot with a gnat's brain would have included, speak up. Perhaps something you wish upon a star I'd included? Is there stuff you know is scanned but apparently I don't, anything tenuously connected to anything ever even glanced at for one second by someone who worked for DC for five minutes? 
    Speak soon, or forever hold your peace. When I up the last fill, which will be part 56 or  maybe 57, your chance will have expired.  If there's any comic that I can share, let me do it now, for I may never torrent this way again. Sniff.

=================================
Today we have a serious message, nothing funny about this at all.

     If you don't know about SOPA and the Protect IP acts before the US congress right now, (Senate and Hose version of the same basic thing) you need to learn. In short hey would place unprecedented power to censor the internet in the hands of the government, private corporations, groups like the MPAA,RIAA, and anyone who claims copyright to material on line. No longer would they have to sue and prove their case before action was taken, no longer would overseas servers like this one be relatively safe from US laws (that are more restrictive than local ones). This act would allow for  sites to be blocked from the entire US, without due process. Non-US sites would be untouched but, but we would be cut off. Anonymous proxies that get around this might easily be blocked as well.  This would not be limited to blocking P2P sites. The law is so  broad and misguided ISPs could be forced to block entire websites because of a single alleged copyright violations, such as a U-Tube video of an amateur musician singing a copyright song. Some will try to sooth you with words about "intent of the law" and "trust in our law enforcement and court system not to abuse it." But legislative intent often means little compared to the letter of the law. Most law enforcement personnel are well intentioned and trustworthy, but still their is a long history of abuse of legal powers, and plenty of illegal actions as well. At best they can only enforce the law as is. They have to do so wether they like the law or not. Courts likewise don't have to deliberately abuse a law that  is as miswritten as this. Judges have to deal with the law as is, unless they can find it unconstitutional. Honest judges will still have to let this craziness go forward. 
      There are some legit problems that may require new laws, but these bills are the wrong laws to do the job. They will do more harm than good.   What the acts say is terrible, and would likely have a chilling (think arctic cold) power over internet free speech and expression -  not just online piracy and sales of counterfeit goods  as recent TV ads in the US claim. If you see them, they are the ones talking about a hundred  thousand (and more) american jobs being lost due to online piracy and sales of counterfeit goods., a figure I very much doubt. Any such claim is disingenuous even if true. Far more  jobs were sent overseas deliberately  by US business than were ever lost to pirate media and counterfeit goods. In fact much of the manufacturing off these same goods by these same companies is actually overseas anyway. What jobs have been lost, (and it is surely some)  were most likely lost outside the US.  The jobs gained by the pirates may make that a wash for the world, with no difference to the US either. The appearance of these now is evidence, I think, that the campaign against these bills has started to scare their supporters, They are concerned they now may fail.
	This law might eventually be declared unconstitutional  if someone has the enormous amounts of money needed to get a challenge to the US Supreme Court, but there's no guarantee of that. That would take years to find out. 

Primarily this is for US citizens, but protests from overseas will also be of value. Future voters (those under 18) should also add their voice. The number one thing politicians spend time on is raising money for re-election, because re-election is the number one goal they have (their is some justification for that, to be honest. You can't do much if you can't stay in office)  Be that as it may, nothing changes legislation like a threat to campaign funds, and next votes which are the point of the funds. Let him or her know you are a voter (and a campaign contributor if you are - much money comes from small contributions), Tell them you will remember how they vote on this issue when they stand for re-election next fall.

GO here to read the comics, read the "more info link." US citizens should sign the petitions and e-mail your congress members- 

Go here http://eff.org and here https://action.eff.org/o/9042/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=8173 and read about SOPA and Protect IP.  Notice on the right side of the second site if you give the site your zip code, and in some cases street address, it will identify your representatives in congress and will go to an easy page for e-mailing your House Rep and Senators to oppose these acts.

 If any of you support these acts, I would question why you are here? If this law passes - sites like this will probably be the first to be blocked by all US ISPs.

  I have to admit I've read part of this and it's not bad. What brings the  (ugghh! Â®Â©)â„¢   is  the Vertigo (ugghh! Â®Â©)â„¢    take on some of my beloved DC heroes, concepts and titles. I like them they way they were. I'm a bit surprised they haven't matched the child-friendly DC Animated Universe line with a DC Vertigoverse (ugghh! Â®Â©)â„¢ version likewise in a separate continuity from the DCU.

It may astonish you but romance comics, aimed at teenage girls of the 40s-70s hare the last thing on most scanners to do list. There has been a lot of progress on DC titles in the last year or so,because there aren't that many DC issues  of any kind that are still unscanned. The bottom of the list has come to the top. Also near the bottom but above these are the recent cartoon comics like Scooby Doo, and old war comics. Again here here has been a lot of progress on those in the last year. Less popular companies like Prize Comcis, from which DC bought several properties, are further down the list for any given genre.

Done! A few fills, and then I retire again. If SOPA and Protect IP pass, I may not have any place to come back to. It doesn't matter if the comics industry acts, the MPAA and RIAA will promptly get this site blocked in the US. That will cause an enormous advertising revenue and donations hit for many sites, and might even kill this site.

=================================

     Since this is the final torrent of the A-Z postings, the final fill torrents are coming soon. I'd really like to know of anything I forgot, skipped, screwed up, or omitted with malicious intent.
     If you think just maybe you know something I should have included, that any idiot with a gnat's brain would have included, speak up. Perhaps something you wish upon a star I'd included? Is there stuff you know is scanned but apparently I don't, anything tenuously connected to anything ever even glanced at for one second by someone who worked for DC for five minutes? 
    Speak soon, or forever hold your peace. When I up the last fill, which will be part 56 or  maybe 57, your chance will have expired.  If there's any comic that I can share, let me do it now, for I may never torrent this way again. Sniff.

Please Seed! Lots of people will start on the series months
or even a year or two from now. You are their only hope to complete
their downloads.

Thanks to the Scanners and editors, and thanks to the seeders, the
