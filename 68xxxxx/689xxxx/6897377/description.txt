[b]Thx Hive

CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D

Sources:

Video: Russian Bluray
Belka and Strelka 3D (2010) DTS-HD MA 5.1

Audio: Retail English Stereo Audio from Sprinter Release
thx

Encode:

Had that great new animation bluray since a year but never had English Audio for it.
Still no English Retail Date for Bluray/DVD.
European Retail is in 2 month btw.
Finally an english audiotrack popped up.

The Russian Bluray itself had good quality just the colours were off and a bit milky looking.
Fixed rgb colours and sharpened it and made a nice very good looking rip of it.

I synced the english audio to the bluray and cleaned out the russian track from russian voice and russian music from the russian 5.1 track and entered the synced stereo audio into the russian 5.1 track.
looks and sounds prolly like the retail coming in around 2 month.
Enjoy that new animation movie earlier
got very very nice
enjoy
