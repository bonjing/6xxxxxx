    'Why so many divorces? Too many sexual demands? Neglect? Boredom?...     
    We are concerned in this film with those couples who became restless     
    and unhappy and still stay married....We are concerned with those who    
    remain married and live in a half world of illicit sex practices....     
    For them, wife-swapping, sexual indulgences of all sorts, group          
    games, and social intercourse that overwhelms the imagination is         
    common practice.... Then the beautiful gift of Holy Matrimony becomes    
    Unholy Matrimony!'                                                       
                                                                             
    After editor Jim Bremmer gets beaten up for an expos his magazine      
    did on the wife-swapping scene, he realizes he's stumbled upon           
    something bigger: 'A blackmail racket that preys on a person's           
    ability to pay for an indiscretion!' He quickly recruits reporter Al     
    Gentry and Gentry's galpal Janice to pose as married swingers and        
    answer ads in (then-real) tabloids such as Go-Go Girl and Expositor.     
    Things go bad almost immediately when they visit suburbanites Mr. and    
    Mrs. 'M.' Though Al and Mrs. M (MONICA DAVIS of The Pill and The         
    Swap) get it on in the bedroom, Mr. M -- whose motto is 'Find 'em,       
    force 'em, forget 'em!' -- almost rapes Janice in the living room,       
    forcing her to quit the assignment: 'You didn't tell me it would be      
    this disgusting! Disgusting! Disgusting!'                                
                                                                             
    But Al gets 'her feathers back in line' and they're soon meeting with    
    a fat Texan and his cowgirl wife (UTA ERICKSON of Passion in Hot         
    Hollows). This time it's Al that freaks after his champagne is spiked    
    with 'that new drug LSD' and he trips out on a bizarre S&M-flavored      
    hallucination. Eventually they discover the leader of the blackmail      
    racket which leads to a chase through a slaughterhouse and -- Oops!      
    Watch out for those meathooks....                                        
                                                                             
    Witty and well-made, Unholy Matrimony is a slick, often funny piece      
    of sexploitation that delivers the skin while surrounding it with a      
    good story and some of the best acting outside of a Sarno film. It's     
    a shame the film offers no cast or production credits other than         
    Arcanum Productions, story by FOREST RUSSELL, and director ARTHUR        
    JOHN. The only other Arcanum production we know of is the equally        
    good The Love Cult so we assume the same director and production team    
    did that one as well. (The Love Cult also has no credits.)               
    Nevertheless, we recognized the less-than gallant reporter as ALAN       
    DELLAY, an excellent New York-based character actor with a               
    marvelously expressive face whom you might recall as the captive         
    theater critic in Blood Sucking Freaks, and the joke-telling             
    executive in Putney Swope (where he's billed as Archie -- any            
    relation to Forest? -- Russell). Another Putney alumnus is DAVID KIRK    
    (the Mario in 'How many syllables, Mario?') who plays editor Bremmer.    
    In addition to nudie-vets Davis, Erickson, and the anonymous but         
    recognizable actress playing Janice, cute little SHARON KENT is seen     
    posing for topless photos.                                               
                                                                             
    And the next time you need a wedding gift, you might want to consider    
    ropes, whips, and a branding iron. From the 35mm 'party-kooks'
