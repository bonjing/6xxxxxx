In G.H.O.S.T. Chronicles: Phantom of the Renaissance Faire, you are a ghost hunter asked to determine the cause of the haunting at the Spearâ€™s Renaissance Faire park.  The Spear family has recently undergone personal tragedy and a surprising park ownership take-over.  The rumor of a vengeful ghost that has damaged attractions, vandalized shops and perpetrated other disturbing events has driven away the park patrons and vendors and the park may close as a result.
 You've been asked to investigate the supposed haunting of a local theme park. Don't worry - you won't have to dress up in olde tyme costumes, get your face painted, or drink ale from a leather mug to get to the bottom of this mystery, you'll just have to find a lot of hidden objects and solve a few puzzles.
