'The Daily Mail' has been doing the rounds for
a little while now, resonating in hushed
movements through Radiohead's live show and
their 'From In The Basement' live show. Now it
finally gets its release moment in the
spotlight in all its angst-like glory, along
with the beautifully effervescent 'Staircase',
a track of buoyant skittering percussion and
gently simmering synth-work.
