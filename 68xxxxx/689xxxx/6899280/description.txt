Take it easy on me this is my 1st Upload and noticed people were struggling to get the Additional files needed. 


PLEASE NOTE

The game was uploaded by .Bone. so a big thankyou for that. I just uploaded the SD/data to go with the game as 1 complete upload


Install SonicCD.Apk File using Either Es.Explorer/ Astro or your own 


When asked to download additional files just click "no" or "don't download" and the game will exit


Go to your file explorer, (ES./Astro) and look for folder named Android, open that folder, another folder will be there named data, open that file. Inside that folder should be the name of the game you installed along with other games installed. Your looking for the folder named com.sega.soniccd, Once located just simply copy/paste the folder you just downloaded named Files to that folder overwriting all when asked to do so.

When completed just start game from your App's menu



These files are the Additional Files Downloaded that SonicCD asks you for.
