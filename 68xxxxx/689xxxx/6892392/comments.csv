,niarlttep,2011-12-16T22:38Z,"Thank you for this book about Mathematica,
BUT it's an old one. It was for Mathematica 6 and now we have Mathematica 8. Very different.
Like the difference between Poe and Lovecraft ...
If you can have some about Mathematica 8, I will be very pleased.
Thanks again, 
Happy chrismas !"
