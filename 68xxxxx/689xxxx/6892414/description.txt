Uploader Note: source was Moneyball 2011 iNTERNAL 720p BluRay x264-AVS720 
but i don't think it's a real bluray since audio it's pretty weak and have low 
volume,anyway it was nuked on release scene for "no.proof.provided" and if/when
will appear a proper source copy i will upload it for your movie collection,for a watch 
this copy it's pretty good
