Not everyone has the luxury of affording the service and some people in international countries do not have access to Sirius.   So you need to do your research before you start crapping on people who just want to hear the Howard Stern Show.

Paying for a radio show is the most ridiculous thing ever.   If you're paying for it there should be no commercials.   Yet they are doing commercials like FM Radio and charging on top of it.

Another reason.  But yet I still pay for Sirius.  I'm just sharing what I've paid for... and YOU the downloader is the person stealing it.  Not me."
