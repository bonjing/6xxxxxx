From the Sky Down is a 2011 documentary film directed by Davis Guggenheim about
rock band U2 and the production of their 1991 album Achtung Baby. The film
documents the album's difficult recording period, the band members' relationships,
and the group's creative process. Guggenheim, who was commissioned by U2 to create
the film to commemorate Achtung Baby's 20th anniversary, spent several months in
2011 developing the documentary. Archival footage and stills from the recording
sessions appear in From the Sky Down, along with unreleased scenes from the group's
1988 motion picture Rattle and Hum. For the documentary, the band were filmed
during a return visit to Hansa Studios in Berlin where the album was partly
recorded, and during rehearsals in Winnipeg for the Glastonbury Festival 2011.
