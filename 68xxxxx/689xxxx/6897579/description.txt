              In 1816, Lord Byron invited Claire              
               Clairmont, Mary Godwin and her future           
               husband Percy Shelley to stay at his Villa      
               in Switzerland. There they met Byron's         
                 friend Dr Polidori. On June 16th they           
                 amused themselves by telling ghost stories      
                and revealing skeletons. Mary's experience      
                of miscarriage led to the creation of the        
               Frankenstein monster. From Polidori's            
               homosexuality, suicidal thoughts, and            
                fascination with vampires came "The               
                Vampyre".
