 I think this completes the Painting Daisies discography. I was so impressed with the album Flambescence that I bought a few other discs to complete it. There's hardly any information about this band on the internet so if anybody has anymore Daisies please do make available in lossless!

From Radio3.CBC:


Painting Daisies recorded their most recent album â€œPhonographyâ€ at Randy Bachmanâ€™s (BTO/The Guess Who) studio equipped with the production genius of Joby Baker (Cowboy Junkies/Mae Moore). The sound is the result of 10 grueling years on the road, reflected in the amazing slide guitar of Rachelle van Zanten, the songwriting smarts of Daisy Blue Groff, and Kim Grybaâ€™s extensive experience behind the drum kit.


Their second album, â€œFortissimoâ€, was self-released in 2000. The group toured Iceland, Holland, Germany and the US following its release. â€œFortissimoâ€ was nominated for 4 Prairie Music Awards, and Painting Daisies walked away with â€œEntertainers of the Yearâ€ beating out Nickelback, Jann Arden and Wide Mouth Mason.


Having gotten together in early 1995 as an acoustical duo between Rachelle van Zanten (guitar/vocals) and Daisy Blue Groff (guitar/vocals), Painting Daisies didnâ€™t officially take off until Carolyn Fortowsky (bass) and Kim Gryba (drums) were eventually recruited.


The bandâ€™s first album, â€œFlambescenceâ€, debuted in 1998 following 3 cross-country tours of their native Canada. â€œFlambescenceâ€ won an ARIA award for â€œbest new folk recordâ€.


After another extensive tour of Europe and the US, the band won CBCâ€™s â€œGreat Canadian Music Dreamâ€. Competing against 4,000 acts across Canada, the ladies won their own TV show with guest Randy Bachman (The Guess Who/BTO) that was nominated for â€œBest TV Specialâ€ at the Gemini Awards.
