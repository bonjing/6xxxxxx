Never has the phrase "more than just an airport" held true.

Acclaimed developer Jarrad Marshall has created something truly special with 74S Anacortes Airport, giving you not just a hyper-detailed airport as an FBO, but most of beautiful Fidalgo Island to explore. Additionally there are auxiliary landing areas including the Burrows Island Lighthouse Helipad, Allan Island private airstrip and the 21H Skyline water landing area. The entire city of Anacortes is represented, and also the Deception Pass Bridge (specifically for your low-flying adventures!), the detailed refinery area nearby and many other POIs. The scenery seamlessly integrates with KBVS Skagit Regional airport also from Orbx, and uses 7cm, 15cm and 60cm photoreal imagery. This is Jarrad Marshall's finest hour for sure!
