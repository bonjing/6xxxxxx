  This manic four-part series takes five top Scrapheap teams and gives  
  them five weeks to build five freakish, monster, mutant motors at     
  home. These basic rigs are then taken on a fantastic, hairy race      
  across England, Scotland and Wales.                                   
                                                                        
  Episode2 - Speed Test                                                 
                                                                        
  Handbrakes off and pedals to the metal. Our five bonkers Scrappy      
  Racers are flying down the M4 motorway to glorious south Wales.       
  Destination: Pendine Sands. The long trip down is going to be a test  
  of endurance for the ingenious competitors. Can their robust          
  contraptions manage the miles?                                        
                                                                        
  If they make it, the 'flat as a snooker table' Sands await. They      
  have seen many land speed tests in the past (including the famous     
  Bluebird). Each team get eight hours in a local scrapyard to torch,   
  cut, weld, bash and bolt their road runners into racers.
