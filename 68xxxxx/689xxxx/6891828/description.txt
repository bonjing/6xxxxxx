The mod is settled in the period 1618-1648 of the wars in Central Europe better known as the '30 years war'. The battlefields of this conflict are all located in the area of the Holy Roman Empire; therefore the map encompasses the Empireâ€™s dominion and the directly neighboring areas (Copenhagen-Udine / Reims-Riga). A high level of detail is guaranteed through 198 provinces and 24 factions an extensive script adds to the immersion. The pivotal aspect of the mod will be the struggle of the Kaiser with the Counter Reformation; protestant leaders being his main adversaries.
Foreign powers enter the game as spawning factions like SiebenbÃ¼rgen or as invaders like Sweden and France. Poland-Lithuania (the Western areas), Denmark, Swiss Union and the United Netherlands have their part on the map as well, although their influence in the beginning will be more passive. The eighty years war between the Netherlands and Spanish Habsburg will also play a role in the overall war of that period.
