"If you can dream it, we can build it" is the motto at Red Jacket, the nation's most unique weapons business. Owner Will Hayden and his eclectic crew of Baton Rouge, Louisiana gunsmiths and historians rise to the challenge daily on Discovery Channel's world premiere series "Sons of Guns", creating one-of-a-kind custom weapons. The show fires off on Wednesdays at 10PM ET/PT, starting January 12.

As a straight shooter and an avid historian, Will is a trusted expert to handle the requests of Red Jacket's major clientsâ€”law enforcement, military and collectors. From guns to knives to swords to cannons, Will sells, trades, buys, builds and customizes them all. While weapons manufacturers are making attachable silencers for AK-47's, Will takes it a step furtherâ€”creating internal silencers that help police departments be even more stealth in threatening situations. If someone needs to restore a WWII flamethrower to make it operational, Will can do that too. And when the sheriff's department needs to turn two gunsâ€”a shotgun and a rifleâ€”into one, they call Will.
