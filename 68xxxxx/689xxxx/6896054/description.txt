Drawing on art, literature, recent archeological discovers and the record of history, Professor Szegedy-Maszak of Wesleyan University explores the culture of 2,500 years of Greek civilization. 

Beginning with Greece's own pre-history in Cycladic and Minoan civilizations through the warrior kings of Mycenae, the lectures share in the invention and developing consciousness that led to the poetry of Homer, the philosophical achievements of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, the rise and disappointments of early democracy, the beginnings of historical understanding the harsh tensions imposed by the colonial and military ambitions of the Greeks, as well as the rich artistic legacy left ot us by the rich first flower of western civilization.
