FIS World Cup Cross-Country (2011-12-18) Rogla Sprint PDTV x264

18th December 2011 British Eurosport
10:30-11:30 sprint (live)

The sprint events at the FIS Cross-Country Skiing World Cup round from Rogla Slovenia. The quality of the Rogla video is significantly worse than other races. CRF 28 was needed to lower the bitrate. One of the cameras had a 16 pixel black bar down the right side - it's normally an 8 pixel black bar. It's possible they're using low quality SD cameras and elsewhere they're probably using high quality HD cameras.
