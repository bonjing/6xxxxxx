Car of the Future
Is new technology about to transform the way we drive? Join "Car Talk" hosts Tom and Ray Magliozzi as they take a look at plug-in hybrids, all-electric roadsters, bio fuels and more in this light-hearted but shrewd take on America's four-wheeled future. John Lithgow narrates as the brother's mix their trademark slapstick with serious nuts-and-bolts analysis of what it will take to make our autos more energy-efficient and secure a sustainable future for our environment.
