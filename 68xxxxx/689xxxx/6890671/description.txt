Pro  Evolution  Soccer  makes  its  return  this fall, Pro  
Evolution  Soccer 2012! This year, Konami is determined to    
give global football fans a truly realistic, immersive and  
a  delightfully  playable  take  on  the  beautiful  game.  
Creative  Producer  Shingo  "Seabass"  Takatsuka  has been
sourcing  the desires of fans across the globe and working    
non-stop  on  marrying  the  digital game to the real life  
game  so  fans  can  get  as  close to the real thing. All  
elements  have  been  examined  -  defense,  offense,  AI,    
penalties, officiating and of course, graphics! The result  
is  a game truly represents the key attributes of the game    
and it's players. Pro Evolution Soccer... "Can you play?"    

         


Notes:  Are the voices files so big that Konami must split    
their  games in multi versions? Or.. this is just to limit
imports and win more? Anyway,  none  of  the  released EUR  
versions had english until now, so here it is. Hurray.
