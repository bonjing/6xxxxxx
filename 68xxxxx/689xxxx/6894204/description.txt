The Eagles are one of the most successful rock bands in history. This DVD features live performances by the band from their European tour of 1973 and American tour of 1974. Linda Ronstadt and Jackson Browne guest. It was briefly on Amazon but got pulled.

I took the DVD posted here by EricFormanand ripped it to mp4 using Handbrake for the others of us who use Apple.


Having seen them numerous times from 1974 to 2008 I enjoy their music immensely but find them incredibly boring as shit drying in the mid-day sun in their live performances. Give me U2 any day. This is a nice collection as Linda Ronstadt and Jackson Browne appear. Henley looks freaky with his afro-white guy hair but the songs are performed to audio perfection.
