Lisa Ekdahl's sixth album, Lisa Ekdahl sings Salvadore Poe (2000), signaled a new direction and critical esteem. As the new album's title indicates, Ekdahl exclusively sings songs written by her husband, primarily in the bossa nova style. Her fragile and childish voice seems to be made for this type of music. Their album was a smash in France and Scandinavia, where it sold over 120,000 copies by early 2001. (wikipedia)
