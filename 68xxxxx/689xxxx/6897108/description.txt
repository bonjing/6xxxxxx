I would like to thank the uploaders for Standing In The Dark and Alien Shores. These torrents have since disappeared so I cannot give proper credit but a huge Thank You! Alien Shores is a vinyl rip and whoever did it did a great job - sounds pretty good. Perhaps someone has the CD (these Platinum Blonde CD's are rare and when can be found are expensive) so if anybody has ANY Platinum Blonde on CD please do make available in lossless. I have also included audiochecker log for these files. The 2 albums missing from this torrent is Contact1987 and Yeah Yeah Yeah 1990 (when they were known as The Blondes). Also, the live album "Best of Live" that came out in 1993.


And just a note, 7 Year Itch is horribly compressed & brickwalled. I would be happy with just having 7 Year Itch Greatest Hits but I find it unlistenable so proper CD rips of their studio albums with EAC Log's are much much welcomed.


Thanks! Kit 



Please help seed these FLACs! 





From Wiki:

Platinum Blonde is a Canadian New Wave group that was active in the mid 1980s to the early 1990s. The band originally consisted of Mark Holmes from Scarborough on vocals and bass, Sergio Galli on guitar and Chris Steffler on drums. Scottish musician Kenny MacLean later joined the group as the bassist. The name of the band was inspired by the 1931 Jean Harlow movie Platinum Blonde. They were known also for their stylish glam rock-like appearance.

The band re-united in 2010 and will be releasing a new album in 2012.

Platinum Blonde was inducted into the Music and Broadcast Industry Hall of Fame on March 12, 2010.

Platinum Blonde originated in 1983 as a tribute band performing the music of The Police in Canada's university and club circuit. In 1983, they released a self-titled six-song EP, which made it to #39 on the Canadian album charts. It was quickly expanded into a full length album titled Standing in the Dark, which featured identical artwork to the EP.

The band's popularity on the airwaves in Canada was thanks to a triple platinum (300,000) album, featuring four hits including two Juno Award nominations: "Standing in the Dark" and "It Doesn't Really Matter". Their music videos were placed into high rotation on the newly created MuchMusic, Canada's national music video network. Within months some were calling Platinum Blonde the top band of the decade because of their glamorous image and cutting-edge, futuristic New Wave videos.

In 1985, the band released a second album called Alien Shores, featuring the addition of a fourth member, Kenny MacLean. "Alien Shores" went quintuple platinum (500,000), the group's high-water mark of success. Hits from the second album included "Situation Critical", "Crying Over You", "Somebody Somewhere", and "Hungry Eyes".

In 1988 the band's next album, Contact, was a hit in Canada, going double platinum. The title track "Contact" charted well, but the album was a commercial disappointment. Platinum Blonde changed their name to The Blondes and recorded one further album to minimal attention before disbanding.

The entire group appeared as alien bikers in the 1988 episode Eye for an Eye of the television series War of the Worlds.

In 2002, Mark Holmes opened the internationally renowned The Mod Club Theatre on College Street in Toronto's Little Italy. The Mod Club Theatre has showcased the likes of Muse, Amy Winehouse, MGMT, The Killers, The Ruby Spirit, Keane, Feist, Mobile and more.

Rumors of a reunion of the original band, and possibly some new material, continued to swirl, as the band has played a few charity concerts in the mid-2000s. A DVD video compilation entitled Platinum Blonde: The Complete DVD Collection is in production. According to the band's official website, the compilation consists of nine music videos as well as several bonus features.

Bassist Kenny MacLean was found dead on November 24, 2008 in his recording studio on Yonge Street in Toronto. He had just released his third solo CD entitled Completely at Toronto's Mod Club on Friday November 21, passing away that night after the show of heart failure.

On March 10, 2010, Platinum Blonde played their first reunion show at The Mod Club Theatre in Toronto, Ontario. The original line up of Mark Holmes, Sergio Galli & Chris Steffler were inducted into the Radio and Television Broadcasters Association Hall of Fame. The next day, The band announced on MuchMusic that a reunion is in the works with a new recording and show dates.

On December 6, 2010, an EP containing a cover of the song "Not in Love" was released by the Canadian electronic band Crystal Castles featuring the vocals of Robert Smith (The Cure) on the Fiction Records label .

Platinum Blonde have been touring Canada throughout 2011.

Alien Shores 1985


Alien Shores was Platinum Blonde's 1985 follow up to their debut album Standing in the Dark. Released by Columbia/CBS Records Canada in 1985, it contained one of the band's biggest Canadian hits with "Crying Over You" and their only US hit, "Somebody Somewhere".

This album was the first to feature Kenny MacLean as a full-time bassist and keyboardist. This freed lead singer Mark Holmes to focus on lead vocal duties.

The band enlisted Alex Lifeson from fellow Canadian rockers Rush to perform guitar solos on two songs on the album, "Crying Over You" and "Holy Water". A song entitled "Alien Shore" is the sixth track on Rush's 1993 album Counterparts.

The liner notes from the Seven Year Itch collection bear this relationship out: "...Platinum Blonde managed to infuse well-crafted intelligent modern rock with pop hooks that literally grafted themselves onto the airwaves. One of the first to acknowledge this fact was Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson who validated their efforts with solos on "Crying Over You", "Holy Water"."

The album was released as a mini-concept album with the b-side (starting with "Lost in Space") containing various songs with a science fiction theme and narrative.
