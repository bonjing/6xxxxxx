Howling Wolf is one of the best-loved authentic bluesmen. This CD draws together Howling Wolfâ€™s complete output for Modern. It was recorded in the Memphis area by the great Sam Phillips (of Sun Records fame) and Ike Turner & Joe Bihari in 1951 and 1952. This release is based around Wolfâ€™s Crown LP, a long-time collectorsâ€™ favourite. Like the B.B. King Crown LP reissues on CD, we are featuring the original striking LP cover. Included is the very first version of Wolfâ€™s classic â€˜Smokestack Lightninâ€™â€™ as â€˜Crying At Daybreakâ€™. Also included are two (of the three) Joe Hill Louis tracks that appeared on the Crown album. The booklet features notes by blues expert Dave Sax with period photographs and illustrations. Since the original Ace CD (CDCHD 333, "Rides Again", which this CD replaces) fresh masters have been discovered in the archives. The remastered sound is quite stunning - do not accept any substitute!
