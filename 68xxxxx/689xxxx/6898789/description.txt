Originally based on the south coast of England in Portsmouth, Cranes released their first album, â€œFuse,â€ on cassette in 1990. This material was subsequently re-recorded and released as part of â€œSelf Non Self,â€ released later that year.
The intensity of that album garnered very good reviews and caught the attention of John Peel, who picked up on the album right away, with the group recording a session for him in the albumâ€™s first week of release.
Shortly after drawing intense media attention, they signed to the label Dedicated (which also became home to Spiritualized and Beth Orton) and went on to record their EP â€œEsperoâ€ in 1990, with the album â€œWings of Joyâ€ following a year later.
The release of â€œWings of Joyâ€ caught the attention of Robert Smith of The Cure who picked the Cranes to open for them on their world tour in 1992, and then went on to record the albums â€œForeverâ€ (1993), â€œLovedâ€ (1994), â€œLa Tragedie dâ€™Oreste et Electreâ€ (1995), and â€œPopulation Fourâ€ (1997).
After a 4 year break, Cranes re-emerged on their own independent label Dadaphonic to release â€œFuture Songsâ€ (2001) and â€œParticles & Wavesâ€ (2004), which saw the band heading in a more electronic direction while retaining the trademark sound of previous releases.
In January 2007 the band released â€œLive at Amsterdam Paradiso,â€ originally recorded in 1991, just before â€œWings of Joyâ€ album was released.
