Big Walter Horton  Walter â€œShakeyâ€ Horton Live
Label Pacific Blues 
Released: 1999
Format:Mp3@320

Recorded live at a bar in Minneapolis in 1979, here's Big Walter fronting a pickup band for a typical set of raw and elegant harmonica blues. The band follows him well and plays with a restraint rare in a pickup band. Big Walter's in fine form, blowing with an inventiveness that only he possessed and mumbling his way through the vocals in his own inimitable way. There's eight comfortably stretched-out performances, including two instrumental jams and a nice closer of "Don't Get Around Much Anymore." 
This album makes a nice addition to a very small but potent discography.
