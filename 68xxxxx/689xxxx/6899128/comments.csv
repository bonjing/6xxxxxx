,Montel-,2012-05-23T04:17Z,"This is a great torrent, but I don't find the ""soft-coded sub titles"".  Subs would be nice for the German dialog.  Looking at the contents of the torrent, there is no .srt or .ssa files shown, which I would think would be needed, but I don't know much about the .mkv video format. Can anyone help?"
