I look at, say this torrents date (12-12-2011) and then compare it with the official chart company, and its a week off. According to their website, this chart/torrent is the 24-12-2011.
I know the Beeb, do their charts on Sunday, so that chart would have been 25-12-2011.

Could the uploader help me out please :)

Thanks,"
