Tragicomedy by director and producer Jos Stelling on the individualism of the nineties with the same nonsense and absurd humor of his previous films such as The Ilusionist and The Pointsman, winners of two Mostras.

    The story, based on the novel Broederweelde, by Jean-Paul Franssen, takes place in the space of 24 hours in one same site, the Centraal CafÃ© on a station square, and no more than just a place to wait for the next train. To some people, however, the cafÃ© is a refuge for a life of illusion and heartache.

    These are the persons that make up the chorus of lonely cafÃ© customers seeking a little human warmth and solidarity in each other. All of them have a story of their own, but when one of them, Gerard, announces that he will move to Italy, things on the site take a new turn.

    He wants to bid farewell to his dearest friends, to his girlfriend Paula, and to the waiter Joop and his daughter. He also wants to find a brother whom he has not seen for 20 years. To everyone's surprise, the brother is a famous crooner, who makes Gerard's farewell unforgettable in Centraal CafÃ©. A day that is to come to an unexpected end.
