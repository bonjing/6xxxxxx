  After 15 years of soaring success with the Commodores, Lionel Richie  
  left the group to go solo in what many considered to be a risky       
  move. His first solo album, Lionel Richie, grabbed the world's        
  attention, whilst the follow-up, Can't Slow Down, turned him into a   
  global superstar. But could he maintain sustained popularity without  
  the group he'd known as brothers behind him?                          
                                                                        
  This documentary shows how Lionel achieved his dream of becoming 'as  
  big as the Beatles' and how much of what he learnt from his years     
  with the Commodores prepared him for that success.                    
                                                                        
  Contributors include: Billboard Magazine editor Adam White; Motown    
  songwriter and producer Gloria Jones; Kenny Rogers; video director    
  Bob Giraldi; songwriter and producer David Foster; General Manager    
  at Motown in 1978, Keith Harris; UK soul singer Lemar; and Pearly
