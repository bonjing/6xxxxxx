Dead Block PC FiGHTCLUB - THETA

Days after p2p group THETA, hereâ€™s group FiGHTCLUB with the scene release.
 Dead Block is a third-person tower defense game set during a 1950s zombie apocalypse. 
In the â€˜50s Rockâ€™nâ€™Roll music was spawned straight from hell and was so evil that it turned dead people into Zombies!
 Three survivors â€“ Jack Foster, a construction worker, Foxy Jones, a traffic warden, and Mike Bacon, 
a perpetually hungry boy scout â€“ have formed an unlikely alliance to protect themselves from the invading undead.
 Hiding from the Zombies in abandoned buildings, they build blockades, set traps and â€“ as a last resort â€“ use weapons to fight.



Features:

A humoristic gameplay mix of killing zombies and tactical defense.
Kill zombies in unusual and entertaining ways: install unique traps,
 employ devious tactics and fight the intruders with smart bombs and melee weapons.
Tactical defense gameplay: defend from zombies by building blockades, 
gathering resources and switching between all 3 characters.
