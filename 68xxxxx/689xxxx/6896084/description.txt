Can't configure Debian? This is a pure configured Debian DVD with no BS. I made it so that you can start using it immediately.

This is a regular configured Debian Squeeze XFCE install with some extra goodies.

Tor, Torbutton and Polipo is installed and preconfigured. (Browse the web anonymously.)

Use Flash and watch DVDs out of the box.

Added non-free firmware to work with most hardware.

Nvidia and ATI drivers are preinstalled.

Choose from thousands of packages using the Synaptic Package Manager.

Use it as a livecd to test if Debian works on your system. If you like it, use the installer to get it on your hard drive.

Debian has never been this easy.


Use a regular writable DVD to burn the ISO. Use as low speed as possible!
