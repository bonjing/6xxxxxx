Audiobook

5 CDs (Abridged)
Play time about 6 1/2 hours

Usually I hate abridged anything, but "This abridgement has been approved by the
author" and besides, I think it's the only audiobook version.  If it has been
released unabridged, I can't find it.  Anyway, it's still a fun listen.  Kathy
does the reading herself so it's a lot like listening to her act, but without
the cheering.  I'll trust each of you to provide that for yourselves.
