Binaton panel
 There are streaming channels to the mountains around, but when looking for each one (in addition to giving a lot of work), you may experience losses and links that bring inappropriate content. Binaton Panel is a program that leaves the main stream channels arranged for you to access any program without any problems.

 With it, the user is able to have complete lists of the main channels for Brazil, which are distributed in several categories. Simply choose the channel of your choice and click \"Watch\" for which he already appears on your screen.
