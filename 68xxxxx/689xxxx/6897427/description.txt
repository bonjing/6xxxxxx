Plot:
Zooey and Alec Morrison are a married couple who are struggling to bridge the painful gap that is developing between them. Unable to conceive, the Morrisons await confirmation of a child to foster. One day, a seven years old boy who calls himself Eli appears on their doorstep quite mysteriously, explaining the foster agency has sent him. The boy is old beyond his years and it becomes apparent that he is the listening ear amongst the coupleÃ¢Â€â„¢s marriage breakdown. Eli offers moral support and idealistic suggestions to his foster parents on how to repair and re-kindle their love for each other. Adored by his foster mother and admired by his foster father, the couple begin to rebuild their foundations at home, at work and emotionally until they find the love they once had for each other. And miraculously, Zooey discovers she has conceived. A baby is on the way.
