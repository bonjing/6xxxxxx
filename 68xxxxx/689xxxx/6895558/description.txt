From Wiki:


Roxette are a Swedish pop music duo, consisting of Marie Fredriksson (vocals) and Per Gessle (vocals and guitar). Formed in 1986, the duo became an international act from the late 1980s, when they released their breakthrough album Look Sharp!. Roxette went onto achieve nineteen UK Top 40 hits[1] and several US Hot 100 hits, including four US number-ones with "The Look", "Listen to Your Heart", "It Must Have Been Love", and "Joyride".[2] Other hits include "Dangerous", "Fading Like a Flower", and "Dressed for Success".[1][2]

After the release of Don't Bore Us, Get to the Chorus!, a greatest hits record, the duo took a hiatus in the mid-1990s. With the release of Have a Nice Day (1999) and Room Service (2001) they continued to chart in other territories such as Europe and South America, where they earned various Gold and Platinum awards until the beginning of the new millennium. In 2002 the duo took a break from recording and touring when Fredriksson was diagnosed with a brain tumour.[3] Roxette took to the stage together again for the first 
time in 8 years, in 2009, during Gessle's European Party Crasher tour.[4]
Their songs "It Must Have Been Love" and "Listen to Your Heart" continue to receive radio airplay, with both singles recently receiving awards from BMI for achieving four million radio plays.[5][6] They have sold an estimated 60 million records worldwide,[7][8] with over 3.5 million record sales in the United States,[9][10][11] achieving platinum for Joyride and Look Sharp! there. 





Look Sharp! 1988


Look Sharp! is the second studio album by the Swedish pop and rock duo Roxette. It was recorded at EMI Studios in Stockholm between March and June 1988 and at Trident II Studios in London in June 1988. The album was released on October 19, 1988, two years after their debut Pearls of Passion, and became a worldwide bestseller. Look Sharp! is often considered as Roxette's breakthrough.

The album has sold over 9 million copies worldwide.

"The Look", "Chances", "Dressed for Success", "Listen to Your Heart" and "Dangerous" were released as singles. In native Sweden, "Dressed for Success" and "Listen to Your Heart" were chosen as the first two singles, as Gessle and EMI Svenska chose to highlight Fredriksson's singing. The singles reached #2 and #3 on Swedish chart respectively. But despite huge popularity in their homeland Roxette were still unknown globally.

Everything changed when the third single "The Look" was released in Sweden. It was while studying in Sweden, that an American exchange student from Minneapolis, Dean Cushman[2], heard "The Look", and brought a copy of Look Sharp! home for the 1988 holiday break.[3][4] He gave the album to a Minneapolis radio station,[3][4] KDWB 101.3 FM.[5] The station started playing "The Look" and based on positive caller feedback, the song became very popular,[4][5] and quickly spread to other radio stations.[4] The song became a radio hit before any Roxette music had been commercially released or promoted in the US market.[4] The story was covered by radio, newspapers and TV in the US and in Sweden, making for good press for many years, with Gessle telling this as the story which highlighted the beginning of their international success.[5]

Until 2009 Look Sharp! has sold over 9 million copies worldwide[6] including over 1 million copies in US alone, which gave the album platinum certification by RIAA in January 1990[7] (it has sold 402,000 since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking data in 1991).[8] Look Sharp! peaked at #4 in UK, where it stayed on the charts for 53 weeks and was certified platinum by BPI in the UK in December 1990 for sales in excess of 300,000.[9] It is also the second best selling album in Swedish music history (only behind ABBA's Arrival)[citation needed] where it held the top spot for 14 weeks and has gone 6x platinum. Furthermore Look Sharp! collected gold and platinum certifications all around the world.

Joyride 1991


Joyride is the third studio album by Swedish duo Roxette, released 28 March 1991 by EMI. After the great popularity of "It Must Have Been Love" single and enormous sales of Look Sharp!, Joyride became just as successful, spawning the US #1 hit "Joyride".[

"Joyride", "Fading Like a Flower", "The Big L.", "Spending My Time", and "Church of Your Heart" were released as singles. Roxette's original recording of "Soul Deep" (more synthesiser-driven and with less guitars) appeared on their 1986 album Pearls of Passion. In some releases, "I Remember You" was an additional track on the album, bringing the total track count to 15 instead of 14. "Joyride" became Roxette's fourth and last US #1 single.[4]

Joyride immediately became best-seller all around the world. It held the position of best selling album in Europe for 2 weeks in June 1991, following its debut and peak at #2 on UK charts two months earlier. It was certified 2x platinum by BPI in August 1992 for selling more than 600,000 copies,[5] after staying on British charts for almost a year.[6] Joyride reached #12 on the American Billboard Top 200 albums and was certified platinum by the RIAA in July 1991,[7] eventually selling 1.3 million copies there[8] and stayed on charts there for over a year.[9] Joyride also reached the upper end of charts across the world, including #1 in Germany (13 weeks) and #1 in Sweden (7 weeks). In Argentina, the album was awarded as the best-selling English album ever (to that date), with sales of more than 400,000 copies there. To date the album has sold over 11 million copies worldwide.
