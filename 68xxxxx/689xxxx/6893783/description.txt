Nomadic lo-fi indie rock malcontent Cass McCombs' fifth album (and second of 2011) begins with the couplet â€œLove thine enemy/But hate the lack of sincerity,â€ a notion that acts as the foundation for the eight cuts on the hypnotic but illuminating Humor Risk. The aforementioned â€œLove Thine Enemyâ€ is just one of three slow-burn rockers on the record that bring to mind Kurt Vile fronting the Church; the other two, â€œThe Same Thingâ€ and â€œRobin Egg Blue,â€ are prettier, but no less dissatisfied. Itâ€™s a sound and style that works well with McCombs' obvious pop sensibilities, which tend to manifest themselves most successfully when the volumeâ€™s turned up. Elsewhere, midtempo outings like the slacker-beat poetry anthem â€œThe Living Wordâ€ and willowy psych-folk closer â€œMariahâ€ paint vivid portraits of amiable dissolution, and the languid and bible-bleak â€œTo Every Man His Chimeraâ€ provides the collectionâ€™s finest sentiment in "Oh, Mary/Iâ€™m just too much to carry.â€
