  Taking part in the third series are Maximus, a trio of Bath boat      
  builders in a camper van; the Chainsaw Clan, three Scottish forestry  
  engineers driving an old timber lorry; the Rally Dragons, a trio of   
  rally racing enthusiasts from Caerphilly in a Ford Capri; and the     
  Staffordshire Bulls, three farmers from Stoke in an old pick-up.      
                                                                        
  Episode5 - Loch Down                                                  
                                                                        
  In the final stage, the teams must convert their vehicles to rescue   
  a whisky barrel from a loch and carry it through a forest and over a  
  steep bank before heading to the finish line.
