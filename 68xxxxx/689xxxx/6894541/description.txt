++It\\\'s Always Sunny In Philadelphia Power Hour++

This is a video tribute to a great show made to complement the fun drinking game called Power Hour (or Centurion, or Century Club). It contains 60 one-minute(ish) clips from seasons 1-7 of the show in chronological order.

Once you have finished, please seed back as much as you downloaded! Without fellow drunks like yourself, you wouldn\\\'t be able to get your hands on this. Please share the drunkenness with others.

++How to Play Power Hour++

Grab some friends, some beer, this movie, and a shot glass for each person playing. Fill your shot glass with beer and prepare to play. A drink screen is shown after each clip along with the clip number to let you know to drink your shot glass. After drinking, refill the shot glass as you watch the clip. Repeat this process for the entire power hour.

By the end, you should have drank between 5 to 7 beers depending on how full you fill your shot glass. Further details are available in the \\\"directions\\\" part at the beginning of the video.

Happy drinking, and please spread the word!
