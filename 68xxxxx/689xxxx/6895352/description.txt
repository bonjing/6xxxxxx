Recovery? What Recovery?

Did you lose money in the stock market in the last financial crisis of late 2008?

Has your home lost value?

Are you \\\"underwater\\\" in your mortgage or concerned about selling?

Do your dollars buy less than they used to at the grocery store and the gas pump?

Have you lost your job or know someone who did?

Are you worried about the safety of your money and investments?

Don\\\'t get fooled again! While the \\\"experts\\\" want us to believe that all is well (or will be soon), nothing could be further from the truth. The worldwide financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 was just a sneak preview of what is to come. For those who act quickly and correctly, there is still time to protect yourself, your family, and your business in the next global money meltdown. The Wall Street Journal business best seller Aftershock can help you:

    Protect and grow your assets before, during, and after the next global financial crisis
    Spot and cash-in on the best new investment opportunities
    Know which jobs, careers, and business sectors will fare the best
    Profit rather than lose when asset bubbles collapse around the world
