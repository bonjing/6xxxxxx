Payday: The Heist Update 3 Changelog
----------------------------------------

PAYDAY Xmas achievement!
Find a Christmas present on any of the levels in multiplayer - take it and you will be given a Santa mask! Plus you will get the chance to be surprised later on...

Big features
Player drop-in ability in load-out and in-game!
You can now join an ongoing game! You will no longer be locked out of games just because they have already started or because you dropped out during play. Just rejoin and continue collecting those precious dollars and gems!
These are the rules: Players who are downed or in custody and drop out only to rejoin the same game will respawn in custody. Drop-in is disabled during the "point of no return" phase of the heist, as well as on the end screen.

Heavily improved fighting and acting by team AI and enemies
New features and fixes include:
â€¢ New events and enemy tactics on all levels
â€¢ Team and enemies now pick better cover and firing positions, and use more intelligent firing lanes for suppression and sniping
â€¢ Enemies now master additional acrobatic moves (such as dashes and slides) and they can fire at you while doing them!
â€¢ More cover moves for team AI and enemies
â€¢ Enemy AI move in tighter formations and coordinate better
â€¢ Team AI now keeps up with human players much better
â€¢ Smoother turn and aim on team AI, and reduced animation glitches on movements
â€¢ Better looking weapon recoils on team and enemies
â€¢ AI teammates now pick weapons that better suit the current combat situation
â€¢ Combat will now be more mid ranged and not run-in gun battles
â€¢ Team AI no longer has "ants in the pants" (they don't move around so much) when there are no enemies around
