Economics, 3rd Edition

Taught By Professor Timothy Taylor, M.Econ., Stanford University,
Macalester College

We are all economistsâ€”when we work, buy, save, invest, pay taxes, and vote. It repays us many times over to be good economists. Economic issues are active in our lives every day. However, when the subject of economics comes up in conversation or on the news, we can find ourselves longing for a more sophisticated understanding of the fundamentals of economics.

How can I get an overview of the entire U.S. economy?
Why do budget deficits matter?
What exactly does the Federal Reserve do?
Why do most economists favor international trade so strongly?
Economics, 3rd Edition, will help you think about and discuss these and other economic issues that affect you and the nation every dayâ€”interest rates, unemployment, personal investing, budget deficits, globalization, and many moreâ€”with a greater level of knowledge and sophistication.

Designed for those who haven't already purchased our 2nd Edition economics course, this enlarged and reorganized 3rd Edition includes updated statistics and discussions of more recent events. It also features expanded coverage in areas of great public interest, such as anti-trust issues, corporate responsibility, and international financial crashes.
