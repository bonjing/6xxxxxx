PLOT:
Four men, one calling: To serve and protect. As law enforcement officers, they face danger every day. 
Yet when tragedy strikes close to home, these fathers are left wrestling with their hopes, their 
fears, and their faith. From this struggle will come a decision that changes all of their lives.
With action, drama, and humor, the fourth film from Sherwood Pictures embraces God's promise

Souls will be stirred, and hearts will be challenged to be ... courageous!
