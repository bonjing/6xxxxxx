MKV thumbnail DLL hangs Explorer, and will infinitely (!) gobble massive network bandwidth if it's failing on a networked video. Can't play/split many MKV's, hence hang (with ""stripped headers"", e.g. MKVToolnix defaults). Uninstaller can't even properly uninstall! And all I installed was the codec! Wow. Most surprising app fail in recent memory. (At least their website/design looks pretty?)

Fuck."
