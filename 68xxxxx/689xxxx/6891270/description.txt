â€œThere is so much more to this story that David Wilcock can imagine. it would take me weeks to bring him up to speed. If any of you who know my version of this story would like to try to bring him up to speed, you are welcome. IMO he would have to read the Obergon Chronicles, read all the articles Gunther wrote on the gold transferâ€¦ and then listen to all 9 hours of David Sales interviews.â€
