From the preface:

"The purpose of this book is to introduce readers to the practice of creative
writing. Equally, the purpose of this book is to introduce writers to the practice
of creative reading.Writing and reading share an interdependent orbit around
the open space of language.
This double helix of reading and writing makes you more alert to your
potential as a reader andwriter of yourself, of other people and of otherwriters.
It also creates a discipline in your life that makes these acts of attention a way of
life. It is then vital you learn to work alone and beyond your potential â€“ writers
and readers alike work beyond their own intelligence."
