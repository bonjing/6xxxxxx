 Having announced their intention to go their separate ways after a farewell tour 
 next year, Kian Egan, Mark Feehily, Nicky Byrne and Shane Filan are joined by 
 presenter Christine Bleakley to celebrate their 14-year career with this 
 greatest hits special. The band have had a staggering 26 top-10 singles - 14 of 
 them reaching the UK number one spot - and songs sure to feature in tonight's 
 concert include Flying without Wings, World of Our Own, You Raise Me Up and What 
 About Now. The programme also traces the Westlife story from its beginnings, and 
 includes archive footage of the boys, as well as interviews with key figures in 
 their career.
                                                                 
                                 Enjoy!
