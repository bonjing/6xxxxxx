Christmas has arrived early as America's most successful rock band, CHICAGO, and producer
Phil Ramone have teamed up for the release of the band's third, and perhaps most rocking,
holiday recording yet with "O Christmas Three" -- also known as Chicago XXXIII.

The legendary band with horns could easily live on its many laurels without going into the
studio again. Instead, members Robert Lamm, Lee Loughnane, James Pankow, Walter Parazaider,
Jason Scheff, Lou Pardini, Tris Imboden, Keith Howland and Drew Hester treat us to 14 Christmas
and holiday favorites that have been "Chicagoized" with that famous sound we've all come to
know and enjoy since the late 1960s.

"O Christmas Three" will thrill longtime Chicago fans and will probably enlist many more who
are simply looking for a wonderful holiday recording.

From the jazzy "It's The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year" and "I'll Be Home for Christmas"
to the rocking "On The Last Night Of The Year" and "Rockin' and Rollin' On Christmas Day,"
Chicago XXXIII is a nonstop holiday musical treat that is performed to typical CHICAGO perfection.

Solid vocals by Lamm, Scheff, Pardini, Loughnane and Howland are supported by hard hitting
brass runs and licks by the force known as Pankow, Parazaider and Loughnane.

Guest performances by artists Dolly Parton, America, Steve Cropper and BeBe Winans add to
the holiday spirit as if CHICAGO simply invited some of their musical friends and us over
for some hot chocolate and a cozy, warm fire.

Chicago XXXIII has definitely become one of "My Favorite Things!"
