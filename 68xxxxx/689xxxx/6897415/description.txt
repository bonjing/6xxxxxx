=============================

The X-Men anime is written by famed English comic book writer/creator Warren Ellis, and borrows story elements from famed Scottish comic book writer Grant Morrisonâ€™s early 2000s story arch for New X-Men, as well as Joss Whedonâ€™s mid-2000s run on Astonishing X-Men.

Yui reveals that the medication is experimental and designed to suppress mutant powers from awakening. However, it is becoming less and less effective, resulting in both Riko and Kaga's transformations. Separately, Emma follows Jun to the depths of the laboratory and confronts him as his true persona: astermind, leader of the Inner Circle. He reveals that the heart of the laboratory contains a power he wishes to use to rule humanity and that he was the one who projected the image of Emma to Cyclops one year ago, an attempt to keep the X-Men from accepting her into their ranks after she defected from the Inner Circle. The two fight, with Emma's diamond form protecting her from Mastermind's psychic attacks. The X-Men arrive, but must deal with Marsh and Rat as Mastermind continues toward the power source. Meanwhile, Xavier realizes the dimensional rift is caused by an unknown psychic assailant and prepares to fight it to escape.
