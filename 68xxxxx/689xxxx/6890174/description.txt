Broadly considered a brand that inspires fervour and defines cool consumerism, 
Apple has become one of the biggest corporations in the world, fuelled by 
game-changing products that tap into modern desires. Its leader, Steve Jobs, 
was a long-haired college dropout with infinite ambition, and an inspirational 
perfectionist with a bully's temper. A man of contradictions, he fused a 
Californian counterculture attitude and a mastery of the art of hype with 
explosive advances in computer technology. 

Insiders including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, the chairman who ousted Jobs 
from the company he founded, and Jobs' chief of software, tell extraordinary 
stories of the rise, fall and rise again of Apple with Steve Jobs at its helm. 

With Stephen Fry, world wide web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee and branding guru 
Rita Clifton, Evan Davis decodes the formula that took Apple from suburban 
garage to global supremacy.
