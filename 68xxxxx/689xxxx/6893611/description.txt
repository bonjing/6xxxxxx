Plot:
The Old West.. where a lone cowboy leads an uprising against a terror from beyond
our world. 1873. Arizona Territory. A stranger with no memory of his past
stumbles into the hard desert town of Absolution. The only hint to his history is
a mysterious shackle that encircles one wrist. What he discovers is that the
people of Absolution don't welcome strangers, and nobody makes a move on its
streets unless ordered to do so by the iron-fisted Colonel Dolarhyde (Ford). It's
a town that lives in fear. But Absolution is about to experience fear it can
scarcely comprehend as the desolate city is attacked by marauders from the sky.
Screaming down with breathtaking velocity and blinding lights to abduct the
helpless one by one, these monsters challenge everything the residents have ever
known. Now, the stranger they rejected is their only hope for salvation. As this
gunslinger slowly starts to remember who he is and where he's been...

Encoders note:
Its actually BDRip, but some people suggested I should Tag it this way because of
DVD resolution.
First QEBS6 encode.  Fixed compatibility, similar quality, large size reduction.
New experimental resolution. In theory this should work on even more smartphones.
This is probably smallest encode of this movie LOL...
What do you think about it. Give me some info.

Check out the new instruction for fixing your player problems.
Regards to all encoders especially Big thanx to Atom, FLAWL3SS and FraMeSToR crew
, Filix, Rok3r, Kempas, Stun, Askeen, Faolanscath and all who likes my work.

REMEMBER!

1. All FASM releases were done by THE PEOPLE for THE PEOPLE, so if you think they
  are worthy share them anywhere you want, but if you like the movie, show your
  gratitude to the creators by going to cinema or buying Bluray/DVD!

2. UNFINISHED/SAMPLE movies HAVE synchro problems, full movies DON`T. This is the
  nature of highly compressed content. The QUALITY of the display depends ALSO
  from the PLAYER you use. There are some buggy players which display those
  movies at the significant worse quality!! If you have any problems with your
  video player check "Instruction for fixing your player problems" folder.

3. Please COMMENT my work ONLY if you have actually seen it. If you LIKED this
  release - tell others about it. If you didnt, leave a comment saying  why, so
  I can learn from your opinions and provide you with something better in the
  future. Everything here has been done with the reason, so if you do not
  understand something dont assume its done bad. Of course we also make mistakes
  so any observation is welcome.

4. I have found that XBox360 can play stereo AAC directly and 5.1 through WINDOWS
  media center extender. For more info read this forum:
 

5. WDTV devices are causing so much problems with AAC. I am not sure is this
  also the case with this release, so its better for me to give you straight link
  to the discussion regarding this: http://wdtvhd.com/index.php?showtopic=23287

6. Movies can be directly streamed through WWW using Adobe Flash Player 9 or new.

7. FASM Quality Enhancer Bitrate Squeezer is h264 compression method optimized
  directly for lowbitrate HD contents. It is constantly being improved,  each
  revision brings quality to a new level. Its efficiency over standard x264
  encoding is explained by the same reason as XVID encodes are better than DIVX3

8. Any subtitles made for different releases, but taken from the same source
  (Bluray) should also work with this release. If you are looking for them visit
  http://subscene.com/

9. AAC sound must be decompressed and send through HDMI or SPDIF as PCM. Please
  also note that if you do have video card with HDMI that means you do have two
  different sound cards. Please make sure you do send the sound to the correct
  one. Its quite different from AC3/DTS where you send compressed sound directly
  from the source.
