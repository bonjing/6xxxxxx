Personal Review          : I have used both ThinApp and Spoon and prefer this.
The portable apps. created by this are smaller in size, faster, and overall
are more compatible with different Operating Systems and architecture.
If you're a noob and want to easily create your own portable applications to
run on USB devices.. this is the tool you'll need. Very simple to use. The
interface is easy to navigate and learn. When i first got into portable
applications.. this is what i use and still use for applications that are
deeply integrated into the Operating System.
