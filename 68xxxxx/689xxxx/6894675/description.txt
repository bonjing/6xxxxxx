This pack of 200 textures for Photoshop was collected and comipled by me and in no ways do I deserve any credit for the making of them. All Ive done is collected them over a long period of time through many hours of using our good friend Mr Google after needing various textures and backgrounds for the addiction known as Photoshop and compiled by me over the time Ive been using them.

So my gratitude goes out to all the peeps and sites like Webtreats who Ive snagged them all from. Without you Photoshop wouldnt have been so much fun! For a full list of sites Ive borrowed them from please visit the sites below.

Im sure you will find this pack well worth the downloading and if you need ANY other Photoshop resources, need help or advice with anything grafix related or just fancy joining a photoshop forum to be with like minded peeps who have a laugh while making things then come and see us at one of the sites below. You will be more than welcome to join in.

Love and peace
