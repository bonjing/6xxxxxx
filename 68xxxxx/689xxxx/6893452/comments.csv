Go to your installation directory and find lang.dat

Open that with note pad and ensure the number is 44 (represents English)

Then, go to your shortcut that was created upon install and right click it, go into properties.

Notice the target location is to your installation directory, but at the end is -language 7.

Remove -language 7

Play your game in English. Enjoy."
