Guanxi - A corner in England

A Corner in England is a perfect soundtrack for any decline of a stressful week. "Turn off your mind, relax and flow down stream" is not only a famous Beatles lyric, but an imperative for the listening of this ornate musical treasury. From the quiet corner of "Blanketflower", passing through the worried drowsiness of "Cloud Star" - "Roman Candles", up to the ancient echoes of "Vasco da Gama" - Guanxi offers a haunting and beguiling setting. The music that appears on this releases fashions a soundscape of uncertainty made all the more ominous by its organic sensibilities. Indeed, the instruments seem to have a life of their own, and one can't help but imagine that the music created is the sound of secrets being shared with the listener.
