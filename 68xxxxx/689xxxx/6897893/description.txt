  This manic four-part series takes five top Scrapheap teams and gives  
  them five weeks to build five freakish, monster, mutant motors at     
  home. These basic rigs are then taken on a fantastic, hairy race      
  across England, Scotland and Wales.                                   
                                                                        
  Episode1 - Agility Test                                               
                                                                        
  The teams engage in a five-week endeavour to build their basic rigs.  
  These machines need to be adaptable, rugged and most of all,          
  roadworthy.                                                           
                                                                        
  Each team's machine will need to pass a Single Vehicle Approval       
  (SVA) test. This is no ordinary MOT - the guidelines alone make up a  
  200-page document - and if the teams don't pass they won't be road    
  legal and will be out of the competition.                             
                                                                        
  But it's not just about building and testing this week. There's a     
  taster of what the machines can do in a timed agility test run.
