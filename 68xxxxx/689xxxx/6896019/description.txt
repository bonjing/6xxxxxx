  More than a decade since The Fast Shows last ever episode,         
  theyve made a new series. Probably the most fondly remembered        
  sketch show of the 1990s  famed for catchphrases such as Suit you,  
  sir!, Scorchio! and Does my bum look big in this?  is back      
  today.                                                                
                                                                        
  This time, though, it isnt on BBC Two. Like Alan Partridges Mid     
  Morning Matters and Vic & Bobs Afternoon Delights, its showing on   
  the website of Fosters, the lager company that has decided to help   
  flog its wares by funding the online-only comebacks of hit comedies.  
  The whole cast has returned, except Mark Williams (You aint seen    
  me, right?, Ill get me coat); Higson says he was keen initially  
  but was doing other stuff that clashed. Still, they are rejoined by  
  Caroline Aherne, who left in 1997 to make The Royle Family.           
                                                                        
  EPISODE SYNOPSIS: Scorchio? You can say that again. Watch Episode     
  One as Downton Abbey gets The Fast Show treatment and your favourite  
  characters from the cult TV comedy sketch show make a long awaited    
  return.                                                               
                                                                        
  NOTES: Being aired on fostersfunny.co.uk - geoblocked to all you      
  non-Britains out there - W4F brings you the full new series 4 of The  
  Fast Show. For US friends this series was called "Brilliant" in the   
  US to avoid confusion with a similarly named show!                    
                                                                        
  XviD rules state ripper discretion for filesize for less than 14      
  minute shows, so sized these rips at 100MB for good quality and to    
  be consistent throughout the series (in case of later episodes being  
  longer).                                                              
                                                                        
  SOURCE NOTES: The source is obviously WEBRip, since this is the only  
  media platform this is being shown on. Source video is 720p x264.     
                                                                        
  We hope you enjoy!
