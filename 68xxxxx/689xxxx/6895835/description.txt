RELEASE NOTES
 
Smash Up The Studio presents "Soul Machine: Complete Edition" An
 extremely authentic collection of Soul and RnB loops in classic
 1980's style
 Here is a chance to own both Midi and Audio versions of this best
 selling collection at a special bundle discount price
 
In producing "Soul Machine" we have tried as accurately as possible
 to re-create those wonderful chords and classic grooves for the
 modern day producer, so if you are looking for a more musical
 collection of Soul/RnB loops, this is the real deal
 
Featuring bass lines, piano loops, rhodes loops, midi guitar loops
 for acoustic and electric, synth loops in various styles including
 bendy moogs, funky polyphonic hooks and floaty more ambient style
 progressions. All synth loops and bass lines have been recorded
 using vintage synthesizers of the era including Moog, Sequential
 Circuits, Roland, ARP and others
 
Content:
 80 Wav Loops 24 bit
 80 Apple Loops 24 bit
 80 Midi Loops
 All loops are tempo labelled and range between 2 - 16 bars in length
 
7 Construction Kits in Wav, Apple Loop, and Midi formats
 
These kits contain all the loops and samples for each of the 7 mixes
 we created for our preview track. Each kit is broken down into sepa
 rate loops so you can arrange each track to your own requirements
 The drums are for demonstration purposes and are not included
