AC 5.1 is a waste. It saves only very little space compared to the size of the film and only brings trouble. Most dolby receivers can NOT process AAC 5.1 so you end up with just 2 channel stereo or some simulated fake surround. If you rip 5.1 DTS IS THE WAY TO GO, if you must AC3 is fine too. But ripping to AAC is a wasted opportunity."
