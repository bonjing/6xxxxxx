Very classic game, hard to find, even harder to figure out how to install. Still an online community after thirteen years, honestly the best game I've ever played ^^.

Copy of the readme.

Installation instructions.

1. Mount Iso
2. Open Iso via windows explorer
3. Use skip CD check.exe follow the instructions in that program
4. Put setup.exe in compat mode for windows '98
5. Run setup.exe follow instructions there. (In administrator mode if applicable)
6. Run patch (Admin mode)
7. Try to run Hardman.exe in compat mode'98 also put HardwarW.exe (or something like that) in compat mode. (Admin)
8. Should it not work make sure you're using your primary video drivers.
9. Should it still not work Run missingres.exe and put those files in to the hardwar directory.
10. Enjoy
