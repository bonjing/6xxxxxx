It seems to me that everybody is missing the big picture regarding the smartphone boom... 

This new money-making revolution headed by Android is opening up endless possibilities and itâ€™s happening unnoticed.


That\\\'s why I decided to put all the available knowledge together in â€œAndrorize! The ultimate guide to make money with Androidâ„¢â€.

 
Samsung, Amazon, HTC, LG, Toshiba, Motorola, Sony Ericsson and Huawei already trusted their products to Androidâ€¦ Why shouldn\\\'t we? 

Androrize! Helps you tap into a world of possibilities...

Join the Android Revolution!

 â€¢ What apps are for and why people are talking so much about them. 

 â€¢ How to get ideas for new apps. 

 â€¢ How to bring your idea to life, even if you are clueless in all respects of the computing world. 

 â€¢ How to sell your app will show you the most effective ways to reach the global market and earn money with it!

Please note:

- Before buying, take a look at the index of the eBook.

 - Androrize! is not a â€œget rich quickâ€ ebook or similar. I just explain the many ways available to profit from Android in a context of the smartphone\\\'s phenomenal growth...

 - Androrize! Is not specifically a programming or technical book. I\\\'m not a programmer. Instead, I\\\'m a tech savvy journalist who wants to fill the gap of information between developers and non-developers. It will undoubtedly help if youâ€™re a programmer, but just to give you the heads upâ€¦
