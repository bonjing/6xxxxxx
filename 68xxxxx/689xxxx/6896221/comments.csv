My title must have been too long because ""rar"" has been cut off after the period. WinRar program will extract the picture files. I'm currently seeding this in UTorrent program but TPB currently shows Seeders: 0. I was worried that I had somehow botched my first Torrent Upload but then I saw someone downloading this file for just a few minutes in UTorrent so hopefully there will be no problems with this gallery getting out. Anyway...Cheers!"
