  This manic four-part series takes five top Scrapheap teams and gives  
  them five weeks to build five freakish, monster, mutant motors at     
  home. These basic rigs are then taken on a fantastic, hairy race      
  across England, Scotland and Wales.                                   
                                                                        
  Episode3 - Off-Roading                                                
                                                                        
  The teams have to travel 300 miles from south Wales to Tong in        
  Yorkshire. Here, they will face one of the toughest off-road driving  
  courses in the country, complete with steep rubble climbs,            
  sump-smashing ruts and engine-drenching pools.                        
                                                                        
  Pace, toughness and grip are the order of the day. Can the robust     
  racers chew up the muddy trail and conquer the clay? Eight hours at   
  a scrapyard and a sack full of tools should help. The fastest team    
  on race day wins this challenge.
