[T],thetorrentlord,2011-12-19T22:14Z,@Kole97: I was not trying to be curt with my answer earlier. The NFL games are almost always posted by the large Group uploaders in both this category and regular TV resolution. Here is the link for the game (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6895305/NFL_Week14_12-11-2011_New_York_Giants_at_Dallas_Cowboys). Hope this helps.
