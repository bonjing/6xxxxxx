War is absurd in several respects and brutal in all. The same can be said of prostitution, so it's not terribly surprising that Story of a Prostitute (Shunpuden) centers its narrative on a woman, Harumi (Yumiko Nogawa), who renders her body to the Japanese military. She's not so much a victim of society as a survivor. Already working as a prostitute when the story begins, Harumi leaves the Chinese city of Tianjin after biting the tongue of her loverâ€”a form of punishment inflicted upon him for marrying another woman.

Harumi flees to northern China, where a Japanese battalion is locked in guerilla warfare with members of the Hachiro army. Suzuki uses the barren landscapes as a beautiful representation of Harumi's desolate disposition as Harumi joins the caravan and does not even flinch when it comes under attack from landmines. Arriving at the brothel, she sets to work immediately until the sadistic adjutant (Isao Tamagawa) interrupts a client session and brutalizes her into submission. The abuse awakens Harumi's zest for life, causing her to concoct a scheme in which she will seduce the adjutant's orderly, Mikami (Tamio Kawachi), into killing him. Things go awry, however, when Mikami and Harumi actually become lovers and need to hide their burgeoning romance from the military.

Mikami is a disgraced soldier and suffers many abuses in order to prove his adherence to Imperial Japan's strict military code. Harumi most likely hopes that the two can disappear into the vast landscapes, but the escalation of military violence makes this impossible. The Chinese continue to attack, mounting more and more successful assaults on the Japanese that will forever change the lives of these people.

Director Seijun Suzuki and screenwriter Hajime Takaiwa, working from a story by Taijiro Tamura (filmed once before as Escape at Dawn) create a strongly antiwar motion picture. Suzuki's work here is strikingly more mature and refined than anywhere else in his career, with a tremendous attention to the plight of these characters. The cinematography is ambitiously kinetic, ushering in a new visual tone for the Japanese material that contrasts against the tradition set by Yasujiro Ozu and others. This break from more serene filmmaking captures the undertone of the film's themes, for the story challenges many of Japan's well-established societal mores. Accompanied by chaotic and elliptic editing that make for stunningly horrifying battle scenes and a lush production design, Suzuki is at the height of his powers here.

The performances are particularly effective, from the emotionally charged performance of Yumiko Nogawa to the quiet power of Tamio Kawachi to Isao Tamagawa's domineering turn. The two lovers come across as real people, making the events all the more devastating. Nogawa's tearful scenes do suggest a certain degree of melodrama, but her work is primarily successful as she conveys the hard-edged nature of Harumi and her fragile state of mind. Kawachi's acting is fantastic, particularly in a scene that occurs late in the movie. Without any dialogue, he simply turns his head and looks at the other actorâ€”it's an image that's worth a thousand words.

The haunting score that begins the film sets the tone for the remaining 96 minutes. Suzuki's work here is breathtaking, heartbreaking, and exhilarating. While many motion pictures are merely content with giving their audience what it wants, I am pleased to say that Story of a Prostitute is so much more than what its title might lead one to think.
