  The second Scrappy Races competition sees the return of the Chaos     
  Crew from Doncaster, who are joined by the Cops and Bodgers from the  
  Home Counties, London-based motorcycle maniacs the Knuckleheadz, and  
  Scottish engineers the Tartan Scarlets.                               
                                                                        
  Episode5 - Mud Runners                                                
                                                                        
  The bold bodgers are nearing the end of their 1000-mile odyssey. The  
  super scrappers must turn their weary wheels into bog-busting,        
  border-breaking Mud Runners as they race through a maze of deep and   
  dangerous muddy moats and across the finish line into Scotland.       
                                                                        
  Reigning champions the Chaos Crew are neck and neck with the          
  Knuckleheadz on the championship table but the competition is wide    
  open because the vehicles must cross the finish line to be in         
  contention for the Scrappy Races title.                               
                                                                        
  First the teams must head for a local scrapyard full of useful old    
  junk, where they have just eight hours to repair, reshape and refine  
  their scrappy racers one final time.
