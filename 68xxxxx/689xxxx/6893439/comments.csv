,Dallas.Maverick,2012-01-01T05:38Z,"Decent cam movie.  The first 3 minutes the camera man can't figure out where to aim the camera but after that it's pretty good.  About half way through the movie as Cruise is climbing the tallest building in the world you also see a few people walk across the screen and here some people laughing but beyond that its a good cam.   Audio is tough so I would give it a 4, Video is pretty good if you watch it in a dark room, so I rate that a 7/8.   Oh and 10% of the movie is in Russian so there are no subtitles and we don't know what they are saying but still a good movie with plenty of action.  Enjoy and thanks TvTeam for your good work in getting this out so early.

A/4
