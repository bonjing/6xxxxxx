Sao Paolo, Brazil 1999
Date: 99-04-17
Venue: Autodromo de Interlogos

Recording: AUD
Quality: 8
Menu: NO
Extras: None
Comments:  Single cam on the left side. Filming is shaky (terrible in the beginning but it gets better) but picture quality is fairly good. Audio is constantly overloaded by the kick causing a very annoying pulsing distorsion throughout. Die-hards only.
