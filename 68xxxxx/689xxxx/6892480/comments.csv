Looks like 240p upscale.

I give my piss and shit to this one.."
ed on HDDVD/BluRay, it is really good option though anyway. THX Vice for Up. There's ONE copy of this movie floating around the web in Hi Res, from Japan television ( release name: The.Abyss.1989.720p.HDTV.x264-FQX ), which is way better than this one, however it has Japan subs hardcoded in it, so it is up to U, which one will U choose. Me, I bet on that one anyway. THX once more"
