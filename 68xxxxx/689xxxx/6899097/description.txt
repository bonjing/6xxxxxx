Introduction

Viperr aims to merge CrunchBang qualities with a Fedora base benefits.
So there is a lightweight, useful, simple, and original liveCD, with brand new but stable software.

Viperr uses Openbox window manager and some standalone components,
in order to customize your desktop as you want.
I've also included the pseudo-tiling fonction to increase the ergonomy.

In fact, Viperr is just my actual desktop, a bit modified for sharing purpose.
Being the only maintainer (with the help of Cyril and other testers),
Viperr comes without any warranty, but I'll try to give you the best experience as possible.
For this reason and as this standalone environment is a bit hard to handle,
this remix is mainly recommended to the experienced users.

The WorldWide edition has language and keyboard configuration tools.
Viperr is partially compatible with Fedora, but it is not supported by the Fedora Project or Red Hat at all.
