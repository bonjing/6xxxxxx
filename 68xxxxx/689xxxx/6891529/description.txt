AC/DC Live

AC/DC Live is a 1992 live album by Australian hard rock band, AC/DC. It was released both as a single album and as a double album (known as AC/DC Live: 2 CD Collector's Edition). The album is supported by a video, AC/DC: Live at Donington.[1]

AC/DC Live: 2 CD Collector's Edition was released a month after the single-disc version, in a slipcased two-disc "book" (similar in shape to old CD longboxes) and containing an AC/DC dollar note.

The album was re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC remasters series.

The recordings on this disc are taken from several shows from AC/DC's 1991 The Razors Edge tour. Most of the recordings are from the Donington & Moscow "Monsters of Rock" shows, and some from other various shows from the tour.
