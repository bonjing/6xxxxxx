Reseed. Six core orchestral works by Aaron Copland - An Outdoor Overture, Our Town, Quiet City, Clarinet Concerto, Danzon Cubano and El Salon Mexico. I got these recordings over a period of time and have lost track of the performers. I do know the Clarinet Concerto is a performance by Benny Goodman (who commissioned it), with the composer conducting the Columbia Symphony. I think the last two are by the Detroit Symphony under Antal Dorati. All of these are excellent if not definitive performances of the works.
