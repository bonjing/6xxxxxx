Imanari Masakazu, master of leglocks. 

In this instructional video(and interview) Imanari will show you all sorts of submissions and takedowns. For Gi and no Gi.

The quality is pretty good and very watchable. Its a good and fun vid to watch. Also this isnt a torrent i downloaded from the net, so idk about the max upload speed. If its slow perhaps some can explain how to get good seed speed(since im seeding) :)

well enjoy mma/ figh fans &gt;&lt;
