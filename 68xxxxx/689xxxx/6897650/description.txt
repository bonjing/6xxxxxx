  A hockey enthusiast since 12 years of age, 
  Toronto-based Rajvinder Singh, even went   
  to the extent of trimming his hair,        
  discarding his Pagri/turban, did not       
  complete his education, incurred the wrath 
  of his father, Darvesh, who wanted him to  
  be involved in the family business as well 
  as confirm and respect Sikh religion       
  principles and values. Hoping to play      
  professional hockey, Rajvinder, along with 
  other fellow Sikh players, instead finds   
  himself treated as the object of ridicule, 
  referred to as a 'joker', by mainstream    
  Caucasian players. Even his friends tease  
  him and ask him to take up 'Guli Danda'    
  and Kabaddi', while his father makes him   
  work for Uncle Sammy as a truck driver. He
