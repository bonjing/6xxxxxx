Episode 9

Lund and Strange are in Afghanistan on a mission to track down the killer. Pressing on with the investigation back home, Brix decides to conduct a search at the army barracks. Justice minister Thomas Buch remains hellbent on getting to the bottom of what he believes to be a top-level cover-up and goes out of his way to generate turmoil within the cabinet with his revelations. The cabinet, in turn, is less than impressed. Raben is once again preparing to face a court hearing and, despite pressure from all sides, refuses to retract his inflammatory statement.
