I was hoping that HDTV rips would appear so delayed fixing these episodes. Unfortunately I don\'t think we will get any better until the DVDs come out. 

Both in mp4 format, if you don\'t like it, don\'t download it and go fix it yourself.



S02E07 Guts and Glory

Edited the 600mb version uploaded by someone else already, so no ads, no uncompressed audio and no black bars top and bottom. Quality as far as I can tell is no different just file size is now only 272mb.



S02E08 Top of the World

Didn't have to do much just converted to mp4 to remove the black bars top and bottom. File size now 348mb.
