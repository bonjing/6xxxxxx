  Four Seasons. Four Colors. Four different    
  age groups of our protagonists. Four true    
  historical events. This is what constitutes  
  our Film - Mausam.Mausam, a love story in    
  its first season start with mere adolescent  
  attraction between a Punjabi boy Harry, and  
  a Kashmiri girl Aayat, in a small village of 
  Punjab. It develops into young love between  
  them in season two. Their love realizes its  
  own depth in the hours of separation through 
  season three. In the fourth and final season 
  their love culminates into togetherness. But 
  not before sacrificing a lot personally and  
  learning the truth behind universal love. It 
  is a passionate love story which sees, as its
  background various shades of life, questioni 
  ng us and yet not becoming indulgent.
