2010 two CD collection. Back in 1985, the compilation album A Real Cool Time: Distorted Sounds From The North defined the sound of Sweden's garage rock revival. Bands like The Nomads, The Creeps, The Shoutless and The Watermelon Men showed that Sweden was Europe's Garage-Psych hot bed. Now, for the original album's 25th anniversary, we have A Real Cool Time Revisited, the definitive Swedish overview of the country's Garage Rock phenomenon. New fans of the '60s sound will find plenty of appeal and lustre in this Swedish jewel. 40 tracks. Cherry Red. (amazon.com)
