On the Thursday, December 15 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with Richard Mack, former sheriff of Graham County, Arizona, and founder of the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, about his lawsuit filed in federal court against the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) for slander, libel and defamation. Mack filed the lawsuit after the SPLC falsely claimed he advocates shooting IRS agents. Alex also covers the latest news, including the passage yesterday in the House of the draconian National Defense Authorization Act that will allow the military to throw domestic â€œterroristsâ€ in Camp Gitmo. The bill now moves on to the Senate and ultimately to Obama for signature. Alex also takes your calls.
