. Lulz I know... Mac people remind me of people that are trying too hard. I mean why pay 1400$ for a mac when you can get a Dell/Hp/Sony that is faster with more ram a larger screen 2 mouse buttons(its like magics) and a larger SSD for 700$. Oh, I know why, its trendy. Mac users are right up there with people who own new Camaro on my hit list."
