Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Monday, December 19 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex confronts the latest news, including the death and rumored assassination of North Korea's cult of personality dictator, Kim Jong-Il and what his passing portends for international politics. 

Alex also talks about Ron Paul's astounding lead in the polls with the Iowa caucus right around the corner. 

He takes a look at the continuing implosion of the eurozone and the Egyptian military crackdown on demonstrators, including the humiliating stripping and beating of female protesters.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
