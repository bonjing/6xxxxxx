As Mainwaring prepares to host a sherry party for local
civil dignitaries and army officers, Private Frazer is
having an interesting encounter on the train with a drunken
figure with more than a passing resemblance to his Captain.

But when Mainwaring's black-sheep brother Barry arrives in
Walmington, the family welcome is less than warm.

THIS IS MY OWN DVD RIP AND ENCODE.
