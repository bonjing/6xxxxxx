Nature's Deadly Journeys
Exploring animals that stick together, including those that seem to feel there is safety in numbers and those that team up to undertake perilous journeys. "Nature's Deadly Journeys", follow animals on their migration routes and showcase some of the finest spectacles nature has to offer: from herds of wildebeest sweeping majestically across Africa's Rift Valley, to the red crabs of Christmas Island negotiating traffic and cliffs on the way to their spawning grounds. And, as you'd expect of National Geographic, the programmes feature some truly stunning camerawork.
