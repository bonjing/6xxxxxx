,nandiulu,2012-01-05T01:26Z,i will try to get time to scan the tamil english part also... although it is not as complete as the english-tamil part. why is learning Tamil so difficult? because of a lack of learning materials written in a coherant fashion. please some scholar do a good book on learning tamil without the need to be totally fluent in Tamil script
