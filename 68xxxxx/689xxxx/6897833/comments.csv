n a few episodes theres a lot of this going on at the moment from a few things (other shows and ufc mainly ive noticed so far) not sure what the cause is bad encoding or poor drivers only apears to be recorded hdtv thats the problem though my drivers are all up to date codec packs fully updated tried old versions too and tried on a few media players aswell (powerdvd & mpc) i have no probs with other media mkv hd movies ' blu-ray ' 3d ' or the web-dl's just some scattterd hdtv episode rips if anyone has any ideas or insite i would be glad of the input its getting quite annoying.
