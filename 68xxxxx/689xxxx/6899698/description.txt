[/b][/color] Unique Sweets is an insider's peek into innovative eateries across America that are creating the most unique and exciting desserts today.
Each episode runs the gamut on the sweet spectrum: restaurants with revolutionary pastry chefs, candy shops inventing eye-popping confections, chocolate boutiques with wild artisanal flavors and bakeries producing one-of-a-kind pastries, cakes and cookies in the middle of the night.
Wherever there are gooey, crunchy, sticky and sweet treats that you won't find anywhere else, Unique Sweets will take you there.
