Liner notes:   It may be surprising that RCA had placed a new Christmas album an the top of their priority list for the sessions Elvis was to undertake in March 1971. With Elvis' new found success and credibility, starting with the NBC TV special, the legendary Memphis recordings, the return to live performances, and most recently the brilliant and critically acclaimed THAT'S THE WAY IT IS and ELVIS COUNTRY albums, it seems the last thing Elvis needed was a Christmas album.

But in reality, maybe the most surprising element was that RCA hadn't been bombarding Elvis with such a request many years earlier. 
By early 1971 the original 1957 Christmas album was very close to sales of two million copies in the US alone, and a scaled down version released the previous year on the budget-priced Camden label, was on to a promising start and would eventually become Elvis' biggest selling album, with more than 10 million copies certified by the RIAA. 
As for credibility and success, Elvis had taken a dive between RCA's request and the actual release of ELVIS SINGS THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF CHRISTMAS (4 consecutive singles that didn't make the top 30, and lukewarm reviews of the preceding album LOVE LETTERS FROM ELVIS), but when the Christmas album came out in October of that year, it proved RCA right with US sales of more than three million copies over the next decades, with several additional millions to all the tracks as they were re-released on Christmas compilations one after die other. 

In the early 1970s, Christmas albums weren't listed on Billboard's pop album charts, but on its special Christmas album chart it peaked at # 2 in 1971, and topped the chart in both 1972 and 1973. 



Merry Christmas!!!
