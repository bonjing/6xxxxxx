  For generations the French Foreign Legion has been romanticised as a  
  refuge for men seeking a second chance in life. But what is the       
  Legion really like? In this series, adventurer Bear Grylls sets off   
  for the Sahara desert to find out. Along with eleven other            
  volunteers, from ex-criminals to struggling businessmen, Bear puts    
  himself through a month's brutal training at an ex-Legion fort in     
  the Western Sahara that is designed to replicate the rigours of the   
  Legion's own basic training.
