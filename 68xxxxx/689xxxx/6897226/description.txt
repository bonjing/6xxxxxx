This version includes new design tools, an all new interface, integration with Google Maps, support for 2D barcodes, and more.
Designs

The program received 140 new and 210 re-designed business cards to the supplied collection.

Google Maps Integration

One of the most innovative features of Business Card Composer 5 is the newly added integration with Google Maps, allowing you to mark your business location in Google Maps and place a small map on the card to provide exact directions.

2D Barcodes

Another prominent feature worth noting is support for 2D barcodes. Now you will be able to encode your details or any other information, including price lists, URLs, etc., into QR or Data Matrix barcodes and include this barcode on your business card. This barcode can later be read by many mobile devices. 2D barcodes will make your card look unique and let the world know that your business is progressively keeping up with today's technology.

Editing Tools

Apart from that, various design and layout tools were added or improved, making the business card design process more extensive. This includes object grouping, linear and radial gradient, new guideline capabilities and more.

Working with Photos

Business Card Composer 5 is now more robust when it comes to working with your photos. The program now supports iPhoto events. We also added the ability to access photos from your Apple Aperture library right inside of Business Card Composer.
