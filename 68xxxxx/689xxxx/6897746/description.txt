"The Eraser" is the debut solo album by Radiohead lead singer Thom Yorke, released on July 10th, 2006.

Complete CD, ripped as a single .wav disc image file that can be easily burned to disc, as well as being listened to like a virtual CD, directly from your computer by selecting (right clicking) the .cue file and choosing to "Play with VLC media player".

Included are scans of the case, which is a fairly flimsy five panel paper case, that has a separate paper sleeve for the CD, which slides in to the far right panel, as seen in the included "Thom Yorke - The Eraser (2006) - 'Front' Side Composite.jpg".

Burn to CD using ImgBurn or your favorite disc image burning program, by either selecting the .cue file and proceeding as normal or see the enclosed .pdf entitled "How to write an image file to a disc using ImgBurn".

  Enjoy!
