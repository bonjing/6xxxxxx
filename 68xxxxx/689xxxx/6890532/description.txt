The field of education has experienced extraordinary technological, societal and institutional change in recent years, making it one of the most fascinating yet complex fields of study in social science.

Unequalled in its combination of authoritative scholarship and comprehensive coverage, International Encyclopedia of Education 3rd edition succeeds two highly successful previous editions (1985, 1994) in aiming to encapsulate research in this vibrant field for the twenty-first century reader. Under development for five years, this work encompasses over 1,350 articles across 24 individual areas of coverage, and is expected to become the dominant resource in the field.

Education is a multidisciplinary and international field drawing on a wide range of social sciences and humanities disciplines and IEE3 comprehensively matches this diversity. The diverse background and multi-disciplinary subject coverage of the Editorial Board ensure that a balanced and objective academic framework was achieved. Working relationships with relevant international organizations provide have lent this project the requisite global outlook. The 1100 contributors represent over 100 countries, capturing a complete portrait of this evolving field.
