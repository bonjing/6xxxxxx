Won't play on a ps3.  Usually stream via ps3mediaserver.  As the previous commenter said, CINAVIA protected.  It lets you watch about 20 minutes or so and then the audio cuts out with the cinavia notice.  And no, you can't just hit stop, jump forward and watch another 20 min worth.  Once it's cut, it's cut.  too bad.

My only suggestion is to play it on a laptop and hdmi your laptop into your t.v.  Haven't tried it yet, but I think the problem lies in it's combination with playing on a ps3."
