Plot:

Made for TV drama recreating the May 1937 disaster in which the German airship the Hindenburg caught fire. The Hindenburg was the largest airship in the world and a symbol of growing German commercial and military power. Initially designed to use the non-flammable helium as a lifting gas, the US embargo on helium exports forced the use of hydrogen instead. This proved catastrophic when, docking in New Jersey in 1937, the ship caught fire and burned furiously before the eyes of the world. The drama follows some of the Hindenburgs passengers, including an airship designer, Gestapo agents and fleeing Jews, as they journey towards tragedy.
