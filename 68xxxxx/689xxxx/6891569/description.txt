Beavis and Butt-head is the creation of Mike Judge. It started as a clip on MTV's "Liquid Television" - a show that featured brilliant and unusual animation. Beavis and Butt-head debuted as its own series in March of 1993 on MTV, introducing the world to their own special brand of humor. This is a world where parents are nearly non-existent, grasshoppers are punished by chainsaw, where cockroach-infested nachos are a delicious treat, and two bored young teens can get into a world of trouble. 

When not sleeping through classes or torturing their teachers at Highland High School, they amuse themselves by watching TV, trying to score with chicks, and annoying everyone in town. The show alternates between the misadventures of the two boys and music videos, which they critique in their simple and opinionated way.
