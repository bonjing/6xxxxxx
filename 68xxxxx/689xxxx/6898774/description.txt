There were not a lot of Supertramp concerts recorded or available.  This concert was recorded before the fame-making Breakfast in America album and features the songs that created hard core fans across the world.  I had the opportunity to see them live in this time period in St. Louis MO and was astounded by the group.  

The original source was a recording taken from the BBC and later rebroadcast in France. In this version the original mono TV sound was replaced by stereo versions taken from pre-FM sources
