NOTE: Sorry for the previous download. The Movies Archive was too big, and I couldn't recover the movies on my end either. I will upload the movies in three segments - this one will be Part 1 movies 59-68. I double checked that the movies are not corrupt so feel assured that this torrent will give you the movies in the segment. I cannot seed all uploads at once, so once this one is seeded I will upload the next sequence of movies.

Deke's Techniques is a collection of short Photoshop and Illustrator projects and creative effects that can be completed in ten minutes or less. The series is taught by computer graphics guru Deke McClelland, and presented in his signature step-by-step style. The intent is to reveal how various Photoshop and Illustrator features can be combined and leveraged in real-world examples so that they can be applied to creative projects right away.
