Synopsis

Homage to late choreographer Pina Bausch (1940-2009), a leading influence in the development of the Tanztheater style of dance. Bausch was the artistic head of Tanztheater Wuppertal, a German group that fuses modern dance with theatrical flourishes into a kind of hybrid art form. Lewis Segal, former Times dance critic, said that "it is limiting to call her a choreographer; she liked the term 'dance theater.' She was important because she thought everything belonged together -- speech, movement, design, commenting on the audience."
