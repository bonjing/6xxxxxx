├óΓé¼┼ôSorrow does not come merely from contemplating death, which forces us to look into Eternity, but also from life, which compels us to confront Time├óΓé¼┬¥, wrote Russian philosopher Nikolai Berdyayev. Renowned Lithuanian documentarist Audrius Stonys took these words as a motto for his latest film, a meditative visual essay which portrays old people undertaking all kinds of activities, meditation and group laughter therapy. Without a single word of commentary, he creates from sophisticated, aesthetic images a compelling study of human corporeality which, in an ideal union with spiritual equilibrium, can sustain us with the pledge that old age doesn├óΓé¼Γäót have to be a painful wait for the last breath.
