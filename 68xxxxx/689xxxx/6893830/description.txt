Marty Ehrlich's genius lies within an ability to reinvent his music while
retaining his unique voice on the alto saxophone. A vocal quality, the slight
human cry of his tone, and the angular but not obtuse lines of his melodies have
made Ehrlich a true original, and for his followers, immediately
recognizable. While Ehrlich refuses to stand pat in the size or depth of his
ensembles, the four-piece setting has been a constant over the years, but in
specific terms of favorite players, the Rites Quartet may be the finest he has
ever assembled. Longtime drummer Pheeroan AkLaff joins cellist (not bassist)
Erik Friedlander and trumpeter James Zollar to play new music that is
consistently scintillating. Zollar's pithy, lithe, but sinewy lines work so well
with Ehrlich's sound, while rhythmically and harmonically, Friedlander cannot be
eclipsed by anyone on the cello. The resultant progressive jazz within and out
of the jazz tradition, should keep listeners on their toes through this grand
experience of creating absorbing, truly new music. The rich harmonies and spiky
accents always associated with Ehrlich's music are extant from the opener "Rites
Rhythms," with groove cello from Friedlander and a solid trumpet solo by
Zollar. Ornette Coleman's tandem lyricism is referenced in "Dung," not
standardized, but expounded upon in a bop notion, while Friedlander's cello
takes center stage during the romantic reverence of "Some Kind of Prayer" and
the bouncy, jig-flavored waltz "On the One," where Ehrlich's lyrical,
tangent-busting alto departs into the stratosphere. But there is much more on
the second half of the date, as the quartet ups the ante further for the somber
undertones and wonderfully quirky bop funk of "Slices of Light," very
reminiscent of AkLaff and Ehrlich's past groundbreaking work with guitarist
Michael Gregory Jackson. The juxtaposed blues bop of "Song for Tomorrow," and
dark, diffuse, stark, hauntingly resonant, free "From Strength to Strength" are
preludes for a mighty version of Julius Hemphill's "Dogon A.D.," a definitive
hip and funky creative crossover in 11/8 time. There's little more to describe
or critique about this masterful progressive jazz made by some of the best
players in the business, all at the top of their game, making some of the most
remarkable music of their careers from start to finish. Where certain political
and social areas in the world must change, we should all be appreciative that
Ehrlich stays the course. This is a must-have item, and without question, one of
the very best jazz recordings of 2009.
