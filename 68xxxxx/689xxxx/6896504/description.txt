RELEASE INFO

Womble MPEG Video Wizard DVD 5.0 is the latest MPEG editor with
DVD authoring and full AC-3 encoder support, and it includes all

Video Wizard and MPEG-VCR. Whether you are a video professional
or a new video enthusiast, we are confident that MVW-DVD will
meet all of your needs of MPEG editing and DVD authoring.

Features...

EDITING

- Smart rendering
Smart Rendering makes the editing process faster and easier by
only re-encoding the edited points. Unlike other video editing
software that tends to re-encode the entire video at the
slightest touch, MVW-DVD only re-encodes when needed, which
leads to fast export speed and maximum quality preservation.

- No re-encoding
When editing DVD-compliant MPEG files, your edited video will
be written back to disk as fast as any disk-to-disk copy
operation.

- Fast HD MPEG editing with frame accuracy
Fast scrubbing and frame accurate HD MPEG editing allows you to
move quickly from one point in the video to another. You can
also step through the video frame by frame to perform precise
edits.

- Automatic Ad detection and removal
The blank search and scene change detection take the pain out
of finding the best places to cut advertisements from your
favorite TV shows.

- Convert your movies for your iPod and PSP
You can convert your DVD library or TV shows into MP4 format
for your portable video player, including iPod and PSP.

- Powerful tools
MVW-DVD provides a set of powerful tools for multiplexing and
de-multiplexing, MPEG format conversion, repairing data error
to restore A/V synchronization, and other features.

- Very intuitive User Interface (UI)
It gives you the ultimate balance between an easy-to-use
intuitive approach and powerful functionality.

- Create a slideshow to share with others
With few clicks, transform your precious photos into a video
complete with music, title, and transition effects, which you
can play on the TV, load into your video player, post online or
upload onto YouTube.

- Batch job processing
Since an export job usually involves a time consuming MPEG
encoding process, Batch exports allow you to set these jobs as
a task or group of tasks and schedule them at a time convenient
for you.

DVD AUTHOR

- Professional-looking menu with a few clicks
With a few mouse clicks, you can create a professional-looking
DVD motion video menu and burn it to a disc ready for playback
on a standard DVD player.

- Minimal video re-encoding
With our smart rendering technology, you can quickly convert
MPEG video files into a DVD movie with minimal video
re-encoding, affording fast export speed and maximum quality
preservation.

- Multiple video titling
Our multiple video title support allows you to create DVD discs
that can hold both NTSC and PAL movies without video
re-encoding.

- Full AC-3 audio encoder support
This feature is capable of compressing any audio track into a
two track stereo or 5.1 Surround audio stream, providing
awesome surround sound in the comfort of your home.

- Flexible format support
Export DVDs with nonstandard image format by storing HD movies
in standard DVD discs without image resizing.

- Extensible menu templates: MyTemplate
Want to make something truly unique? Then choose to create a
custom menu where you can alter practically everything about
your menu. Change the background to a personal photo, add an
opening video before the menu display, relink the menu button,
alter page titles, and more. When you're all done, save your
menu as a template for future use.

- Multi-layer menu design with flexibility
Create as many sub-menus as you want. Easily add, delete, and
highlight menu buttons. Relink any menu button to any menu
page, video title, or chapter.

- Menu with creative playback controls
With the End Action control, you can create any playback
sequence imaginable. Specify the end action for a title or
chapter when its playback ends, such as returning to a chapter
or menu page; or repeatedly playing a special segment.

- Share your DVD menu design
Extract the menu from any DVD project and add it to MyTemplate
list. This comes in handy if you want to share your menu design
with others.

- Add music, image, and video to your menu
Add background music, favorite photos, and action videos to
make your menus come alive.

- True drag and drop functionality
Adjust the playing order of titles or chapters in the DVD
simply by dragging and dropping. Otherwise, drag video files
directly from your web browser into the DVD editor.

- Real-time video preview before DVD export
With this function, you can see what it would be like to
navigate through your menus without outputting to the hard
drive or DVD. Don't like what you see? Go back and make
changes, then test it again.

- DVD burning
Want to create your own high definition home videos to archive
or share with friends and family? The built-in burner allows
you to easily burn your exported DVD folder onto a DVD disc -
no extra software required.

manipulating the mechanics of MPEG files.

The list of Tools includes MPEG multiplexer, de-multiplexer,
