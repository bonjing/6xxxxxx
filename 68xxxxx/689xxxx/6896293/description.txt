BjÃ¸rnstad/Darling's first duet album "The River" was one of the runaway successes of our 1997 programme, described by the Sydney Morning Herald as "An unforgettable listening experience." On "Epigraphs", the frame of reference for the Norwegian pianist and the American cellist is the music of the Renaissance. Darling and BjÃ¸rnstad play arrangements of pieces by William Byrd, Orlando Gibbons, Guillaume Dufay, and Gregor Aichinger as well as compositions of their own, inspired by these old masters. The result is an extremely attractive, gentle, often slowly-moving music of great clarity.
