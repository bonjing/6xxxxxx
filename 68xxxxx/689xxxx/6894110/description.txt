|   4.0/5.0 - Excellent [Jimmie Stephens, SputnikMusic]                        |
|                                                                              |
|   In 1994 at a local Melbourne pub, 3 friends in Paul Dempsey, Clint         |
|   Hyndman and Julian Carroll (Julian left the band after the release of      |
|   Elsewhere For 8 Minutes and was replaced by Stephanie Anworth), took the   |
|   dip of putting their funds together and recording an album. What           |
|   resulted was Elsewhere For 8 Minutes, a fantastic debut album by a band    |
|   that was soon to become one of the biggest names in Australian music,      |
|   Something For Kate had made their initial yet, lasting impression on       |
|   anybody that took notice.                                                  |
|                                                                              |
|   Elsewhere For 8 Minutes is really a stand-alone record in the SFK          |
|   discography, as it is the one album that is very grunge rock focussed,     |
|   leaving out any of the alternative and tender pop hooks that are found     |
|   in albums like, The Official Fiction and Desert Lights. The sound of the   |
|   band was very gruff, which suited the unique stylising of Dempsey's        |
|   vocals. No better example of this is one of the most celebrated            |
|   Something For Kate tunes, "Captain (A Million Miles an Hour)" which is a   |
|   very bass and drum heavy song. The beat is syncopated, and the guitar      |
|   locks right into this, while Dempsey's vocals are really a highlight as    |
|   the flourish all over this grungy tune with bravo, as "Captain" shows      |
|   off Dempsey's vocal range quite subtly. Another example of this grunge     |
|   rock styling is fan favourite "Pinstripe", a simple song, that features    |
|   some fantastic guitar and bass duelling from Dempsey and Carroll during    |
|   the verses, while the bridge has an almost Kidcrash sound about things.    |
|   Lyrically the song is the usual Dempsey standard - impeccable, as the      |
|   discussion of how things that are lost can never be gotten back are sung   |
|   in glorious metaphors.                                                     |
|                                                                              |
|   "You're the last day of April every year                                   |
|    You're grey, feeling for something, anything, you can't have              |
|    Oversize, owning the road                                                 |
|    Pulled by a current, tossed over in the wind                              |
|                                                                              |
|    You focus your sights and try                                             |
|    Try to stare up at the sky                                                |
|    Does it hurt your eyes?                                                   |
|    Maybe you'll go blind                                                     |
|    Or maybe all you'll see is, all you'll see is sunshine                    |
|    Sunshine"                                                                 |
|                                                                              |
|   Yes, Elsewhere For 8 Minutes does not have the most fantastic production   |
|   as the vocals are sometimes overpowering, the cymbals cut through like a   |
|   church bell, the guitar tone is slightly askew and the bass is almost -    |
|   gasp - the loudest instrument heard, yet this really shouldn't deter the   |
|   listening experience, as you begin to hear the wonderful sounds and be     |
|   empowered by the lyrics that is Something For Kate, a band that after      |
|   Elsewhere For 8 Minutes were to become one of Australia's most favourite   |
|   and loved bands. This is why we should all be thankful, that at that pub   |
|   in 1994, Something For Kate had decided to record.                         |
|                                                                              |
