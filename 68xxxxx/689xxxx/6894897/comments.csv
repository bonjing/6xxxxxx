,cham1289,2012-01-15T12:37Z,just want to comment on the fact that i am downloading winrar because i cant extract rar files so why would you put this file in rar format?
 is fine, keep up the good work, and don't listen to the stupid people that if they wanted latest version they could go somewhere else instead of trying to flame someone who actually RELEASED a download, I wish people would just be able to not be morons, but alas this is not possible."
