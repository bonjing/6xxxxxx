The biennial International Permaculture Conference is the world's premier permaculture gathering. 
 
The tenth International Permaculture Conference and Convergence, IPC10, was held in Jordan across September 2011.  The theme was "Plan Jordan ~ Water".
 
The 1-day IPC10 Conference (open to all) and 4-day IPC10 Convergence (open to Permaculture Design Certificate graduates only) was held in Jordan (Amman and Wadi Rum, respectively) and was coordinated by Nadia 'Abu Yahia' Lawton. Prior to the start of the Conference and subsequent Convergence, a two-week International Permaculture Design Certificate (PDC) course was  taught by a team of respected permaculture educators and pratitioners, and all three events were followed by tours and permaculture site visits.

The theme of IPC10 was highly appropriate given the United Nations have just launched their Decades for Deserts and the Fight Against Desertification. We have the solutions!
