NOTES:

Here we go with a complete version from start to end.The video and audio i've had to make from using both sources
mentioned above,but the bulk of it was the rus video and bida audio.
Right onto the russian video ...we were kndly given the source files ( thanks ) which were in 5 avi files.The source
was ok but alot of camera movement,missing intro and the colours had that rainbow effect.
The other source i grabbed was tagged MI4 so not sure who to thank ...but thanks either way ....this one had a watermark
hardcoded to the middle of the screen throughout :( but did contain the complete intro :) .
So took 3mins 48 secs off it and cut and saved that.From there we needed to rotate and crop and filter the 5 avi files differently
so i will pre warn there is some AR change and we've gone with a res that was inbetween so he should look dam close throughout.
Once we had all the parts done it was a case of appending them all ....had to remove the start of the russian video though as it 
had more cam cover ups than actual video footage,but replaced this with the other video.
Also we changed all the brightness,contrast,chroma levels,used a heavy noise filter and also on the intro we blurred the watermark.
Now the audio ....had to use the non english audio for the first 1min39 secs ...but no english speaking all effects and music.From
there we used bidas synced audio.
Had to cut it up into 6-7 pieces and reline the audio as it was slightly oos with our encode.
Finally we decided to drop the audio into goldwave,remove the hissing the best we could without messing the audio up and also
changed all the EQ settings.

Oh check near the beginng where it says Budapest &lt;&lt;&lt; sounds like it says Budapest shithead LMFAO.
