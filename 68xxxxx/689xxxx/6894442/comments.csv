windows installed on your c:\ drive or a other one.

The program looks for the skin files in ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Portable\VirtualDJ Pro v7.0.5\""

If windows is installed on d:\ or higher,
then copy ""YOURDRIVE:\Program Files (x86)\Portable\VirtualDJ Pro v7.0.5\"" 
to ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Portable\VirtualDJ Pro v7.0.5\""

Or if you know how to change things in your registry goto:
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\VirtualDJ]
And change:
""RunFolder""=""C:\\Program Files (x86)\\VirtualDJ\\"" and ""HomeFolder""=""C:\\Program Files (x86)\\VirtualDJ\\""
to the correct drive."
