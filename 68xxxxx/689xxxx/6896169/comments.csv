@ Kaos_D, IF you have nothing constructive to say, then KEEP IT SHUT. Until you have heard Britney Spears done in Death Metal, you have no idea how much fun listening to covers can be.
I suggest that your mommy hides the computer from you till you are old enough to appreciate the contribution of others.
Incidently, I noticed that you have made an incredible contribution ... NOT !!!"
