17th December 2011 British Eurosport
11:45-13:00 ladies (live)

The ladies 10km and mens 15km classic mass start events at the FIS Cross-Country Skiing World Cup round from Rogla Slovenia. Only the last 2 minutes (600 metres) of the mens race is covered. The mens live race was only shown on European Eurosport 2 (not British Eurosport 2). There was a 30 minute recorded highlights of the mens race on British Eurosport 1 at 3:30pm but I missed it. There is a 1 hour record highlight repeat of the mens race on European Eurosport 2 at 8am GMT Sunday morning 18th Dec 2011 which I don't have access to.
