This pack was collected Rendered and compiled by me over the time Ive been into Photoshop. Plus I noticed a couple from me buddy Cojogo I see sneak in! Ta matey. (Couldn\'t be bothered to take them out haha!)

Like all Photoshoppers and peeps on the computer Ive taken these stocks and wallpapers from as many different places as I could using our friend Google. Afterall thats what we Photoshoppers do isnt it lol Then I ruined my eyesight in rendering them for many hours for peeps to hopefully use in their grafix works later and stuck them on both the sites Gallerys that Im active on to join with the 6000 + renders,stocks,textures,C4Ds etc we have there.


Id like to thank all the sites and the photoshoppers on them that post these stocks and wallpapers so all of the grafix community can come along and take them like what I done :)
Ta Muchly peeps :)

Im sure you will find this pack well worth the downloading and if you need ANY other Photoshop resources, need help or advice with anything grafix related or just fancy joining a photoshop forum to be with like minded peeps who have a laugh while making things and give each other inspiration then come and see us at one of the sites below. You will be more than welcome to join in.

Love and peace
