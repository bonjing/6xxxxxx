All in one solution to begin playing Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 online via Tunngle.

The installer will check for and confirm the location of your COD-MW3 installation, then copy over the Teckno loader and 1.4 update files. Installer then checks for tunngle install, and offers to install (ver 4.3.3.0) ONLY if it is not found. Shortcuts to play online are created in the start menu and on the desktop. Uninstaller included and registered in Add/Remove Programs.

Any questions or comments please post them here. This torrent (thepiratebay) is the initial release location and it will be here that I maintain/update it.

As always, please seed.
