This album is more or less a continuation of the style and approach of Ballads and Songs. It sounds a little more relaxed and the guitar style's beginning to sound a little more distinctive - some more percussive touches are creeping in. Here we have beautiful versions of The Bonny Bunch of Roses and Lord Bateman, alongside a reworking of The Outlandish Knight - also on Ballads and Songs Nic obviously thought that his 1970 version needed work. Again, many of the songs are set to tunes that Nic has adapted, assembled or invented. Like others of his musical stature and ability, Nic Jones had become part of a living tradition - allowing folk songs to evolve through him, noting the evolution and his own contributions all the while.
