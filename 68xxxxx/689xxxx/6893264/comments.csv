[V],.BONE.,2012-03-23T02:46Z,it will not download thats why the sd files are added
and get it running.  Too bad that It gives me a pop up when it starts saying ""Need Resources - The game needs to download resources.  Do you want to start downloading now?"" When I click yes it says ""Error - and error occurred while downloading. Please try again later.  If I click no to the download it just closes the app.  I followed the instructions and transferred the files on WiFi as well as tether and card reader.  All with the same results.  I placed the files in Android, Data.  The file MarketMilitiaDragonsLair103.apk comes up as Directory is empty.  I even unzipped it and same thing. I deleted it and still the same.  Any help you may offer.  I have a Sony Ericsson Xperia Play."
