|   4.0/5.0 [Erin Horgan / Amazon]                                             |
|                                                                              |
|   Aussie alternative band SFK is a prime example of self-development. Some   |
|   artists have a way of keeping the same style throughout each album, but    |
|   SFK is changing. In the beginning, with the album "Elsewhere for 8         |
|   Minutes", they were more rock. "Beautiful Sharks" was more commercial      |
|   with a bit of experimentation, capturing attention with rock songs such    |
|   as "Hallways" and the catchiness of "Electricity" (which has an            |
|   excellent riff). "Echolalia" brought the most public attention, a very     |
|   commercially friendly album that seems pretty much flawless. Now with      |
|   "The Official Fiction", they've grown to add classy sophistication to      |
|   their repertoire.                                                          |
|                                                                              |
|   The differences between this and past albums are evident. While the        |
|   commerciality isn't as frequent, "The Official Fiction" is nonetheless     |
|   quite powerful and emotional, and is best played during a quiet night      |
|   in. And to get the most out of this album, one should pay close            |
|   attention to the lyrics, and SFK provides some of the best in the song-    |
|   writing business of recent times.                                          |
|                                                                              |
|   A brilliant example of quality lyrics is "Best Weapon", clearly inspired   |
|   by today's world. One can tell by the sinister tones in the opening bars   |
|   that there is something disturbing going on. "His machines all agree,      |
|   let's wind them up and march them out / History repeated and read out      |
|   loud - this could be our best weapon now..." The second verse is even      |
|   more powerful: "Stripes and suits pushing the numbers through / They       |
|   treat them like they don't exist / And they count them up like they're     |
|   matchsticks..." The lyrics are perfectly suited to the music, which has    |
|   a haunting and emotional outro, with those two adjectives capable of       |
|   pretty much summing up the entire album.                                   |
|                                                                              |
|   Another standout track is clearly "Letter to the Editor", upbeat and       |
|   energetic enough to capture attention, with a brilliant riff in the        |
|   verses. However, the true essence lies in the lyrics, which comment on     |
|   the media's interpretation of life. "It's just information burned up,      |
|   passed out, spun to your door..." is a prime example, as are the           |
|   choruses. This is a very meaningful song, with other lyrics such as "and   |
|   the choice of words is choose no words; say nothing, nothing at all" and   |
|   "tell it like it is". This is a song to remember.                          |
|                                                                              |
|   The first single released from this album was "Deja Vu", certainly a       |
|   change from the released singles of previous albums. This is a powerful,   |
|   string-driven track with lyrics of coincidence. It's a haunting piece,     |
|   and the strings truly bring the song to life, before it softens for the    |
|   ending. A terrific version of it (though with the lyrics slightly          |
|   altered) was performed at Australian music's night of nights (the ARIA     |
|   Awards), complete with a string section, so it can be brilliant live as    |
|   well.                                                                      |
|                                                                              |
|   "Song for a Sleepwalker" was the second released single, and tames the     |
|   passionate fire created by the more powerful tracks. It's sweet, with a    |
|   gentle lightness that makes it accessible for commercial purposes, and     |
|   elicits smiles. However, like with SFK's other released singles, it        |
|   didn't stay for very long in the top 20 singles in Australia.              |
|                                                                              |
|   Like "Echolalia", this album has a track best performed live. In this      |
|   case, it's "Light at the End of the Tunnel", with an acoustic guitar,      |
|   strings and light female background vocals. This is one for gigs.          |
|                                                                              |
|   "Max Planck" is solid, a smooth piece that holds something somewhat        |
|   emotional in the verses. "Kaplan / Thornhill" isn't particularly a         |
|   standout, with a swaying feeling, and string instruments playing a major   |
|   part in the outro.                                                         |
|                                                                              |
|   The only track that I personally don't think belongs on the album is       |
|   "Reverse Soundtrack". It's a slow track, and the problem with slow         |
|   tracks is that if they're not special then they seem like time-fillers.    |
|   Unfortunately, it is the later that describes this song, and it's a        |
|   disappointment.                                                            |
|                                                                              |
|   The track positioning of the album shows that maybe this didn't go         |
|   unnoticed, and so it seems as though attempts to make up for it are done   |
|   with the following tracks. "Coldwater Canyon" is lightly upbeat about      |
|   getting "out of this still life", reasonably catchy. The last minute       |
|   consists of strings only, but they are slower, and so I'm not quite sure   |
|   if they fit in with the rest of the song. Meanwhile, "Souvenir" sounds     |
|   as if it was written back in earlier years of the band, around the time    |
|   of "Elsewhere for 8 Minutes", perhaps, as it is upbeat, lively and         |
|   catchy soft-rock, its best line being "it's all money over mind over       |
|   matter over miles of nothing, nothing here".                               |
|                                                                              |
|   One of my personal favourite tracks is "Moving Right Along", which is      |
|   the blessed feel-good track of the album. This is the song to hug - it's   |
|   lovely, lively and cuddly, and you just have to adore it. The lyrics are   |
|   about a friend never falling in times of trouble: "They thought you'd      |
|   falter, they thought you'd fail / But I knew better - you were just        |
|   setting sail / And you were moving right along..."                         |
|                                                                              |
|   "Asleep at the Wheel" goes back to slightly haunting soft-rock, with a     |
|   snappy riff and interesting lyrics in the chorus - "This is how we come    |
|   and go, with ghosts for memories and memories for ghosts..." And the       |
|   final track, "No Man's Land", has its opening bars and verses similar to   |
|   the band's earlier work, but the chorus sounds similar to "Deja Vu".       |
|   It's nice, though not particularly outstanding, with good writing, but     |
|   it doesn't feel individual enough.                                         |
|                                                                              |
|   Overall, "The Official Fiction" is powerful, sophisticated music, but      |
|   lacks stability of strength. "Reverse Soundtrack" bogs down the album,     |
|   and the next three songs seem to try to compensate for that. The first     |
|   half is - for the most part - serious and dramatic, while the other half   |
|   is lighter, so maybe this could be better equalised by mixing up the       |
|   track order. The album could be viewed as an acquired taste overall, but   |
|   it's a must-have for fans. Newcomers to the band's listeners may prefer    |
|   to start off with "Echolalia" or "Beautiful Sharks", but it really         |
|   depends on what they're after.                                             |
|                                                                              |
