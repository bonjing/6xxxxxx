Having problems with Direct X 11 install Microsoft .NET Framework 4.
I have Arkham City and the official patch did not work for me.

My system set up:

Windows 7 64-Bit
Core 2 Extreme
8 Gigs DDR2
GTX 580 1.5 GB
7200 RPM HD

Arkham City plays smooth after the Framework. It should work for 32-Bit OS.

I have Arkham City settings 100% maxed out except for motion blur on a 1200p monitor. I even get playable quality with AA maxed and V Sync on.
