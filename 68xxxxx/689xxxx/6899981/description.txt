  Adventurer Bear Grylls and eleven other 'recruits' take part in the   
  French Foreign Legion's basic training in the Sahara desert for a     
  month. In the second episode, Lee is rushed to hospital with a back   
  injury, but Sgt Ferguson is convinced he is faking. Stephen also      
  earns the officers' disapproval with his constant complaining, and    
  Bear is punished for a small misdemeanour in classic Foreign Legion   
  fashion - by being buried up to his neck in sand!
