|   4.0/5.0 - Excellent [Jimmie Stephens, SputnikMusic]                        |
|                                                                              |
|   When Something For Kate first formed, they were considered to be a more    |
|   of a full on rock group, though as the years have progressed things have   |
|   changed and they have become what some consider as folk pop. Though on     |
|   their fifth album Something For Kate are able to merge both these genres   |
|   together and create what they have called Desert Lights.                   |
|                                                                              |
|   Their previous release The Official Fiction - an album that this           |
|   reviewer adores too much for his own good - left the basic three piece     |
|   sound that they had stuck to for so many years, by adding orchestral       |
|   arrangements to many of the songs, though Desert Lights returns us back    |
|   to the original Something For Kate sound. When recording this album, it    |
|   was no secret that Paul Dempsey had suffered a case of writers block,      |
|   though on the opening track `California' he sings, with much sarcasm       |
|   "It's a beautiful life" and by the end you as the listener are quite       |
|   confused to whether Dempsey is trying to force himself to believe it       |
|   since his lyrics are often plagued with many depressing references.        |
|                                                                              |
|   As the album continues through each track, new sounds appear that you      |
|   can't quite compare to anything else. And it becomes obvious that this     |
|   band is taking things to a completely different place. `This Is The        |
|   Life' with Dempsey's beautiful voice floating above the driving guitar,    |
|   and then there is `Was Outed To Sea' with an almost lullaby like piano     |
|   accompaniment giving Something For Kate a totally different sound. The     |
|   band also keeps the melodic feeling that they showed with their past two   |
|   albums, but unlike the others these songs seemed to be soaked in           |
|   darkness. The passion of the band is also at large here and makes          |
|   Something For Kate's previous outings look like a happy Christmas day.     |
|                                                                              |
|   Desert Lights shows even with a case of writers block, Something For       |
|   Kate are still some of the best writers in the business. Instead of        |
|   sitting with the common trend they do things differently, with intricate   |
|   melodies and guitar solos that you can tell Dempsey has spent hours        |
|   thinking over. Plus Stephanie Ashworth's smooth bass lines and Clint       |
|   Hyndman's erratic drumming and you have a band to be reckoned with.        |
|                                                                              |
|   Backing up the amazing release that The Official Fiction is, it was        |
|   always going to be a hard task, and even more difficult when Dempsey,      |
|   the band's main contributor is suffering writers block, though Something   |
|   For Kate have added quite a fantastic album to their catalogue with        |
|   Desert Lights. This is poetic depression at its best.                      |
|                                                                              |
