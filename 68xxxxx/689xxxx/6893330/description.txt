This is supposedly the season finale. Boohoo. Oh well. The new season should be just around the corner. In this episode Zak, Nick and Aaron examine an old jail in Charleston, S.C.; during its 137 years in operation, the Old Charleston Jail detained some of the city's most infamous criminals within its stone walls; some prisoners have been vindicated by history.
