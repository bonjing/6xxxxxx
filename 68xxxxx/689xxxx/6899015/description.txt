Once you have downloaded the Edit, create a playlist in whatever program you\'re playing music through. The playlist\'s name ought to be the same as the torrentname. 

(A.E you download Edit #32 &gt; create a playlist in iTunes &gt; name the playlist \"Edit #32\" &gt; Put all the songs from the Edit #32 torrent in there)

This makes it much easier for me to know what kind of tracks you\'ve got (this music is mainly for my friends but available to everyone.
