Hello everyone =)

This is my first torrent and it is detailed as such:

WCW Nitro - 1995 (September-December)

This is the WCW Nitro television show from the year 1995. Nitro was started in September of 1995, so this is a COMPLETE collection of the first FOUR (4) MONTHS of WCW Nitro.

If everything goes good, I will be uploading the rest of Nitro. I got these torrents from a private tracker a long time ago and I wish to share them with everybody else.

This torrent is seeding on a cap of 300KB/s with SIX (6) UPLOAD SLOTS. This is due to my limited bandwidth for uploading on my internet plan. This is being uploaded through a VPN through uTorrent v3.0 with outgoing encryption set to FORCED.

I hope you enjoy the first FOUR (4) MONTHS of WCW Nitro!

You can find me on The Pirate Bay's Forums (Suprbay) and the address is www.Suprbay.org - My username is "Kolokovichk".

Enjoy! =)
