I apologize for the low upload speed. It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.
I see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. 
Ok pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. 
Surely I wont always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it is up to you to help these shares to spread.

Robert Fripp (& King Crimson) Discography

A MUSIC torrent :)

Dig the Grand Master of Music: Robert Fripp
 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fripp


Robert Fripp is one of the most influential musician during the end of XX century.
He's one of the founders of progressive rock music; he explored the possibilities of the guitar in realms never touched before with his definition of ambient music and "frippertronics".
What you find here are 89 albums defining his discography. 36 come from the King Crimson experience which I kept to the essential works, avoiding the insane proliferation of bootlegs which are good for maniac collectors but don't add further meaning to the knowledge of music of the band

It does not need to be insane to listen to Fripp's music... but it helps anyway... :)

All the album are zipped (since the number of files was too high for TPB).
The sampling rate is mostly 320kbps.
Different rates are signed in the name of the albums zips.

Enjoy :)
