  The second Scrappy Races competition sees the return of the Chaos     
  Crew from Doncaster, who are joined by the Cops and Bodgers from the  
  Home Counties, London-based motorcycle maniacs the Knuckleheadz, and  
  Scottish engineers the Tartan Scarlets.                               
                                                                        
  Episode2 - Giant Archery                                              
                                                                        
  This week the teams travel 100 miles from the start line in Suffolk   
  to 11th-century Rockingham Castle in Northamptonshire. Waiting for    
  them is an appointment with a giant archery circuit.                  
                                                                        
  The arrows are provided, but the teams must build huge bows, which    
  they have to attach to their radical roadsters. In order to succeed   
  against three intimidating medieval targets, the teams need to build  
  some seriously strapping siege engines.
