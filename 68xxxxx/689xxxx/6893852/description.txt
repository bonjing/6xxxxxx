This update includes:

\'Knight of the Order\' costume DLC                             
\'Orc Slayer\' costume DLC

I have tested it on one of the THETA releases and it\'s working. Also, it\'s from the RLSLOG download link so should be fine.

Please don\'t delete this torrent. I swear it\'s legit and I\'m only trying to help out.

I\'ll try and help with any problems, though I doubt I\'ll be any help :)
