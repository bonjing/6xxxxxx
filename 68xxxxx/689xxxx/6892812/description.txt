  The series exposing rip-offs, raw deals and poor service returns for  
  a new run, with Julia Somerville joining Gloria Hunniford and Angela  
  Rippon to investigate why viewers have been left out of pocket - and  
  trying to get their problems resolved. Whether it's rocketing energy  
  prices, unexpected bank charges, or a catch in the small print        
  that's had devastating consequences, they'll get answers from the     
  companies responsible - as well as giving invaluable tips and advice  
  on how to get the best deals, and avoid costly rip offs! Plus, the    
  team have been on the road, tackling consumer complaints face to      
  face at the Rip Off Britain Pop-Up shop.                              
                                                                        
  EPISODE 3                                                             
                                                                        
  With house prices so unpredictable, more of you are looking into      
  ways of extending and improving your current property rather than     
  trying to move. But trying to find a builder you can trust can be     
  very tricky. Which? magazine estimated that over the last three       
  years, 2.5million of us have had some sort of complaint about a       
  builder. We investigate what happens when a builder doesnt finish a  
  job, leaving a family out of pocket and frustrated. And one of the    
  most shocking stories we have heard on Rip Off  a plumber who        
  charged 14,400 to unblock a drain! We also look at those charges     
  that can creep up when taking out a mortgage and what you need to be  
  aware of.
