Among other things this mini-series is putting another spin on how Batman and 

Superman first met,and how gradually they became friends and partners as we know

them today.Every chapter tells of passing year when they meet to pay respect to

...well spoilers...don\'t wanna...anyway another spin to their partnership,artwork

takes getting used to,especially in the first few issues..but anyway this just goes

to show you how Batman villain gallery is much more classic and better than 

Superman\'s...
