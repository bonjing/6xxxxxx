Shrimad Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda(Uttarardh) [By Team Nanban][TPB]


About Valmiki:



"Valmiki" (during Lord Rama's time) is celebrated as the poet harbinger in Sanskrit literature. 

He is the author of the epic Ramayana, based on the attribution in the text of the epic itself.

He is revered as the Adi Kavi, which means First Poet, for he discovered the first sloka i.e. first verse, which set the base and defined the form to Sanskrit poetry.

The Ramayana, originally written by Valmiki, consists of 24,000 verses in seven cantos (some say six i.e. excluding the Uttara Ramayana) (Kandas). 

The Ramayana tells the story of a prince, Rama of Ayodhya, whose wife Sita is abducted by the demon (Raakshasa) king of Lanka, Ravana. 

The Valmiki Ramayana is dated variously from 500 BC to 100 BC, or about co-eval with early versions of the Mahabharata.

As with many traditional epics, it has gone through a long process of interpolations and redactions, making it impossible to date accurately.



SHORT DESCRIPTION ON Shrimad Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda(Uttarardh):


After Rama and Sita have been married for twelve years, an elderly Dasharatha expresses his desire to crown Rama, to which the Kosala assembly and his subjects express their support.

On the eve of the great event, Kaikeyiâ€”her jealousy aroused by Manthara, a wicked maidservantâ€”claims two boons that Dasharatha had long ago granted her. 

Kaikeyi demands Rama to be exiled into wilderness for fourteen years, while the succession passes to her son Bharata. 

The heartbroken king, constrained by his rigid devotion to his given word, accedes to Kaikeyi's demands.

Rama accepts his father's reluctant decree with absolute submission and calm self-control which characterizes him throughout the story.

He is joined by Sita and Lakshmana. When he asks Sita not to follow him, she says, "the forest where you dwell is Ayodhya for me and Ayodhya without you is a veritable hell for me."

After Rama's departure, king Dasharatha, unable to bear the grief, passes away.

Meanwhile, Bharata who was on a visit to his maternal uncle, learns about the events in Ayodhya. 

Bharata refuses to profit from his mother's wicked scheming and visits Rama in the forest. 

He requests Rama to return and rule. 

But Rama, determined to carry out his father's orders to the letter, refuses to return before the period of exile. 

However, Bharata carries Rama's sandals, and keeps them on the throne, while he rules as Rama's regent.
