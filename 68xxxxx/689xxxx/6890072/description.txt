     3. Performance Tuning

*****************************************************************
VIDEO
-Regardless of your video card, make sure to download the latest drivers from your manufacturer.

Drivers for supported video cards are available as follows:
	NVIDIA: http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us
	ATI: http://ati.amd.com/support/driver.html


If you are experiencing performance issues in the game, reset your video options to what the Skyrim Launcher has auto-detected.  To do this, select Options from the Skyrim Launcher and clicking the Default button in the Detail section.  

Additionally, there are several things you can do to increase game performance.

-Make sure you have no other programs running in the background.

In the Skyrim Launcher:
-Switch to LOW or MEDIUM Detail settings. Select Advanced for more detail options.
-Turn Anti-Aliasing and/or Anisotropic Filtering down or off.  This may degrade overall visual quality but will improve framerate.
-Lower the game resolution.  The title will run faster at smaller resolutions.


INPUT
-ALT+TAB may cause some game instability with some hardware configurations and is not advised.
