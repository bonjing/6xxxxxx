Well, for obvious reasons, this movie gets very good ratings and a highly positive review...... This is undoubtedly the best of E.V.V...... but the maximum credit for the success of the movie goes to Rajendra Prasad..... His performance as Atukula Chitti Babu stands as a role model for all those comedy heroes of Telugu industry...... and Rao Gopal Rao as Royyala Naidu excelled the character as the owner of a rich fishing factory...... two and a half hours of absolute entertainment......

an absolute 10 out of 10 for this movie........

I strongly recommend everyone to watch this movie at least once..... and I'm sure you cant really stop at one.........
