Gary Lineker presents highlights of today's Premier League clashes, including Newcastle United v Swansea City at St James' Park 
and Wolverhampton Wanderers v Stoke City at Molineux. The Magpies played host to the Swans for the first time since November 2009, 
when they recorded a 3-0 win in a season that saw them win the Championship title and earn promotion back to the top flight. Meanwhile, 
Mick McCarthy's men were hoping to avoid a third successive defeat against the Potters in a clash between two sides in need of three points. 
Plus, action from Blackburn Rovers v West Bromwich Albion, Everton v Norwich City, Fulham v Bolton Wanderers and Wigan Athletic v Chelsea.
