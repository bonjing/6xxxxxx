Riddles of the Bible - Season 2
Today, biblical archaeologists and scholars rub shoulders with scientists. They're all scouring the globe for the most elusive and controversial goal in biblical research, to find out whether or not the stories of the Bible are based on real events.


1)  Dead Sea Scrolls 
Nearly sixty years after their discovery; some scholars argue the Dead Sea Scrolls continue to pose more questions than they can answer. Join National Geographic as they examine what the latest science and archaeology tells us of the history and meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls.

2)  Lost Cities 
A tale of two cities gone bad: Sodom and Gomorrah destroyed as God's retribution for scandalous sin. Then, God sides with Joshua to conquer another city: Jericho. Are these Bible stories fact or moral fable? Biblical scholars and scientists look to archaeological and geological evidence to uncover the mysteries of these Lost Cities.

3)  Kings of Israel 
David and Goliath. Few haven't heard of the small boy who legend says brought down Goliath the giant with a slingshot. Join National Geographic as they investigate the meaning behind an artefact that lends the story a historical foundation. Then follow a trail of evidence that may provide tantalising proof of the lives of King David and Solomon.

4)  Hunt for the Ark of the Covernant 
Perhaps the greatest biblical riddle ever. The Ark of the Covenant was terrifying beyond belief - consuming those who sought to look upon it in fire or disfiguring them with tumours and leprosy. Then it simply vanished. Join National Geographic on an epic scholarly journey in search of the truth behind one of the most coveted artefacts of the Bible.
