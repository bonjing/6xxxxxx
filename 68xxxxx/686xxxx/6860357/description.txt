Today we present you another new graffiti 
video from Europe! We've released the
two previous titles from the SMGO series.
And after a few years they are back with
this excellent new DVD featuring Europe's
and Japan's Subway Systems and lots of
good footage. Very well edited with good 
effects and excellent music choices for
each chapter on their journey around 
Europe and Japan.
Featuring the RCLS SPK MUTANTS and others
Also the vide includes various funny and
surprising situations along the usual
live actions, entering spots, spotting
and running. Entertainment guarenteed!

[color=yellow]### NOTE ### [/color]
The source was great, so we just added a few filters to our rip......aspect, croping, deinterlace, sharpmatrix, denoise.

[color=red]This DVD consists of various video sources, day and
night scenes, expect a variety in video quality.
Also different cropping may occur during the movie.
expect some segments to have black borders or even
different aspect ratio.
Some scenes featuring original languages, either
from writers, security, police or other people, but
the video supplies hardcoded english subtitles in
those few situations.[/color]
