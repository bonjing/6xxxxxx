Ron Geesin and Roger Waters: Music from The Body (1970)
FLAC

This project is more Geesin than Waters, but Harvest-era Floyd fans should enjoy this.  "Breathe" was reworked a couple years later for Dark Side of the Moon.  Pink Floyd contribute a (formerly) uncredited backing track to "Give Birth to a Smile."
