Mary Poppins is as great a movie for most kids as is The Sound of Music
I daresay, and I enjoyed it equally as much as a child myself! In fact it stars
Ms. Julie Andrews equally of course and has a similar storyline to some degree.

Lovely British kids in the best example of great spirit, as an example to all!
Great songs for the children to grow up with!

Do enjoy, and merry Christmas this and every year!
