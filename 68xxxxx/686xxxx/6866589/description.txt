Babylon (1980) Restored DVDRip XviD & Soundtrack
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080406/

Previously only available on VHS Babylon was restored, remastered and released in 2008. Old rips that I've downloaded are poor quality. This is ripped from the restored DVD release.


Babylon is set in South London at the start of the â€™80s, a time when reggae music was at its peak, along with a distinctively British brand of xenophobia and racism.
The plot concerns Blue, lead chanter for Ital Lion Sound (played by Aswad singer Brinsley Forde), in the run-up to a competition with a rival crew led by Jah Shaka (who appears as himself).
Over the course of the film Blue socialises with his friends and clashes with his family, employer, and a local clan of racists, before going on a spiritual and physical journey through small hours London where he encounters a series of trials and temptations that set up the filmâ€™s violent climax.

Babylon remained an underground cult classic for years.
Audiences got little chance to catch it.
The censors were scared that black Britons under the age of 18 would misread the film as an incitement to violence.
The BBFC saddled it with a limiting 'X' certificate.
BBFC secretary James Ferman reassured, "We all believe that it will become a classic of its type and be around for many years, so that black youngsters who cannot see it today will have their chance before very long."
But following its cinema run, Babylon went underground. With no VHS or DVD release (even the soundtrack wasn't reissued on CD until 2005),
the film instead collected a cult following via second-generation recordings, taped off the TV after either of its two screenings on Channel 4 during the 1980s and then exchanged and passed around.
