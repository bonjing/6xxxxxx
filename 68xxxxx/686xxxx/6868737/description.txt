The Good Doctor is a comedy with music written by Neil Simon.

The Good Doctor is set in Russia during the 19th century and written in the style of Chekhovian comedy. It is composed of a series of scenes in which the only connecting thread is the character of the Writer originally played by Christopher Plummer, who is obviously Anton Chekhov. Simon uses several direct references to Chekhov in the play: The writer's opening monologue quotes Trigorn, the writer in The Seagull, directly and one of the scenes, "The Audition" centers around an untried actress auditioning for The Writer by playing all of Three Sisters.

The Good Doctor opened on Broadway at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre on November 27, 1973 and closed on May 25, 1974 after 208 performances and 8 previews. Produced by Emanuel Azenberg and directed by A.J. Antoon, it starred RenÃ© Auberjonois, Barnard Hughes, Marsha Mason, Christopher Plummer, and Frances Sternhagen. Frances Sternhagen won the Tony Award, Best Featured Actress in a Play, and it received 4 additional Tony Award nominations: Best Original Score Peter Link, Best Featured Actor in a Play (RenÃ© Auberjonois), and Best Lighting remiDesign.

A revival was produced by The Melting Pot Theater, at the Theater of the Riverside Church, New York City, from February 1998 through March 1, 1998, with Andre De Shields, Jane Connell, and Gordon Connell.

A television movie was made based on the play, with Edward Asner, Richard Chamberlain, and Marsha Mason. It premiered on U.S. Public Television on November 8, 1978.

Simon met his second wife, Marsha Mason during auditions for this play.
