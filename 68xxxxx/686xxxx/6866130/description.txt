Somewhat of a triumph, especially for a British band of the \'90s with no hint of Beatles influence or tortured vocals. Instead we are treated to a smorgasbord of nifty melodies, some very good lyrics and Sarah Blackwood\'s lovely vocals. For the most part, the sound (led by Stephen Hague\'s glossy production) is layered synths, sometimes Erasuresque (as on \"Anywhere\"), with programmed beats and, here or there, the odd jangly guitar a la the Sundays (\"St. Swithins Day,\" written by Billy Bragg). The singles \"Stars\" and \"Not So Manic Now\" are sumptuous, and even when the guitar delves into grungy terrain on the title track, reminiscent of Garlands-period Cocteau Twins, they still pull it off. Only on \"Not Once, Not Ever\" and \"The Day I See You Again do they come slightly unstuck -- not much to complain about on a debut.
