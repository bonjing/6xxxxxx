C/O amazon

A good variety of rock songs on all 3 discs - quite a nostalgic mix to bring back memories. 
Most notable on disc one are Humble Pie, Jefferson Airplane, The Spencer Davis Group & 
The Allmann Brothers Band - on disc two Rainbow, Status Quo, The Spin Doctors & Patti Smith
disc three Europe, Alice Cooper, Cher & The Scorpions. 

I expect like me you will have most of theses tracks on other albums but is a great cd for the car
