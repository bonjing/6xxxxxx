 Content is organized within 12 thematic units, including Everyday Language, People, Housing, Food and Recreation.

 Each unit starts with an Intro page (new to this edition) and ends with a story page, with single or double-page sub-topics introducing new words in a realistic visual context and easy-to-learn "chunks."


 The target new vocabulary is listed and simple practice activities help students put their new words into practice.
 Story pages include pre-reading questions to build previewing and predicting skills and post-reading questions and role-play activities to support critical thinking and to encourage students to use the new language they have learned.

 Rich visual contexts recycle words from the unit. This structure is designed to address the needs of multilevel classrooms.

 Supporting components include more guidance on this topic as well as assessing needs and lesson planning. (available in English only).
