For some reason your xbox-uploads don't work when I run them through Abgx, I just get an error message that says the file ""isn't recognized XBOX 360 iso or stealth file. I tried to burn some of your game anyway but they wont work. They go through the burning prosses smoothly but when I run them in my xbox I just get a error message. Games from other uploaders work fine but yours don't. Im not saying you're doing something wrong, but you might know what im doing wrong. Please help! "
