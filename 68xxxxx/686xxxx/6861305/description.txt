David Rosenfeld made a version of ben Gurion Airport for FS2004 a few years ago, and decided to start anew with his FSX version. And that is what we offer here today: a brand new, fully FSX native version of Ben Gurion Airport, situated near Tel Aviv, Israel.

This scenery is made specifically for Microsoft Flight Simulator X and was built in order to replace the default Ben Gurion airport scenery provided by Microsoft.

The scenery contains:

    Terminal 3 â€“ with moving jetway - (CTRL-J) and its surrounding parking positions.
    More realistic runways and taxiways.
    Highly detailed buildings, structures and facilities
    Navigation aids and lights, including the new LDA system on runway 30 which allows any kind of training.
    Photorealistic ground textures on and around the airport.

Auto-generated buildings and trees appear on the photorealistic ground, according to the location of the cities. Furthermore, the roads are illuminated during night time, and allow night VFR flying in the vicinity of the airport.
