ReleaseNotes:

A greatest hits collection from a group that didn't get enough airplay...

I have always been a big fan of the Classics IV's biggest hits "Spooky" and "Stormy"(it's hard to get them out of your head once you've heard them!)and this compilation brings together ALL of their major Imperial releases on one CD.The only hit missing would be their last to chart and that was"What am I crying for?" but this was done for another label(MGM),so one wouldn't have expected to get it here.

The group originated from Florida in the very early 60s and was called "The Classics". From that time to the line up of players it had when"Spooky" first hit the charts,the only original member still with them was Walter Eaton on guitar.Dennis Yost came in as the singer/drummer who would later front the group(literally) but who eventually would just concentrate on vocals after another drummer would be hired to do those honours.In 1968 their
version of "Spooky" hit the charts big time,followed by "Stormy". In 1969 they would lead off with another big one,the slower but nice "Traces". Also included are their more minor releases:"Everyday With You Girl","Change Of Heart","Midnight"and "The Funniest Thing". It's all here,all their major and minor hits on Imperial,for the casual and the more intense fan.
