Pan.Am.S01E09.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 168MB]

[/b][/color] Passion, jealousy and espionage... They do it all - and they do it at 30,000 feet.
The style of the 1960s, the energy and excitement of the Jet Age and a drama full of sexy entanglements deliciously mesh in this thrilling and highly-original new series.


In this modern world, air travel represents the height of luxury and Pan Am is the biggest name in the business.
The planes are glamorous, the pilots are rock stars and the stewardesses are the most desirable women in the world.
Not only are these flyboys and girls young and good looking, but to represent Pan Am they also have to be educated, cultured and refined.
They're trained to handle everything from in-air emergencies to unwanted advances - all without rumpling their pristine uniforms or mussing their hair.
There's Dean (Jonah Lotan) - a cocky, charismatic and ambitious new pilot - the first of a new breed not trained in the war.
On the sly against company policy, he's dating Bridget, a stunning beauty with a mysterious past.
A rebellious bohemian, Maggie (Christina Ricci) turns into a buttoned up professional for work so she can see the world.
Rounding out the crew are flirtatious Collette (Karine Vanasse), the adventurous Kate (Kelli Garner) and, finally, Laura (Margot Robbie) - Kate's beauty queen younger sister, a runaway bride, who recently fled a life of domestic boredom to take to the skies.
