    Jean Carter, nine-year-old daughter of the town's newly-appointed        
    school principal, Peter Carter and his wife Sally, is playing in the     
    woods with her 11-year-old friend Lucille, when Jean discovers she       
    has lost her purse containing her "candy" money. Lucille tells her       
    she knows where they can get sweets for nothing, and leads her to an     
    imposing mansion, from which the owner, Clarence Olderberry, Sr., a      
    tall, gaunt man of 70 has been watching the girls from a window. That    
    night Jean, unable to sleep, tells her parents that Oldeberry made       
    her and Lucille dance before him nude in exchange for some candy.        
    Carter files a complaint, but the local police chief, Captain            
    Hammond, is skeptical of Jean's story and warns Carter that the          
    Oldenberry family put the town on the map and have far more standing     
    in the community than the new-comer Carters. Oldenberry, Jr. also        
    tells Carter that if he follows up on the complaint he may be certain    
    that Oldenberry's lawyers will show Jean no mercy. In the ensuing        
    trial, the defense lawyers confuse Jean, make her an uncreditable        
    witness, and Oldenberry is acquitted, after the enraged Carter           
    attacks him physically in court. While her parents are packing to        
    leave town, Jean and Lucille again are playing in the woods, and are     
    approached by Oldenberry, and the two girls flee in blind panic.         
    Reaching a desolate lake, they find an old rowboat and attempt to        
    escape in it, but the mooring rope is still attached to the shore.       
    And Oldenberry is using it to pull the boat and the girls to him.
