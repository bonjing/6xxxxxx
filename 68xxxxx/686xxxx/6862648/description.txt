This is an .Iso of Unit one in the Dave Ramsey Financial Peace School Curriculum.
This DVD covers Dangers of Debt, Consumer Awareness, Credit Bureaus and Collection Practices, Credit Scores and Employment, Warnings for College, Driving For Free, Building Wealth.

From the videos that I have watched, this is a great way to learn about how to achieve financial peace. No more living from paycheck to paycheck!

I have included the intro video to the course as a sample.
