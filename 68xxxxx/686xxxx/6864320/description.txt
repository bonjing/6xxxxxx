Kate Bush (born Catherine Bush 30 July 1958) is an English singer-songwriter,
musician and record producer. Her eclectic musical style and idiosyncratic vocal
style have made her one of the United Kingdom's most successful solo female
performers of the past 30 years. On 27 November 2011, Bush's tenth studio album,
50 Words for Snow, entered the UK album charts at #5, making Bush the first
female recording artist to have an album of all new material in the top five
during each of the last five decades.
