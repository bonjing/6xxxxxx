NG The Witch Doctor Will See You Now: Cow Urine Cure
Piers Gibbon and his volunteer patients attempt to unravel the mysteries of traditional Indian healing. Piers warns why you must never fall ill in India, when a man troubled by eczema braves bloodletting - an ancient treatment in which incisions are made into the skin with a razor blade to rid the body of bad blood. Practitioners of the therapy suggest that the darker the blood, the more the patient must bleed. They also test the benefits of cow urine. Piers Gibbon travels to India with Mark, who suffers from tinnitus and eczema, and Charles, who battles chronic migraines, to explore the healing properties of traditional local medicine. Guided by yoga master "Yogi Gi," the men start by using a rubber pipe to introduce a dollop of clarified butter into the nose. They also go under the knife for some vein slashing, get buried up to their necks in sand and finally sit down to reap the benefits of a tall glass of cow pee.
