Glorious One-Pot Meals: A Revolutionary New Quick and Healthy Approach to Dutch-Oven Cooking by Elizabeth Yarnell Cl.rkson P.tter | 2009 | ISBN: 076793010X | 240 pages | epub, mobi


A totally new patented way to cook quick and easy one-pot meals, while keeping ingredients intact and full of flavor. Elizabeth Yarnell developed her revolutionary infusion-cooking method to avoid often mushy slow-cooker results and to make cooking and cleaning up after dinner a breeze. Now anyone with too many tasks and not enough time can use her technique to get dinner on the table in an hour or less, with no more than twenty minutes of hands-on prep workâ€”and just one pot to clean. 

All it takes is a Dutch oven and a few basic fresh or even frozen ingredients layered--never stirred. Glorious One-Pot Meals provides the most convenient method yet of serving highly nutritious, satisfying suppers every night of the week.
