I should note that while this is pretty nice, it seems to lag explorer.exe (what you use to view all the files on your compute) quite a bit when loading directories on my iPod, at least for me. Maybe if you buy the program it works better than this cracked version, or maybe it's just my iPod and computer having a random issue. Either way, everyone should be aware that this type of behavior may occur. Don't yell at me about it. Fortunately, it only seems to happen when changing directories. But you may want to try another program like iPhone Folders, iExplore, iPhone Explorer, or TransCopy Manager, since none of these seem to have this issue. In fact, iPhone Folders does almost the same thing as this for free, but unfortunately doesn't support Windows 7 64 bit. 

Anyway. Sorry for the lengthy side comment. "
