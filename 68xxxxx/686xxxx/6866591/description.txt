 Panoroma looks at issues affecting the British public and the rest of the world. 

 Britain's leading supermarket chains are constantly competing for shoppers' cash 
 with price drops, roll-backs, brand matches and two-for-one deals. Sophie 
 Raworth explores whether these money-saving offers are all that they seem, 
 revealing how some can lead to a nasty surprise at the checkout.  
                     
                                 Enjoy!
