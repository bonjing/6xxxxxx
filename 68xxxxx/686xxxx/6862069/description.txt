The second edition of Arkham Asylum, which tells the story of Batman's struggle against the most dangerous villains. This time, we move from a psychiatric facility on the island of Arkham to the cover of Gotham City district, occupied entirely by criminals.
Batman: Arkham City is a follow-up action games transferring us to the world of comics known by the title character. The creation of production corresponds to Rocksteady Studios, which developed the great archetype (Batman: Arkham Asylum), and Urban Chaos: Riot Response (PS2, Xbox).
The story begins several months after the events of the first part. Quincy Sharp, former head of the plant Arkham, after assigning the merits of Batman was appointed mayor of Gotham. One of his first decisions was to purchase a substantial part of the local slum, the ejection of these normal people, fencing, and then admitting there villains from Arkham. Amazingly, instead of the other tenants of this unusual powyrzynaÄ‡ prison grouped in a number of gangs and each of them shows a classic villain from the Batman comics.

In addition to moving the main plot we counted side missions, find the whole area porozmieszczane puzzles or solve puzzles by Human-Puzzles. In the described continuation of gadgets are all familiar with Batman Arkham Asylum, but some of them went through major changes (for example, we can now change the direction of movement when using the launcher ropes). The title character may also take advantage of many brand new toys, such as the sending device electrical impulses or grenade allowing the freezing of selected elements of the environment.
