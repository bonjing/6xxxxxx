BG-Rescue Linux is a Busybox and uClibc-based rescue system with a 2.4 series Linux kernel. It supports full read/write support for NTFS using ntfs-3g. It is loaded either from two floppy disks or from one 2.8MB El Torito CD. The system runs entirely in RAM. It supports a wide range of hardware (including SATA and DM/LVM2) and filesystems (including ext2/3, hfs/hfs+, and xfs) and can serve as a full backup/restore system for MS Windows systems that use FAT12/16/32 or NTFS. It also includes many utilities, including strong compresstion tools like lrzip.
