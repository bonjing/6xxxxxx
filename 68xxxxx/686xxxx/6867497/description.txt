The last truly indispensable disc of the great guitar hero's career, and perhaps the most innately satisfying of all, these mid-'50s recordings boast magnificent presence, with T-Bone Walker's axe so crisp and clear it seems as though he's sitting right next to you as he delivers a luxurious remake of 'Call It Stormy Monday.' Atlantic took some chances with Walker, dispatching him to Chicago for a 1955 date with Junior Wells and Jimmy Rogers that produced 'Why Not' and 'Papa Ain't Salty.' Even better were the 1956-1957 L.A. dates that produced the scalding instrumental 'Two Bones and a Pick' (which finds Walker duelling it out with nephew R.S. Rankin and jazzman Barney Kessel).
