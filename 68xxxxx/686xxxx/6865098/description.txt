The Nickel Ride - 1974 - U.S.A.


written by Eric Roth
directed by Robert Mulligan
starring Jason Miller, Linda Haynes, Bo Hopkins


Crime / Drama / Neo Noir


"The Nickel Ride" opened at the Cannes Film Festival in 1974
and was nominated for the Palme d'Or that year.

Selected by Quentin Tarantino for the First Quentin Tarantino
Film Fest in Austin, Texas, 1996.

Downbeat and grim, "The Nickel Ride" concerns itself with a
crime boss who is losing his grip.

The action was his life... without it he was dead.
