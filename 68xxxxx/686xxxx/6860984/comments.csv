If the MP4 gives you playback issues on your WDEP try using MKVmerge GUI to mux it into an MKV.  Only takes a minute to do so and it's not converting anything; only putting the x264 and AC3 from the MP4 into an MKV container.  I don't have a WDEP and make releases specifically for a PC and PS3.

@falasteen - out of my control and nothing I can do about that.  Sorry?"
