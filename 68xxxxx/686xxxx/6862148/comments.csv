in Asia for several years and saw people 
use their rice cookers to cook almost everything
as this book description says.  At first I thought
they were a little loco .... but hey, it was their
rice cooker.

I even saw one person attempt to bake a bread
in their rice cooker as that was the only ""oven""
they had .... This however did not work out at
all as the source of heat is solely on the bottom 
of rice cookers ... not evenly distributed.  As such,
their bread was burnt on the bottom .... but the 
rest appeared to be somewhat edible.

Regardless, it was entertaining to watch.

Thanks again for the ""up"" as I'm sure many will
get some interesting ideas from this one."
