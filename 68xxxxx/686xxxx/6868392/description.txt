POtHS - The Blues - 05 - Rick Estrin and The Nightcats



POtHS comment. I just saw Rick Estrin and The Nightcats Live at Biscuits and Blues in San Francisco. What a wonderful surprise. These guys are one tight group. Rick plays the Harmonica and sings as well as anybody and is a delightful front man. Kid Anderson is a Child Prodigy guitar player from Europe. He had food poisoning that night and still put on a Stellar performance. Kid is at the top of his game. J Hanson plays the drums standing up (cool)and writes most all their original music. Lorenzo Farrell plays Stand Up Base, Strap-on Base and Keyboards. In fact these 4 guys can all the instruments in The Band. They are ALL Superb Musicians.

You WILL enjoy these 4 Superb Musicians

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.


RAPtURE (My transportation outta here).

The Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe That The Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn\\\'t PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)

In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed..

\\\"And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.

\\\"Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...

May Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed Long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.
