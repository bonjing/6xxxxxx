The old BitComet crap that you are using has been obsolete for years.

Also, the proper title of the movie is""Attack The Block""

The exact same movie file you just uploaded has already been available for more than two months from this torrent:
https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6645464/Attack_The_Block_DVDRip_XviD-DoNE
It has more than 1400 seeders.
