From Wiki:


College Music Journal, commonly known as CMJ, is a music events/publishing company which hosts an annual festival in New York City, the CMJ Music Marathon, as well as a weekly magazine of and for the music industry and college radio stations in the United States and Canada. It publishes top 30 lists sent by stations which subscribe at a cost of a few hundred dollars a year. It is also sent to record companies and their public relations and publicity representatives as well as record stores. CMJ also formerly published CMJ New Music Monthly, which was a magazine with interviews, reviews, and special features. Each magazine came with an indie buzz band's cassette or a mix CD of 15-24 songs by well-established bands, unsigned bands and everything in between. The staff puts together CMJ Music Marathon, a convention and music festival, each autumn, in New York. A second festival: the CMJ Rock Hall Music Fest, took place in Cleveland in 2005 and 2006.


CMJ New Music Monthly, the first consumer magazine to include a bound-in cassette or CD sampler, was a publication for the emerging music enthusiast. CMJ New Music Monthly stopped publishing in 2008.
