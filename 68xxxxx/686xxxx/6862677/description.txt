[b]Thx Hive

CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D

!!Cleared line!!

Sources:
Video: Russian DVD-9
Vremya.2011.DVD9
Audio: Mistere Proper R5 Line
thx

Info:

Last 3 days i had 12h workshifts each - some of us have to work in real life8)
will try to get you the missed movies asap.

But now to this Movie. 

Encode:

There are already loads of versions around, i am sure you have collected at least 3 versions already, and you are not satisfied with any of it for sure.

This is the version you shouldnt miss.

There is either the hollow line that sounds like a mic or the proper line, which has a buzz like crazy. 
But that is the better audio to begin with, removing the buzz was very easy, just took me couple mins. 
what took ages was that other rumbling sounding noise in the background which was noticeable after the buzz was gone, that was the only thing standing in the way of a great line.
Removing that took me more than 8h.
Needed 15 steps in restoration,i didnt want to touch the voices, so i had to be careful.
that background noise is still very slightly there, sounds as perfect now as possible, entered that final audio back into the russian 5.1 track and it was ready to go.

To the Video: 

the dvd was very good, just the typical r5 cleaning was needed.
sharpness,rgb,brightness and denoise.
got very nice in the end.
Quality approved
check extra long sample :P
enjoy
