Herbs and Nutrients for the Mind: A Guide to Natural Brain Enhancers

Two naturopaths introduce us to the world of brain biochemistry, translating the science into laymen's terms, so that the reader can understand the potential power of herbs and nutrients to enhance health, prevent disorders, and affect existing health disorders. These alternatives, or supplements, to medication are being used across the country to help treat health conditions with a psychological componentâ€”from ADHD and anorexia to insomnia, menopause, and Parkinson's Disease. 

Authors Meletis and Barker explain 18 of these conditions, and review the most current research into howâ€”or whetherâ€”the use of herbs and supplements has been proven to prevent, affect or remove these health conditions, or at least some of their symptoms. Can the Chinese herb Salvia curb cravings in alcoholics? Can niacin help treat anxiety? Other herbs, nutrients, and conditions addressed include the use of zinc to reduce symptoms of anorexia and bulimia, ginkgo biloba for Alzheimer's, and 5-HTP for depression. One appendix to this volume lists the top 20 brain-enhancing herbs and supplements. Another lists nutrient deficiencies and their links to health and brain function.

It is not the intent of this book to advocate for the replacement of standard drug therapy, but for the integration of these natural medicines with traditional medical treatments. Consumers are urged to discuss these herbs and nutrients with their physician before beginning use, as some allergic reactions or interactions with traditional medicines can occur. The central argument of this book is that when properly nourished people can operate at maximum physical and mental capacity, with maximum ability to fend off or recover from disease and disorder.

 In today's world, women have more power, legal recognition, and professional success than ever before. Alongside the evident progress of the women's movement, however, writer and journalist Naomi Wolf is troubled by a different kind of social control, which, she argues, may prove just as restrictive as the traditional image of homemaker and wife. It's the beauty myth, an obsession with physical perfection that traps the modern woman in an endless spiral of hope, self-consciousness, and self-hatred as she tries to fulfill society's impossible definition of "the flawless beauty." the beauty myth how images are used against women naomi wolf,
