Film-maker Patrick Forbes presents an in-depth study of the Wikileaks affair, which began when publisher and journalist Julian Assange launched a whistle-blowing website seemingly unafraid to publish classified governmental material. Interviews with Assange, his business partner Daniel Domscheit Berg and members of the editorial teams at the Guardian, Der Spiegel and New York Times provide an insight into how the acclaimed operation was brought to its knees when its founder was accused of rape and sexual assault in his homeland of Sweden. Narrated by Samuel West.
