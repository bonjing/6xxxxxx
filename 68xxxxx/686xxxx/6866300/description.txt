German audio with "fancy font - green century gothic" english subtitles ON as
well as German subs for turkish audio segments

This is a movie that is a sober wake-up call for all those that think a European
Union with diverse cultures would be anything but a continual "comdey of errors"
without a real humorous side despite the incessant pressures to break down barriers
to becoming absorbed into some other idea of existence as to what is the 
now advocated "new norm".

For those who wish to view with subtitles of other languages than English 
please download the other offering of this title we have posted here 
(as it uses external subtitles rather than hard coded ones as is the case here)
and please make your subtitles available to all if you would so that all can
benefit equally from the experience.
