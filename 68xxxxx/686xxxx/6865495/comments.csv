It worked for me, I played all night with my brother on both Survival and Mission modes, and he lives in another country, i just typed his IP address on my program and that\\\'s it, all I did was:

1) Port Forward 3074 as TCP
2) Port Forward 29184 as UDP
3) Run the Program \\\""TeknoMW3.exe\\\"" as Administrator
4) Open the \\\""readme.txt\\\"" file and read the instructions on how to use it.

Note:
By the way I ONLY TRIED IT WITH THE RELOADED VERSION AND IT WORKS PERFECTLY..."
