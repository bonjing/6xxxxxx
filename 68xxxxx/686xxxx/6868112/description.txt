The coal mine in a northern English village may be closing, which would
also mean the end of the miners' brass band.

          Brass Music performed by The Grimethorpe Colliery Band

NOTE: In the United States, United Kingdom, and South Africa, a coal mine
      and its structures are a "colliery". In Australia, "colliery"
      generally refers to an underground coal mine.
