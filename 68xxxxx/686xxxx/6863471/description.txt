Episode 5

Lund and Strange travel to Sweden to question and protect the only other surviving member of Raben's former army squad. But Raben himself is on the same mission. Having lost face with the prime minister, Buch is pressured into passing the much-negotiated anti-terrorism bill. Will he agree to the new draconian measures against his own better judgement? Top police brass and Special Branch interfere with the investigation, but Lund persists and has a breakthrough when she suddenly sees the case from a new angle.
