                   CTR Theme - The Ultimate AdSense Theme




CTR Theme (for Wordpress) makes it easy to build informational websites monetized with AdSense that get awesome click-through rates (CTR). AdSense provides hands-off recurring income, but usually these sites leave a lot of money on the table by having bad designs or underoptimized ad placement.




                               FEATURES



--- Google-Recommended Ad Placements

Google AdSense representatives occasionally contact high-earning websites to recommend ad placement improvements. CTR Theme implements the Google-recommended placements that have helped niche sites earn over $4,000 per month (and sell at auction for as much as $80,000).



--- Ad Randomization to Combat Ad Blindness

With a single click of the button, you can choose to randomize ad placements between the Google-recommended positions. That means every time a visitor comes to the site, the ad layout could be different. This minimizes "ad blindness" and results in improved click-through rates (CTR).



--- Fully Featured Admin Panel

No more messing around with theme files or hunting for the right plugin to place your AdSense code or adjust theme settings. CTR Theme's admin panel makes short work of these tasks.



--- Super Fast Load Times

CTR Theme is optimized to load super fast, helping to reduce visitor bounce rates. With site load time now being used as a ranking factor, you'll never have to worry about your site getting hit with a Google performance penalty.



--- Automatic Ad Hiding (Based on Referrer)

Don't want that DMOZ editor to see ads when they come to your site? Block dmoz-referred traffic from seeing ads. Get initial momentum at StumbleUpon by hiding ads, then display them when traffic is pouring in... you get the idea.



--- Multiple Subthemes to Choose From
