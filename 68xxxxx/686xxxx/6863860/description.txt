Just unzip this file, and copy it to your garmin device. No extra unlock work required!

No mexico in this one, looking forward to someone uploading a version that contains that too.

Can be copied directly to Oregon/62/78, or for Nuvi/60/eTrex series it must be renamed to GMAPSUPP.IMG or GMAPPROM.IMG.
