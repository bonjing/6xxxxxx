INTRO: First of all, let me thank you for downloading this map: note that this is still a beta version (and it will probably stay it).
It contains buildings, a fast food, several fountains, an area to park choppers, parking with parked cars, weapons to catch, Buyable weapons in ammu-nation, 3 new hidden packets, respawn places in the island if busted or wasted, some peds zone in only 2 islands of the 3 islands. (if not working replace the original path.ipl, map.zon and navig.zon). 

INSTALLATION: To install this map you must extract it then Move the following files:
to your GTA Vice City:
- gta-vc.exe

to maps:
- oceandrv
- oceandn
- Heaven_island
- path.ipl

to data:
- gta_vc.dat
- MAIN.SCM
- navig.zon
- map.zon

to TEXT:
- american.gxt

HOW TO GO TO THE ISLANDS:
- by boat: (I put it one near the headlight)
- By walk: Climb the rocks (watch your step, don\'t fall in water!)
- by car: Take the bridge (not far from the hotel)

Yay!When you done, lauch the game normally (begin a new game) and you can explore the islands... Have fun and have a good trip!
