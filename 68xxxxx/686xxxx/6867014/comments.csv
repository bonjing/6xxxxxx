ent or Vuze.
The old BitComet crap that you are using has been obsolete for years.


The exact same movie file you just uploaded has already been available for more than two months from this torrent:
https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6694883/Horrible_Bosses_2011_DVDRip_XviD-AMIABLE
It has more than 9000 seeders.
