My Little Pony Friendship is Magic S02E09 720p

Summary:
Rarity runs into the upper-crust of Canterlot and, by hanging out with them, becomes one of the popular ponies in the kingdom. She soon becomes distracted from preparing for Twilight Sparkle's birthday party, an event that she promised to attend to. Rarity, after a bit of thought, decides to attend the garden party. Rarity then writes a letter to Twilight, telling her that Opalescence had gotten sick, and therefore could not attend her birthday party. When Twilight's party is moved to Canterlot Castle, next to a fancy garden party she had just been invited to, Rarity must decide whether to continue her rising social status or stay loyal to her friends.
