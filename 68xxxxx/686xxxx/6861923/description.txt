Edmonton Rocks Vol. 1 is a 1997 compilation album featuring local Indie bands from the city of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. There's not much information on the web about this release and I don't know if a Vol. 2 was ever made. I picked it up at a small venue in 1997 when there was 2 or 3 local bands playing. Can't remember where it was.
