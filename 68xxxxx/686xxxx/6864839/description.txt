The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events.

The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.

On this LIVE Sunday edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex takes your calls and covers the spectrum of news, including fresh admissions that the Justice Department deceived Congress in their investigation of Operation Fast and Furious. All eyes are on Attorney General Eric Holder, who many believe deliberately issued false statements on when he first knew about the 'gunwalking' activities that resulted in the death of Border Agent Brian Terry. 

Also, Alex breaks down the false support for Newt Gingrich in the mainstream media, and the failure to suppress and silence Ron Paul, even as the Texas Congressman remains strong in Iowa polls only weeks out from the caucus that leads the 2012 GOP primary. The impact of the Senate declaring war on Americans via the recent passage of S. 1867, the National Defense Authorization Act, and its utterly destructive attitude towards the Constitution and Bill of Rights also remains key, along with so much other news.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
