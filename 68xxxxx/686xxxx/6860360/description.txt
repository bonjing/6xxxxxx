I was gonna let this one go. After all, this is the big disappointment of the new Quadrophenia box set: they provide a new mix of only 8 tracks instead of the whole album. How does that make any sense? Anyway, since you asked for it, here is the DVD. You can download the flac files or the ISO: your pick.
