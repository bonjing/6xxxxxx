The Last Design are a Melbourne Punk Rock band that incorporate blues, reggae and folk into their music.
Made up of three friends, in it for the good times and the plain and simple reason of playing music together, and getting to share that energy with other people.
They are politically and socially motivated with an old D.I.Y punk ethic, but still maintain having fun and don\'t get too caught up in the politics of it all.
