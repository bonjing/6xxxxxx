This is the last of my :20 Minute Workout uploads.  These AVI files are much higher quality than the last batch, aiming for the best compromise possible between quality and torrent size.  Obviously the DVD set will be the best quality, but these come pretty close.  Each file is approximately 350 MB; the entire torrent is 10.2 GB.

The AVI files are XVID and AC3 encoded.  That means you\'ll need the appropriate codecs installed to see the XVID video and hear the AC3 audio.  You can download them here:

XVID - http://www.xvid.org
AC3 - http://ac3filter.net
AC3 plugin for Winamp - http://www.winamp.com/plugin/winampac3/221648


The only thing I ask in return for these uploads is that you share them as much as you can on other bittorrent sites, or through whatever means online you feel most comfortable with.  DO NOT SELL THEM.  It\'s monster bad karma to make money off of someone else\'s work without their permission or paying them royalties, and now that it\'s out there for free, it\'s going to stay out there for free.  Why go through the hassle?

Thanks to all the uploaders here at TPB and other sites from whom I\'ve downloaded gigs on gigs of freebies.  Enjoy this meager token of appreciation.
