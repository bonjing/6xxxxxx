WORKDONE:

Right lets get the readnfo resoning out the way.....firstly the video is the same,but the file given was different and higher Q.
But sadly has been watermarked with cinetux url,not all the time but now and again through the film ...guess around 3-4 times.
Some without comparing will same say same as the others ....but thats because their brain dead and ain't looking properly or comparing
and only going off screenies ....which never tell the full story anyways.

On to workdone....well the video was 720 x 480 avi file with a framerate of 25,which is a massive NO NO.Also there was that crap intro again 
added,which as nothing to do with the film and also there is one big camera movement around 28mins in.
the first 28mins had black borders on left and right and then it changes and you get them at the top and bottom.
So firstly cut the film into 2 ...removed the intro rubbish and made a script for the first part.And then again for the 2nd part.
Now both contained the same lines ...heavy noise filter,brightness,contrast,rgb eq,sharpness etc...only difference was the cropping,had to keep
one AR so it might change slightly and also opted for a different res ...2.251 which is super widescreen.
IMHO ....this looks the best video to date,you can tell when playing it,it does break up as much as the other one.

Audio ....just wow,for a cam its one of the best cam audio i've heard ....hell i could almost call it line.
No remastering needed...only thing done was resync it as my old synced audio didn't fit right. 
Check sample for Q
