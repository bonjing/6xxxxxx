The Frank and Chris show was a live, call in, internet talk show that was broadcast on talkshoe between May 2008 and June 2010.

They talk about current events and try to make sense out of the madness in this world from a Biblical perspective.

I broke the show notes up by episode and also include them all in one file so you can search a topic or particular call in guest and jump to a show that is of interest.

I did the best I could creating show notes considering I was at work the whole time I was working on this.  Sorry about mis-spellings and missing info but I did the best I could.

I hope you enjoy.  I know the Frank and Chris show was a special time for a lot of people in the history of the Revelations Radio Network.
