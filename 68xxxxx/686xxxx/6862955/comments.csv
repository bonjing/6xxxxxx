After you reach the point when the black loading screen comes,just exit the game.
Go to,C:Program FilesBatman Arkham CityBmGame
Here you will find a folder named ""MoviesStereo"".
Change the name to ""MoviesStero123"".
Play the game.The loading screen should now skip right to the next scene where Batman is fallen on the ground.Watch the cutscene.Exit the game again AFTER the cutscene is over.Go to that BmGame folder and rename ""MoviesStereo123"" to ""MoviesStereo"".
Now play like a DAWG. :D
Note: You will have to repeat the entire procedure everytime u start a new game and reach that load screen."
