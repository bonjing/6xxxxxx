Today, biblical archaeologists and scholars rub shoulders with scientists. They re all scouring the globe for the most elusive and controversial goal in biblical research, to find out whether or not the stories of the Bible are based on real events.


1)  Noah 
- It is perhaps the best-known story in the Bible a righteous man named Noah, who built an ark and survived a flood. At first glance, it seems like a simple story but what happened or didn't happen to Noah is raising questions: in geology, in astronomy, even in global imaging. They start with the most basic question of all: did it really happen?

2)  Cain and Abel 
- Follow archaeologists as they investigate the beginning of recorded time from inside Egyptian tombs in a quest to decipher a story that s even more difficult to decode than hieroglyphics a brief but timeless narrative of one brother's bloodshed that s puzzled biblical scholars for centuries.

3)  Exodus Revealed 
- This is the Book of Exodus, the story of Moses, the enslaved Israelites, ten terrible plagues and the epic parting of the Red Sea. Explore the possible causes between these events and investigate ecological theories that demonstrate how they might have been locked together in a web of cause and effect.

4)  The Secrets of Revelation 
- Perhaps the most controversial and influential book in the Bible, it claims to be prophetic visions given by an angel. Commanding the lives of millions of Christians today, the book inspires hope in people who believe it foretells God s ultimate triumph over evil. It is filled with harrowing imagery of unimaginable death and destruction. What is it about this text that inspires such vehement convictions?
