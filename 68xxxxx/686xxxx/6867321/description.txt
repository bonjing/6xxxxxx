[/b][/color] Proving that layovers are opportunities for travelers to mingle with locals, crash parties, dine on local cuisine, and explore cultures, this new weekly series gives No Reservations' foodie-traveler extraordinaire Anthony Bourdain just 24-48 hours to hit the "must see" places, people and foods.
 From New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami to Hong Kong, Singapore, London, Rome, Montreal and Amsterdam, he will provide viewers with insider tips that only the most seasoned travelers would know.
