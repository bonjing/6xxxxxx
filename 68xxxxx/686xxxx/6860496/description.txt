Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Friday edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with author and journalist Nomi Prins. She is a former managing director of Goldman Sachs and a Bears Stearns analyst. On December 1, she wrote forabout the Federal Reserve's continuation of bailout economics and protecting US mega-banks from losses incurred by European banks through derivatives. Prins is the author of It Takes a Pillage: Behind the Bonuses, Bailouts, and Backroom Deals from Washington to Wall Street. 

Alex also talks about economic issues with regular Friday guest Bob Chapman, publisher of the International Forecaster. 


I am including in this torrent the most recent issue of Chapman's The International Forecaster [via rdubya at ConCen].

Nomi Prins is a terrific writer. Please enjoy these two recent articles by her.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
