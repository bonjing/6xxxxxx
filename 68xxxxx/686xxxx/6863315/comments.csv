Would you happen to have the A A Fair novels of long ago? (Earle Stanley Gardner's #1 alias.) A very fun mystery series - and very different from Mason - with Donald Lam and Bertha ""Fry Me For An Oyster"" Cool.  I two really huge fiction packs here there were just two of them, which is hard to understand, given all the Perry Masons available here."
