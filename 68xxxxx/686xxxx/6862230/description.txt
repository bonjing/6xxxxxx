Anti-Clock is a 1979 film written and directed by Jane Arden and co-directed Jack Bond. The film, which stars Arden's son Sebastian Saville, was shot on film and video in colour and black and white sequences. It opened the 1979 London Film Festival, but was never picked up for British distribution: its only other public British screening was at the National Film Theatre in 1983 as a tribute to Jane Arden, who committed suicide at the end of the previous year. However, it had a modest theatrical release in the US, where it received considerable critical acclaim.


'A complex and fascinating experimental exploration of time and identity. 'Anti-Clock' is a film of authentic, startling originality. Brilliantly mixing cinema and video techniques, Arden and Bond have created a movie that captures the anxiety and sense of danger that has infiltrated the consciousness of so many people in western society. Filled with high tension and high intelligence, Anti-Clock is mysterious, disturbing, fascinating and exciting'. (Jack Kroll, Newsweek).
