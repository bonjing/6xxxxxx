This is configured default engine.ini file by myself with minimal loss of image quality. Game now runs much better on highest settings, only v sync, AA, physics is turned off. My specs cpu intel dual core 2ghz, gpu nvidia geforce 8600 gt 256 mb ddr3, 2gb ram, os win7. Just copy default engine.ini in your batman-bm game-config. And first backup your original file.
