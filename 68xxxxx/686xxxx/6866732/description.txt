                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Part one of two. An investigation into why one million houses lie empty, even 
 though the UK is enduring its worst housing crisis since the Second World War.
 Presenter George Clarke argues refurbishing the properties would be a cheaper 
 and quicker option than building new ones, thus providing suitable            
 accommodation for the country's homeless. Clarke meets a woman and her young  
 children who have been moved 10 times in 13 years. Part of the Great British  
 Property Scandal season.                                                      
                                 Enjoy!
