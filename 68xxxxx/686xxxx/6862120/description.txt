DX Ball 1 And 2

Part 1 is full game while part 2 is demo.

In part 2 you have unlimited play but only a few levels are accessible from different sections.

Whereas part 1 is like 1 big game where everything is accessible.

High scores can be recorded in both parts 1 and 2

These games were scanned and no viruses were found.

To play the games just copy your downloaded folders to 'my documents' and open each folder. you would see dxball.exe right click and send to desktop. on your desktop just open the shortcut and play. do the same for part 2.

NO NEED TO INSTALL, JUST COPY, CREATE SHORTCUT AND PLAY!!
