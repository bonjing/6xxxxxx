2010 two CD live release from the American rockers. The Derek Trucks Band is a six-piece group with a 16 year legacy of relentless touring; always believing in building the machine the old fashioned way: one fan at a time. Their concerts have evolved into consistent, rafter-raising events, filled with soulful jams and Gospel-revival intensity, highlighted by Trucks' dazzling, daring guitar solos. Roadsongs captures the DTB in their full, cathartic glory and promises to expand their audience and draw greater attention to the group... and Trucks himself!
