"The Shepherd"

David - aka John Doe - must choose between 
staying with Kathryn or leaving her to be with 
Mary Margaret, with whom he's fallen deeply, and 
inexplicably, in love; and Emma catches Sheriff 
Graham in a lie. Meanwhile, back in the 
fairytale world that was, Prince Charming is 
about to encounter a life-changing event that 
will forever alter his destiny.

Evolve... or die.
