Complete.Idiots.Guide.To.Amazing.Sex

Amazing sex! Wouldn't you love to have it all the time?! Well, you can! To help you have
amazing sex, you need sex education. I don't mean that you need a boring lecture about how
the sperm fertilizes the egg, like you probably heard in your high school health class. There's
much more to sex education than that. The kind of sex ed you'll get from this book is about all
the pleasures and variations you can add to your sex life. The more you know, the better a lover
you will become.
Sex is not like riding a bike. Sure the same old balancing act that you learned as a kid still
works just fine years later when all you have to do is pedal to the store and back. But when it
comes to sex, it's a whole new balancing act every time you hop on for a ride. It's possible to
experience new things every time you do it. So it sure makes sense to learn what all those new
things are, doesn't it, darling? On the metaphorical bike ride of your sex life, it's a good idea to
push hard on the uphill side, glide freely on the downhill side, pop a few wheelies, and safely
enjoy the ride..............
