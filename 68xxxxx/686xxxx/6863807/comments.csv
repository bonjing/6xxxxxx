xactly where FSX was and for that you get FSX+ with support and development for the future.  Porting FSX stuff can be a pain, and certain developers are refusing to support it at all (for now) but it is poised to be the FSX replacement we've all been waiting for!  Also, 3 serious updates in the past 4 months is quite a bit better than what we got in M$ and FSX days..."
