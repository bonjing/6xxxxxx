All you have to do is click on ""create new torrent"" on your torrent page and the rest is self-explanatory. You can always use help/about, search Google or go to your torrent clients home page. Yeah, I hate reading directions too but in this case only a moron will need them:) Good luck!!  ..................................................................and THANKS eztv!!"
