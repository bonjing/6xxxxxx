Yea, I know I've been TRYing to Kill The 1-CD Rip ever since I returned to torrents around a Year ago. But for some insane reason, I decided to prove I'm not as good as I once was, but I'm as good once, as I ever was.

Since Nobody ever bothers to leave a comment after downloading one of my Rips, I'm Not bothering to leave a description.

Download This One if You want to remember what a Real 1-CD Rip looks like, or download a different copy. Makes Me no difference. I'm in Too Much Extreme Pain to give a Crap.
