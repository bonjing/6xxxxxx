This is the complete movie without the black bars (I cropped those away) in 16:9 or 1.77:1 aspect ratio. Video format is .mpg and video bit-rate is ~6000 kbps with 2 channel audio at 320 kbps. It's pretty good quality, IMO. 

My upload speed is slow so if you can be patient and have the time (couple of days), download it (speed will increase, of course, once a few people have downloaded this completely and if they seed too). If you love this movie and want to watch the entire thing on your HDTV in full screen (i.e. without those damned black bars, this torrent is for you).

Also note, the parts of the movie that were already without the black bars (such as the first scene with the bank heist) have not been cropped (hence the reason the file is cut in seven parts). And the resolution is little more than 720p (it's exactly: 774p (1376 x 774))

Pro Tip: Download 1_The.Dark.Knight.2008.mpg at first (because it's smaller size), watch it and, based on that, if you like how things are, download it all then. The intro to the movie is with the black bars elsewhere but I've cropped it here so that it fills the entire screen and you'll get the feel of how the entire movie is going to be.

Any questions? Ask in the comments. Will try to answer.
Enjoy... and seed, please.
