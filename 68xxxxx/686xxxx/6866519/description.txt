Decca was a fairly wide-ranging label whose trademark sound was a strain of commercially palpable hillbilly pop perfected by producer (and, beginning in 1958, label head) Owen Bradley. These three discs offer an assortment of stars (Patsy Cline, Buddy Holly, Bill Monroe, Loretta Lynn), subordinates, and the uncelebrated. The latter, in fact, are what makes this box stand out. A great deal of the fun comes from antiquated time pieces like Johnny Wright\'s \"Hello Vietnam\" (\"I hope the world will come to learn/That fires we don\'t put out will bigger burn\") or that master of the hayseed soliloquy Red Sovine\'s \"If Jesus Came to Your House\" (\"Would you have to change your clothes before you let him in?/Or hide some magazines and put the Bible where they\'d been?\"). Overall, From The Vaults serves as an evocative sampler of what a rural jukebox was playing when Gunsmoke ruled the tube.
