"We are Charlie Chaplin (Panama City, Panama)"

The final four teams travel to Panama City, 
Panama, where they face their fear of heights 
during a challenge.

(Rules are unclear if a show such as this would
be 'reality' or 'competitive reality'. Due to
this being a literal race involving lots of
running and high motion we went with 
'competitive'.

22/Slower
Evolve...or die.

Enjoy :)
