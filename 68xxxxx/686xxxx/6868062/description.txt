      PLOT SUMMARY     : In ancient Japan, a woman is raped and her 
                         husband killed. The film gives us four viewpoints 
                         of the incident - one for each defendant - each 
                         revealing a little more detail. Which version, 
                         if any, is the real truth about what happened ?

      RELEASE NOTES : More presents from our belated 4th birthday. A bunch
                      of Akira Kurosawa films featuring Toshir Mifune.
                      Here's Rashomon, a crime drama where the viewer is
                      left to decide the "truth" of the crime for 
                      themselves. It is a very thought provoking and 
                      captivating film. Another testament to Kurosawa's
                      brilliance. Enjoy!

         SChiZO is one of the longest living MPEG-4 release groups in
         the scene. Since our inception in March of 2001 we have been
         catering to the needs of DivX & XviD enthusiasts everywhere
         by releasing high-quality DVDRips of the finest films and 
         television shows from around the world.

         We also strive to keep on the cutting edge of new developments 
         in the MPEG-4 scene and applying them within the constraints of
         the existing scene rules. Our XviD settings are chosen in an 
         attempt to create the best compromise between quality and 
         compatibility. In pursuit of that goal, we have decided at that
         this time we will avoid the use of QPel and GMC. As well, when 
         using Custom Mpeg Quantization matrices, we will try to make
         sure that such matrices will be compatible with as many decoders 
         as possible. We are also now using Packed Bitstream in our
         encodes.  With the development of MPEG4Modifier, it is now a 
         simple matter to remove the packed bitstream for those whom PB 
         causes a playback issue. Please make sure to unpack the bitstream 
         and remove the DivX999b000p UserData. Please make sure to update 
         your own decoders if any trouble arises.

         We are currently looking for 100Mbit+ Classic DivX/XviD sites
         in Europe and Asia for affiliation. We are also looking for
         experienced XviD rippers with their own DVD Supply.
