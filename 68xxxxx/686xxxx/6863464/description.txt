THE DARK SIDE OF DISNEY reveals all of the tips, tricks, scams, and stories that THEY don-t want you to know about! Unabashedly unafraid of offending the family-oriented audiences catered to by other Disney travel guides, author Leonard Kinsey gives intrepid travelers access to the seamy, raunchy, and often hilarious underbelly of Walt Disney World. From cautionary tales of scoring illegal tickets, to thrilling accounts of exploring off-limits areas, to chronicles of drug-induced debauchery, this completely unauthorized guidebook will change the way you think about vacationing at -The Happiest Place on Earth-. "Pack the trunks and leave the kids at Grandma's because THE DARK SIDE is about to make your next Disney vacation the best one ever!" -Chris Mitchell, author of CAST MEMBER CONFIDENTIAL
