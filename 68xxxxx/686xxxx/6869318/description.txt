Angane Thudangi, is a 2011 romantic comedy film written and directed by Nandini Reddy under Sri Ranjith Movies banner. Angane Thudangi begins with an accident. Gautham (Nani) is abducted by John Abraham (Ashish Vidyarthi). On the way Gautham is forced to narrate his tale as Gautham talks of stopping a marriage and John too talks of preventing a wedding. Hence, the flashback. Gautham (Nani) is ready to propose to Simran (Kriti Kharbanda) with a bunch of red roses. But destiny has other plans. Elsewhere, Nithya (Nitya Menon) is playing cricket and hits Gautham with her shot. He is then taken to the hospital in the stretcher. Here there is a twist. Simran falls in love with the doctor treating Nani and they get married in six months. Gautham goes to the wedding but cannot face Simran. When he walks out, he gets drunk and meets a drunk Nithya who actually was in love with the doctor. Later on, Gautham accompanies her everywhere. He realises he is in love with her. But it is not as simple as it seems. She is in love with someone else. The process takes a twisted and curvy route. And the audience goes on that bouncy ride too.
