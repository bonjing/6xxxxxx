at some stage your PS3 was updated and infected with Cinavia detection.
The short answer is don't use a PS3 for playback (some Bluray players have it also though). I don't know how you'd go about verifying which Bluray discs (and therefore the encodes as Cinavia is buried in the audio stream) are infected with Cinavia. Google may help."
