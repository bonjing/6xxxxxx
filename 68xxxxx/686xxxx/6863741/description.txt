Paris, France 1999
Date: 99-03-22
Venue: Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy

Recording: AUD
Quality: 8
Menu: NO 
Comments:  Single cam on the balcony, extreme stage right. Decent shooting for the most part but it's just a bit shaky on closeups (although some closeups are excellent) and the filmer misses the focus a bit here and there. Picture quality is hazy and lacking in detail and color. This could stand to "lose a few gens". Audio is muffled but the vocals all come through nicely.
