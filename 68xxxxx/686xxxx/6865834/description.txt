Delicate, haunting and heartbreaking are just a few of the words that have been used to describe the music of Jonny Kearney and Lucy Farrell. The Newcastle-based duo, who have just released their first EP, met while studying folk and traditional music at Newcastle University. Jonny won a prize for his song-writing while there, and most of the material they perform together is their own. They have supported The Unthanks on tour and look set for a bright future.
