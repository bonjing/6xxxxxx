The More than Complete DC-Now More Completerer!

This forty-ninth alphabetical installment is: DC from V-Wg

What's This?
     It's a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and M.C. Gaines among others.
       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those "Pre-DC" comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC super-heroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heroes are Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and among many others. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will be some "Post DC" comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c.875-885gb in total. It will take as long as it takes, but it's nearly done I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.

=================================

Projected remaining torrents start and stop letters and approximate size

Several of these still have significant work needed and the size could go up or down. For example this one is 1gb less than was before final sorting. I'm betting on down for the last 3, though they continue to grow for now. All the cutting will occur when I sort through them after #53. 

 17g 50 Wh-Wom
 14g 51 Won - Wonder Woman, Wonder Girl
 16g 52 Woo-Wz
 14g 53 X-Z
 19g 54 Fill Torent a-c
 17g 55 Fill Torent d-j
 17g 56 Fill Torent k-z

Time is short today. Sorry to the fans of my ramblings but "no fun for you!"
