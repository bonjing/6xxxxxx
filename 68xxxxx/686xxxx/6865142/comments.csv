ums at ÂµTorrent to check that there are MAJOR problems as of now.
You might be a lucky or knowledgable user, but hundreds aren't, therefore this upLoad.

And one last note: its NOT at all in the www style to PREVENT people to choose the version of the software they use. *Torrent has made a very preoccupying decision in infringing that rule.
IMHO, they are just paving the way for a PAYING version full of useless add-ons ."
