                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Have I Got News For You is a half hour BBC programme that takes a satirical look 
 at the weeks news. Regular Team Captains are Ian Hislop and Paul Merton, with 
 Angus Deayton as host. Since Angus Deayton got fired the programme has had 
 alternating hosts, which proved to be just as successful by raising viewing 
 figures by a million.
                                 
                                 Enjoy!
