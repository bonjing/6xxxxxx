For your digital backup convenience, I have for you a collection of both Audio and eBooks in PDF format of Angie Sage Septimus Heap series. Books one through six have been included in this upload.

Originally I was going to include a summary of each book in this description. However, I have decided not to spoil this excellent story line for any readers. Instead below you will find links to Wikipedia for each as well as a general coverage of the entire series & the author Angie Sage.
