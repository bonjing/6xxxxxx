.....other notes:

Ripped from the original DVD; playable on most mobile devices.

Alot of testing went into this DVD movie, considering it's originally made in 1959, I can honestly say, I have finally nailed it - BullsEye!

I wanted to perfect the quality just a little bit more, so members of TPB can enjoy Sleeping Beauty (1959) 50th Anniversary.

I sincerely hope you have some time to post your feedback related to audio and video quality.
...thank you!!  

Please seed as much as you can, and if possible leave rating/comment on quality.
It means a lot.
