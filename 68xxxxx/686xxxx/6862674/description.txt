This is a test for the next planned step for Office 2010 Toolkit. It is my plan to eventually phase out Office 2010 Toolkit for a new application, that is currently under development. App is stable as it is still well tested code in almost all cases, but I'm looking for new ideas, suggestions, and testing of new functions.

Bugs/Quirks/Incompleteness
-Almost all EZ-Activator settings apply only to office.
-Readme is currently inconsistent but generally applies to windows the same as office.
-I plan to add more Windows stuff but would like some ideas and want to get this out early in the development stage. A BETA of mine is usually just bug testing and last minute feature additions.
-Currently using OTK changelog/Readme.

Ideas
-I would like to add OEM abilities of some sort, so as to bring back the License tab when under windows. Perhaps with permission EZ-Activator could trigger a Windows Loader installation for OS that cannot use KMS activation but either have a BIOS with SLIC or just run the loader (Have to ask Daz about this).
-Possibly create a Windows AutoRearm equivalent, rather unlikely as if a PE boot is required then it would just be another IR5, the other known way is PMR method.

Microsoft Toolkit Changelog: 

BETA 8
-Added Permissions Fix during a Restore and Improved Office Rearm Check Success Rate
-Added Program Update Check on Startup
-Added support for UDF Office ISO's
-Added Functions to directly Check and Show Keys in the DigitalProductID.
-Channel Changing does patching via code instead of using xdelta3.exe and no longer needs to write patches to disk
-Customize Setup disables channel change button if setup.exe is not from Office 2010, so you can use it to integrate Office 2007 Updates/Languages.
-Enhanced error checking/messages on KMSEmulator failure.
-Fix MAK Activation Count always failing
-Fix Restoration of Phone Activation ending up in grace
-Fixed Scheduled Tasks not running as SYSTEM
-KMS PID is set before start instead of editing process memory when using manual Activation
-Preliminary Windows 8 Key Decoding
-Removed options and unnecessary fixes from EZ-Activator
-Scheduled tasks now keep the last run time and result
-Timing of Activation Restore
-Updating Settings or PID via EZ-Activator will update AutoKMS/AutoRearm. 
This is because changing settings but not the EXE could cause a INI mismatch so AutoKMS/AutoRearm would revert to default settings.
-Using ReSharper for automatic code refactoring

Alpha 1 R7
-Fixed checks that disable functions

Alpha 1 R6
-Fixed Scheduled task install failure.

Alpha 1 R5
-Added IR5 detection
-Added MultiKMS
-Added Office/Windows Product detection in Main tab
-AutoKMS and AutoRearm show their version in the log
-Backups are sorted by OS/Office and show up as a list. Move old backups to new folders to use them.
-Can install AutoRearm alongside AutoKMS, allowing AutoRearm to be a failsafe.
-CMID change and Office Repair disabled by default in EZ-Activator. If the PID fix doesn't work you probably have an issue that these won't help.
-Disable and check Save/Restore keys in Windows since Windows backup needs this.
-Fix tokens permissions on restore in case of bad permissions.
-Key Checker doesn't require Office or Windows Vista+ to use.
-Key Checker gets remaining MAK count if a MAK is checked. Requires Internet connection or will not work.
-Key Checker is a bit faster.

-UI changed on CID/Key Prompt boxes.
-Various improvements, bugfixes, and techniques to optimize the apps and minimize AV false positives.
