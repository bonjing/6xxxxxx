Britain 2007, bryant (sean bean) arrives back in britain from iraq. The soldier finds a country he no longer recognises; violent crime, drugs, rape and murder rule the streets. He decides enough-is-enough, it's time to fight back. Soon a small group of men gravitate to him and his cause, and together they take the law into there own hands. Their aim, to punish the guilty with violence.........                               ENJOY!!!
