Plot:
-----
While vacationing in Haiti with his wife Grace (Anita Strindberg), 
Fred Wright (Gabriel Tinti) decides to make an impromptu visit on 
an old friend, Williams (Anthony Steffen), a doctor.Fred's motives 
are not entirely pure, however, with it soon emerging that he is one 
of various parties interested in a new wonder drug that Williams has 
developed, some of whom will stop at nothing - including murder - 
to secure it for themselves. (Genre fans may be reminded of the plot 
of Bava's Five Dolls for an August Moon in this regard, with the brightly 
coloured visuals and Piero Umiliani's not dissimilar lounge score reinforcing 
this intertextual connection.)The first complication is that the idealistic 
Williams appears to have no interest in selling the drug, regardless of the 
price...The second complication is that the drug, the sample of which has 
gone missing, may in any case also have potentially fatal side effects for 
those who take it, with one of Williams's native assistants turning up dead
soon afterwards, his blood being almost like water in its appearance and 
chemical composition...Although showcasing a number of characteristic giallo
themes, being bookended by the arrival and departure of a Pan Am jet and 
featuring the obligatory unidentified black gloved killer (or killers) working
their way through a swathe of victims, the gloves admittedly somewhat 
incongruous in the tropical setting, Death in Haiti AKA Tropic of Cancer 
offsets such routine elements thanks to its atypical setting (rum rather 
than J&B being the drink of choice) and the inclusion of some documentary 
style footage of cockfighting, a slaughterhouse and voodoo rituals.

Trama:
------
Il dottor Williams medico in un ospedale di Port-au-Prince (Haiti), ha 
scoperto un allucinogeno dotato di un forte potere erotico. Alla sua 
formula che lo scienziato tiene rigorosamente segreta e che non vuole 
cedere a nessun prezzo sono interessati l'industriale Peacock e il suo 
socio Garner, un altro uomo d'affari (Mr. Prater) col suo braccio destro 
Murdock e infine, un amico di Williams, Fred Wright, giunto ad Haiti 
con sua moglie Grace.
