New band I discovered that i absolutely adore. If you like Make A Change... Kill Yourself You will love this. There are many discographies for this band but i never understood why none had the split The Bitter Taste Of Life or those discography torrents that were created in 2011 but don\\\'t even have The First Step Towards Suicide. Hence The Torrent.
