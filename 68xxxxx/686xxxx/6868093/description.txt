When Bruce finally returns for good, he wears a sturdier (made of Kevlar), darker Batsuit (quite similar to the costume of the Tim Burton Batman movies), and drives a new, state-of-the-art Batmobile. He again fights Colonel Vega, KGBeast, and Dark Rider, in order to foil a plot to nuke Gotham City with a device the size and shape of a baseball.
