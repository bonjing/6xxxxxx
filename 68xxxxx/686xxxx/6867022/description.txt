Storyline:


God Bless Ozzy Osbourne is the first rock documentary to tell the story of a major icon's torturous and emotionally fraught journey to sobriety, which Ozzy regards as his greatest accomplishment. Featuring interviews with his brothers and sisters, as well as Jack, Sharon, Aimee and Kelly Osbourne, God Bless Ozzy Osbourne is a film about the intoxicating rush of success and the redemption that comes from pulling away from the very thing that made you successful.

Featuring never-before-seen footage uncovered from the archives and interviews with Tommy Lee, Henry Rollins and others, God Bless Ozzy Osbourne is the first documentary to take viewers inside the mind and psyche of a legendary and timeless cultural figure.
