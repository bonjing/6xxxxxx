ReleaseNotes:

2011 album from the Canadian hard rockers. Produced by Nickelback and recorded at Mountain View Studios, Vancouver, BC, Here and Now is Nickelback s seventh studio record and is the follow up to 2008 s widely successful Dark Horse which has been certified three-times platinum. "When you listen to this record, it sounds like it could be from four different artists," says Chad Kroeger. "We always try and do the same thing: We try to do something heavier than we've ever done, more melodic than we've ever done, every single time we do this, and I think we've achieved it again."

We rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.
HHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)
