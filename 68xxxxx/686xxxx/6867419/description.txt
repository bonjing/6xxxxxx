[color=red][size=4]
A young Brooklyn boy witnesses the brutal murder of his mother and grows up obsessed with finding her killer. 
Thus begins his life as a quiet, straight-A student by day and a self-appointed hero at night. But what is a
 real hero? And who decides what is right or wrong? As the boundaries blur, Sean's dual life wears on his 
psyche and his two worlds careen dangerously close to colliding. Like a graphic novel you can't put down, Boy 
Wonder challenges morality, distorting perceptions of what is right and what is justified, as it races to its 
shocking conclusion. [/size][/color]
