The music got more body, but kept the depth and subtlety which was so intertwined with the Mirna's Fling sound. In 2011 the band started recording their debut album for The Good Hand and will be released the 24th of September on the record label Minstrel Music. So if you're a rock lover The Good Hand's self-titled album is a must-have. The range of influences and joy for performing is a guaranty for a vivid live show that will leave you wanting more!
