Description:
The four remaining acts perform two songs each as they
battle it out for a place in the final and the chance to win
a recording contract. As usual, they are hoping to gain
praise from Gary Barlow, Kelly Rowland, Tulisa
Contostavlos and Louis Walsh, but their fate is in the
hands of the public, whose votes alone decide the line
up for next week's show - which will be held in front of
10,000 fans at Wembley Arena. Dermot O'Leary deals
with the war of words as the judges voice their opinions
after each performance
