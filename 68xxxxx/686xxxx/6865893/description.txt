Ali Farka Toure  Savane
Released: 2006
Label: World Circuit / Nonesuch 
Format: Mp3@320

Whenever a final album is released after the death of a great performer, it is often reviewed far more kindly than it might have been had the artist still been alive. There is no such problem with Ali Farka TourÃ©'s Savane. There may be other recordings of his that have yet to be released (including sessions with the world's finest kora player, Toumani DiabatÃ©, recorded at the time of their memorable concert together at the Barbican last year), but this is the last solo album by the best-known and best-loved guitarist in Africa, and it's simply outstanding. He described it as "my best album evera" and he was absolutely right. Even compared to the much-praised earlier work by Mali's "godfather of the desert blues", this is a set that's remarkable for its sheer variety and passion, along with the expected but still thrilling guitar work, and some less predictably fine vocals.
