It downloaded fine though it only had 1 seed last night and took most of the night to download.  Seems to play fine, though I haven't watched it all the way through yet.  Just from skipping around to different parts, I did spot one place (around 24:50 during ""Angel of Music"" in the part 1), where there's a small skip, but it's nothing major."
