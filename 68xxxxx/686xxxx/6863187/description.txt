Swami Karmayogini is a qualified and experienced physiotherapist and teacher in the Satyananda Yoga tradition. While these CDs have been created primarily for students of the Satyananda Yoga Academy's Yogic Studies / Yoga Teacher Training courses, the simple yoga practices of Yoga Nidra (relaxation) and asanas (yoga postures), taught with an anatomy and physiology theme, are a great aid to learning for all students of yoga and of anatomy and physiology in general. The practices included are:

Using deep relaxation to accelerate learning musculo-skeletal anatomy:

1. Skeletal Yoga Nidra
2. Muscles Yoga Nidra

A guided practice of simple yoga postures and breathing practices to facilitate learning musculo-skeletal physiology naturally:

3. Muscles and Bones In Action
