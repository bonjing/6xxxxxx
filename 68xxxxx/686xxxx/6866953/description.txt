"Cuffed"

When Castle and Beckett wake up in bed, 
handcuffed together, in a locked room with 
no memory of how they got there, they must 
piece together the mystery of where they 
are and why, all while trying to escape. 
But as the two of them adjust to being 
shackled together, what's the biggest 
threat they face... the people who 
abducted them or each other? Meanwhile, 
Ryan, Esposito and Gates are left to 
investigate their disappearance in a case 
where all is not what it seems.

18/Slower
Evolve...or die.

Enjoy :)
