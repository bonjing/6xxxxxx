And the guy swearing at Orbit_u and then saying ""please upload a rip"" - you really think being abusive to someone and then asking them a favour they don't owe you is really the way to go? You just make yourself look like the idiot you are.
I keep somehow coming back to this torrent in my searches but hopefully I'll find the right copy I'm after and not come back here again after this post. Mind you I've watched this copy and can't say the film itself was any good (quality of the copy is what you'd expect for a TS).... but that doesn't matter since others will probably like it.
This torrent delivers exactly what it says in the title."
en done a lot better. 
Don't bite the hand that feeds you and don't piss off an uploader doing you a favour you idiots; they may not bother doing you anymore favours in future. They don't owe you anything of any quality. Just post polite comments on the quality in future so we don't have to see your filth - ESPECIALLY on a torrent that is for a CHILDREN'S movie. Very well done on adding filth to something that was innocent. And people wonder why children have no manners these days...
This is a public board so assume that children can see what you post - and act accordingly."
