The story of a western movie actor (Johnny Dust) still trying to make it big in a western film studio and theme park, when a â€˜new management teamâ€™ takes over the park and turns the film studio into a fright-fest for the month of Halloween. Haunted by the image of his dead western movie hero, who appears to him on the little screen, Johnny unravels the real intent of management and its opening night â€™spectacularâ€™, which takes place in the depths of the parkâ€™s cave.
