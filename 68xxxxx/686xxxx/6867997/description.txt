Due to the high number of leechers and low number of seeders on other torrents, i have divided the files into seasons and uploaded torrents as such. I have "borrowed" from hifi2005. All files are in perfect working order and are very good rips.


98%  are dvd rips   which ive collected around   news groups
so i take no credit  for these
theres only a few tv rips  but  are good rips
 
please seed after download as this fantastic series appears to be very hard to get a hold of. 

All files are of AVI format.
