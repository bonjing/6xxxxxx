The.Colbert.Report.2011.12.05.Jimmie.Johnson.HDTV.iTunes.m4v

This is a compressed HDTV version of The Colbert Report that is compatible with the Apple iTunes application, making it easier for me to keep a collection. The quality is surprisingly good for 100mb.

I will keep releasing these as long as people keep downloading/seeding.

You can change the extension from .m4v to .mp4 if you wish, it makes no difference except that it doesn't load into iTunes automatically.




Converted with Handbrake (2-pass) MP4 H.264 /w ACC Audio @ 128bps
