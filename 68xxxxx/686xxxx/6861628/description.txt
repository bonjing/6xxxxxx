Introduction to International Disaster Management, Second Edition continues to serve as the sole comprehensive overview of global emergency management. This second edition contains updated information on disaster trends as well as on management structures and advancements around the world.

Coppola includes changes that reflect the dual theme of the book: universal principles of global emergency management practice and advances in the field worldwide, and lessons from disasters and other watershed events that have occurred since the first edition was published. This text includes new case studies and updated disaster, risk, and vulnerability data, as well as insightful discussions of recent national and international initiatives, and of progress towards improving non-governmental organization (NGO) and private sector cooperation and professionalism. This text approaches the practice of emergency management from a global perspective, making it the only introductory book without bias towards the emergency management system or history of a single country or region.
