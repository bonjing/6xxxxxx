Scuola di polizia 4 - Cittadini... in guardia Ã¨ il quarto capitolo della fortunata serie di film comici ambientati nel mondo dei poliziotti statunitensi.

Nonostante il ritorno di Harris, ormai diventato capitano, il comandante Lassard ha la solita idea strampalata:
questa volta, per combattere il crimine, decide di addestrare i cittadini all'uso delle armi;
soprattutto, l'imponente nero Thomas Conklin (Casa lo chiamano ora), amico d'infanzia di Hightower.
Ovviamente Ã¨ un disastro e Mahoney (ormai diventato sergente) ha il compito di rimediare agli sconquassi dei cittadini che, improbabilmente, sono capeggiati da un'arzilla vecchietta...



Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol is the fourth comedy film in the Police Academy series. It was released in 1987.

A group of Police Academy graduates are sent to train a group of newly recruited civilian officers.
The original Police Academy cast reprise their roles in the film.
Capt. Harris, not seen since the first installment, returns as the film's nemesis.
In Police Academy 2 and 3, Capt. Mauser (played by Art Metrano) filled that role, but Metrano was severely injured in a fall after filming number 3, and asked to be replaced for the remainder of the series.

Commandant Eric Lassard decides that the police force is overworked and understaffed, so he comes up with the idea of recruiting civilian volunteers to work side-by-side with his officers in a program called "Citizens On Patrol" (COP).
Carey Mahoney and his friends Moses Hightower, Larvell Jones, Eugene Tackleberry, Zed, Sweetchuck, Laverne Hooks, and Debbie Callahan are in charge of training the civilians.
The civilians include the enormous Tommy "House" Conklin, gung-ho senior citizen Lois Feldman, and skateboarding delinquents Kyle and Arnie.
Captain Thaddeus Harris believes "the concept of citizens doing police work is asinine" and plans to take over Lassard's job, and that's why Harris is determined to see the COP program fail...
