                                ====================




According to the Mayan prophecies, humanity has always stood Between 2 Worlds. The Old World of the Gregorian calendar has led humanity to a world of mechanical consumption, creating within us a detrimental desire for control, power, and wealth.

 
The New World of the Mayan calendar can lead humanity to a world of peace, respect, love, unity, and harmony with nature. Our task according to this prophecy is to balance these two worlds before the end of the Mayan cycle in 2012.
