ChaLean Extreme Workout Set

Phase 1--Burn: In phase one of the training, you start lifting weights to jump-start your metabolism and break down extra reserves of fat. In these moderate training workouts, you'll work your upper and then lower body, and learn how "Lean Phasing" will help you see major results every 30 days.

Phase 2--Push: In phase two, ChaLean shows you how to lift heavier weights--going beyond your comfort zone--so that you will build the muscle you need to burn fat. This phase is made easier than it sounds with plenty of guidance and incredibly fast results.

Phase 3--Lean: In phase three, new routines and dynamic moves literally melt the fat off your body. You will be blown away by the results and rewarded with a brand-new body.

Extreme Cardio: During each phase of the training, ChaLean ignites your metabolism with super-intense cardio and strength-training routines, and then rejuvenates and lengthens your hard-working muscles with an invigorating flexibility workout.

Core Power: Core Power helps you to shrink, tighten, and tone your tummy with two targeted abs routines for a rock-hard midsection.
