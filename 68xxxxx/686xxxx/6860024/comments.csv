They just keep a database of the top few BT sites and use that to get the hits and when you pay your $5-20 for a month, you will find that they have nothing available to download, it's a shell, in fact, I think most are just that.   Just wanted to mention this..."
him in the prof. bio at the start of this course) and his memory of names, places, events is astounding, IMO.   He is a genius.  It is no easy task to understand with such confidence how time, from the first civilization til now all fit into place relative to each other with all the changes in geography, names, languages, etc...

Seems that there is something going on with ttc and this course as it has become VERY hard to find, in fact, mishhh, yours here is the only one that I have located (that has a seeder) after a ton of research.  May just be the last one standing....
I only hesitated as you have compressed in the title and when I actually looked, it was no more compressed than 90% of the vids out there.  Kudos and thanks for keeping this alive, I will certainly make sure to keep seeding for at least a month.  

Seems that there is something happening with ttc, this course and our method of access.  I found that this was listed in several locations and when clicked, some said it was removed, some said nothing.  I think that this may just be one of their most popular atm and they are postering to ensure an appropriate profit.  I can agree, but I can't afford their prices.  Their prices seem to be for institutions, not the general public. (Although they have reduced all of their courses dramatically in the past year or two).  Still, at the rate that I go through these, there is no way I can afford those rates.
I think that I will make a purchase at some time in the near future just to help support their efforts, but I really think that at those rates, the institutions that buy these must be enough support as they have made only a minor attempt to get these in the hands of the general public.  
I just do not think that they really understand that the majority of college grads will eventually start to pick up these books (ie...ttc videos) at some point and try to broaden their knowledge base and that if they could spend more time getting their name out there (I know of nobody who has ever heard of TTC or even that there are videos of this caliber and diversity available), lowering the prices so that they sell 10x more, but at a reduced rate.  

In EVERY case where there is a big demand of this type, it is not the source that is the problem, it is the fact that they are just not priced reasonably to reach the majority of the audience that is downloading them.  The fix is their problem, not the courts.  The courts will help them only temporarily, ttc needs to resolve this by changing their business model completely."
