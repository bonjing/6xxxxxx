It is when a virus protection program ""THINKS"" it is but it isn't due to the unknown coding because it is altering the code to bypass the DVD check from the .exe file also he was trying to be nice and help the community not bitch because it didn't work it is called being nice people fucking help one another to make this a better place, Also I do agree with him uploading content without being confirmed it is working or even known what it is."
