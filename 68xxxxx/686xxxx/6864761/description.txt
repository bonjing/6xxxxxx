X-Men Legends 2 Full PC Game

Burn the .iso image to a empty/blank DVD using nero/ashampoo or any image burning program. Then re-insert DVD into PC and run installation. When finished open the disc and look for the 'crack' Copy the crack file found inside the folder and paste to where your game has been installed. When asked to replace, choose YES.

An easy way to find where your game has been installed right click on the shortcut on the desktop and go on properties. Do this after you have copied the crack file and on properties you should see 'find target/open file location' click on that and a window should appear. Paste your crack there and click YES to copy and replace. 

After applying the crack, your game should be fully functional without the use of the DVD.
