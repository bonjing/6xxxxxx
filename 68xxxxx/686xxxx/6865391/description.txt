"Cops & Robbers"

When Castle and Martha are taken hostage by 
a crew of bank robbers dressed in hospital 
scrubs and using classic television doctor 
names (Trapper John M.D., Dr. Huxtable, Dr. 
Quinn Medicine Woman and Dr. Doogie 
Howser), Beckett finds herself on the 
outside, desperately trying to rescue them 
-- which proves to be even more difficult 
with a by-the-book hostage negotiator 
(guest star Dean Norris, "Breaking Bad") 
watching her every move. Castle becomes the 
de facto leader of the hostages, which 
includes Barry Livingston ("My Three Sons"), 
and discovers that the robbery is actually a 
skillfully orchestrated distraction for an 
even more sinister plan. But with Castle 
stuck on the inside and Beckett on the 
outside, will either be able to foil the 
bank robbers' plans before it is too late? 

18/Slower
Evolve...or die.

Enjoy :)
