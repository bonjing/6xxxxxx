thanx for the upload!!"
we all had to just ""download and see"", there would be no need for comments at all, and it would cause a dramatic choke on everyone's internet connections trying to download 5 versions just to see which one was good. Why the fuck should we do that? We can usually find out from the comments which are worth it. "
