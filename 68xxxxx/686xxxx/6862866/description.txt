Plot: Adam and Mary have been married for over thirty years; they have spent more than half their lives together. Their children left home long ago; it seems as though Adam and Mary have enjoyed and endured all of lifeâ€™s ups and downs together and are now looking forward to what should be a quieter phase in their lives. But then, gradually, certain irritations begin to creep into their lives and both are obliged to acknowledge that the years are now taking their toll. Adam, an architect once successful, see his career and financial situation does not become more prosperous as before, while Mary is having memory problems, which may be an early dementia. Slowly, he and Mary begin to drift apart â€“ until their separation seems inevitable.
