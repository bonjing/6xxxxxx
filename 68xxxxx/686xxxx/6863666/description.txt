	Rip Notes:							      
	Forgot that i had this...found it yesterday...anywhooo...	      
	So the Source for the Rip is from a VHS....a very good copy at that   
	It was posted to USENET a couple of years ago...then in XCD format    
	The original encode was in XviD with Vorbis .Ogg sound		      
	Since it was in XCD the file size was 800MB, so i decided to reencode 
	it to get it down to 700MB...Cant say the quality got hurt for it     
	it still looks very good...However there is a small glitch the        
	first seconds of the movie...but so was the original .dat file	      
	So that have nothing to do with my Reencode, i also reencoded the     
	audio to mp3...that didnt hurt the sound either			      
	still looks & sounds very good this one...just watched it :D          
	I hope you will enjoy this....cos its a great movie		      
	And it got one HELL of a good soundtrack...worth the download alone.
