                               ======================



Wicked Pirate City takes you on a journey back to the 17th century Jamaican city of Port Royal to meet the swashbuckling, rum-swigging, good-for-nothing villains of the high sea!
Thanks to Johnny Depp's portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow, pirates have never been more popular. But, behind the Hollywood image, some of the most fascinating tales of buccaneers come not from the silver screen, but real life. In Wicked Pirate City you will experience the original home of the real-life Pirates of the Caribbean.

With frequent raids on the surrounding islands by the likes of legendary UK born privateer Henry Morgan - it wasn't known as the 'the world's wickedest city' for nothing. But, in 1692, a catastrophic earthquake caused the entire city to sink into the sea, killing thousands and submerging a treasure trove of archaeological gems.
Now, a team of marine scientists ventures beneath the waves to explore the sunken remains of this fascinating ghost town.

They hope to piece together life in the city like never before, opening a window onto the lives of the murderers, thieves and prostitutes who made it their home.
By analysing the remains of the city in detail, the team also hopes to create an ambitious CGI model of Port Royal in its bustling heyday.
As they dig deep into the murky past, this is an intimate portrait of one of history's most infamous cities.
