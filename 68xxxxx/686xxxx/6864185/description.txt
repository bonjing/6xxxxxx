Batman Arkham City (ENGLISH ONLY AND FULL MOTION MOVIES, REMOVE THE MOVIES IS A INSULT TO THE GAME!)

* PROPER Cracked no mini image is required. So no Daemon tools!
* Take note the game will take a while to load, maybe 2-4 minutes, and turn off \'Physx\' in the option if you do not have the right graphic card.
* GFWL(Games For Windows Live) is required, create offline/local profile to save the game.
* Yes, you can play Catwoman and she is HOT!, Actually you get to play her in the start, but I think you need to complete the game to enable to play her as main character.
