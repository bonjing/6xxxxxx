Thelonious Monk made a total of six solo piano recordings in his lifetime. The first three were between 1954-1959 for the Riverside label and its affiliates, two were for Alfred Lion's Black Lion label very late in his career, and Solo Monk was in 1964 and 1965 recorded mainly out West while on tour. As with Legacy's other reissues, Solo Monk is a deluxe package for a fair price. Here are the original 12 tunes comprised of four originals and eight standards as well as nine really alternate takes. In addition, there is a recording here of his little-known or -played composition "North of the Sunset." Monk's solo recordings always stood in stark contrast to his ensemble works; the voice here is less strident and dissonant in that he plays against a less-varied set of tonalities, and the solo pianist has the opportunity to sing through the instrument because it is not accountable to any other player. The beauty of his "Sweet 'n' Lovely," or the old standard "I Should Care," are nearly unbearable. His read of "These Foolish Things" is fraught with some perilously large chord voicings that stray into other key signatures, and his two takes of "Ruby My Dear" included here are finer than any he recorded previously. This is perhaps *the* solo piano record to have by Monk.
