Its another Dinosaur movie, both were filmed in 2007 and released on 3D bluray later on.  Always keep in mind your eyes may take up to 4 mins to get used to the 3D don't get frustrated or think the disc sucks or whatever. be patient. sooner or later you will take less time to adapt ranging from 45-120 seconds.
