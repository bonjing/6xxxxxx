Information
------------------------------

Love it or hate it, Facebook is the world's most successful social networking site. And whether you use it or not, it is fundamentally changing the way people connect and communicate. Facebook is easy to use and so far, more than three-quarters of a billion people all over the world have signed up. Our relationships, our thoughts, our pastimes, our memories, our lives and deaths - all are now routinely recorded on Facebook. It represents a paradigm shift in communications as significant as the printing press, or the telegraph, or the television. Inevitably, mishaps, embarrassment and trouble accompany such change.

Facebook Follies is a one-hour documentary that takes a look at the unexpected consequences of people sharing their personal information on social media. Viewers meet people who lost their jobs, their marriages, their dignity, or who even ended up in jail - all because of their own or someone else's Facebook posting. To give a broader context to the events, these stories are intercut with reflections from experts in the areas of social change, internet security and contemporary media.

Shot on location in Canada, the US and the UK, Facebook Follies is an engaging journey through one of today's most pervasive forces of social change.

Originally aired October 27, 2011.
