Storyline

Raised on the streets of turn-of-the century London, orphaned Peter 
and his pals survive by their fearless wits as cunning young pickpockets. 
Now, they've been rounded up by their mentor Jimmy Hook to snatch a 
priceless, some believe, magical treasure which transports them to another 
world. Neverland is a realm of white jungles and legendary mysteries of 
eternal youth, where unknown friends and enemies snatched from time welcome 
the new travelers with both excitement and trepidation. These groups include
a band of 18th century pirates led by the power-mad Elizabeth Bonny, and the 
Native American Kaw tribe led by a Holy Man, which has protected the secret 
of the tree spirits from Bonny and her gang for ages, and that has meant war. 
But as the fight to save this strange and beautiful world becomes vital, Hook, 
Peter, and the ragamuffin lost boys consider that growing old somewhere in 
time could be less important than growing up, right here in their new home 
called Neverland.
