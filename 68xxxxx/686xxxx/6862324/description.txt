I apologize for the low upload speed. It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.
I see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. 
Ok pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. 
Surely I wont always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it is up to you to help these shares to spread.

Trilok Gurtu Discography

A MUSIC torrent :)

Dig the Master of Rhythm: Trilok Gurtu
 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilok_Gurtu



It was years that I wanted to build this discography since I had the fortune to see Gurtu alive. He can be considered one of the fathers of the world / fusion music, the central nervous system of the rhythm. Starting from his Indian roots he has walked through a myriad of genres, collaborating with musicians from the whole world with his open minded approach to music.
What you find here are 97 albums from his discography, what was available today after an extensive crawling throughout the web..

I've also appended in the torrent a txt file with the missing albums I know about... If somebody with good will got some of those missing works, feel free to post a comment on this torrent at TPB (either contact me on SuprBay)...

All the album are zipped (since the number of files was too high for TPB).
The sampling rate is 320kbps when possible.
Different rates are signed in the name of the albums zips.

Enjoy :)
