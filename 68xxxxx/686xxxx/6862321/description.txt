VanDyke SecureCRT v6.7.3 Portable for Windows x86 (32 bits)- No install needed, no administrative rights needed. Just copy the single file to any drive / folder and use it.

Whether you need a Telnet or Terminal replacement with solid security and session management, or a more capable remote access tool to raise your productivity to the nth degree, SecureCRT is an application you can live in all day long.

Securely access business applications on UNIX, Linux, or VMS from machines running Windows, Linux, and Mac â€” employ the rich emulation support for VT100/102/220, ANSI, SCO ANSI, Wyse 50/60, Xterm, and Linux console.

Configure, manage, and customize 1 to 5,000 sessions with full control over scrollback, key mappings, colors, fonts, and more.

Access your full array of network devices from one client with SSH2, SSH1, Telnet, Telnet/SSL, serial, and other protocols.

Leverage the high-productivity UI with time-saving capabilities including multi-session launch, tabbed sessions, cloned sessions, a button bar for repeated commands, and mapped keys.

Depend on the open standard Secure Shell protocol for encrypted logon and session data, flexible authentication options, and optional FIPS 140-2 -approved ciphers.

Automate repetitive tasks in SecureCRT by running scripts using VBScript, JScript, PerlScript, or Python. The script recorder builds your keystrokes into a VBScript or Python script.

Transfer files between network devices with SFTP or Xmodem, Ymodem, and Zmodem protocols.

Save steps with the close integration of SecureCRT for Windows and the SecureFXÂ® file transfer client, which share sessions and settings that let you run SFTP, FTP, SCP, and FTP/SSL file transfer sessions without reentering passwords.
