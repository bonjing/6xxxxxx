The main focus of the book is to present the effects of nanostructuring on superconducting critical parameters. Optimizing systematically flux and condensate confinement in various nanostructured superconductors, ranging from single nano-cells to their huge arrays, critical fields and currents can be increased up to their theoretical limits, thus drastically improving the potential for practical applications of nanostructured superconductors.
