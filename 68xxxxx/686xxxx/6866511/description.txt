It's Christmas Eve and Nan receives some unexpected
visitors, in the form of Ghosts of Christmas Past,
Present and Future. In this comic retelling of
Dickens' A Christmas Carol, Nan is shown the error
of her ways, but is it too late for her to swap her
Scrooge-like misery for some seasonal goodwill?
Mathew Horne returns as Nan's ever-patient grandson
Jamie, and there are guest appearances from David
Tennant, Ben Miller and Roger Lloyd-Pack.
