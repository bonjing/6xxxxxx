"The Men of New Natesville"

Burt encourages Jimmy to be more of a 
daredevil. So when Jimmy's co-worker, Frank, 
invites him to a house party, Jimmy jumps at 
the chance to unleash his bolder side. As 
Jimmy and his new pal spend more time 
together, they discover they shared a common 
high school bully. In a series of 
flashbacks, Jimmy and Frank look back at 
their unhappy high school years as Young 
Jimmy and Young Frank. But when the two try 
to take down their old nemesis, they're 
surprised to learn that the bully has 
changed.
