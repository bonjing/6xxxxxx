HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY, 7th edition focuses on the mechanisms of body function from cells to systems and is organized around the central theme of homeostasis--how the body meets changing demands while maintaining the internal constancy necessary for all cells and organs to function. As an author, Lauralee Sherwood is known for the most up-to-date and accurate coverage as well as strong pedagogy making the text the most effective learning tool. Plus, the program offers a complete complement of media tools for learning and teaching. Additionally, this new edition has an entirely revised art program offering realistic and three-dimensional art as well as new flow diagrams. The new art program helps students visualize difficult concepts and processes for better understanding and mastery of concepts.
