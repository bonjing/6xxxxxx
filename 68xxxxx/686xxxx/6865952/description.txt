This disc captures the music of the ambitious 1993 staging of Show Boat as the opening attraction of the North York Performing Arts Centre in Toronto. The classic American musical is given new life in this production, as director Harold Prince shapes elements of various past productions into a renewed, more contemporary vision of the show. Orchestrator William David Brohn also revised the show's original orchestrations to suit the new format, but nonetheless remains respectful to Robert Russell Bennett's original. This reworking of Show Boat stands as an important development in the genre of musical theater, and this disc does a commendable job of capturing it for listeners.
