5/31/69 Grateful Dead at the University of Oregon, Eugene.

Soundboard recording, Xth generation

Shorten files downloaded from www.archive.org, converted to FLAC, edited with Wavepad, saved as FLAC and burned to CD.

The original files were in a slightly different sequence and they were a bit of a mess, with nasty cuts and tape warble, and clearly the source tape (soundboard) has been copied and recopied a number of times. But the band is in very good form, with a little help from Ken Babbs who makes a few appearances and even dominates Babble (CD2, track 1). Vintage Dead. This version of the show is NOT how it went down in actuality, but rather my attempt to make a good 2-disc set from the worn and tattered files that were available. I salvaged the really good stuff. 

Please note - the segue from TIFTOO into Sitting on Top of the World was done with a crossfade because tape warble made Jerrys guitar sound horrible and he kept playing on for a few more minutes as I recall.

I think I remember patching over cuts in Lovelight and Dark Star by stitching segments together, and Doin That Rag fades out for good reason. He Was a Friend of Mine starts mid-solo after a cut in the master tape.

Overall these sounded like improvements to me but anyone who suspects that the original untampered-with show is a better listening experience, or a more authentic experience,  is urged to visit the Internet Archive and stream the concert there. Enjoy the jarring, unmusical cuts and tape warble . . . :-)
