****************************************************************
The Flight Before Christmas centres on a young reindeer named Niko (Andrew McMahon), who dreams of following in the footsteps of his father and becoming a member of Santa Clausâ€™ â€˜Flying Forcesâ€™ (thatâ€™s Dasher, Dancer, Prancer and company to me and you). Naturally Nikoâ€™s flying ambitions quickly bring trouble his way when the young buck accidentally leads a pack of hungry wolves to his home. Shunned by the rest of the herd, Niko and his friend â€“ a squirrel called Julius (Norm Macdonald) â€“ set off on an adventure to find Santaâ€™s fell, while the evil wolves concoct a plan to wash down a feast of flying reindeer with a nice dessert of Father Christmas pudding. Itâ€™s soon down to Niko to save Christmas and, well â€“ Iâ€™m sure you can guess how it all plays out from there.
