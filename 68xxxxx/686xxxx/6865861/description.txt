"The Ten-Per-Cent Solution"

Krusty the Clown is stuck in a rut when the 
television network pulls his show from the 
air and his talent agency drops him as a 
client. But when the Simpsons introduce him 
to seasoned agent Annie (guest voice Joan 
Rivers), they are surprised to learn that 
Annie was Krusty's very first agent. Despite 
their rocky relationship, Annie is convinced 
to re-sign Krusty and craft his career 
comeback. But when Krustys retro comedy 
show reboot is deemed a critical success, 
Krusty must decide to stay with his agent or 
side with the network executives.
