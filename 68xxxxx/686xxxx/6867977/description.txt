Knightquest is divided into two storylines, one following Bruce Wayne (Knightquest: The Search) and the other on the new Batman (Knightquest: The Crusade). The stories were not treated as crossovers and the Batman titles continued as they had before Knightfall where the creative teams each pursued its own storyline. Instead of a crossover, Knightquest was more of an umbrella title that also encompassed some issues of Shadow of the Bat.  

This is not a complete Knightquest storyline, only the first half since as I already said, I'm uploading storylines chronologically py plot.
