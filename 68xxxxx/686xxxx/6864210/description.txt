Jack White's Third Man Records Collection Vol 2 (Vinyl Rip) MP3@320Kbps

Credit to the Original Rippers.  I have taken the Origial FLAC and WAV Vinyl Rip
Files Converted them to MP3 @320Kbps, Correctly Tagged the files and in the case of
the 12 inch Split each song where I thought appropriate so you can skip track and
select songs for Ipod sync and finaly provided the Cover Art.  In Some cases for this upload I've increased the Volume as you could barely hear the Tracks from the Original Rips but I've been conservative as I didn't want it to sound Processsed. 

ENJOY!
