    Legal and illegal criminality. An American tourist with a boat is        
    robbed by a gang of teenager boys, assisted by the leader's sister.      
    But soon afterward she jumps to the victim's boat to escape her          
    brother's incestuous jealousy. The couple fly together and is hunted     
    by the entire gang. Both happen to enter high-classified military        
    territory. There might be a third and atomic world war, after which      
    no ordinary man could survive. But now and then children are born who    
    are "naturally" radio-active and have cold blood. They might survive     
    in the post-war world and carry on mankind. They are fetched and         
    brought to an underground construction where they are educated by TV.    
    They are told that they are on a space ship moving toward the earth,     
    which they should eventually colonize. This military project seems to    
    be a failure because of a high mortality among the children. - The       
    military soon finds the gang. The couple finds the children and tries    
    to help them to escape. This situation will develop into                 
    psychological and other horror.
