                The National Anthem.
                Charlie Brooker returns to Channel 4 with three
                stand-alone dramas that are sharp, suspenseful,
                satirical tales with a techno-paranoia bent. Charlie
                authors the first two, while the third is written by
                Jesse Armstrong. Over the last ten years, technology
                has transformed almost every aspect of our lives
                before we've had time to stop and question it. In
                every home; on every desk; in every palm - a plasma
                screen; a monitor; a smartphone - a black mirror of
                our 21st-century existence. Our grip on reality is
                shifting. We worship at the altars of Google and
                Apple. Facebook algorithms know us more intimately
                than our own parents. We have access to all the
                information in the world, but no brain space left to
                absorb anything longer than a 140-character tweet.
