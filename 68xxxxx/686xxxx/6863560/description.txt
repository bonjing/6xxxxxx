Episode 5: Park and Slide
Original airdate: November 21, 2011

The country's most appalling drivers begin this episode in a busy parking lot. Frustrations rise as they each attempt to maneuver and secure a parking space. Then, stress levels elevate as our abysmal drivers attempt to parallel park. It will be a tight squeeze for our drivers as they attempt the challenge in a massive automobile. Later, our drivers try their hand at the Trough.

Knowing where your wheels are has never been more important. Finally, the "worst" tackle a true Canadian driving task as they slide into the Icy Corner Challenge. Learning the proper method to taking an icy corner has never been more frightening. 

Once our drivers finish their day, our panel of experts make their decision. One driver heads back onto the public roads and we continue the search for Canada's Worst Driver.
