Episode Details:
================

01 	"Rebirth"

High school student, Light Yagami finds a notebook dropped from the sky named the "Death Note". He tests the mysterious powers of the notebook and finds to his astonishment that the book has the power to kill people whose names are written in it. 5 days later, Ryuk, a shinigami confronts him at his home, telling him the book belongs to the human owner who found it first and cannot be returned unless the owner dies or relinquishes ownership. He makes it clear Light found it by chance and was not 'chosen'. Though initially terrified and distraught by how he killed people, Light decides that he will use the Death Note to rid the world of evil and become the new god.
