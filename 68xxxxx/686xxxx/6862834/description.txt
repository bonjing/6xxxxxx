Dracula Dead and Loving It [1995]

Another spoof from the mind of Mel Brooks. This time he's out to poke fun at the
Dracula myth. Basically, he took "Bram Stoker's Dracula," gave it a new cast and
a new script and made a big joke out of it. The usual, rich English are attacked
by Dracula and Dr. Van Helsing is brought in to save the day.
