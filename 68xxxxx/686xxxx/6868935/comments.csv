Secondly, the file (once renamed back to .mkv) spits out all kinds of errors in mkvtoolnix and mkvcleaver. 

Its playable in VLC. But that's not what all of us need. Tversity spits out errors so it can't even transcode/play/read this. I've noticed the same thing on two of your other uploads.

Not trying to be a douche, but unless you're watching this at your PC, skip it."
