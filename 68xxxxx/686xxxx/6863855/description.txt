RECEPTION

Live at The Royal Albert Hall was well-received by music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 80, based on 5 reviews, which indicates "generally favorable reviews".
The Boston Globe labeled the release "Our DVD pick" and said, "the performances are routinely inspired. With the voice of an angel - and the potty mouth of a sailor - sheâ€™s a force throughout." In a very positive review, MTV News writes, "I actually had to remind myself not to clap at the conclusion of a couple songs... And in that regard, it is a tremendous success; you definitely get the full experience. Adele is luminous, compelling, funny and profane throughout, and like I said, her voice is in tiptop shape."
