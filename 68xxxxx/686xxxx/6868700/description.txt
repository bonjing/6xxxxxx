****************************************************************
Based on the bestselling book, this is the story of Littlest Angel, who chooses to make a mischief of himself. Instead of going to his "good deeds" classes at the Angel's Academy and properly growing his wings, he spends his days chasing butterflies, climbing trees and getting into trouble. What he really wants is to go on an adventure to retrieve his favourite possession, his treasure box.

Despite the danger, and the fact that it is forbidden, Littlest goes on an adventure with his friend Halo, a cute little talking dog with wings, to find his treasure box.
