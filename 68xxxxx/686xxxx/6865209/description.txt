
About two and a half years ago I found this soundtrack rip
somewhere else and decided to share it in two torrents here on
TPB.  After a couple years I lost my copy so I came back here to
get it back but, sad to say, both versions had died out.  Zero
100% seeds after several months of idling.  So, I went and found
the CD and started over.  I did everything the same as the
original ripper except I used a slightly newer version of Foobar
2000, I used GoldWave for the MP3 conversions, and I didn\'t make
new scans (I\'m using the original ripper\'s jpegs here).  I\'m
also posting the wave in case anyone wants to burn it as a
regular audio CD, or perhaps do your own FLAC or MP3 processing.

This is my first CD rip ever but I happen to love this movie and
this soundtrack so I took great care to do everything by the
book.  I hope it sounds good to you folks with a critical ear.

First of all let me point out a couple mistakes in the CD
packaging.  One thing is that in the track list, both on the CD
and on the tray liner, they listed the first ten tracks by
Artist/Title and then the last three tracks by Title/Artist. 
Strange.  The other thing is that they misspelled the title of
the movie.  It\'s \"Box of Moon Light\", four words, not \"Box of
Moonlight\" like it says on this CD.  The correct spelling can be
seen at the IMDB page and more importantly, in the opening title
screen of the movie.  OK enough of all that, on to this
torrent...

First of all I ripped the CD to my hard drive using Exact Audio
Copy EAC v0.99 prebeta 5 according to the instructions on this
page:
 
http://www.pchelpforum.com/cd-dvd-burning/51232-create-flac-image-audio-cd.html

I think I got it right because it went precisely as the guide
said it should, and EAC reported a 100% perfect rip.  The EAC
log is included in this torrent.

Next I created two sets of files, one as FLAC for folks with
cable, one as MP3 for those who need a smaller download.  I
followed the instructions on that same page and created the FLAC
files using Foobar2000 v0.9.6.8 which is the most recent version
as of today, and then for the MP3 files I used a trusty old
version of AudioCatalyst and created them as 160/44 Stereo (not
Joint Stereo) CBR.

Then I scanned all of the artwork and the CD itself at 240 DPI. 
I included lossless versions along with the FLACs, and Jpegs
along with the MP3s.

And that\'s the whole story.  I hope you like it.
