This game requires speed, skill and strategic thinking.

Connect the start to the end, or vice versa, as quickly as possible and let it charge up. The aim is to form a complete path that can be followed from start to finish.

The quicker you are, the higher your score will be - the timer is ticking and every second counts!

Be careful to avoid the hazards and destroy the dangers and watch out for permanent blocks too - they can be your best friendm or your worst enemy, it just depends on how you choose to use them!
