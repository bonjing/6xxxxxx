FOR TESTING

illume OS is a full-featured operating system designed for use in many ways. You could use it on desktops, notebooks, netbooks, servers, you name it. It can be used in homes, schools, offices, etc. It is virus-free and crashing would be a thing of the past. illume OS's desktop was designed to be easy enough for even a 5 year old to use. The operating system is based on the Debian operating system, which is based on the rock-solid Linux kernel.
For such an amazing operating system, you won't have to pay a single cent. It is 100% free. You won't have to worry about buying licenses for all your machines. All you have to do is come to this website and download a copy of illume OS. It is that simple.

illume OS 1.0 Release Candidate
Finally! Iâ€™ve decided to make a Release Candidate of illume OS 1.0. It features hundreds of new features over the last Preview release. Hereâ€™s the list of new features (of what I can remember):
    * New IceWM theme
    * GTK theme changed to â€˜Clearlooksâ€™
    * More wallpapers
    * GNOME To Do
    * Dropbox client
It is not much, but it feels like a big change when you try it out. illume OS 1.0 is going to be based on the next build, which I might compile next week.
