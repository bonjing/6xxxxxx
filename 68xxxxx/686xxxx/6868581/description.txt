Instructions:

Install the file J13.0.527-32bit.exe

You need to temporarily disable UAC before patching on Vista or seven.

You should also find the jfw.exe and jhook.dll files which will crack JAWS.

If you haven't cracked any JAWS version before, just simply paste the two files referenced above to JAWS' program files directory.

To find this, go to Start --&gt; All Programs/Programs --&gt; JAWS 13.0 --&gt; Explore JAWS --&gt; Explore Program Files 

Good luck and remember to share with other visually impaired persons.
