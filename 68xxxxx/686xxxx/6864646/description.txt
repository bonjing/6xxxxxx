  Lorraine Pascale dishes up her favourite foods. First she cranks up   
  the volume on a kitchen classic with a prosciutto and brie toastie    
  that's ready in moments. Then she goes back to her roots to share     
  her inspiration for a seriously chocolatey chocolate digestive        
  cheesecake with white icing - that doesn't involve any cooking.       
                                                                        
  Next, salad gets an autumn twist, in a hearty pan-fried balsamic      
  pear salad with pancetta, gorgonzola and a warm honey dressing, and   
  in another seasonal treat Lorraine rustles up homely chutney and      
  gives it a twist with apple, blackberries and cinnamon.               
                                                                        
  Then it's Lorraine's favourite meal of the week, Sunday lunch.        
  Comforting, leisurely and easy, with really slow roast pork shoulder  
  with crispy, crispy crackling, garlic roast vegetables, gravy and     
  delicious leftovers. This is home cooking the favourites - what's     
  not to love?
