This patch removes the flak explosions from projectiles, by popular demand. It is completely optional, and makes no other changes to the mod. It is compatible with all releases of Imperial Civil War up to at least 1.3. To install, copy the contents of the TRNoFlak folder and paste them into the Imperial_Civil_War/Data/Art/Models folder.
