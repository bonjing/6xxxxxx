The Monopoly Men (1999) DVDRip

This video is an expose of the Federal Reserve. It explores the conspiracy to rob the American people of their money, purchasing power, and the manipulation of the people by the people who own the game.

During the Wilson Presidency, the U.S. Government sanctioned the creation of the Federal Reserve. Thought by many to be a government organization maintained to provide financial accountability in the event of a domestic depression, the actual business of the FED is shrouded in secrecy. In Phenomenon: The Lost Archives -- Monopoly Men, viewers investigate the Federal Reserve. The history of this organization is examined as well as its contemporary assignments. Hosted by Dean Stockwell.
