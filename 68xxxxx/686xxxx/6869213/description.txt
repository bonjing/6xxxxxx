With Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys at the producerâ€™s helm, this album corroborates Cadillac Skyâ€™s bluegrass roots (using many techniques that seem to have been forsaken in the genre throughout the years) while at the same time departing into the great beyond, schlepping suitcases full of classical influences, rock and pop, on the way to expanding musical frontiers.

Letters In The Deep finds Matt Menefee, known for his â€œother worldâ€ banjo playing, sitting behind an upright piano, banging on the drums, playing the glockenspielâ€¦ It finds David Mayfield, guitarist extraordinaire, adding percussion; mandolinist Bryan Simpson playing guitar, violin, and â€˜Thrilla-Fiddlaâ€™ Ross Holmes playing mandolin and melotron. Andy â€œPandaâ€ Moritz also takes turns at piano, percussion, and weaving bass lines of increasingly subtle complexity; all combine to reveal a richly textured musical tapestry. Cadillac Sky has explored a lot of new terrain â€˜liveâ€™ on stage and, with the addition of David â€˜Mayhemâ€™ Mayfield on guitar, the band has developed into one of the most exciting rock-shows around. That new energy yielded an abundance of new tunes. There are so many musical treats in Letters In The Deep that it becomes a SmÃ¶rgÃ¥sbord for connoisseurs of great music present and past.
