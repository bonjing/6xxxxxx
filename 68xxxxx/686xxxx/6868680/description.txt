 Starring: Rose McGowan, Martin Cummins, Julia Sarah Stone, Lilah Fitzgerald, 
Eric Keenleyside, Susan Hogan, Michael Shanks Genre: True Story

 Based on the true story of Matthew Winkler, a beloved minister who, in 2006, 
was found shot and killed in his Selmer, Tennessee home, his wife and young 
daughters missing. Authorities soon zeroed in on Matthew's wife, Mary, as the 
prime suspect in the murder. After her capture, the residents of Selmer were 
left to wonder what would drive Mary to shoot her husband in the back as he slept. 
They would get their answers during her trial, when what went on behind the 
closed doors of this seemingly perfect family was revealed for all to see.
