I've downloaded and tried a lot of different Dirt 3 uploads and there's no problem installing and get them working.
The problem is that they all freezes every 4-5 seconds when I play. So I can't really play it.
I've tried all sorts of cracks and patches and it still don't work. Lower grafics and so on like someone mentioned. It can't be the computer cos I have an i7 2600K, GTX 580 and 8gb ram and all the latest drivers.
Any suggestions?
Thank's for the upload!"
