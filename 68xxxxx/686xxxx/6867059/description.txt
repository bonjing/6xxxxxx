About the Game: Story players will return in time to the first attack over the Mental Earth. This means that the plot of the game is the precursor to the events in Serious Sam 1 and 2. This time, the authors promise a much better story told and emphasized, however, the gameplay will remain based on the destruction of as many enemies from the battlefield. Questions about the implementation of systems for cover and regeneration of health Ribaric boldly notes "cover?? Regeneration?? You can not be serious! "A novelty in the game is there are more melee weapons such as hammers, fists, feet, struck dumb with some weapons, etc. The inclusion of the hammer just broke Ribaric "Why not? LOL! Has there ever been another reason to put anything in the game besides "This way of killing the aliens look very funny '."
