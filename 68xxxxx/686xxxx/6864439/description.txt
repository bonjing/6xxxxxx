German Airports 3 - Paderborn/Lippstadt X (FSX+FS2004)

Visit the home base airport of Aerosoft and location of the German Flight Simulation Conference in Microsoft Flight Simulator X and 2004. The airport Paderborn/Lippstadt has been developed using the latest FSX technologies and therefore comes in an extreme level of detail. A must-have for all Aerosoft fans and friends of high-end graphics.

For us this airport of Paderborn/Lippstadt has a special significance as its been the home base of the Aerosoft GmbH headquarters in Germany. It is also the location of our annual German Flight Simulation Conference since the year 2002. Now surely this is what every scenery designer wants to do most of all, create the environment he (she) knows best. It's also special project as we wanted to show what FSX is actually capable of doing and of course displaying. It is an airport scenery as detailed as (we think) FSX can display and which uses all the latest technology made available by FSX. From the 20 cm pixel ground images to the animated gates that dock with the AI traffic. The airport is realistic as it looks from the windows of our office.

The regional airport of Paderborn/Lippstadt is a commercial airport offering a complete service of a modern and up to date airport.
