Description:
A mysterious criminal rolls into a small town planning to knock off the local bank, 
assuming it will go off without a hitch. But when he encounters a retired poetry 
professor, his plans take an unlikely turn. With no place to stay, the professor 
generously welcomes him into his home. As the two men talk, a bond forms between 
these two polar opposites, and surprising moments of humor and compassion emerge. 
As they begin to understand each other more, they each examine the choices they've 
made in their lives, secretly longing to live the type of lifestyle the other man 
has lived, based on the desire to escape their own.
