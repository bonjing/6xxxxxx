From Wikipedia:

Gone Fishin' is a 1984 LP album, the second studio release by San Francisco punk/noise rock band Flipper. The album's artwork featured a depiction of Flipper's tour van as a ready-to-cut-out-and-assemble centerpiece, with similar cutouts of the four band members on the back cover. At the time of the album's release, Subterranean Records offered extra empty covers of the album by mail order for $2 for those Flipper fans that wanted to have a cover to cut up and assemble. The album was reissued through Water Records on December 9, 2008 for the first time on CD, with liner notes provided by Buzz Osborne of the Melvins.

Review

by John Dougan

After the glow of Album, Gone Fishin' may sound like a bit of a disappointment primarily due to the cleaned up (for Flipper anyway) sound, but that shouldn't stop you from enjoying this record. Not as confrontational nor as gloriously unhinged, Gone Fishin' still has moments that will poleaxe you with their power.
