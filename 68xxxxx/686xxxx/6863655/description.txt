Jack White's Third Man Records Collection Vol 1 (Vinyl Rip) MP3@320Kbps

Credit to the Original Rippers.  I have taken the Origial FLAC and WAV Vinyl Rip
Files Converted them to MP3 @320Kbps, Correctly Tagged the files and in the case of
the 12 inch Split into each song were I thought appropriate so you can skip track
and select songs for Ipod sync. I haven't included The Black Belles 2011 here which
is part of the collection, you can download it here.
