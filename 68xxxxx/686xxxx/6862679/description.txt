Festive fun with Ronnies Corbett and Barker from Christmas
1973. The magnificent two - well, one and a half. What are
they doing on Christmas Eve 1874?

Victorian England. Dinner at the house of Messrs Barker and
Corbett, but, someone's stolen the Christmas Turkey! It'll
take a brilliant mind and loyal companions to aid the capture
of this thief. Too bad all they've got is Piggy Malone.

Featuring several news items of interest, some wonderfully
choreographed dancing, and a brilliant compilation of the
new works by a duo called Sullivan and Gilbert performed by
our generous hosts.
