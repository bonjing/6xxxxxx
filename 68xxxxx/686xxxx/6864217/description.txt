Now in its third edition, Bronson's C++ for Engineers and Scientists makes C++ accessible to first-level engineering students as C++ maintains its stronghold in engineering and scientific communities. The text continues to take a pragmatic approach that incorporates actual engineering and science problems for its applications and examples. Students begin with a foundation in procedural programming, moving into object-oriented concepts in the second half of the text. This new edition also offers new case studies and an expanded selection of examples from a variety of fields including thermodynamics, optics, and fluid mechanics.
