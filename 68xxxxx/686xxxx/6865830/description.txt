No Regret begins 46 hours after the events of No Remorse. The Silencerâ€™s escape pod is picked up by a freighter that is headed to the WEC penitentiary mining facility on the Moon, where political dissidents and Resistance members are held. The mining operation there is the key to destabilizing the entire WEC structure from within, and this is why Chairman Draygan himself is overseeing the program. The Resistance has also managed to install a cell on the Moon and is trying to delay the Di-Corellium extraction as much as possible. All the pieces are in place and it is up to you to make the first moveâ€”and the last one.
