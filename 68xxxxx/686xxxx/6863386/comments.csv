files were changed later on, but at this current moment in time, this copy of Flash Builder is loaded with a newer virus that installs a program called Smart HDD onto your computer.  It hides all of your files and does other annoying shit.  

Just to make sure it was this causing it, I ran it in a sandbox and traced it to the main program exe that exists after installation.  Be vigilant~"
