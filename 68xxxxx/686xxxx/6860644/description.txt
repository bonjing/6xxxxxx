

      Lady Gaga - Marry The Night (Official Music Video) 14Min Long HQ


 
Lady Gaga made her music video directorial debut with a 14-minute production which was met on Friday with a mix of weariness and adulation by fans and pop culture watchers.

"Marry the Night" -- the fifth single from her "Born This Way" album -- sees the Grammy-winning performance artist making a trip to the hospital, dying her hair mint green, throwing Cheerios over her naked body and hanging upside down in a car -- all in the eight minutes before the song comes in.
