You are a man that temporarily lives at a strange and large hotel. You've started to notice mysterious sounds at night and other visitors at the hotel have disappeard, yet all their valuables is still in their room. You have heard rumors about the host at the hotel, that he'd kidnapped people and torture them to their death. You have decided that you're going to investigate what's really going on at this hotel and you will do that when everyone else is asleep, at night. This custom story is still in progress, I just wanted it to get out there and see what you guys think about it so far! I don't know when this mod will be released but I will do my best to finish it!
