P.S.: I just don't like the RAR files."
 please don't take offense to my next question / comment.  Is there a reason why you RAR these?  I don't see the point since it does not actually make the file any smaller.  Also It means that the file has to be extracted to be watched which means that we have to keep two copies of it on our hard drives in order to continue seeding.  This gives us the choice of either taking up twice as much space or not to seed.  I would encourage people to look for, download and seed the non rar'd copy that is also available of these files.  If there is a purpose to this I would be interested in knowing it.  Thank you."
