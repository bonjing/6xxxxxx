I made this from the available .ts MPEG-2 file. The video looks exactly as good, and I normalized the audio to loud volume without clipping.

Plus, the weird scan lines to the far left side of the video have been cropped away, resulting in a much cleaner, nicer file.

This file is compatible with XBOX360 and PS3! Great quality!
