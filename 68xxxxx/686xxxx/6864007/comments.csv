How can you say it ""Dont have any Connection with ""A Taste of China "" when in fact that is the name of  the PDF in your torrent. My original comment pointed out the fact that the name of the PDF and the name of the torrent did not match and could lead some people to think they were downloading one thing when they were, in fact, downloading something else. 

True, this ""A Taste of China"" does have pictures where most of the other copies of this cookbook do not but never-the-less it still contains the same recipes. 

Also, the beginning of each page of this PDF contains the following spam:

(here a URL is listed. Evidently TPB sees this as spam in the comments and will not allow it to be posted, but it is there all the same)
