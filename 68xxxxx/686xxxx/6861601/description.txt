American Anthems 2 is a great follow up compilation. The box features three CDs. 58
tracks are included of these iconic American artists and groups to establish in the
music scene. The music spans at least two decades (70's and 80's)

First disc- Toto-Africa, Tina Turner- We do need another hero, Whitesnake- Here I
go again, Hall & Oates- I can't go for thatn;, Fleetwod Mac- Everywhere and 14 more
tracks

Second disc- Reo Speedwagon- Can't fight the feeling, Huey Lewis & The News- Stuck
with you, Chicago- If you leave me know, Cyndi Lauper- Time after time, Mr Mister
Kyrie and 14 more tracks

Third disc- Cher- If I could Turn Back time, Starship- Nothing gonna stop us now,
Roy Orbison- I drove all night, Meat Loaf- Two out of three ain't bad, Kiss- Crazy
Crazy nights and 15 more tracks

I have listed 5 tracks of each disc. These songs stand out the most with me as
memorable American Anthems. I fondly remembering listening to the tracks during my
childhood. The calibre of artists and group speaks for themselves and you know what
to expect. The wide choice of tracks offered is unique, as there are many tracks that
I have not listened to and I really enjoy listening to the tracks. Full credit must be
given for offering variety. The British music scene during the 70's and 80's decade was
saturated as some American bands and groups made in-roads in the scene. Unfortunately
not all artists and groups received recognition in UK. There was far too much competition.
It is nice to listen and appreciate the music scene of America, as it really boosted some
quality and nostalgic tracks. The idea of releasing a follow is justified as there are so
many tracks I have not listned to. American Anthems offers an excellent choice of tracks
to listen timelessly. I am impressed with the album.
