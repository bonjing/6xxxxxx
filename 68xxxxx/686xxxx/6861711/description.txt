Raw video footage shot by @OakFoSho (www.oakfosho.com) of the OccupyLA raid on November 29-30

The main raid action is in the November 29 945 PM file which runs for about 4 hours.  This footage was removed from Ustream.com but was mirrored by someone on livestream, and now everyone who downloads this torrent.

Mostly shot with HD camera but some cell phone footage as well.  Continuous commentary.
