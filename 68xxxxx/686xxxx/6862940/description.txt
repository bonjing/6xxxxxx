Still not 100% sure which season this is. Some sites will say it's Season 4 while other sites say Season 3, including biography.com. I can't find it in me to post something as a new season when it was on break for only a few weeks before coming out with new episodes. Whatever, though, it's the newest episode.
 
Beverley Mitchell uncovers the evil past of an abandoned insane asylum; Mark Curry awakens an angry spirit in his new home; Donovan Leitch unearths an uninvited guest at his country house; and Phyllis Diller comes face to face with the ghost of her childhood muse.
