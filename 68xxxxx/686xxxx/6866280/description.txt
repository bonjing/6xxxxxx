Details:

2011 album from Sindri M r Sigfasson (AKA Sin Fang), the Icelandic king of lo-fi layered lushness, The album oscillates wildly, unearthing glimpses of familiarity - vintage Flying Nun here, Paw Tracks there and a Belle and Sebastian pop nous - while retaining the own stark originality of this uber-talented artist and producer. The fact that Sigfasson did not only write all the music but also was doing most of the recording and production promises a lot for his future and Summer Echoes conveys the feeling that the real story has only just begun. Asian edition includes two bonus tracks.
