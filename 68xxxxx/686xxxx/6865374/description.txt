A CEO falls mysteriously ill just 
days before he signs a contract that 
would relocate his company's entire 
labor force to China. House attempts 
to make an underhanded business 
transaction with his wealthy patient, 
but when the patient's condition 
worsens, the team must work around 
the clock to save his life. Meanwhile, 
Park prepares for her hearing with the 
Princeton Plainsboro Disciplinary 
Committee chaired by Foreman, and 
Adams' outlook on her patient's 
business venture reveals her deeper 
feelings about loyalty
