The double-disc set Health & Happinesss Shows collects eight complete radio shows that
Hank Williams recorded in 1949, when his career was just taking off. Throughout the
collection, Williams sounds energetic and vibrant, even during his between-song stage
patter which is nearly fascinating as the music. It's a set that is designed for
collectors, but even casual Williams fans will find much to treasure on the Health &
Happiness Shows.
