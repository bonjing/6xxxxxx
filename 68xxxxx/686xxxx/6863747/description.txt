Release Notes for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.7

1. Installation
The Red Hat Enterprise Linux installer (also known as anaconda) assists in the installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. The Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.7 includes the following enhancements:

A kickstart installation, by default, has the SSH port open in the firewall settings. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.7, the new "--no-ssh" kickstart option for the firewall command can be used to ensure that SSH access to a system is disabled.
The new blacklist functionality in anaconda is used to avoid the installation or probing of drivers.
anaconda provides added support for the subscription and entitlement changes implemented in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.7. Refer to Section 2, â€œSubscriptions and Entitlementâ€ for further information.

2. Subscriptions and Entitlement
Effective software and infrastructure management requires a mechanism to handle the software inventory â€” both the type of products and the number of systems that the software is installed on.
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.7,includes support for the new Entitlement Platform which provides oversight for the software entitlements for an organization and a more effective content delivery system. On local systems, the new Red Hat Subscription Manager offers both GUI and command-line tools to manage the local system and its allocated subscriptions.
A better method to handle subscriptions will help our customers maintain their software compliance and will make installing and updating Red Hat products much simpler.
Note
For more information refer to the Overview of changes to Red Hat subscription and entitlement management article on the Red Hat Knowledgebase.
3. Virtualization
3.1. Xen

Xen guests now support up to 4 serial ports.
xz compression support is now available in Xen pygrub.

3.2. KVM
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.7 includes support for the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. KVM is integrated into the Linux kernel, providing a virtualization platform that takes advantage of the stability, features, and hardware support inherent in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
This release provides the following bug fixes and enhancements:

CDROM emulation in KVM is improved.
Live migration convergence speed is improved.
issues with the boot order of virtual machines have been fixed.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.7 provides the following notable filesystem improvements:

A new debugging facility for Network File System (NFS) address space operations (aops)
Additional checks to ensure that quota limits cannot be set too high.

5.1. Global File System 2 (GFS2)
The Red Hat GFS2 file system is a native file system that interfaces directly with the Linux kernel file system interface (VFS layer). When implemented as a cluster file system, GFS2 employs distributed metadata and multiple journals.
GFS2 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux includes the following notable new features:

The fallocate() system call preallocates filesystem blocks to a file. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.7 introduces support for the fallocate() system call on the GFS2 filesystem.
Performance when bouncing locks in a cluster with GFS2 is improved.
gfs2_grow is used to expand the GFS2 filesystem. Previously, growing a GFS2 filesystem that was at capacity (full) was unsupported. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.7 introduces support for growing a full GFS2 filesytem.

6. System Security Services Daemon (SSSD)
The System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) provides a set of daemons to manage access to remote directories and authentication mechanisms. It provides Name Service Switch (NSS) and Pluggable Authentication Modules(PAM) interfaces toward the system and a pluggable back end system to connect to multiple different account sources.
SSSD in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.7 includes the following notable bug fixes and enhancements:

The new ding-libs package provides utility functions to manipulate filesystem pathnames (libpath_utils), a hash table which dynamically resizes to achieve optimal storage and access time properties (libdhash), a data type to collect data in a hierarchical structure for easy iteration and serialization (libcollection), a dynamically growing, reference-counted array (libref_array), and a library to process configuration files in initialization format (INI) into a library collection data structure (libini_config).
