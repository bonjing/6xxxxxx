When you move in next door to Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse, they are impressed with the size and splendour of your kitchen. Of course, whenever you make something, you will have to let them come over and taste test it for you. And if you ever run out of food, well, you\\\'ll have to let them go shopping for you!

With this game, players can spend time puttering in the kitchen, whipping up tasty treats either on the computer or in their own kitchen at home. 30 recipes are included from the pages of FamilyFun Magazine. Players can also bake, microwave, boil or fry their creations in the kitchen provided.

Players can also redecorate their kitchen and set the table, or take part in the three activities: The Make-a-Cake oven, the Good Morning Griddle, or the Magic Recipe box. Players are even encouraged to clean up after themselves with the sponge, mop and cleaning implements provided. They are also given a wrench (under the sink) in case of leaks.
