Knightshift (or Once Upon A Knight as it was released in the US) is a RTS/RPG hybrid game from developers Reality Pump Studios, Deep Silver and publisher Zuxxez Entertainment. The story involves the ancient fight between good and evil in a fantasy world. The game consists of 2 unique modes: in RTS mode you are faced with 3 campaigns and the characters gain experience and level up. In RPG mode you can choose your character from 8 classes including barbarian, spearman and amazon sorceress among others. You can customize the appearance of your hero and distribute points to his or her skills when you level up, learning new spells and new abilities on your way to completing your quests. This is an interesting game that i would like to share but be warned: knightshift was running with minimal pauses on my system and i guess itâ€™s because the 2 processors so if you face this, leave only one cpu running (i didn\'t try it because i didn\'t know this then).  Just install and use the serial number to play. Keep the torrents alive by seeding!
