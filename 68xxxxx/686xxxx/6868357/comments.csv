You're welcome and thanks for helping out:)

I just doublechecked once more,though i knew the fault wasn't mine.What you need is a proper codec(s). Download VLC player from the link i'm providing and you'll be fine.Plays almost everything and is one of the most popular free players out there.Take care and have a nice day.
