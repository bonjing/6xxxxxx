This is "Weird Al" Yankovic's "White and Nerdy" track in FLAC with the following modification:

The bass from this track was stripped and the bass from Chamillionaire's "Ridin'" was mixed in, providing a more rich and typical rap song bass. Effect was achieved utilizing FFT filtering and inverse mixing. The bass portion of the track was intentionally extended beyond the end of the song for identification purposes.
