Happy People: A Year In The Taiga 
Werner Herzog, director of Grizzly Man, Encounters at The End of The World and Cave of Forgotten Dreams, presents yet another awe-inspiring documentary, this time following the lives of the indigenous people living in the heart of the Siberian Taiga. Deep within this remote landscape, facing the most hostile conditions on earth, 300 people inhabit the small village of Bakhatia. There are only two ways to reach the outpost, by helicopter and by boat. In this wilderness there are no phones, running water or medical aid. The people live according to their own values and cultural traditions which have remained unchanged for centuries. With his wonderfully evocative narration accompanying the breath-taking imagery, Werner Herzog brings us another remarkable encounter.
