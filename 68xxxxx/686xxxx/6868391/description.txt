A friend was over the other day browsing through my Apple TV library and exclaimed, "WOW!  You've got a shitload of U2 concerts.  Please share them with me."  

"Why stop with him" I thought, so here they are, spanning U2's concerts from 1983 through 2010.

All have been converted from original DVD's to the Apple friendly .m4v format which is really a mp4 if you change the suffix.  Unless noted otherwise the videos have both stereo and 5.1 Dolby surround audio tracks.

Due to the massive size of this torrent, I ask you please keep seeding this after you download to assist everyone els.  Thanks.
