  "Attic Thoughts" is an instrumental progressive rock album originally
  issued in Sweden late 1975 by Swedish musician Bo Hansson. The album
  featured contributions from many of the same session musicians and friends
  that had played on Hansson's previous album, "Magician's Hat". In addition
  to featuring Hansson's usual blend of other-worldly progressive rock and
  fairy tale-like ambiance, "Attic Thoughts" includes a suite named "Rabbit Music",
  which was inspired by Richard Adams' novel "Watership Down".

  Bo Hansson passed away on April 23, 2010, at the age of 67.
