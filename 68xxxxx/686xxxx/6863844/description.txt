                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Russell Howard's Good News sees Russell giving his perspective on the week's  
 news.                                                                         
                                                                               
 Extended version of the topical comedy show in which Russell Howard offers up 
 his unique perspective on the news stories that have dominated the media over 
 the past seven days. In search of the weird, the wonderful and the just plain 
 odd, Russell and his crack team plough through over 60 news channels from     
 across the world, read over 140 newspapers and watch over 1,000 clips all for 
 your viewing pleasure. While there's no way of knowing what tangent the world 
 of news will take, Russell will, as always, be joined by special mystery      
 guests and sign off the show with an often under-reported feelgood tale of    
 triumph, courage or kindness.                                                 
                                 Enjoy!
