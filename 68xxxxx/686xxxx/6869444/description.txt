""Rosenrot (German: "rose-red") is the fifth album by German Neue Deutsche HÃ¤rte band Rammstein.  It was released on October 28, 2005 in Germany, December 6, 2005 in Canada, and March 28, 2006 in the United States.  A limited edition with a bonus DVD is also available.  As of February 2006, the album has shipped 1 million copies globally.  The album includes six songs artistically omitted from Reise, Reise.  The album's first title was Reise, Reise Volume Two, but on August 18, 2005 the album was announced as Rosenrot.  The cover art is nearly identical to the Japanese import of Reise, Reise.  The image is a slightly altered photograph of the icebreaker USS Atka, taken on March 13, 1960 at McMurdo Station, Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica.  While Rammstein did not actively promote the album, the band built anticipation through a variety of means.  The first single from the album, "Benzin", premiered at the Berliner Wuhlheide and was subsequently released on disc.  Rammstein's official website featured one-minute samples from six of the tracks, and had featured a prominent release-date countdown.  A brief section of the chorus from "Rosenrot" plays in the background of an e-card containing photographs of the band and basic album information.""
