Two ploughshares/peacenik movies

- First Strike: Portrait of an Activist, 38 min

(Douglas Dibble, 1989. A powerful film about Katya Komisaruk, an anti-nuclear activist who, alone and unarmed, entered Vandenberg Air Force Base in 1987 and destroyed parts of the NAVSTAR computer system, which she regarded as part of the nerve center of the U.S. "first strike" capability. Much of the film concentrates on her trial, at which the judge disallowed all testimony about her motivation, making it impossible for Katya to offer a "defense of necessity" and to argue that her actions were required under the Nuremberg Charter.)

- Tri-Denting the Nuclear Conspiracy - Uphold International Law, 16 min

(A visual tour of the Faslane Trident Nuclear Submarine base and an introduction to the campaign to stop it. The TRIDENT PLOUGHSHARES campaign is part of the international peace movement that has been struggling for nuclear disarmament since the first use of nuclear weapons in Hiroshima and Nagasaki over 50 years ago. For our part in the abolition of nuclear weapons, we will endeavour to peacefully, openly and accountably disarm the British Trident nuclear weapon system. Our acts of disarmament are intended to stop ongoing criminal activity under well-recognised principles of international humanitarian law.)
