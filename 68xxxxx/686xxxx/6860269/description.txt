I have this game in my collection for 8 years now but i\'ve never had the chance to play it because i always had other gaming priorities. I tested it before i upload and i couldn\'t get used to the controls but you should do it better than me. I think itâ€™s hard to be found, so here it is for anyone interested.

Unpack, use power iso to create a virtual drive, mount the .mdf image and either the installation will begin automatically either you will run the setup manually. Then play and have fun. And of course seed!
