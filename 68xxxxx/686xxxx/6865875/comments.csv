,hooverd78,2011-12-21T23:51Z,I just got a call from my ISP that I will be fined for copyright on this movie!! Have been downloading for almost 2 years and that never happened! BEWARE! It was a shitty cam too! 
n overseas rip (codec coloring was off) then finally after almost making me delete this off the harddrive and coming back to bellyache about being a fake, the cam copy starts, Finally. (Dunno why this persons added 2 extra videos that have nothing to do with this movie other than its the muppets singing the first one and a homemade version of them in the 2nd one, wasted bandwidth to make it bigger for no logical reason) 

Quality :V - 7.5 (max, that weird flicker is back and almost harsh during brightly lit day scenes)
A - 8 (little ""tunnely"" sounding and theres issues with the volume, some scene are so hard to hear while others come blasting across.)"
