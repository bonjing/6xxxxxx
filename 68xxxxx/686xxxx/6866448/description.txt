We awoke this morning to find that Swedish television viewers last night had been getting very excited and very vocal about a new song by a new singer.

The girl to your right is Moa Lignell, and sheâ€™s been taking part in the latest series of Swedish Idol. In last nightâ€™s show, she performed her own composition â€˜When I Held Yaâ€™, and thatâ€™s whatâ€™s been getting everyone so worked up.

Why?â€¦

Well because itâ€™s really quite amazing! Lyrically and melodically, itâ€™s a beautiful song. And its simplicity gives it an extra added layer of beauty on top of that. The melody of the chorus is delightfully infectious. Itâ€™s not difficult to see why viewers have fallen in love with it.

What is more difficult to work out though, is whatâ€™s best for Moa in the competition. If she goes and wins it, sheâ€™ll be obliged to release the standard winnerâ€™s single, and then will probably have to wait a little while to unleash â€˜When I Held Yaâ€™. So in actual fact, Moa herself, and Universal Music, are probably hoping that she gets knocked out of the contest ASAP â€“ thus enabling her to release this as a single while last nightâ€™s performance is still on everyoneâ€™s minds, AND go into the studio to record that massive selling hit album sheâ€™s gonna have regardless of whether she wins the show or leaves next week.
