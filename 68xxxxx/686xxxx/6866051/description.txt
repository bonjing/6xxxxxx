The second season begins with Grimes and the survivors choosing to leave Atlanta to the walkers and head to Fort Benning. Along the way, they come across a traffic jam of vehicles on I-85. The group loots several vehicles and hide as walkers approach; Sophia, chased away from the camp by the walkers, runs off into the woods. The remaining group deals with interpersonal relationships while a search is performed. The searchers come across a deer, and Carl is accidentally shot as he approaches it. In a desperate bid to save Carl\\\'s life, Otis, the man who shot Carl, leads Rick and Shane to a large, isolated farm owned by a man named Hershel. The survivors move to the farm, where Rick\\\'s group and Hershel\\\'s group attempt to co-exist, but dangerous secrets on both sides threaten to unravel the shaky peace.
