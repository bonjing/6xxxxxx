Episode 3: Dangerous Driving
Original airdate: November 7, 2011

The remaining drivers start by quickly becoming distracted behind the wheel and learn how dangerous distracted driving can really be. It becomes quite clear that old habits need to change. Next, our drivers are paired-up and tackle the Head-to-Head Challenge. The race is on to see who understands the S-Turn. It is a challenge that is going to be double the fun and double the frustration.

Finally, the drivers race down the track and are required to check their blind spot to succeed in this task. Checking their blind spot remains to be challenging for some of our abysmal drivers. 

It's anybody's guess at this point as to who ultimately will be branded Canada's Worst Driver.
