Notes: Guitarist Duke Robillard emphasized the rocking blues and barrelhouse side of his musical personality on this session that highlighted what was then his band. Vocalist Susan Forrest provides a lusty, sensual quality while bassist Scott Appelrough and drummer Doug Hinman lay down sparse rhythmic backgrounds. Robillard provides the lead guitar presence and energy, adding more flashy chords, riffs, licks, and driving solos than on his more restrained jazz-based material. It's an effective session, though Forrest's vocals aren't always as hard-hitting as the material demands. But Robillard and his mates provide instrumental cover when Forrest doesn't quite hit the mark, and are even more on target when she does.
