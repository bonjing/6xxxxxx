Minstrels on Speed are a lo-fi alternative indie rock band from Edmonton, Alberta Canada. Band members include: Scott Lingley (Drums), Kelly Service (Guitar & Vocals), Bass (Ken Hartig), Nial Day (Guitar), Kelly McPhillamey (Vocals). There's not much information about these guys on the web so all I can tell you they were a local band. I actually did see them live once at a bar around 1995, can't even remember which one it was - I think somewhere on Whyte Ave but could have been downtown. They're a little rough around the edges but some decent indie alt-rock from the era.
