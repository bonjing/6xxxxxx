rs as a certified personal trainer (not my day job any more), this is still the book I recommend as a guide for beginners and the average person (not the meat head, gym rat type) that wants to learn proper nutrition and how to get into better shape. 
It is KISS simple, uncomplicated and continues to work years later. The trick? There is no trick. It just teaches a proper foundation of fitness and food. They make product recommendations but you can substitute other brands if you like. 

This works and you actually learn something!"
