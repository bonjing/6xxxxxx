Combining techniques of puppet animation, stop motion and live action, "Kooky" tells the story of a six-year-old asthmatic boy whose parents force him to throw away his favorite toy, an old teddy bear named Kooky. In the boy's fantasy, Kooky comes to life in the landfill, escapes into a mysterious forest and begins its journey amongst the rough-and-ready creatures of the forest.
