No IMDB link, no info on the source, audio/video quality, screenshots or anything.  Hell, usually it's in a RAR archive anyway.

How do these guys even get the green skull?!? 

We need to vote with our proverbial dollar and stop downloading from these guys.  Froggie100 popped out of nowhere and he's at least putting in the effort to make his uploads more accessible to PS3 users, people with NAS servers (RAR is crazy slow to uncompress) and a ton of info/screens.

AAAAHHHHH!!!"
