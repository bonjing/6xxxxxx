Episode 6: Hard!
Original airdate: November 28, 2011

Our drivers begin the episode by learning that anyone with a licence is allowed to drive a truck attached with a huge snow plow. But the question is, will Canada's worst drivers be able to plow their way through the challenge? Then, we find out what our drivers know about everyday rules of the road. The results will surprise you. Later, our drivers slide over to the curling ice and try their hand at Car Curling.

Using all they've learnt in rehab so far, they must deliver the best draw weight so the stone reaches the house. Finally, with training under their belts, they attempt the Moose Evasive Challenge. 

One driver heads back to the public roads after showing an improvement and our experts continue to watch closely to determine who will be Canada's Worst Driver.
