Pitty is just a lonely screw living on the very bottom of the Toolbox. Full of frost topped mountains, deep seas and lush green forests its rules are quite different from our own. You see it is also full of his enemies, vicious bolts, screwdrivers and circular saws, all desperate to see Pitty fail. His goal is simple: freedom. Pitty must navigate 10 of the most complex levels, filled with pitfalls and danger lurking just around a ledge.
