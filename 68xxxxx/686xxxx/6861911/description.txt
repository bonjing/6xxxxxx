[/b][/color] IIt is a time of darkness! It???s not a good time to be here.
A Skeleton Army is attacking Ninjago.
There???s a rumor that Lord Garmadon has returned, but that???s impossible.
He???s only a legend; a dark and terrible legend told to scare little children who misbehave.

But what if he???s real? What if he???s returned? Legend says, long ago before time had a name, Lord Garmadon tried to destroy Ninjago; to break it apart with the Power of Destruction.
But before he could, his brother Wu, a Spinjitzu Master saved us all by banishing Garmadon to the Underworld.

As I said, it is just a legend.
But still, the Skeleton Army is real, so where is the Spinjitzu Master.
Who will save us now?
