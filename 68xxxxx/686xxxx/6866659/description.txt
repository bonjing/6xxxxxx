Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Monday, December 5 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with Bruce Fein about the Ron Paul campaign. Mr. Fein specializes in in constitutional and international law. He served as an associate deputy attorney general from 1981 to 1982 under Reagan and as general counsel to the Federal Communications Commission. Fein is the author of Constitutional Peril: The Life and Death Struggle for Our Constitution and Democracy. 

Alex also confronts the latest news, including a Federal Reserve plan to give the IMF money for the eurozone debt crisis and a report that a record number of Americans are buying firearms as the prospect of a second Obama term approaches.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
