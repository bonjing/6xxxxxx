For most of the applications, rubber must be reinforced with certain fillers such as carbon blacks, silica or clay. As compared with microfiller reinforced rubber, nanofiller reinforced rubber exhibit high degree of hardness, modulus, anti-aging and gas barrier properties. Rubber-layered silicate, nanotubes and nanosized spherical particles have therefore attracted much attention recently because of their outstanding properties. Thomas and Stephen offer a systematic introduction to and an in-depth discussion of rubber nanocomposities.
