Gary Lineker presents highlights of today's Premier League clashes, including Aston Villa v Manchester United at Villa Park 
and Newcastle United v Chelsea at St James' Park. United had not lost away to Villa in the league since 1995, but had drawn 
on their last three visits, while the Blues were looking for an improvement on last season, when they failed to get the better 
of the Magpies on three occasions. Plus, action from Blackburn Rovers v Swansea City, Manchester City v Norwich City, 
Queens Park Rangers v West Bromwich Albion, Tottenham Hotspur v Bolton Wanderers and Wigan Athletic v Arsenal.
