thanks!"
disc DVD set contains four of the Christmas
Shows which the duo produced during their tenure at
the BBC. I’m not entirely sure why only four have been
included when they did one virtually every year until
1987, but there’s presumably some reason to do with
copyright or the like. Still all is not lost – the omissions
mean that we don’t have to see Phil Collins."
