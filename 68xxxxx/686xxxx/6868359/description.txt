                           ================================




In the modern world, witchcraft and witches are dismissed as fantasies, but in many cultures, magic is alive and its practitioners admired and feared.
Join National Geographic on a quest to find the stories behind the myths and legends of witchcraft. Along the way, we'll meet an anthropologist who became a believer in Mexico and a witch cleanser; in Zimbabwe.
