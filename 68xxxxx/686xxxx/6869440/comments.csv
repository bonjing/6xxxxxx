This is NOT from season 2, this is correctly labeled as being from Season 3, I've just downloaded and checked. The season 2 Christmas episode featured an artifact that was killing this douchebag executive guy in order to replace him with a more ""jolly"" version that wouldn't break promises to his daughter. 

THIS episode is the latest Christmas episode in which Pete has an ""It's a Wonderful Life"" thing where he sees how things would be if he hadn't been around. "
