For Tes (Akerman) and her two cohorts Kara (Nikki Reed, "Thirteen," the "Twilight" franchise) and Tara (Deborah Ann Woll, "True Blood"), the job sounded simple enough: intercept a double-cross drug shipment for their crime boss Mel (Willis) at an isolated diner. But when an unstoppable chain of events unfolds, everyone soon realizes no one is who they seem and the job may be something other than eliminating the competition. What started as simple instructions has now turned into a deadly cat-and-mouse game â€“ with large guns pointed at everyone.
