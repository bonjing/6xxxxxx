How To Turn A Woman On, Satisfy Her In A Big Way, And Get Her To Do
The Things You've Always Wanted
To begin with, I want to remind you of the differences between how
men and women approach and experience sex.
To set the stage, I first want to talk about â€œexperience.â€
As humans, we use our five primary senses to take in information
about the world. This is called â€œPerception.â€ Most of this happens on an
UNCONSCIOUS level.
We then take what we get from our senses and we process this
information. We compare it to what weâ€™ve experienced before, we classify it,
we imagine it in different ways, and we have UNCONSCIOUS reactions to it.
Next, we make decisions about what weâ€™re going to do with what we
just experienced. Again, these are mostly UNCONSCIOUS.
Finally, we take action on what we decided to do. You guessed it...
again, mostly unconsciously.
This description is oversimplified, but I think itâ€™s a useful model to
work with here.
Basically, I believe that men and women go through these four stages
a little differently. And when it comes to sex, I believe that they go through
them much differently.
I mention this because most people deal with other people the way
that they want to be dealt with. They communicate in ways that make sense
to themselves. They usually assume that they know whatâ€™s best for others
without checking first.
This only makes sense. Most people donâ€™t walk around saying to
themselves â€œHmmm, I wonder if Sarah tastes the same thing as I do when
she drinks coffee?â€ and â€œI wonder if water tastes exactly the same to her...
or if itâ€™s just slightly different...â€
Most people have asked these questions once or twice in life, but they
usually stop asking once they decide that most people have the same
experiences as they do when they drink coffee, etc.
