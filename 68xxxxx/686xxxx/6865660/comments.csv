I agree that the sound could of been much better but, -->> [AC3 192 kbit/s] should be more than enough.Think you might need an update on your codecs.

1) http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ (free player)

2) Or download K-lite codec pack.(Google it,different sources)

Hope you solve the issue.Enjoy and have a good day. "
