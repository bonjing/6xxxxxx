From the case-
Chip Miller, renowned collector and co-founder of Carlisle Events, eventually found and restored the #3 Cunningham Corvette, and was about to realize his dream of returning the car to LeMans in 2010, on the 50th Anniversary of its historic victory, when he lost his life to a rare disease called amyloidosis - a fatal affliction with no known cause or cure. The film chronicles how Chip's son, Lance Miller, picked up where his father left off, and accomplished his father's dream of taking the car back to France in June 2010, and leading a parade of Corvettes around the track - marking 50 years of Corvette racing at LeMans. Never before seen race footage, photos and interviews bring this story to life. Whether you are a hard core car buff, or just like a great story, this is a wonderful movie for all ages and interests.
