What i can tell you is to avoid to enable :
GPU acceleration video decoding (experimental)
is certain cases where vlc will not working properly if you enable it.
Btw do you have avivo,dndtranscoding or else installed.
May be another driver could be better for you.
You can contact me to :
tyrell.tpb@gmail.com
if you want other special great drivers and i will let you know where find it.
Anyway,i'm gonna up new build today,so let me know afterwards if this will be better for you so.
Marry christmas bud
