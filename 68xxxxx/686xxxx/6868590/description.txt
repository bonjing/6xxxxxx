One of the toughest challenges novice CSS developers face is when seemingly perfect code doesnâ€™t translate into a perfectly rendered browser pageâ€”and with all the different browsers available today, this happens all too often. The CSS Detective Guide aims to help, by teaching real world troubleshooting skills. Youâ€™ll learn how to track clues, analyze the evidence, and get to the truth behind CSS mysteries. These arenâ€™t pat solutions, but rather strategies for thinking about CSS. Author Denise Jacobs begins by going over the basics of CSS with a special emphasis on common causes of problems. Then she shows you methods for giving your code the third degree. Then youâ€™ll take a look at the line-up of usual suspects, the common problems and persistent bugs that are often encountered in CSS.

Finally, youâ€™ll have the chance to play detective and find the guilty culprit in:

    * The Case of the Devilish Details

    * The Case of the Mistaken Identity

    * The Case of the Single White Space

    * The Case of the Float with a Mind of Its Own

    * The Case of the Browser Who Hated Me

    * The Case of the LOL Layout

At the end, youâ€™ll find that you can crack any case and solve any future mystery that you encounter, and your coding problems will become elementary.
