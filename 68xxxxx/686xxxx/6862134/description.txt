Batman: Arkham City builds upon the intense, atmospheric foundation of Batman: Arkham Asylum, sending players soaring into Arkham City, the new maximum security home for all of Gotham Cityï¿½â‚¬â„¢s thugs, gangsters and insane criminal masterminds. Set inside the heavily fortified walls of a sprawling district in the heart of Gotham City, this highly anticipated sequel introduces a brand-new story that draws together a new all-star cast of classic characters and murderous villains from the Batman universe, as well as a vast range of new and enhanced gameplay features to deliver the ultimate experience as the Dark Knight.

Features:
Become the Dark Knight ï¿½â‚¬â€ Batman: Arkham City delivers a genuinely authentic Batman experience with advanced, compelling gameplay on every level: high-impact street brawls, nail-biting stealth, multifaceted forensic investigation, epic super-villain encounters and unexpected glimpses into Batmanï¿½â‚¬â„¢s tortured psychology.
Play as Catwoman ï¿½â‚¬â€ Catwoman is a fully playable character in Batman: Arkham City who has her own storyline in the main game which is seamlessly interwoven with Batmanï¿½â‚¬â„¢s story arc. Her navigation skills, combat moves and gadgetry have been specifically designed to deliver a fully featured and unique experience.
Advanced FreeFlow Combat ï¿½â‚¬â€ Batman faces highly coordinated, simultaneous attacks from every direction as Arkhamï¿½â‚¬â„¢s gangs bring heavy weapons and all-new AI to the fight, but Batman steps it up with twice the number of combat animations and double the range of attacks, counters and takedowns.

New Gadgets ï¿½â‚¬â€ Batman has access to new gadgets such as the Cryptographic Sequencer V2 and Smoke Pellets, as well as new functionality for existing gadgets that expand the range of Batmanï¿½â‚¬â„¢s abilities without adding extra weight to his Utility Belt.

New Story ï¿½â‚¬â€ Five-time Emmy-Award-winner Paul Dini returns to pen a brand-new story for Batman: Arkham City, taking gamers deep inside the diseased heart of Gotham.

Arkham Has Moved ï¿½â‚¬â€ Following the closure of Arkham Asylum and Blackgate prison, Gothamï¿½â‚¬â„¢s new mayor, Quincy Sharp ordered the relocation of all inmates to Arkham City. This sprawling new super-prison is five times bigger than Arkham Island, enclosing a wide variety of industrial districts, iconic locations and Gotham landmarks.
