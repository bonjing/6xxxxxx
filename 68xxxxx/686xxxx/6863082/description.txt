[/b][/color] Everybody has a ghost story.
But how many people have filmed theirs? Hear true and unbelievable stories of the paranormal as told by the people who lived through them--and actually captured their hauntings on tape.
These harrowing eye-witness accounts of the unexplainable are transformed into more than tales with terrifying visual evidence.
You'll have no choice but to believe your eyes.
