LochMaster 4.0 is a developers tool for strip board projects. It has useful functions for designing, documenting and testing project boards. Therefore you will find functions like auto-generation of components lists, a connection test, a editable library with a large number of symbols and components, and many more. The latest version comes a long with new practical features, like parallel usage of mm, inch and hole grids. It is still compatible with all previous versions. You can load and edit any project you have already designed with LochMaster.

LochMaster displays both sides of the board, which are editable simultaneously. You can choose from several board types with different layouts and grids. All required functions, like wiring, splitting tracks, soldering, placing components, etc. are included and appear very realistic. The well-sorted and extendable library contains lots of material, that can be placed on the board: Electric and electronic components, mechanical elements, symbols and labels are available. Even â€œflyingâ€ soldering points are handled.
