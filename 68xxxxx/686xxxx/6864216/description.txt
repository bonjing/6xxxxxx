Guns and bombs are childrenâ€™s toys. A true war wages, and youâ€™re invited. ITâ€™S AN INVITATION you may not be able to accept if you want to, or decline if you donâ€™t. Itâ€™s an invitation to fight in a war like no other; a war where loss is counted as gain, surrender as victory, and where the enemy you must face, an enemy of unimaginable superiority, is yourself. Spiritual Warfare issues a damning and irrefutable indictment of its own audience and genre, putting spirituality and religion themselves on trial. Spiritual Warfare is a sharp-edged book for those who want to experience a direct and authentic spirituality.
