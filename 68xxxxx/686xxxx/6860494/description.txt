your holiday pictures. This way you can later find all pictures
you took at that destination very fast.

Be creative and edit your digital pictures according to your
wishes. Optimize photos with one click, remove red eyes or use
different effects, like color changes, for your image editing.
Turn your most beautiful images into oil paintings, create a
calendar with your own pictures or a personal invitation with a
funny picture of the last party.

With the grouping function in the improved miniature view you
can get a better overview of your pictures by filtering them
according to certain terms (tags), model of the camera, file
format etc.

Tagging
You can now tag your photos, this means that you assign certain
terms to your photos. These will be saved to the IPTC meta data
and simplify for example the detection or grouping of pictures.

Batch processing
Batch processing significantly reduces the amount of effort
when editing photos. You can convert several pictures into a
new format at once or apply effects to a bunch of pictures.

and TIFF multi pages of your pictures can be created in next to
no time.

management, optimization and editing processes concerning your
digital photos. The miniature view in the user interface allows

in a folder. Of course, you can also sort your photos according
to date and time when the photo was taken (Â“calendar overviewÂ”)
or you can filter the photos according to different criteria,
e.g. only .jpg files, not older than two month or tagged with a
certain term.

Not only pictures, but also audio and video collections are
neatly displayed. Photos can be grouped differently or compiled
in a virtual album for further editing. Batch processing allows
you to select several pictures for editing, e.g. convert them
into a different format.

The editing and quick-fix modes in Ashampoo Photo Commander 9
are designed clearly and intuitively so that you can give free
rein to your creativity and experiment with effects and
functions. ItÂ’s easy to rotate pictures, adjust horizontal
nonalignment, crop images, remove red eyes and lots more. With
just a click photos can be optimized or changed using effects,
e.g. inversion, pixelization or outlining of contours.

Ashampoo Photo Commander 9 also offers you several cool features
to present your photos. Create for example a slideshow or an HTML
album in order to show your photos to family and friends.
Collages as well as greeting cards or calendars are easily
produced in next to no time.

Moreover, Ashampoo Photo Commander 9 enables you to make
screenshots, scan images as well as print photos, send them by
e-mail or burn them on a disc.
