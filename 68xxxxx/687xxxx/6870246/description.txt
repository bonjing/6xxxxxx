Quote:
Wally and Ost are just average office workers...IN THE FUTURE! Office life hasn't changed much in few thousand years. Sure there are all kinds of futuristic thing-a-ma-bobs like rebelling A.I. office equipment, aliens, and teleporters that clone. But one thing that will never change is that you are waiting for the day to end and getting into trouble trying to make the day go by as quick as possible.

Cubicles: The Movie...The Graphic novel takes Wally and Ost out of the office and into the largest space adventure of their volume 1 lives. Follow the duo as they take on angry aliens, plundering pirates, and slimy space squid. Will they save their company? Will they get the girl? Will they get a raise?
