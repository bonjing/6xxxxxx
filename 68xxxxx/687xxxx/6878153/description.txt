From Wikipedia:

Pin Ups is the seventh album by David Bowie, containing cover versions of songs, released by RCA Records in 1973 (see 1973 in music). It was his last studio album with the bulk of 'The Spiders From Mars', his backing band throughout his Ziggy Stardust phase; Mick Woodmansey was replaced on drums by Aynsley Dunbar.

Pin Ups entered the UK chart on 3 November 1973 (1973-11-03) (coincidentally the same day as Bryan Ferry's covers album These Foolish Things) and stayed there for 21 weeks, peaking at #1. It re-entered the chart on 30 April 1983 (1983-04-30), this time for 15 weeks, peaking at #57. In July 1990 (1990-07) it again entered the chart, for one week, at #52.

A version of The Velvet Underground's "White Light/White Heat" was recorded during the sessions. It was never released; Bowie donated the backing track to Mick Ronson for his 1975 album Play Don't Worry.

Pin Ups was the first of two "1960's nostalgia" albums that Bowie had planned to release. The second, which was planned to be called "Bowie-ing Out," would have contained Bowie covering his favorite American artists, but was never recorded.[4]

In the album booklet, Bowie himself describes Pin Ups as:

"These songs are among my favourites from the '64â€“67' period of London. / Most of the groups were playing the Ricky-Tick (was it a 'y' or an 'i'?) -Scene club circuit (Marquee, eel pie island la-la). / Some are still with us. / Pretty Things, Them, Yardbirds, Syd's Pink Floyd, Mojos, Who, Easybeats, Merseys, The Kinks. / Love-on ya!"

Pin Ups fits into David Bowie's output roughly where Moondog Matinee (which, strangely enough, appeared the very same month) did into the Band's output, which is to say that it didn't seem to fit in at all. Just as a lot of fans of Levon Helm et al. couldn't figure where a bunch of rock & roll and R&B; covers fit alongside their output of original songs, so Bowie's fans -- after enjoying a string of fiercely original LPs going back to 1970's The Man Who Sold the World -- weren't able to make too much out of Pin Ups' new recordings of a brace of '60s British hits. Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane had established Bowie as perhaps the most fiercely original of all England's glam rockers (though Marc Bolan's fans would dispute that to their dying day), so an album of covers didn't make any sense and was especially confusing for American fans -- apart from the Easybeats' "Friday on My Mind" and the Yardbirds' "Shapes of Things," little here was among the biggest hits of their respective artists' careers, and the Who's "I Can't Explain" and "Anyway Anyhow Anywhere" were the only ones whose original versions were easily available or played very often on the radio; everything else was as much a history lesson, for Pink Floyd fans whose knowledge of that band went back no further than Atom Heart Mother, or into Liverpool rock (the Merseys' "Sorrow"), as it was a tour through Bowie's taste in '60s music. The latter was a mixed bag stylistically, opening with the Pretty Things' high-energy Bo Diddley homage "Rosalyn" and segueing directly into a hard, surging rendition of Them's version of Bert Berns' "Here Comes the Night," filled with crunchy guitars; "I Wish You Would" and "Shapes of Things" were both showcases for Bowie's and Mick Ronson's guitars, and "See Emily Play" emphasized the punkish (as opposed to the psychedelic) side of the song. "Sorrow," which benefited from a new saxophone break, was actually a distinct improvement over the original, managing to be edgier and more elegant all at once, and could easily have been a single at the time, and Bowie's slow version of "I Can't Explain" was distinctly different from the Who's original -- in other words, Pin Ups was an artistic statement, of sorts, with some thought behind it, rather than just a quick album of oldies covers to buy some time, as it was often dismissed as being. In the broader context of Bowie's career, Pin Ups was more than an anomaly -- it marked the swan song for the Spiders from Mars and something of an interlude between the first and second phases of his international career; the next, beginning with Diamond Dogs, would be a break from his glam rock phase, going off in new directions. It's not a bad bridge between the two, and it has endured across the decades -- and the CD remasterings since the late '90s have made it worth discovering all over again.

Perhaps the covers album Pin Ups was conceived as a breather, a way for David Bowie and the Spiders From Mars to regroup amid the hysteria of the Ziggy Stardust mania, or perhaps it was meant as a genuine tribute to Bowie's influences. Either way, Pin Ups was the first sign that the Ziggy persona was running out of energy. The album isn't bad -- in fact, it's an energetic, infectious collection of relatively obscure British rock & roll, R&B;, and mod anthems -- but the timing of a covers album was odd, suggesting that Bowie was running out of ideas. On its own, Pin Ups is quite enjoyable, especially since the selections are fairly arcane. Bowie relies primarily on songs that never were hits outside America -- even the Kinks, Who, Yardbirds, and Pink Floyd songs were relatively obscure -- which makes the record fascinating. Bowie and the Spiders make songs by the Pretty Things ("Rosalyn," "Don't Bring Me Down"), the Merseys ("Sorrow"), and the Easybeats ("Friday on My Mind") tough and nervy, occasionally surpassing the original versions in terms of attitude. So, if Pin Ups isn't a major entry in Bowie's catalog, it is fun, even though it's a rather undistinguished final effort from the Spiders From Mars.
