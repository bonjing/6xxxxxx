Okay, so this is an updated torrent by me (originally ZnaxQue, but my account got messed up).

Again, contains an ISO image extracted directly from the original Unreal I CD, as well as the 227h patch (check oldunreal.com for new updates now and then).


How to install:
---------------

1. Extract the two 7z archives (containing the iso, and the patch) to desired
   directory on your hard drive (for example, your desktop).
 
2. Use a virtual CD/DVD emulator program such as Daemon Tools to mount the ISO
   image as a virtual CD.

3. Install the game from the virtual CD you just mounted.

4. When the game is installed, patch the game using the patch provided.

5. PLAY!

Making your own maps:
---------------------
If you feel like creating your own maps, just launch the Unreal Editor 2.0. It\'s really easy to learn, Wolf has a great guide:

Have fun playing the game, and enjoy the stunning graphics!

(Best played on a computer with Pentium MMX 266MHz,  with two 3DFX Voodoo 2 cards). ;)
