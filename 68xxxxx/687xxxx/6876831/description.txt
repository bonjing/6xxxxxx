Opposites attract, but can they survive and get their own happy ending?
Hannah (Gracie Glam) and Scott (Brendon Miller) are like night and day. She is granola; he is metal. She owns a spa; he is a tattoo artist. She enjoys yoga; he likes beer.
Yet despite their differences, it's love at first sight. That is...until their meddling best friends Alexis and Doug (Stormy Daniels and Barrett Blade) convince each of them that the other is having an affair. After some poorly planned and disastrous detective work, Hannah and Scott go their separate ways.
Realizing how miserable they have made their friends, it is now up to Alexis and Doug to fix the mess they have made. And who knows? They may even get a happy ending of their own along the way...
