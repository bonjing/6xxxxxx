Behind every box office hit is a Hollywood mogulâ€¦ in The Movies Superstar Edition, that mogul is you!

Starting out at the dawn of cinema, itâ€™s up to you to build your studio from an empty lot into a glittering Hollywood empire by producing must-see blockbusters, creating huge stars and giving the movie-going public exactly what they want to see. Itâ€™s not all award-parties thoughâ€¦ youâ€™ll need to balance spiralling budgets, fierce competition, and worst of all, actorsâ€™ egos if you want to make it to the top.

When itâ€™s time to start the cameras rolling, settle into the directorâ€™s chair! The Movies comes packed with tools to help you write and direct your own films. Once youâ€™ve polished your films to perfection, you can upload them to YouTube and show the world your best shots.

Included in the Superstar Edition is the Stunts & Effects expansion pack, which adds more sets, costumes, props, vehicles and backdrops for your virtual productions, along with a new employee type: the stuntman, and a host of new creative options with which to dazzle the audience.
