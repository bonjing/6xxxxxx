,Dude1217,2012-03-20T14:24Z,Nice attempt and I commend you on it but the 3D effects aren't very good due to low resolution. I have never seen a 3D movie file worth watching in less than 10gb file. My TV is way too picky but thats what you get I guess when you are picky about what type of 3D TV you wanna buy. Too pixelated and blurry for my taste on my TV but another quick conversion and it works good on my Nintendo 3DS
