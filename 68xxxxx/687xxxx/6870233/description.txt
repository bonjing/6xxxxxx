Science Documentary hosted by James May, published by BBC in 2011 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

James May continues his epic quest to re-skill the modern male.


1)  Navigation 
A handcuffed James and Oz Clarke break out of Dartmoor prison and must navigate their way across the treacherous moors, with a team of trackers in hot pursuit and just an Ordnance Survey map and a compass to help them. James also builds a genuine slate-bed pool table, turns his hand to portrait painting and squares up to one of the most terrifying scenarios the modern male can face: how to remember people's names at a party.

2)  Making Bog Roll 
James and the team reunite a former teenage rock band and gets them to play their first concert in 20 years - in front of 5,000 unsuspecting festival goers. James also demonstrates his own axe skills as he fells a tree, makes toilet paper out of Richard Hammond's autobiography and learns how to tame his fears by going on a good old-fashioned ghost hunt in one of Britain's most haunted castles.

3)  Catwalk 
James takes to the catwalk to liberate men from the tyranny of fashion and promote the one item of clothing they'll ever need - a cunningly modified boiler suit. He also does his bit for the British space project by sending the ashes of a cat and a budgie 100,000 feet into the stratosphere, re-forms some impractical kitchen items into the perfect lemon squeezer in his very own foundry, and teaches Man Lab's musically-challenged males how to cheat at playing the guitar.

4)  Penalty 
James May attempts to prove the impossible - that an Englishman can take a penalty and score. He will need to keep a cool head as he'll be taking the penalty in front of 20,000 baying German fans on the exact spot where England were knocked out of the 2006 World Cup. Plus, James reinstates an ancient ferry crossing by building a boat from little more than bendy sticks, creates an indoor garden in the ultimate brown field site - the toilet, and builds the world's first multi-functional Swiss Army Bike.
