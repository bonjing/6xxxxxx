Unlike some others here who compellingly showed they don't know caca (you?), I didn't disparage Acrobat products. Au contraire!  OTOH I plead guilty to ""spamming"" for a _freeware_ PDF reader that abides only loosely to the different PDF standards and will display about any PDF file, standard-abiding or not. Moreover it is lightweight and very easy to use. I ain't here to scare but to help. Now how much time would it take you to spot a single object 5 characters long inserted non-compliantly in a 100-MB PDF stream? I'll take the wild guess you wouldn't know a PDF stream if it bit your sorry a**. But don't sweat it, chap, ignorance is bliss, eh?"
