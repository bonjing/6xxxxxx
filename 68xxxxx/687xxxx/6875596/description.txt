The Twist in the Twister

The team discovers the remains of a
so-called "storm chaser" who seems to
have died while following a tornado.
But footage recorded during the storm
ultimately leads them to believe he
was murdered. Meanwhile, Booth
becomes increasingly overprotective
of Brennan both at home and in the
field, and sleep-deprived Angela and
Hodgins come to terms with having
Angela's father and rock musician
babysit their infant son
