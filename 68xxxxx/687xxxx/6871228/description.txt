The lineup for L.A.'s 1000 Mona Lisas coalesced in 1993 around vocalist/guitarist Armando Prado (b. Glendale, CA), bassist Gianni Neiviller (b. Hollywood, CA) and drummer Rocco Bidlovski (b. Brazil); Bidlovski had previously played with the South American band Tokyo before coming to the U.S. The group's California punk/hardcore attitude and style is laced with melodic power-pop on two releases, the Slammin' EP and 1995's debut album New Disease, produced by Geza X (Black Flag, Dead Kennedys).
