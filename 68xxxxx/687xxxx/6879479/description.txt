BBC Radio 4 Plays for January 2011 
 
I have captured these myself so the quality (be it good or bad) is at least consistent.
 
If you are unfamiliar with BBC Radio plays I can recommend them for quality and variety ranging through humour, pathos, sci-fi, crime, romance, documentary etc. etc. etc. 
 
The format is CD quality (128kbps, 44kHz, Stereo, CBR).
They are all fully tagged with Title, Author, Date, Comments and Cover Art. 
 
The 22 Afternoon plays run for approx. 45 minutes each.
The 3  Friday plays run for approx. 55 minutes each.
The 5  Saturday plays run for approx. 60 or 90 minutes each. 
 
If these prove popular I shall continue with the plays for this year.
 
One caveat, you must be patient with my upload times and speed. I shall be active as often as possible but NOT 24/7.
