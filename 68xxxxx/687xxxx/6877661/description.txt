-Notes-
I want to thank everyone in the Taleworlds community, and especially everyone in the ChineseMB forums.
If you don't know about ChineseMB you should register there and go to there english forum.
I want to give a special thanks to all of my mod supporters.
Without them I wouldn't have known how important this mod is to everyone.
I greatly respect the previous SOD modders of the Classic M&B; Era.
I hope to take this mod to the next level.
Also I'm still looking for work and I'm pretty much self taught.
So if anyone is hiring in computer or game design send me a message. ;D
