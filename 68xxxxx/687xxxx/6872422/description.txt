"Purple Hearts"

Harry, Oliver and Cassie struggle to 
defend their client, a mother who stands 
accused of killing her infant son who 
suffered from a debilitating disorder with 
no hope for a cure. Meanwhile, Tommy and 
Adam represent a former-soldier-turned-
clown who, after suffering a minor 
traumatic brain injury in the Iraq War, 
was deemed ineligible for a Purple Heart. 
In the holiday spirit, Tommy and Adam try 
to get the veteran the recognition he 
deserves.
