In Detail

The HTML5 canvas is revolutionizing graphics and visualizations on the Web. Powered by JavaScript, the HTML5 Canvas API enables web developers to create visualizations and animations right in the browser for the first time without Flash. HTML5 Canvas is being considered as the future of graphics and interactivity on the Web and yet most developers fail to exercise all of the features that this powerful technology has to offer.

HTML5 Canvas Cookbook covers the fundamental methods and properties of the HTML5 canvas API. As soon as you are familiar with the API, the book provides advanced techniques for handling animations, image and video manipulations, canvas interactivity, data visualizations, game development, 3D modeling, and more.

HTML5 Canvas Cookbook begins by covering the basics of the HTML5 Canvas API and then provides techniques for handling features not directly supported by the API such as animations and canvas interactivity. It winds up by providing detailed templates for a few of the most common HTML5 canvas applications - data visualization, game development, and 3D modeling. It will acquaint you with interesting topics such as fractals, principles of animation, physics, color models, matrix mathematics, and 3D projection.

By the end of this book, you will have a solid understanding of the HTML5 canvas API and a toolbox of techniques for creating any type of HTML5 Canvas application, limited only by the extent of your imagination.
