d Mike and Randi, well those that lusten that is, too bad fucking TV would mention about their radio shows, you know, get more to lusten, well it's a war, they have no friends on TV and neither do we.

folks, turn off your TV, you will be more informed.

i am reading the new book about T. E. Lawrence, called ""Hero"", very interesting to know about him and what a super media star he was in the 1920s. there is a great BBC documentary (oh, a TV show, smile) here, made in 2009.
check it out.  "
