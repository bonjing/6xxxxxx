And as usual audio will be in US english and French language,both to DTS-HD Master audio 5.1.
This explains why most of my BDRip are somewhat bigger and so huge aswell.
I prefer keep the Original sound anyway to keep the best original sound quality.
The Ambiance/Atmosphere must stay intact for best joy as possible,for me,so.
Btw,i still/often use Special higher screen resolution aswell.
As the source is a BD,i think that all must be replicated as best as possible.
Most of my BDRip are perfectly fitting with all/any WideScreen,PC or TV anyway.

All has been reconverted as i usually made so.
