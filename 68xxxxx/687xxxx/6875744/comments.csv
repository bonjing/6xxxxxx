My screen turns black, flashes a few times and the cursor appears and nothing happens. i pressed ctrl alt delete and found out that it has stopped working. what happened?"
ut don't worry, the game may be English. Same procedure with my Mass Effect 3 [Lossless Rep also], the installation is in Russian but the game contents are all in English.  Just follow what your common sense dictates you and proceed to the installation process by clicking the corresponding buttons based on how you usually install other games - Back button is at the Left, Cancel at the Right and Install in the middle... I guess or something like that. Just try to experiment, don't be scared by all those weird writings."
