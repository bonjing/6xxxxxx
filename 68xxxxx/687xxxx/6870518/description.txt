The Strange Case of the Man in the Velvet Jacket

From BBC Radio 3. Written by Robert Forrest; Full-cast dramatisation.

A powerful and intriguing original play based on the writer Robert Louis Stevenson's early life in Edinburgh.

Set in 1873, the play focuses on Stevenson as a young man invigorated by the intellectual maelstrom that was still challenging the way people saw and navigated the world of arts, science and politics following the Enlightment. He may have been unsure of what his role in all this could be, but it was the things he knew he had to reject - belief in God, a career in law or engineering - that were creating turmoil in his own mind and heartache in his relationship with his parents. And meanwhile his discovery of the female species was also pre-occupying his thoughts and emotions.
