****************************************************************
The Griswolds' Christmas holiday is anything but an occasion for peace on earth and there's certainly not much goodwill to spare when the rest of the repulsive family arrive for a spot of rejoicing. The third in the series is one of the best - who hasn't lived through the horror of hanging the Christmas lights and then spending hours looking for the one bulb that's broken?
