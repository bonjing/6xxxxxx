\"THE COKE NEW MUSIC PODCAST WITH ADAM & JOE (2006-2007)

We started doing these in September 2006 and after a shaky start, theyâ€™re got a lot better but after a year and 13 shows we decided to move on. Essentially it was me and Joe playing a selection of some of the best music from unsigned bands who had uploaded their songs to the Coke Music website. You should still be able to download them from I-tunes (theyâ€™re free) or listen on the Coke website here.\"
