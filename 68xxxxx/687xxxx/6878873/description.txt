Jerry Garcia, David Grisman & Tony Rice - The Complete Pizza Tapes

The informal once-in-a lifetime jam session that brought guitar icons Jerry Garcia and Tony Rice together with their mandolin-picking host David Grisman was recorded in Dawg Studios on two successive evenings in February, 1993. The Pizza Tapes CD (2000) soon became an acoustic classic and one of Acoustic Discâ€™s most popular releases.

Now hereâ€™s the Extra Large 170-minute edition of this legendary session, including 16 previously unissued alternate takes in addition to the original master takes in their original sequence.  This unique collection also features more of the personal repartee, which made the original release so endearing and insightful â€” the anatomy of this very special jam.
