I'm from Barcelona is a pop group from JÃ¶nkÃ¶ping, Sweden, best known for its 29 band members and eclectic mix of instruments such as clarinets, saxophones, flutes, trumpets, banjos, accordions, kazoos, guitars, drums, and keyboards among others. While most band members provide backing vocals on releases and during live performances, Emanuel Lundgren is founder, principal songwriter and lead singer for the group.

In 2006 the band released an EP entitled Don't Give Up on Your Dreams, Buddy! as well as a full length album, Let Me Introduce My Friends - both of which were well-received critically. Their second full-length album, Who Killed Harry Houdini?, was released in October 2008.(wikipedia)

Forever Today, is an infectious, catchy-as-hell, big, breezy, summery statement that doesnt boast a single bad apple across its expansive ten tracks. Its a return to Im From Barcelonas notably twee sound, considering that their sophomore record, 2008s Who Killed Harry Houdini?, was a remarkably darker and more melancholic affair. But, here, Im From Barcelona mastermind Emanuel Lundgren has opened the blinds on his bedroom window, and just let the lazy sunshine come flooding right in. (popmatters.com)
