    Music Video for "Santa Claus Is Coming To Town" Holiday Song.Bieber delivered the first of two versions of the video soon after animagic creation featuring  his likeness in the recording studio and riding Santaâ€™s sleigh with no danger in sight, save for a flying reindeer thatâ€™s lost his way. Now weâ€™ve been given the second clip, whose steampunk leanings feature Bieber and his fellow Ambassadors of Joy taking a dance break from their otherwise grueling holiday work. One top hat away from being the Artful Dodger, Bieber finds himself in a much scarier workshop than what was home to Tim Allen in the â€™90s, dancing among some oversized toys and teeny tiny Newsie lookalikes. Despite his pained expressions willing Santa to come this way, we never get to see the Big Man in the flesh.
