This is a rip of a VHS tape featuring Slaughter, a couple of their early music videos, as well as lots of backstage footage and clowning around on the bus.

I've included scans of the front/back covers for complete details.  I've also pulled out "Up All Night" as a separate file.  Enjoy!

Technical: VHS tape is coded to a single file, DivX compatible, 640x480, about 1.5kbps, with MP3 audio.

File plays fine in mPlayer, DivX Player, Windows Media Player (with DivX codec), etc.
