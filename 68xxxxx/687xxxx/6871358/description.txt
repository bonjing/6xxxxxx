Light Yagami explains to Ryuk that he is trying to create an ideal world where no criminals are left unpunished, and "as the god of such a world", he cannot sacrifice half his life for the shinigami eyes. The protagonist then goes on to wonder how much control he can have over the deaths of criminals and decides to experiment. Light's father is soon puzzled at the odd reports he receives â€” as is L. 6 prisoners are dead, 3 in odd circumstances. One drew a pentagram in his own blood; the second wrote a rambling note; the third escaped, then died in the staff bathroom. However Light was not able to get prisoners to draw L's face, or escape to France in an hour or write 'L suspects the Japanese police', learning that even the Death Note is not that powerful. Hacking into the police computer records, Light discovers that L doesn't want this to be reported to the media. Later, in an attempt to kill the tracker who is following him, Light creates a plan but is careful not to arouse the suspicion of the tracker, who is really a Federal Agent from the United States named Raye Penber, employed by L and Watari.
He arranges a bus jacking by a drug dealer, Kiichiro Osoreda who was tricked into touching a piece of the Death Note, sees Ryuk, fires his gun, then gets off and is run over. During it, Light tricks Ray Penber into showing him his ID as proof he is not with the busjacker.
