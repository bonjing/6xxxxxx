Encounters at the End of the World
Acclaimed film director Werner Herzog travels to Antarctica to uncover the raw beauty and humanity on this fascinating continent. Accompanied by cinematographer Peter Zeitlinger, they meet the people who live and work there, and capture footage of a variety of unique locations. They begin their journey at McMurdo Station interviewing the community's maintenance and support workers. McMurdo Station is the largest settlement in Antarctica and has grown to accommodate approximately 1,000 people during the summer months. They then embark on a series of discoveries, including traveling by snowmobile to a nearby seal camp. Supervised by zoologist Olav Oftedal, they learn more about the feed cycle of the Weddell seal. In his first documentary since 'Grizzly Man', Herzog exposes the reality of Antarctica as you have never seen it before. 
Review

Extraordinary Herzog finds breathtaking beauty here in the awesome scale of things FOUR STARS --Uncut

Superb. It also contains some of the most jaw-dropping photography you're likely to see this year. Powerful... eye-boggling... utterly masterful. FIVE STARS --Timeout

Breathtaking almost every image is astonishing. This is a film that makes our existence feel utterly insignificant in the most life-affirming manner possible. Brilliant. 9/10 --Clash
