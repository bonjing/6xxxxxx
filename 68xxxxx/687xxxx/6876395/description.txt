Although heâ€™ll be best known in these quarters for his contribution to Ryan Adamsâ€™ backing band as lead guitarist of the Cardinals, Neal Casal has now released some ten albums in his own name, as well as a lavish volume of impressive photography, documenting an artful expose of the life of a working rock band touring hard, spreading their message to the world. Heâ€™s also contributed to several movies, including being a vocal coach to Owen Wilson, and he has toured with Lucinda Williams, Mark Olsen and Rufus Wainwright amongst others.

Perhaps fittingly enough for a CV of such note, Casal has a supremely confident and relaxed approach on this concise collection of songs that oozes melodic charm and presence at every juncture. Casal himself has a likeable, light voice which possesses some latter-day Lennon in its melodic distinction and nasal delivery, best sampled on the lazy title track with its rich layers of sound and wonderful familiar acoustic guitar figures.

Although not really ever sounding like his former bandleader for a minute, fans of Ryan Adams wont be too disappointed in much of the material here. The acoustic-driven groove of â€˜Bird With No Nameâ€™, the impressive title track and the hypnotic â€˜Girls of Winterâ€™ have definite traces of Adamsâ€™ heartbroken poetics, and post-country balladeering. â€˜Feathers for Bakersfieldâ€™ is an absolutely wonderful break-up soul searching ballad, framed perfectly with subtle orchestration, and houses Casalâ€™s most sensitive and measured vocals. If Ryan had recorded this weâ€™d all be reaching for superlatives.

If â€˜Sweeten the Distanceâ€™ had been released at a different time itâ€™s craft and soul would sound completely at home amongst the warm breezes of the early 70s California valleys, FM radio and, for example, James Taylorâ€™s major works. With every song a subtle delight, â€˜Sweeten the Distanceâ€™ is a masterful album of brilliantly soulful Americana music and should be edging towards the top of your CD shopping list. A really enjoyable record
