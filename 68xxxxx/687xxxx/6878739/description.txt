TeraCopy is a compact program designed to copy and move files at the maximum possible speed, providing the user with a lot of features: 
-Copy files faster. TeraCopy uses dynamically adjusted buffers to reduce seek times. Asynchronous copy speeds up file transfer between two physical hard drives.
-Pause and resume file transfers. Pause copy process at any time to free up system resources and continue with a single click.
-Error recovery. In case of copy error, TeraCopy will try several times and in the worse case just skip the file, not terminating the entire transfer.
-Interactive file list. TeraCopy shows failed file transfers and lets you fix the problem and recopy only problem files.
-Shell integration. TeraCopy can completely replace Explorer copy and move functions, allowing you work with files as usual.
-Full Unicode support.
-Windows 8 x64 support.
