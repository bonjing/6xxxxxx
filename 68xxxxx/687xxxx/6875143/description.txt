November 3, 2011 - Altiverb 6.3.7 for Mac OS X, all plug-in formats 

[Mac] installer now works on Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) 
[Mac] preferences are now saved in user preferences, as Mac OS 10.7 does not allow read&write; in global folder anymore.                                                      

1 known issue: Audio Unit fails validation in Logic 9, however as 'incompatible' plug-in Altiverb 6 functions fine, the next update will address this issue.
