,zafpak,2011-12-09T06:41Z,Thanks for upload SEP V11 RU7 MP1. We are using V11 RU6 MP3 and no problem at all.
ses definitions till August 16 2011 or so... which is pretty well to start with...also may use the alternative to live update, the offline sfx definitions update launchers...named:

2011XXYY-ZZZ-v5i32.exe , for 32 bits
and
2011XXYY-ZZZ-v5i64.exe , for 64 bits

from here:

or just use Live update that launches by itself when finishing the program installation session."
