LEONARDO DA VINCI
By MAURICE W. BROCKWELL
Illustrated With Eight Reproductions in Colour

"Leonardo," wrote an English critic as far back as 1721, "was a Man so
happy in his genius, so consummate in his Profession, so accomplished
in the Arts, so knowing in the Sciences, and withal, so much esteemed
by the Age wherein he lived, his Works so highly applauded by the
Ages which have succeeded, and his Name and Memory still preserved
with so much Veneration by the present Age--that, if anything could
equal the Merit of the Man, it must be the Success he met with.
Moreover, 'tis not in Painting alone, but in Philosophy, too, that
Leonardo surpassed all his Brethren of the 'Pencil.'"
This admirable summary of the great Florentine painter's life's work
still holds good to-day.
