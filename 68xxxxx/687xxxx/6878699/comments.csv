I've been unemployed for over 3 years now and I really can't afford to go out and rent these movies/shows, much less buy them. I pray every day that God will make His plan for me known and provide a way.

Now, do you have any way of getting subtitles/srt files for these shows? I like to keep the subtitles on the screen so the kids might ""soak up"" the reading. English mainly, however, other languages are good to."
