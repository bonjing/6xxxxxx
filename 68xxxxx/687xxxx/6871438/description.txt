There's absolutely no fluff, and the presence on CD of rare cuts like the Young Holt Trio's "Wack Wack" and Alvin Cash & the Crawlers' "Twine Time" is most welcome. (AMG)




The most consistently enticing disc in the Rock Instrumental Classics series, this is both a great party and driving record and a window on the rhythms that powered soul music in the '60s (and early '70s, in two cases).
In addition to some obvious choices (the four Booker T. & the MG's tracks, the Mar-Keys' 'Last Night' ), it also offers some left-field picks, such as the varied approaches to Latin music offered by Ray Barretto, Mongo Santamaria, and El Chicano.
The stock of virtuoso performances here is all but endless: the bass-and-drums breakdown on Cliff Nobles and Co.'s 'The Horse,' the glinting guitar solo on the Bar-Kays' 'Soul Finger,' Hugh Masekela's questing trumpet on 'Grazing in the Grass.' Rickey Wright (Amazon)
