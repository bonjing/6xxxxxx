The Crimson Wing
One lake, a million birds, an incredible story... 

In a remote and forgotten wilderness, one of nature's last great mysteries unfolds: the birth, life and death of a million crimson-winged flamingos. Against a dramatic backdrop of never-before filmed landscapes, these secretive birds struggle to survive and prevail over danger and fate. This inspiring story, set in the extraordinary 'otherworld' of Lake Natrona in northern Tanzania, the cradle of humankind, reminds us: here on earth is a universe waiting to be discovered. The film traces the life cycle of flamingos in a measured, absorbing, non-flashy manner, and that helps make Crimson Wing such a fascinating watch. It's terrifically shot, which helps, but over the course of its gentle running time. And it follows the creatures through life, death and the day-to-day challenges that they face.
