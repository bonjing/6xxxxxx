Suburgatory.S01E09.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 97MB]

[/b][/color] Single father George only wants the best for his 16-year-old daughter, Tessa.
So when he finds a box of condoms on her nightstand, he moves them out of their apartment in New York City to a house in the suburbs.
But all Tessa sees is the horror of over-manicured lawns and plastic Franken-moms.
Being in the `burbs can be hell, but it also may just bring Tessa and George closer than they've ever been.
