For some reason the full description was not displayed.
This was ripped from vinyl 'cos CD is not available. Original album: EMI Columbia 3CX 1570  Released UK 1959.
However, equipment used was Linn Sondek LP12 turntable, Syrinx arm, Audio Technica cartridge (stylus costs ĂÂŁ250!), Musical Fidelity X-LP preamp, Philips CD951 CD recorder, wave files edited on PC. In other words, better than CD quality!"
