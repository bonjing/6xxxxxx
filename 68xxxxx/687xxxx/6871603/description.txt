New series i'm starting , with the filthiest jump-up around


What is Jump-Up?


Jump-Up is a subgenre of drum and bass that was first popular in the mid-1990s. 
Tunes typically were light-hearted, featuring hip hop samples and loud melodic basslines. The term is derived from the earlier use of "jump-up" to refer to tracks with often ambient intros which altered their style at the drop, often by breaking into amen breakbeats. This would make the crowd "jump up" and dance. Around 1994 it began to be more exclusively applied to records with hip hop samples and oscillating basslines, such as Suburban Bass artists Dream Team and DJ Hype, and by 1995 more specifically to the style associated with DJ Zinc and Ganja Records.

It is usually characterized by basslines that have a filter shaping LFO on them which gives the bass a â€˜wobbleâ€™ sound accompanied by uptempo drum loops.

Most frequently in modern Jump-Up, an element of highly energetic â€˜stabsâ€™ are often heard. Jump-Up is closely related to the more popular 1996â€“1997 era of jungle-drum and bass, known for its 'warmthâ€™ through beat and melody syncopation and simpler heavy basslines (as opposed to the lighter, more distorted basslines of the precise-sounding techier styles of Neurofunk & Techstep coming out around this time).
