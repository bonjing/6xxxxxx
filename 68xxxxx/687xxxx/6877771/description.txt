Kasabian's mission to make each gig a celebration saw another conquest here at the Roundhouse this evening. They more than pulled off their ambition to perform with a full concert orchestra and turned the venue into one huge party.
It was a highly powerful performance from the band and their special guest Zac Starkey (son of Ringo Star) who became the band's second drummer for three songs. Lead singer Tom Meighan proved himself to be a brilliant showman as he draped himself in a Union Jack and demanded the crowd sing along to all the words. Tracks like 'Processed Beats' and 'Club Foot' sent everyone wild.
By the time the band close with an epic version of 'L.S.F.' it's hard to know who's loving it more - the crowd or the band. "It's been f****n' monumental!" declares lead singer Tom Meighan as the band have a group hug and depart. The entire crowd continue to sing the final track's chorus as they pile out of the building and into the Camden night.
