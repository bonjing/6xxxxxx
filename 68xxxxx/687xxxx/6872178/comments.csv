,pawlowjp,2012-01-12T03:34Z,Thanks!! I look forward to coming to your page to find new shows from the BBC. I love that channel!!
r dream of not saying thank-you if you gave it to them in person - yet it's the norm when someone who probably spent a few hour on creating a torrent and THEN seeding it to them.


But - ~ Make one single error and then you get a flood of ""Experts""

It might be a nothing error i.e the Descriptions says E05 when it should be 04
Even though the Avi is named correctly the Description is a lie.

I think many think they get a prize for spotting an error."
