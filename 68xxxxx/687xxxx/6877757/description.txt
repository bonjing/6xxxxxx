This is a night by night account of the stars. For every night of the year Sir Patrick Moore gives the reader details of interesting objects that can be seen from earth. It is a book for people with a wide interest in astronomy, those who may not have specialised in a specific area of astronomy and wish to expand their knowledge in all areas. 

There are 365 nights in every year (366 in a leap year!) and from an amateur astronomerâ€™s point of view, no two are alike.

And that is why Sir Patrick Moore â€“ the worldâ€™s most widely known and respected TV broadcaster and writer on astronomy â€“ has produced this unique book to highlight special objects of interest on each and every night of the year. Using easy-to-follow star maps, he talks about the science and history of stars, double stars, galaxies, nebulae, the Moon, planets, constellations and even asteroids.
