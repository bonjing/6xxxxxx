e book does, it simply looks up numbers to connect to.
Just as owning a lot of telephone books won't make anyone you call talk any faster on the phone, listing many trackers in your torrent files won't speed up anyone's data transfers.
For torrents that you plan to upload to The Pirate Bay, you do not need to include any trackers at all, since the system automatically edits the tracker list in each uploaded torrent file to use the trackers of our choice."
