Tenacious D is the first studio album by American comedy rock band Tenacious D, released on September 25, 2001. The album's polished production was a departure from the band's acoustic origins, due in part to the production of the Dust Brothers. "Tribute" was the first single released from the album, followed by "Wonderboy". Both singles had music videos filmed for them, with the Liam Lynchâ€“directed Tribute video achieving cult status. While Tenacious D did not achieve chart success after its release, it was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America by the end of 2005. Despite peaking at only #38 in the UK, it had sold 426,000 copies in that country by 2006.
