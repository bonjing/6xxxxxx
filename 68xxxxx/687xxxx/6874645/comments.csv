Thanks to the uploader anyway. I don't know if you're at all responsible for the subs or if you're just spreading the file, but, if possible, it would be appreciated, if, next time, you supplied the subs as a separate file, since hardcoded subs are useless for those who don't speak that language and make using different subs difficult, as the subs are then either layered over each other, making them hard to read or are cluttering the whole screen."
