Description

Description: Salvation Boulevard is a modern comedy based on the book of the same title by Larry Beinhart about Pastor Dan Day, a charismatic evangelical preacher who has captivated a small western American town with his charm â€“ and the promise of a sweet real estate development. Carl is a former follower â€“ not of Christ, but of the Grateful Dead â€“ who has since become â€œfoundâ€ in Danâ€™s Evangelical community, serving as one of the preacherâ€™s great examples of spiritual and moral transformation. But Carlâ€™s new belief system is turned upside down when he witnesses a sinful act that Pastor Danâ€™s doughy henchman aims to cover up.
