Happy.Endings.S02E09.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 103MB]

[/b][/color] Happy Endings revolves around six friends, living in Chicago, whose group is rocked when the couple that brought them together, Alex and Dave, break up.
This leaves the rest of the group (Max, Brad, Jane, and Penny) in an awkward position of either trying to stay together as friends or having to choose sides.
Alex and Dave decide to stay friends, but there are many more complications down the road.
