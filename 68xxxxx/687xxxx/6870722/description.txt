Band-in-a-box 2011.5 update (build 35) for mac.

This release includes .app only. You need to have the previous BiaB 2010.5 installed on your mac.

Band-in-a-Box is so easy to use! Just type in the chords for any song using standard chord symbols (like C, Fm7, or C13b9), choose the style you'd like, and Band-in-a-Box does the rest... Band-in-a-Box automatically generates a complete professional-quality arrangement of piano, bass, drums, guitar, and strings or horns.
