"Regional Holiday Music"

When the Greendale Glee Club is 
unexpectedly sidelined, the school's 
effervescent choir director Cory Radison 
sets about recruiting the study group 
members to fill in. Skeptical at first, 
they eventually fall under his hypnotic 
spell - one-by-one - singing and dancing 
their way to the annual Christmas 
Pageant.

18/Slower
Evolve...or die.

Enjoy :)
