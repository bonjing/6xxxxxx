,qwertzo99,2011-12-11T20:37Z,I don't want that piratebay becomes some place where we decide what will be on it and what not so I don't object to sexual kind of torrents but it would be better to put them in bigger heap and not like this. For the last several days I'm just seeing sex related torrents in books section.
