    A gang of horny, sadistic juvenile delinquents looking for kicks         
    invades the suburban home of a housewife, injects her with dope and      
    waylays her. A passing saleswoman receives similar treatment. The        
    gang steals the housewife's car and heads for the open road. They        
    hijack a bus, kill the driver when he objects, and assault two female    
    passengers, one of whom enjoys it. She convinces her friend to play      
    along, and they all get their kicks.
