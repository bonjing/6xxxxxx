Wiki paste with Season 2 and dates

Season 2 (2011-2012)

For season 2, the series was renamed to Gold Rush. The mining action moved from Porcupine Creek in the Panhandle of Alaska, USA, to the Klondike of the Yukon, Canada. No longer occurring in Alaska, necessitating a name change for the series.

Inspections by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration Aug. 4 to 8 (2011) resulted in a total of 13 citations and two compliance orders against John Schnabel's Big Nugget Mine and the Jim Nail Placer Mine operated by ""Dakota"" Fred Hurt, according to a website maintained by the agency.
