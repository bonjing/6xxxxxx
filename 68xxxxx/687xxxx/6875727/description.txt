Mick Clarke (guitar, slide guitar, vocal), Lou Martin (piano, Hammond organ), Dave Newman (harmonica), Mick Phillips (bass), Mike Hirsh (drums).

Clarke likes nothing better than laying out stinging guitar solos over Hammond organ-supported rhythms and then playing tag with harmonica player Dave Newman, as he does on songs like Earl Hooker's "Swear to Tell the Truth." Clarke's most recent release, his second in the U.S., also includes covers of Muddy Waters's "Gypsy Woman" and "She Moves Me" as well as a bunch of originals that display his affinity for rocking blues.
