Ok here's the scoop. VHS Ripped and then they were uploaded to streaming source in multiple chunks, with no real guide the episodes could be jumbled up a bit cuz i didnt know which chunk was put where, i simply downloaded the multiple parts of the episode and combined them back to a fuller "episode". Now the episodes could be missing parts as well, i just have no way of really knowing what all these episodes were made up of except for when they went to commercial break. Since there are NO copies on ANY torrent site out there (even just episodes or specials) Heres the first of the seasons combined back to hopefully as close as possible in their original forms. Yes I do have more seasons and am currently working on recombining them for torrents as well. These were converted for PSP playback, quality is ho hum at best simply cuz VHS conversion to the web playable MP4 sucked and downgraded these a bit. And considering i dont even see like Amazon selling any of these in BluRay or DVD, i doubt anything better will be upped. I know these are a little bigger than my normal IPOD/PSP/MP4 releases, this is how they came out after combining the individual pieces and i really didn't wanna tamper with them further cuz i doubt it would've helped them any. If any one at all has the VHS versions with ALL the shows and seasons and can get better rips i implore you, upload. I know from reading the comments and seeing how many views were on each part as i downloaded these are still a hot commodity even in 2011 even tho it came out in 1989. Then again, despite the bad mustaches, gas guzzling cars, big hair and 64k computers, tv reality shows will always be good to watch, this show i believe was just ahead of its time and its a shame it ended.So keep in mind before coming back and going "AW this is terrible" blah blah etc, I am well aware these are not the best rips of these, these were pulled from streaming source in pieces since i couldn't find any of these on torrents, recombined them, kept them in PSP codec form (dunno what the technical term is, just a prebuilt feature in the combiner) and labeled them accordingly.
