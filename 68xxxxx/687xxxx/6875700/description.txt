The first (well, second if you count Promiseâ€™s appearance on Home Schooled: ABCâ€™s of Kid Soul) offering from the massive wealth of tapes we discovered in producer R. Hosea Williamsâ€™ garage in 2009, Whoâ€™s Gonna Save The World is the proper debut of Washington DCâ€™s Fatherâ€™s Children.

Hailing from the Adams-Morgan neighborhood, in 1973 Nick Smith, Billy Sumler, and Ted â€œSkeetâ€ Carpenter created a lost document of gritty soul, concerned with its own time and place, stripped of the L.A. gloss that permeated the the groupâ€™s own 1979 â€œdebutâ€ for Mercury. Unreleased until now, this true freshman offering is an amalgam of sunny vocal group harmonies, fuzz-guitar solos, shimmering keys, bubbling percussion, spiritual prophecy, and dub experiments.
