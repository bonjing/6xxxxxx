Given the huge success of our earlier posted DivX HD dual English-German
720p version of this greatest movie for children, we now bring you a 1080p
version additionally for all the great fans out there of Ms Julie Andrews
and her greatly spirited kids in this movie example for all

1920 X 1080p DivX HDTV 4000k video bitrate dual 256k audio tracks in both
English or German

"Wanted! a nanny for two adorable children if you want this position
you must have a cheerful disposition... you must be kind and witty... 
never be cross or cruel..." What great words of widsom from the most 
brilliant children in this movie example! 


Mary Poppins is as great a movie for most kids as is The Sound of Music
I daresay, and I enjoyed it equally as much as a child myself! In fact it stars
Ms. Julie Andrews equally of course and has a similar storyline to some degree.

Lovely British kids in the best example of great spirit, as an example to all!
Great songs for the children to grow up with!

Do enjoy, and merry Christmas this and every year!

By the way (at the time of this posting - late 2011) we recently obtained
a huge file sized 1080p version of 12 angry men (to compare) on the net and
found it terrible quality (its a criterion disc rip by the way)and far below
the standards of our great HDTV 720p version which got rave reviews by the
way for both video and sound quality
