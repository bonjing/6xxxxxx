Info from TalentHouse:

Korn usher in a new horizon for heavy music with their new album 'The Path of Totality'. Collaborating with dubstep heavyweights Skrillex, Excision, Downlink, Noisia, Feed Me, 12th Planet and Flinch, Korn have constructed a hypnotic hybrid of dubstep and metal. Infusing dubstep anarchy into their signature sound, the legendary quartet stand on the cusp of a musical revolution for both hard rock and electronica. Bouncing from polyrhythmic guitar pummeling into drastic electro drops, the music is dark, dangerous and definitive Korn.

To celebrate 'The Path of Totality', Korn is inviting artists to submit a remix using the provided stems from the songs 'Get Up' or 'Narcissistic Cannibal' for the chance to be the opening DJ at one of their upcoming concerts.
