[/b][/color] Chuck Bartowski, ace computer geek at Buy More, is not in his right mind.
That s a good thing.
Ever since he unwittingly downloaded stolen government secrets into his brain, action, excitement and a cool secret-agent girlfriend have entered his life.
It s a bad thing, too.
Because now Chuck is in danger 24/7.
