An X Factor finalist with a smoky neo-soul voice, Rebecca Ferguson began working on her major-label debut in early 2011, mere weeks after becoming the showâ€™s 2010 runner-up. Released later that year, the record sketches out a soulful sound similar to Duffy and Corrine Bailey Ray. Ferguson puts her own stamp on the music by co-writing every track, including the lead single â€œNothingâ€™s Real But Love.â€ Most X Factor finalists load their debut albums with cover songs and schmaltzy ballads; Ferguson, an established songwriter as well as a singer, proves there are other avenues worth exploring.
