                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Australia's Hidden Valley Reporter Oliver Steeds and director Ed Braman travel
 to Australia, where they investigate claims that controversial legislation    
 used by the government to take control of Aborigine settlements in a bid to   
 end violence, child abuse and alcoholism has failed. They reveal that critics 
 of the scheme believe it has exacerbated the problems, fuelling dependency and
 racism. Last in the series.                                                   
                                 Enjoy!
