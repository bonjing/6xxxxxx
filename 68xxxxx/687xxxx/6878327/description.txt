Plot:
Rakhwala is a movie that shows that in this world we cannot trust anyone. Not even the employees who work for their masters are not loyal to them. Jwalaprasad is a rich man who has a daughter named Chandni who is very pretty. She falls in love with their driver named Deepak but their marriage is opposed by Jwalaprasad as he thinks he is not of the standard as theirs. Deepak had a brother named Suresh who actually was not his brother, but he never made him realize that. But once Jwalaprasad made Suresh realize that he is the son of his first boss and he was always in search of him so that he can give the property to him. But Jwalaprasad was not good as shown, he and his partner Shyam made a plan to kill Suresh and acquire the property. But the blame of the murder goes on to Deepak.
