 Nothing new or spectacular really, same old same old. Newbies at Final destination series will find it awsome, wich it really is if you haven't seen first or second one. 
I knew there will not be anything new as far as story goes, so i've put my hopes in special effects wich are not bad but they're nothing spectacular also. Just plain disgusting in my opinion. 
So to wrap it up, if the first one was 10/10, than this one in my opinion would be like 5/10. If you're new to the series you'll probably find it something more like 8/10.
Enjoy."
