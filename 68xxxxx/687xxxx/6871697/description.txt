Filled with seasonal fruit, piled high with billowy meringue, or topped with buttery streusel, pies and tarts are comforting and foolproof. In Martha Stewartâ€™s New Pies and Tarts, the editors of Martha Stewart Living include 150 recipes: Some are savory, some are sweet; some are simple enough for a weeknight, while others are fancy enough for special events.

Throughout, readers will find plenty of fillings and crusts, basics, and techniques for creating flavors and textures for every tasteâ€”from down-home classics that come together easily with fresh berries and stone fruits to modern tarts layered with chocolate ganache or finished with a wine glaze. There are also individual hand pies, savory comforts like quiche and potpie, holiday-worthy desserts for nearly every  occasion, and much more.
 
Chapters feature pies and tarts for everyone: Classic (Lattice-Top Blueberry Pie, Pumpkin Pie), Free-form (Apricot-Pistachio Tart, Apple Butter Hand Pies), Sleek (Caramelized Lemon Tart, Chocolate Mousse Tart with Hazelnuts), Dreamy (Frozen Chocolateâ€“Peanut Butter Pie, Butterscotch Praline Cream Pie), Rustic (Cheddar-Crust Apple Pie, Blackberry Jam Tart), Layered (Rainbow Puff-Pastry Tarts, Chocolate Pear Tart), Dainty (Roasted Fig Tartlets, Cranberry Meringue Mini Pies), Artful (Peach-Raspberry Slab Pie, Pumpkin and Ricotta Crostata), Holiday (Neapolitan Easter Pie, Gingerbread-Raspberry Snowflake Tart), and Savory (Leek and Olive Tart, Summer Squash Lattice Tart).
 
As is expected from Martha Stewart, this book is at once a feast for the eyes and the palate, as well as a practical teaching tool. Each dish is accompanied by a lush, four-color photograph. Throughout the book are simple instructions for decorative crusts and finishing techniques (latticework, cutouts, classic edgings). A complete Basics section of tools, pantry staples, and dough recipes (pÃ¢te brisÃ©e, cream cheese dough, press-in cookie crusts, puff pastry), plus plenty of tips and make-ahead tricks, help readers along the way. Whether making an effortless, free-form galette or the perfect latticework pie, bakers of all skill levels will look again and again to Martha Stewartâ€™s New Pies and Tarts.
