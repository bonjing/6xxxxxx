webby100: Anyone giving you shit is an asshole, considering your good intentions. When you download a torrent and open it with your torrent client (say... BitTorrent), you will automatically begin seeding it. You can set your bandwidth (maximum amount of transfer either way) in an 'options' or 'preference' menu. 

By setting your bandwidth cap, it will allow you to seed files without completely destroying your bandwidth with your ISP account. If you have unlimited bandwidth, then keep it set to '0' for unlimited.

On the main screen window, there should be several sections. Some examples: 'Downloading', 'Complete', 'Active', 'Seeding'. If the torrent is listed under 'Seeding', you will be giving back to everyone.

Hope that helps!"
