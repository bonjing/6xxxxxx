If you've seen a fight..hmm...  A sort of debate with arguments....maybe...


For sure HolyRoses knows what he says, but I'm pretty sure that you have seen what is all about...and I'm not asking something ...just for fun..I want to find about it!

My ripps? Not intended to match with any device in particular [Most of MediaPlayers incorporated in the new generations of HDTV LDC/LED are playing those flawlessly]

Mistakes? Yes I still do mistakes, mostly because this is a hobby not a job [ I work in a totally different area] and I still have too much trust in my new machine [PC]. I hope I'll get your trust someday with some of my decent rips.

Cheers!
