About GetDarker

GetDarker is respected as one of the most popular yet credible brands throughout dubstep. An endorsed independent online magazine devoted to dubstep music and UK underground culture. Evolving from an original site launched in 2003, GetDarker has since expanded beyond its London, UK roots and now has strong support from a global audience.

GetDarker has bolstered its brand as an award-winning leader in dubstep via the TV-advertised compilation series This Is Dubstep, weekly GetDarkerTV webcasts, a Top 15 podcast, merchandise and exposure at UK festivals and international tours. Showcasing the full spectrum of the genre, these multi-media platforms have provided exposure to up and coming artists as well as bringing the audience closer to the scene's biggest stars.
