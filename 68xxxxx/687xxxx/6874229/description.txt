Description

Plot: Teenaged Casey never knew what a miracle could doâ€¦ until she created one. Frustrated with her life, Casey throws a coffee at the wall of the Krowne Donuts where she works â€¦ and the splash (with a little help from Casey) seems to resemble an image of Jesus Christ. Overnight, Casey finds herself becoming the ring-master of a growing faith circus: the parking-lot teems in new customers, 24-7 news media arrive. Caseyâ€™s hoax changes everything: for her strict, fundamental boss, her sweet, believing boyfriend, her â€œDoubting Thomasâ€ local priest, and, most importantly, for her Dad â€¦ Haunted by the aftermath of a family tragedy, Caseyâ€™s Dad is letting everything around him go: his mortgage payments, his business, everything. Caseyâ€™s hoax might be just the â€œdivine interventionâ€ which her Dad needs â€¦ but the results are not at all what she expected.
