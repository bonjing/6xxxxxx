SpeedFan lets you take a deeper view at the status of your computer. 
Almost every computer includes support for hardware monitoring. 
Accessing digital temperature sensors is really useful. 
If you are trying to figure out why your PC hangs when under heavy load or 
after some hours of usage, SpeedFan might help you find the real cause. 
Very often it is a poor power supply, or an improperly installed heatsink 
that lead to behaviours that we tend to associate (incorrectly) with errors 
from the operating system. SpeedFan automatically searches your computer 
for informative chips: the hardware monitor chips. SpeedFan can display voltages, 
fan speeds and temperatures. On rare occasions, the BIOS doesn't activate such features. 
SpeedFan tries to enable them as long as this is a safe thing to do. 
Not only the motherboard is searched, but also some video cards and 
almost every currently sold hard disk. SpeedFan can access status info from EIDE, 
SATA and even SCSI drives, consistently showing internal data that can be 
used to diagnose current and future hard disk failures. 
This is known as S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology). 
At the lowest level, the SpeedFan hardware monitor software can access 
digital temperature sensors, but its main feature is its ability to control fan speeds 
according to the temperatures inside your PC, thus reducing noise.
