From Wiki:


Big Wreck is a rock band formed by Ian Thornley in 1994. They disbanded in 2002 and Ian Thornley went onto a successful solo career with his own band Thornley. In 2010, Ian Thornley and Brian Doherty reunited for a cross-Canada tour, playing both Big Wreck and Thornley songs.[1] Doherty then officially joined Thornley. The band continues to tour as "Ian Thornley and Big Wreck".

The band was formed in Boston, Massachusetts by vocalist Ian Thornley, guitarist Brian Doherty, bassist Dave Henning and drummer Forrest Williams, who met as students at the Berklee College of Music. After several years of gigging in Boston and Cambridge, the band signed to a major label and released its debut album In Loving Memory Of... in 1997. The single "The Oaf" was a major Top Ten hit for the band that year.

Perhaps because Ian Thornley is Canadian, the band's biggest commercial success was in Canada rather than the United States (see MAPL system). The album's subsequent singles, "That Song" and "Blown Wide Open", were not as successful on the American charts as "The Oaf", but both charted well in Canada.

In October 2001, Big Wreck played a special show at Toronto's Roy Thomson Hall accompanied by the Toronto Symphony Orchestra and the Uzume Taiko Ensemble of drummers, with The Tragically Hip's Paul Langlois and Robby Baker and guitarist - as they shared the same manager, Bernie Breen from Bernie Breen Music Management, as well as Eric Johnson also making appearances.

The band's second album The Pleasure and the Greed (released in 2001) was marred by poor marketing and was not as big of a hit as their debut album, especially in the United States. The band broke up a year later.

Thornley moved back to Toronto, launching the band Thornley. Doherty is now living in Camlachie, a small community near Sarnia, Ontario, where he teaches guitar and prepares students for University or Conservatory entrance requirements. Doherty also went on to form the indie band Death of 8, but the other band members have not yet emerged with new projects.

According to a March 10, 2010 article on Blabbermouth.netâ€”Dave Henning will be the bassist for (former Guns N' Roses guitarist) Slash's solo touring band.

Hard rock band Submersed and American Idol winner David Cook have both cited the band as an influence.

According to a March 26, 2010 article on Blabbermouth.net, "Todd Kerns (SIN CITY SINNERS, STATIC IN STEREO, AGE OF ELECTRIC) has replaced Dave Henning (BIG WRECK) on bass in former GUNS N' ROSES and current VELVET REVOLVER guitarist Slash's touring band. The rest of the group consists of rhythm guitarist Bobby Schneck (WEEZER, GREEN DAY), drummer Brent Fitz (ALICE COOPER, VINCE NEIL) and vocalist Myles Kennedy from ALTER BRIDGE."

In 2010 Ian and Brian rekindled their friendship which led to Brian filling in for a Thornley show, and then joining the band as they naturally reconnected as musicians. This led the band to tour with Thornley's band as "An Evening with Thornley and Big Wreck". 










In Loving Memory Of... 1997


In Loving Memory Of... is the debut album by hard rock band Big Wreck. Released in 1997, the album features the single "The Oaf," which became major Top Ten hit. Subsequent singles, "Blown Wide Open" and "That Song," found airplay in the United States but experienced greater success in Canada where they were both reached the Top Ten. "Under the Lighthouse" was released exclusively to Canada.

In Loving Memory Of... features layered progressive elements in addition to its heavy Southern rock style. Lyrically, it deals predominately with relationship issues. Frontman Ian Thornley noted, "The majority of the album is actually written about one girl. Somebody who's still fucking me up." He also admitted that the track "Look What I Found?" was intended to sound like Soundgarden as a reference to how popular bands gain fame emulating other groups.[2]

To promote their debut album, Big Wreck opening for progressive metal band Dream Theater in what was their first major national tour.
