    Paul Decker murders his wife in her Italian villa by drugging her        
    milk and asphyxiating her by gas. He cleverly locks the bedroom from     
    the inside and hides inside a trapdoor in the floor until after the      
    body is discovered by servants. He uses a scuba snorkel connected to     
    tubes on the outside to breathe during the ordeal. Decker's              
    stepdaughter Candy suspects him immediately, especially since no         
    suicide note was found. She also is convinced that he murdered her       
    father years before, but her accusations fall on deaf ears. The          
    ruthless Decker even poisons the family spaniel when the pet takes       
    too great an interest in the mask and realizes he will ultimately        
    have to get rid of Candy too.
