PLOT: When successful attorney, Mitch Bright (Daniel Baldwin), returns home after more than 20 years to the small town of Trapper Falls, Alaska he runs into his old high schools rivals: the Reed brothers, Dan (Ted McGinley) and Greg (Brad Stein). Dan is building a new platform for the town's traditional nativity scene, but he is the mayor of the town, the platform is being built with city money, and it's on city property. To top things off: Dan is even married to Kristen (Nancy Stafford) the girl both Dan and Mitch liked in high school. The first thing Mitch does is file a legal injunction against the nativity citing separation of church and state. The second thing he does is decide to run for mayor against his main rival Dan; Dan has been the mayor for years. Mitch accuses Dan of forcing his Christianity upon the entire town, then Mitch goes on a rant about the arrogance and hypocrisy of all Christians...
