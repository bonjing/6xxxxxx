    Shame On You collects 25 previously unreleased radio transcriptions recorded in
    1944-1945, nine of which feature Tex Williams on vocals. The title track is a
    version of Cooley's number one hit from 1945, and the other material runs the
    gamut from polkas ("Cowbell Polka," "Yodeling Polka") and hillbilly hoe-downs
    ("Down Home Rag") to tunes that have become instrumental standards ("Steel
    Guitar Rag," "Silver Bell.") The sound quality is excellent, and Shame on You
    is a fine companion piece to Spadella!, Columbia's collection of Cooley's
    classic OKeh sides.

    Shame On You contains never released recordings of Spade, the King of Western Swing, and his band; some are so rare that in many cases they are the only recorded versions of the songs. Recorded over 1944 and 1945, they feature the vocal talents of Tex Williams (who went on to solo fame behind songs like "Smoke! Smoke! Smoke! That Cigarette!") and showcase Spade and Tex at the height of their collaborative efforts. 25 tracks!

    "With a style that menaces charms and makes you want to move all at the same time, Cooley and the Western Swing Gang deserve wider appreciation. This disc shows Cooley at his prime--a time well before he ended up in the big house for offing his spouse and dead of a heart attack at age 59." â€”Time Out New York

    "There have been quite a few Spade Cooley reissues in recent years, but I haven't found any I like better than this one. What makes this CD so special? It's a combination of factors: the song selection (including a good balance between vocals and instrumentals), sound quality, and rarity. An excellent package." â€”Western Music Advocate

Biography
FROM WIKIPEDIA:

    Donnell Clyde Cooley (December 17, 1910â€“November 23, 1969), better known as Spade Cooley, was an American Western swing musician, big band leader, actor, and television personality. His career ended in 1961 when he was arrested and convicted for the murder of his second wife, Ella Mae Evans.

    One of the groups which played at the Venice Pier Ballroom in Venice, California was led by Jimmy Wakely with Spade Cooley on fiddle. Several thousand dancers would turn out on Saturday night to swing and hop. "The hoards (sic) of people and jitterbuggers loved him." When Wakely got a movie contract at Universal, Cooley replaced him as bandleader.

    To capitalize on the success of the Bob Willsâ€“Tommy Duncan pairing, Cooley hired vocalist Tex Williams who was capable of the mellow deep baritone sound made popular by Duncan. Cooley's 18-month engagement at Santa Monica's Venice Pier Ballroom was record-breaking for the early half of the 1940s. His "Shame on You", released on Columbia's Okeh label, was recorded in December 1944, and was No. 1 on the country charts for two months.[1] "Shame on You" was the first in an unbroken string of six Top Ten singles including "Detour" and "You Can't Break My Heart".

    Cooley appeared in 38 Western films, both in bit parts and as a stand-in for cowboy actor Roy Rogers. Billed as Spade Cooley and His Western Dance Gang, he was featured in the soundie Take Me Back to Tulsa released July 31, 1944 along with Tex Williams and Carolina Cotton.[3] Corrine, Corrina was released August 28, 1944 minus Cotton.[4] In 1950, Cooley had significant roles in several films, and starred in two film shorts: King of Western Swing and Spade Cooley & His Orchestra.

    Beginning in June 1948, Cooley began hosting a variety show on KTLA-TV in Los Angeles, California broadcast from the Santa Monica Pier Ballroom. The show became a mainstay of television in the area, and won local Emmy awards in 1952 and 1953. Guests included Frankie Laine, Frank Sinatra and Dinah Shore.[5][6] The Hoffman Hayride was so popular that an estimated 75 percent of all televisions in the L.A. area were tuned into the show each Saturday night. Making use of video transcriptions, The Spade Cooley Show was viewed coast-to-coast via the Paramount Television Network.[7]

    Although by 1956 Lawrence Welk was achieving increasing success at the nearby Aargon Ballroom, Cooley's show ended in the same year as ratings continued to drop.[8]

    After a "battle of the bands" with Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys at the Venice Pier Ballroom, which Cooley won, he began to promote himself as the King of Western Swing.[9] Evidently Western swing, not used prior to 1942 for this style of music, was a term thought up by Cooley's then promoter, Forman Phillips.[10]

    Cooley's music was like that of the then-current big band orchestras, and its sound was drawn from those dance-oriented big bands.
