Semplice 2.0rc1 'emily' Release Notes
Introduction and warnings

Semplice is a cool, free, light, simple, fast and libre GNU/Linux distribution, based on Debian Sid, the 'unstable' branch of the Debian project. Because of its instability, Semplice Linux is not ideal in production systems, and there is no guarantee that everything works, now or in the near future.

This build was compiled in 2011-12-10.
Known issues
(Live) non-free removal produces output

If using nonfree=false boot parameter (only in live), the non-free removal script displays output during the boot phase. This issue will not affect the Semplice Live usage.
(Live) resizing window during installation may crash the installer

This is not a linstaller-related issue (but of the library who draws the progressbar) but a workaround should show up into the final release.
Missing adwaita engine

The adwaita engine is missing into the ISO image. The GTK3 applications are still usable and only some details are wrong. An OTA update will fix this.
Summary of the CD content
