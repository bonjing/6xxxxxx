Broadcast in October 2011, An Audience With ... is a British entertainment television show produced by ITV Studios, in which a host, usually a singer or comedian, (in this broadcast, Barry Manilow) performs for an invited audience of celebrity guests, interspersed with questions from the audience, in a light hearted revue/tribute style. If you\\\'re a Barry Manilow fan then you will love hearing all his great songs and the conversation he has with his audience. Well done. BTW, Manilow is now 68 years old and still retains a great voice.
