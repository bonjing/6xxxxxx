Lo and behold, it shows up in my library about an hour later.  WHY it says there are no seeders is a question because I am seeding it to five people as I write this.  

Bear with the guys behind TPB.  They are constantly under attack by various ISPs and the music and movie industries who are doing everything they can from blocking access to TPB and then being ordered by the courts to stop then blocking uploads then being order to stop the blocking.  It can't be easy for TPB."
