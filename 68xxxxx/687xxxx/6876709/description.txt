Notes:
If you are in North America these extended versions are available on the daily show website.
This is a flash video web rip converted to x264 mkv
Tested using the free VLC media player.
If you don't know how to play MKV files you can still listen to the interview as the sound is standard MP3. There isn't much visual in the interview anyway. Just two people talking at a desk.
