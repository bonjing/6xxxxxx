Phil Hendrie Show - Best of 1994 WIOD

paid 20 bux for this so if u dont download my mixtapes i will delete it lol 
jk..there clips not full shows like my other uploads...

The Phil Hendrie Shop is please to make available for the first time ever individual downloads of each of the 18 tracks that comprise Phil Hendrie's Best of 1994, the very first Best Of compilation of Phil's on-air work, recorded from broadcasts at WIOD, Miami during that year. WIOD was unique among almost all talk stations in America (the Loop, WLUP, Chicago was similar) in that the emphasis was on entertainment and not news/talk. While Phil was there, from spring 1994 through September of 1996, the lineup consisted of Rick and Suds in the morning, the legendary Neil Rogers, middays, Phil doing afternoons, Jeff DeForrest with sportsTalk 6-8 and Erin Sommers' Lovelines 8-midnight. Each year the station offered for sale Best Of c.d's to fans of WIOD wth proceeds going to benefit different charities in south Florida. It is one of those (Phil did three in all at WIOD) that we're making available on a track by track basis here, Phil Hendrie, Best of 1994.

This period reflects the beginning of Phil pulling all of the elements of his show together to create the legendary radio he's known for. It's to the WIOD and Phil Hendrie fans of Miami that we dedicate this work today. They got it before anybody.
