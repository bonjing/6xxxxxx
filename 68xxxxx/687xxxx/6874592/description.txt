A family drama with a special focus on two generations of the Chopra family. Dinanath Chopra lives in a small tenement with his wife, and two sons Baldev, and Chandramohan. Dinanath re-finances his house in order to get Baldev to study further and be a doctor, and also gets him married with Rekha who comes from a very wealthy family. Chandramohan studies in college, and has a sweetheart in the form of the gorgeous Asha. Asha lives with her mom, and dad, a sort of quack. Differences in the Baldev emerge and multiply. Baldev and Rekha move to their palatial house. The birth of a baby boy to Rekha does lighten things up a bit, but not for long. Dinanath loses his eyesight in an accident and becomes blind. Chandramohan goes out of town to look for employment, leaving his sick mother and blind father at the mercy of an uncaring daughter-in-law, and eventually the older couple are forced to leave Baldev's house...

The film's music is by Madan Mohan.A couple of of songs 'main nigahen tere chehre se hataaoon kaise' by Mohd. Rafi and 'agar mujhse mohabbat hai' by Lata Mangeshkar are plus points of this family drama.
