5j9alrpvot6l5j13l.png Johnny Worricker (Bill Nighy) is a long-serving MI5 officer whose closest friend is also his boss, the Director General of MI5, Benedict Baron (Michael Gambon). Baron dies of a heart attack at his country home where he lives with his wife (Johnny's ex-wife) and step daughter (Johnny's daughter). Baron's death comes shortly after distributing a highly explosive report to two MI5 officers (Worricker and Jill Tankardâ€”Judy Davis) and then sharing it with the Home Secretary. At the meeting with the Home Secretary (Saskia Reeves), Worricker verbally highlights a note at the foot of page eight alleging that the Prime Minister is aware that the US administration has been torturing prisoners in secret overseas prisons, and had knowledge of the locations of the prisons. The implication is that the PM had intelligence information that he did not share with the security services, that might have saved British lives.
