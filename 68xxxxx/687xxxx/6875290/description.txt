The film is based on Gabriel GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez's 1994 novel of the same name... but (fatally) it lacks the frame narrative.  It may be that it is actually closer in tone to the 2008 opera, but it contains almost nothing of the Afro-Caribbean/Yoruba angle that works as a sort of "counter-narrator" in the novel and which the opera apparently foregrounded.  It winds up being, as the negative review posted below suggests, a conventional romance. As that reviewer says, Hidalgo's film has some great imagery but it wasn't audacious enough and (in my view) doesn't wind up realizing a sound adaptation of what Gabriel GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez was fabricating in his novel. Still, the film has merits as a kind of "show-piece" for what Hidalgo can do with images which isn't negligible.
