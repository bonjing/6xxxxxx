NOTE: In the main menu there is no button to push to start the film. You
      have to push "Jump to a scene" which takes you to the scene index.
      Push scenes 1-6 and then 1 "Blazing Saddles- credits and title song"
      and the film starts. This is how I got to do it using VLC.

NOTE: In Sweden most of Mel Brooks films were titled "Det vÃ¥ras fÃ¶r ..." which
means "It's springtime for ..." This emanates from the song "Springtime for Hitler" that was sung in the film "The Producers".

Example:
Det vÃ¥ras fÃ¶r Hitler (It's springtime for Hitler) - The Producers
Det vÃ¥ras fÃ¶r galningarna (It's springtime for the maniacs) - High Anxiety
Det vÃ¥ras fÃ¶r sheriffen (It's springtime for the sheriff) - Blazing Saddles
Det vÃ¥ras fÃ¶r stumfilmen (It's springtime for the silent movie) - Silent Movie
