A judiciously-selected two-CD compendium of Peter Gabriel's finest moments, Hit offers a far 
more generous windfall than can be found on the only previous Peter Gabriel best-of selection, 
the 1990 Shaking the Tree. The devil, after all, is in the detail, particularly on the second 
disc (self-deprecatingly entitled Miss), which really traverses the whole gamut of Peter Gabriels 
globally-visioned artistry. It includes recent soundtrack work (the haunting "Cloudless" from 
Long Walk Home: Music from the Rabbit-Proof Fence), material from 2002's sterling Up 
("Signal To Noise", featuring a compelling vocal from the late Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and some 
ominous string arrangements, really does sound like a thinking man's Massive Attack) and goes 
right back to that fourth album when marrying the reticence of cold, synthesised new wave with 
insistent African percussion seemed like a good idea (it was). The first disc--including the 
MTV smash "Sledgehammer", anti-apartheid war cry "Biko", "Big Time" (interesting how the 
styles of Gabriel and his former group Genesis seem to converge at this time) and "Games Without 
Frontiers"--really speaks for itself, although with hindsight it seems the single-buying 
public-at-large had a particular taste for a certain kind of Peter Gabriel record. 
Universally excellent throughout, the collection is rendered even more desirable by the 
inclusion of three previously unreleased tracks: a live rendition of "Downside Up", a shorter 
version of "Blood of Eden" and "Burn You Up, Burn You Down", latterly included on a video game 
and initially earmarked for the Up album but jettisoned at the last minute. --Kevin Maidment
