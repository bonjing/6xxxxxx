You have no idea what this site is about I suppose.

1 Don't bother sharing free stuff we can get online ourselves. That's pointless.

2 Check what is out there before posting - nobody will go for your torrent if there is another with more seeders.

3 Ask yourself why anyone would seed or comment on such an un-eventful post as this. (apart from flaming you for being a fool - like I am)"
