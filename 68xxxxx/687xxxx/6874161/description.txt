Celebrating fifteen years in the ride, Hospital Records bring you fifteen brand new, unreleased tracks from artists new and old, plus a â€œHistory Of Hospitalâ€ mix from Cyantific on disc two. Bringing together a superb collection of VIPs, remixes and original material, the â€œFifteen Years Of Hospital Recordsâ€ album provides a comprehensive overview of the labelâ€™s past, present and future.

Featuring VIPs of beloved classics from Hospital past from label stalwarts such as High Contrastâ€™s â€œIf We Everâ€ and London Elektricityâ€™s â€œSong In The Key Of Knifeâ€, high profile remixes from Netsky and Nu:Tone plus new offerings from Logistics, Danny Byrd, Camo & Krooked and more, disc one is jam packed with Hospitalâ€™s heroes and offers an eclectic insight into Hospital present. New talents S.P.Y, Royalston and Fred V & Grafix also get a look in, bringing us the cutting edge sounds of Hospital future.

On disc two, Cyantificâ€™s 30-track â€œHistory Of Hospitalâ€ mix provides a sweeping panorama of the last decade and a half and charts Hospitalâ€™s progression from humble origins to the behemoth the label is now. The mix was debuted as a â€œFifteen Yearsâ€ mix at Hospitality Brixton back in April and now finally sees the light of day as a release. A history lesson into Hospitalâ€™s past for those who werenâ€™t there and a trip down memory lane for those who were, Cyantific draws deep into his record box for forgotten gems alongside modern classics and old favourites for a rollercoaster ride into the past.

An essential collectorâ€™s item for any true Hospital fan, the â€œFifteen Years Of Hospital Recordsâ€ is a celebration not only of the label but of all the artists and the music that the last fifteen years have brought as we look forward to the next fifteen years!
