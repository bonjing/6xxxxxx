    High-strung race car driver Alan Colby is trying to recover from a       
    serious head injury. Alan and his lovely new wife Denise go on           
    vacation to the South of France for some much needed rest and            
    relaxation. But Alan is having trouble resisting his more violent        
    impulses. Suave local psychiatrist David Prade offers to help Alan       
    out.
