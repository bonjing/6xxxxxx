A companion to Atlas of the World's Most Dangerous Animals (2007), this volume profiles 50 animals, among them the giraffe, the Siamese fighting fish, the koala, the great grey shrike, and the seahorse. Arrangement is by region, and each animal is covered in a four-page entry combing text with a "Key Facts" box and strong visuals, including photographs, maps, and artwork. Like the earlier work, this one lacks research aids such as further-reading lists. In addition, there is no explanation of why the 50 animals were selected; in fact, some of them "may seem quite mundane," as the brief introduction notes. Nevertheless, the topic and the presentation will appeal to students. Also available as an e-book. Grades 6-10. --Mary Ellen Quinn
