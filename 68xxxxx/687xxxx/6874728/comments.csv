I got nuts this morning tryed install Genius, Driver Detective, DriverScanner and all of them had wrong ore expired serials and then you came like an fucking angel so thanks again Thumper. Wy is it so hard to register thoose driver programs. can it be that when they for the first time scan your PC they see crack, serials and more and disabled them. Dont know but nearly all other programs is there no problem to install and register. What do you think Thumber?
