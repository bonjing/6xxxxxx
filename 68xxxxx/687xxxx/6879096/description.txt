ReleaseNotes:

With their Byrds-ish jangle, Beach Boys-ish harmonies and Moody Blues-ish keyboard parts, it is difficult to argue that The Zombies were a band ahead of their time. Yet, one of the major reasons this St. Albans, England quintet only had three hits, despite being one of the best singles-orientated bands of their day, is that popular music was not quite ready for their tricky time changes and winding melodies. Certainly, the quality of the material was not a problem. A survey of Absolutely the Best, which collects sixteen of The Zombies' greatest tracks, reveals a plethora of almost perfect pop-rock singles, such as the gently rolling
"Remember You;" the hauntingly bleak "Imagine the Swan;" the masterful alternations between jazz-ish virtuosity and R&B-ish oomph, "Is This the Dream" and "Just Out of Reach;" and the remarkably clever "Whenever You're Ready," which is probably the best snide, offhand rejection song this side of Bob Dylan's "Don't Think Twice It's Alright." Then there are the hits: The frantic "She's Not There," the serene "Tell Her No" and the playful "Time of the Season," all of which are bonafied classics.

HHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)
