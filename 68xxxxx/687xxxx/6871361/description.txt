    After the Trojan War, Glauco is the strongest man amongst the Greeks.    
    His friend Pirro meets two men who offer him a large sum of money to     
    persuade Glauco to sail towards unexplored shores. Pirro accepts the     
    proposal and convinces Glauco with a trick: he hits him on his head.     
    The ship lands at a strange place where Pirro and the other men          
    aboard are drugged and find themselves in the hands of the Amazons.      
    Only Glauco escapes, saved from the Egyptian inventor Sofo and he        
    falls in love with Antiope. Between loves and duels, conspiracies and    
    ruses, the pirates will bring together Amazons and Greeks.
