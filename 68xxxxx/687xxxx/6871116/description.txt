Fashion Flair for Portrait and Wedding Photography teaches photographers how to take the concepts of fashion photography (including preparation, styling, props, lighting, posing and post-processing) and apply these techniques to their portrait and wedding photography. By adding fashion flair to their work, photographers can distinguish themselves from their competition and demand a higher price for their images and creativity. Fashion photographers use preparation, styling, props, lighting, posing and post-processing techniques to achieve the desired visual effects in their high-end shoots. Yet these very same techniques can be applied to the images of portrait and wedding photography to create outstanding work that will differentiate a photographer from the competition. Clients want to feel like they are models, and live in a fantasy and this book will help them feel edgy, striking and high-end through a unique approach to their portraits. This book is not about becoming a fashion photographer - it is about using fashion photography techniques for successful portrait and wedding photography.
