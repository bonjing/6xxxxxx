A Scene at the Sea is a 1991 Japanese film written and directed by Takeshi Kitano. This movie was a break from previous Kitano fare in that it features no gangsters or police. However, Kitano did return to more violent storylines in his subsequent film, Sonatine. The movie presents a simple story about a deaf garbage collector, played by Claude Maki, who is determined to learn how to surfâ€”and does so almost at the expense of the girl he loves. In the film, Kitano develops his more delicate, romantic side along with his trademark deadpan approach. In 2002 the Japanese filmmaker directed a similar movie, Dolls, a romantic tale about three pairs of lovers. Occasional Office Kitano actor, Claude Maki, who plays the mute main character, went on to appear in Kitano's film Brother as Ken, a Japanese-American punk set to become leader of a Yakuza clan. In Brother, Claude speaks mostly in American-English with some occasional Japanese. This film marks the first collaboration between Kitano and composer Joe Hisaishi, who had previously created the acclaimed soundtracks of many of Hayao Miyazaki's anime, including NausicaÃ¤ of the Valley of the Wind. Hisaishi would go on to compose the OSTs for all of Kitano's films until Dolls, after which their collaboration ended.
