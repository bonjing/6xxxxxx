Episode 7: Glazed Over
Original airdate: December 5, 2011

There is no time for a coffee break as our drivers begin this episode by attempting to do Donuts. Next, our drivers are put to the ultimate test as they try to manoeuvre themselves through the tight corners of the Cross. Then, its time for "the worst" to put the pedal to the metal as they deal with reversing and speed at the same time in our Reverse Slalom Challenge.

Finally, the group gets behind the wheel of a huge cube truck. After fastening their seatbelts, they attempt to make a special delivery.

One driver will return to Canadian roads again after showing an improvement and our experts continue to watch closely to determine who will be Canada's Worst Driver.
