This is a great live CD release by the legendary musician Levon Helm, titled 'Ramble At Ryman Live'. The CD (15 live tracks) were recorded in September 2008 at historic Nashville's Ryman auditorium. There is however some overlap with Merlefest CD tracks released in 2008 but most of the tracks have been overhauled. Levon Helm plays great music on this CD release (great bluesy-rock sound, vocals & harmonies). The CD opens with a track "Ophelia" : great orchestral base track sound & vocals). Other great tracks include "Back To Memphis" (saxophone/piano combination), "Baby Scratch My Back", "No Depression In Heaven" (countryish track), "Deep Elem Blues" (a great bluesy ballad & melody), "Rag Mama Rag" (up-tempo bluesy track, great saxophone & vocals reminiscent of Bob Dylan's on this track), "Time Out For The Blues" (great guitar), "The Shape I'm In" (up-tempo track, great saxophone & beautiful husky/croaggy voice of Levon Helm) & "Chest Fever" (great lead guitar overdrive/syncopation). Stand-outs/gems/solid tracks include "Evangeline" (up-tempo track, great banjo/spanish guitar, wonderful melody & vocals), "Wide River To Cross" (a ballad with a beautiful violin/guitar combination & vocals), "Anna Lee" (wonderful violin, melody & harmonies), "A Train Robbery" (a slow bluesy track, great guitar chords, melody & vocals) & "The Weight" (wonderful saxophone/piano combination & melody). Okay track is "Famine Mae". On overall, this is a great live CD by Levon Helm, recorded in 2008, a highly recommended CD listening.
