Whitney.S01E10.Christmas.is.Cummings.480p.WEB-DL.x264-mSD [MKV 124MB]

[/b][/color] A hilarious look at modern love, Whitney is a new multi-camera comedy series about Whitney (Whitney Cummings, Chelsea Lately) and Alex (Chris D???Elia, Glory Daze), a happily unmarried couple.
Together for five years, the duo is in no rush to get hitched.
However, after attending yet another one of their friends??? weddings, Whitney realizes that she and Alex are dangerously close to relationship boredom.
Determined not to let that happen, Whitney consults her close circle of opinionated girlfriends -- including Lily (Zoe Lister-Jones, The Other Guys) and Roxanne (Rhea Seehorn, The Starter Wife) -- and then snaps into action.
A few awkward sexy costumes and one botched seductive evening later, the couple ends up in the emergency room.
Even so, Whitney and Alex realize that while their relationship might not be perfect on paper, they really do love each other -- and that works for them.
