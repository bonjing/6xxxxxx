[/b][/color] Based on his  Why Did I Get Married?  movies, Tyler Perry   s  For Better or Worse  follows the ups and downs of marriage and dating.
The show centers on Angela Williams  Tasha Smith , the owner of a successful beauty salon, and her husband of 13 years, Michael  Michael Jai White . Michael is a former professional football player who has recently partnered with Richard Ellington  Kent Faulcon  and Joseph Jetson  Jason Olive  on a new sports news program called C-Sports Now.
 Michael   s business relationship with Richard and Joseph is complicated, however, by the fact that Joseph is dating Keisha  Kiki Haynes , Michael   s ex-girlfriend and the mother of his teenage daughter.
In addition, Richard   s wife, successful real estate agent Leslie  Crystle Stewart , is Angela   s best friend, which sometimes makes it difficult for the couples to keep their business and private lives from mingling.
Brown plays Jennifer, a funny, sassy employee in Angela   s salon.
 Targeted to young adults, this series mingles its ample supply of comedy with a few more serious moments as the couples deal with the issues they face.
