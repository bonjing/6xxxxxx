From Wiki:


The Indigo Girls are an American folk rock music duo, consisting of Amy Ray and Emily Saliers. They met in elementary school and began performing together as high school students in Decatur, Georgia, part of the Atlanta metropolitan area. They started performing with the name â€œIndigo Girlsâ€ as students at Emory University, performing weekly at The Dugout, a bar in the Emory Village.

They released a self-produced, full-length record album in 1987 and contracted with a major record company in 1988. After releasing nine albums with major record labels from 1988 through 2007, they have now resumed self-producing albums with their own IG Recordings company.

Outside of working on Indigo Girls related projects, Ray has released solo albums and founded a non profit organization that promotes independent musicians, while Saliers is a entrepreneur in the restaurant industry as well as a professional author. Both Saliers and Ray self-identify as lesbian and are active in political and environmental causes.

Despite our Differences 2006



Despite Our Differences is the tenth studio album by the Indigo Girls, released in 2006. The title is drawn from track 3 I believe in love (I still believe despite our differences that what we have's enough/And I believe in you and I believe in love).


John Metzger from MusicBox Online described Despite Our Differences as "the most infectious, pop-infused set that the duo ever has managed to concoct. In fact, its melodies, harmonies, and arrangements are so ingratiating that the album carries the weight of an instant classic."[citation needed] Thom Jurekof from Allmusic wrote: "part of an emotional journey as complete as can be. More relevant than anyone dared expect. It's accessible and moving and true. It's their own brand of rock & roll, hewn from over the years, that bears a signature that is now indelible. A moving, and utterly poetic offering."[citation needed] And David Sprague from Barnes and Noble called it "an emotional journey as complete as can be".
