how the music is ripped (from what I understand there are different settings favourable for the quality of the ripped music... And yes, I know these are FLAC-files).
I hope this is the best (in terms of quality of sound) torrent for the Soundtrack, cuz I just downloaded it (and def gonna seed it, that's just how the game is played fair).
Awesome movie btw.
Thanx!"
