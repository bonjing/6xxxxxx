[/b][/color] The Mentalist tells the tale of Patrick Jane, who is employed as an independent consultant working with the California Bureau of Investigation (CBI). He had been making a living as a psychic, and he would assist the police on cases -- until his life changed when he lost the two most important people in his life to one of those serial killers he was helping track.
He now uses his refined observation skills to help the CBI solve cases.
He works with Senior Agent Teresa Lisbon, Agents Kimball Cho and Wayne Rigsby and the rookie Grace Van Pelt.
