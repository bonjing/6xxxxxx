Although in the last months of her life, her tabloid exploits overshadowed the reason she was in the public eye in the first place, itâ€™s important to remember that Amy Winehouse had undeniable musical talent to back that celebrity up. Looking at her two studio albums, Frank and Back to Black, there wasnâ€™t merely a uniquely commercial sensibility, or a terrific voice, but a versatility, and a humanity that set her apart from her contemporaries. And the posthumously-release Lioness: Hidden Treasures celebrates all of those qualities: collecting unreleased instrumentals and completing production on them, or in some cases, creating new arrangements, producers Salaam Remi and Mark Ronson create a surprisingly satisfying tribute to the late Amy Winehouse that avoids feeling like a roundup of discarded material or a cheap, redundant cash-in for folks who already own her existing output.

The eleven-song collection opens with Winehouseâ€™s cover of Ruby & The Romanticsâ€™ â€œOur Day Will Come,â€ and Remiâ€™s ska-tinged arrangement of the r&b; standard doesnâ€™t alter the core elements of the original song, even as Winehouseâ€™s unpredictable, syrupy delivery gives it new life. â€œBetween the Cheats,â€ meanwhile, is more straightforward Winehouse fare from her Back to Black era, balancing anachronistic production with her nakedly honest, bittersweet lyricism. (Mayer Hawthorne should think of adding this tune to his repertoire as a tribute song during concerts, because heâ€™d knock it out.) The â€œOriginal Versionâ€ of â€œTears Dry On Their Ownâ€ augments the album version with a chorus of background voices, offering a slightly more epic sound, but Remi preserves the clarity and intensity of Winehouseâ€™s commanding presence at its forefront.

Although itâ€™s a little scat-jazzy for my particular tastes, Winehouseâ€™s rendition of â€œGirl From Ipanemaâ€ is pretty terrific, communicating the dreamy seaside feeling of Getz & Gilbertoâ€™s original while Remi works overtime giving it a snappy breakbeat. Truthfully, Iâ€™m happier to see more recordings from her Frank days, and songs like â€œHalf Timeâ€ and â€œBest Friends, Right?â€ demonstrate that her old-school sound was a device, not a trap for her creativity, and that she could easily have churned out current-sounding material as well. The discâ€™s closer, â€œA Song For You,â€ seems to encapsulate all of her different sounds into one track, as Remi takes Leon Russellâ€™s song, places an instrumental behind it that sounds a lot like Isaac hayesâ€™ â€œWalk On By,â€ and gives her a suitably epic send-off. Mind you, these eleven songs are still no substitute for new material from Winehouse, but given her otherwise limited output, Lioness: Hidden Treasures offers fans a worthy new volume of music to listen to, and further celebrate her incredible, but sadly brief, career as one of the decadeâ€™s most distinctive performers
