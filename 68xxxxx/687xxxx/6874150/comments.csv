,LechuCzechu,2012-01-31T15:13Z,"This torrent is CRAP, don't download it:

1. It's not DVDRip - it's a Telesync.
2. The quality for that file size is V: 2/10.
3. The *.mkv makes you think you can turn off the subs, but being a TS it's harsubbed in Swedish.
4. It would be a good torrent in 2006 or 2007 but not today.

I strongly recommend this torrent to be retired not to mislead people like me who downloaded it and got crap.

If you want to watch the movie, go here:
