Along with Leftfield's Leftism, Spooky's Gargantuan helped define the progressive house that we all know and love today. There are some bonafide classics on this album. The epic "Little Bullet Part One" sounds absolutely majestic over a decade later, and so do, to a lesser extent, "Little Bullet Part Two" and "Schmoo" (including the more somber dub version). These tracks are timeless classics that have aged marvelously.

Your not going to like every song though. The opening "Don't Panic" is just cheesy and annoying, and "Land Of Oz" is in the same vein saved only by an infectious bassline. Also, the closing "Let Go" doesn't really do much for me either. But for the most part, what's here is good, if unmemorable (save for the classics mentioned above). Progressive house fans should pick this up for their collection, but this is by no means essential (save for "Little Bullet", which should be in everyone's collection). Check out the High Velocity Mix on Sasha & John Digweed's Renaissance Mix Collection or on the single release.
