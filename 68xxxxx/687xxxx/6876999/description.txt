... in there own writing

heres what one person told me that worked for them in windows 7 64bit
For Win 7 (maybe Vista too) 64 bit users, here is what I did to get it to work.
- Ran the file 'DVDFab Platinum v8.1.3.6 Qt Final + Patch'
- Chose to run the setup at the top.
- On install, chose a custom install path. Rather then let it install to the 'Program Files (x86)', erase the (x86). So the path would be 'c:Program FilesDVDFab 8 Qt (32-bit)'
Note: I appended (32-bit) to the name so I would remember that it's a 32-bit app and not 64-bit.
- From the first launch window of DVDFab, choose 'Patch or Crack'. A explorer window should pop up that points to 'C:UsersJoeAppDataLocalTempir_ext_temp_0AutoPlayDocsPatch And Crack'
- Open the 'or Crack' folder.
- Copy the 'msvcr90.dll' file to your 'c:Program FilesDVDFab 8 Qt (32-bit)' folder. Rename the original if needed.
- Go back to your 'Patch and Crack' folder.
- Open the 'DVDFab.Products.v8.x.x.x.Multi.Patch.v1.0-BBB' folder
- Launch 'Patch'
- Press the 'P' button.
- Navigate to your 'c:Program FilesDVDFab 8 Qt (32-bit)' folder and select the 'msvcr90.dll' you copied over from earlier.
- Click 'Open'
That should do it. Open DVDFab and verify that it says in the field "License Expires" it says "Never Expires"
