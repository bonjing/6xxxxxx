    Kerwin Matthews, playing a dissolute drifter down on his luck, is        
    stranded in a cheap bar in France where he falls for Annette, the        
    pretty daughter of the proprietor, played by Nadia Gray. Nadia Gray      
    gradually shifts the young man's attentions to herself, rather than      
    her daughter, and together Matthews and Gray concoct a plot to help      
    Gray's estranged husband, now a homicidal maniac confined in an          
    institution after a grisly series of killings dubbed "The Acetylene      
    Murders" by the press, out of the mental institution so he can escape    
    from the country.
