e blu-ray sound quality is much better than this"" i will have to disagree with you on this. the sound quality on this is much superior to the blue ray version. the blueray has the volume set at a low level and the low and high frequencies have been messed with. even though it is nice to watch the blueray version as it is the same show from different camera's.  to get the same volume as this version if i play your blueray i have to turn my tv up from 20 to 50.
