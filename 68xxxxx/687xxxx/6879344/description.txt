Love Hate & Propaganda | Season 2 | The Cold War


Propaganda, the weapon of mass persuasion, is a powerful force and has helped shape events of the 20th century. Each series examines how propaganda influenced significant moments in history, and the lives of the people who lived through them. Hosted by George Stroumboulopoulos, Love, Hate and Propaganda aims to tell the story of the world we live in to a media savvy generation.

After World War II, two powerful blocs, a democratic and capitalist west led by the United States and a communist world dominated by the Soviet Union faced each other. Each side claimed the other was an implacable ideological foe bent on the destruction of their way of life. This battle would never produce direct armed confrontation between the two countries, but it mobilized minds as never before. The Cold War was the ultimate psychological battle. Its weapons were love, hate and propaganda.
