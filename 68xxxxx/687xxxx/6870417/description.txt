CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D

[size=4][color=blue]It's the closing night at the last drive-in theater in America and Cecil B. Kaufman has planned the ultimate marathon 
of lost film prints to unleash upon his faithful cinephile patrons. Four films so rare that they have never been exhibited 
publicly on American soil until this very night! With titles like Wadzilla, I Was A Teenage Werebear, The Diary of Anne 
Frankenstein, and Zom-B-Movie, Chillerama not only celebrates the golden age of drive-in B horror shlock but also spans over 
four decades of cinema with something for every bad taste.[/color][/size]
