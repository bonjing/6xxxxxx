  "Magician's Hat" is an instrumental progressive rock album originally released
  in Sweden late 1972 by Swedish musician Bo Hansson. The genesis of the album can
  be traced back to the early 1970 recording sessions for Hansson's first solo album,
  "Lord of the Rings". As work on that album neared completion, the prolific Hansson
  also began working on additional material that was not intended for the album.

  Like its predecessor, the album was, at least partly, influenced by fairy tale and
  fantasy themes, with the song "Elidor" having been directly inspired by Alan Garner's
  1965 fantasy novel Elidor.

  Bo Hansson passed away on April 23, 2010, at the age of 67.
