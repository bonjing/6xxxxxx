Plot or Synopsis
A group of attractive young strangers joined a \"survival game\" led by a TV host and a photographer on a remote desert island. Among them were Peng Fei (by Chen Xiaochun) and Yi Lin (by Yang Mi). Each person had his or her own agenda, but was chasing after a common goal: one million dollars prize! Greed drove them to plot against each other tit for tat the moment they boarded the boat, yet lust was still brewing among the youngsters under the blue sky on the vast sea. No one sensed the danger crawling near.
