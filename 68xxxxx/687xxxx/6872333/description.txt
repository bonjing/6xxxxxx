"Express Christmas"

The family is gathered at Jay and Gloria's 
pool on a sunny December day, and that's 
where they realize that everyone will be 
scattered this coming Christmas, so if they 
want to celebrate together, then it will have 
to be today! Everyone sets off with their 
respective duties for Express Christmas - 
Mitchell, Alex and Lily get the tree, Jay and 
Cameron are in charge of gift wrapping, Phil 
and Manny get the groceries, Gloria and Luke 
go retrieve the ornaments, and Claire and 
Haley shop for all the gifts. When they all 
return in the evening, it's quite a sight.
