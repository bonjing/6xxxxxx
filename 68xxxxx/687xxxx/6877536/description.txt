Fuzzy walks a musical tightrope. Their sound balances on that thin line between soothing and sharp vocals, driving rock, and quirky pop. Frontwomen Chris Toppin and Hilken Mancini met in 1993, as co-workers at Newbury Street's Tower Records. Soon, two other Boston recruits -- drummer David Ryan (Lemonheads) and bassist Winston Braman (Come) -- joined, and the four-piece issued the Half a Cow EP. Fuzzy, the eponymous debut on Seed Records, appeared in 1994 and spawned the "Flashlight" single and accompanying video.

Fuzzy's second album, Electric Juices, is as light as air. It's pleasant girl pop that falls somewhere between the sweetness of Velocity Girl's Simpatico and the grunge pop of Veruca Salt's American Thighs. Repeated listens fail to elicit significant changes in mood or structure from one song to the next, and the monotony can get a bit frustrating. But it would be hard for this group of songs to inspire a strong reaction -- positive or negative.
