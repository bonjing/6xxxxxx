The original Panasonic HD Writer AE 2.0 video-editing application for use with Panasonic HDC cameras, with the 2_0L142 update.

I've lost my original CD and I had a really hard time finding another one. I hope this helps.

- First run the main setup that installs the version 2.0
- Then run the update installation

Enjoy!


P.S. Dear Panasonic, your products are great - but it is just not fair that you don't offer a free download of the software to your paying customers. Please reconsider it.
