The source of any photograph is not the camera or even the scene viewed through the viewfinder--it is the mind of the photographer: this is where an image is created before it is committed to a memory card or film. In The Photographer\'s Mind, the follow-up to the international bestseller, The Photographer\'s Eye, photographer and author Michael Freeman unravels the mystery behind the creation of a photograph.

The nature of photography demands that the viewer constantly be intrigued and surprised by new imagery and different interpretations, more so than in any other art form. The aim of this book is to answer what makes a photograph great, and to explore the ways that top photographers achieve this goal time and time again.

As you delve deeper into this subject, The Photographer\'s Mind will provide you with invaluable knowledge on avoiding cliche, the cyclical nature of fashion, style and mannerism, light, and even how to handle the unexpected.
