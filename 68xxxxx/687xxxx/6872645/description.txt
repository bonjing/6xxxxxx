As much a treasured part of Ibiza as Pacha, Privilege, or Las Salinas beach.

In spite of the rise of its brasher, newer neighbours, Mambo, Savannah, Kanya at al, the name on everybody\'s lips is still CafÃ© del Mar, which was built in 1980 and designed by well known Catalan architect Lluis GÃ©ell.


The idea is a simple one, you sit by the shores of the bay of Calo des Moro in San Antonio and admire the stunning sunsets to a backdrop of ambient and eclectic music provided by the DJ in the bar. The simplicity of the event and the pleasure one takes in the perfect combination of scenery, beautiful weather and the wonderfully chilled music, make every sunset a special one. Even now, after 10 years on the island, we are still awed by the silence which descends on the bar as the sun reluctantly gives up its last rays, before vanishing below the horizon.

One of the reasons for the amazing success of this bar are the excellent chillout albums which have been released annually since 1994, pioneering the chillout genre at the time of the first release. There have since been many imitators, but only one true CafÃ© del Mar...

You can order each of these albums online through Amazon. They make excellent presents and will grace any CD collection. We recommend mixing a jug of SangrÃ­a (red wine, slices of orange and lemon, a dash of sparkling wine, lots of ice and sugar to taste), putting on one of these CDs, closing your eyes and floating away...

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.


RAPtURE (My transportation outta here).

The Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe That The Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn\'t PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)

In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed..

\"And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.

\"Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...

May Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed Long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.

Ephesians 5:11

11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.
