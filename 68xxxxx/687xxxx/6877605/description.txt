This is the best-looking version of the Star Wars Holiday Special you're ever likely to see. This version is based primarily on the WBBM Chicago version, which looks a ton better than the other versions no matter what anyone says. Look at the detail! And the color! The commercials come from the WMAR Baltimore version. And yes this disc DOES have Rifftrax as an audio option, thanks for asking! This is the version to see, so if someone tells you to settle for any other, just say NO!

Happy Life Day!!!
