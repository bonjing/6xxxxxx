This is a movie that is a sober wake-up call for all those that think a European
Union with diverse cultures would be anything but a continual "comedy of errors"
without a real humorous side despite the incessant pressures to break down barriers
to becoming absorbed into some other idea of existence as to what is the 
now advocated "new norm".
