Show your technical and managerial skills in this high-quality
simulation by the developers of Farming Simulator.
Manage, maintain and expand your own mountains and villages in
the Ski Region Simulator 2012 to bring your ski resort to success.
Starting with a single lift and a short trail, the player has
to attract guests by tending his resorts and keeping the visitors
excited. The 4 km2 large ski region can be explored by foot and
vehicle. Furthermore, a large automotive fleet containing
well-known vehicles like snow cats and snow cannons can be
discovered and operated. Prepare the slopes with highly detailed
snow cats, build up ski-lifts with the appropriate equipment,
and take care of your fleet by buying the right machines.
To entertain the inhabitants of the resort, the player can
serve delicious meals in the upgradeable Alpine huts, and
deliver cool aprs-ski entertainment. If the player manages
the resort wisely, more and more visitors will make their ski
empire grow
