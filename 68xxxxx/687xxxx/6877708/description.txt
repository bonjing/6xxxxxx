Release Notes:

Originally anticipated for a late 2010 release, "Vaccine" , the third
studio release from Younger Brother is finally available for pre-order
and will be distributed on April 11, 2011.

Younger Brother's worldly music fuses a combination of a number of
genres and influences from experienced musicians that create it.

The dream-team side-project featuring Simon Posford (Shpongle,
Hallucinogen), Benji Vaughn (Prometheus), Ru Campbell, Marc Brownstein
(The Disco Biscuits), Tommy Hamilton (Brothers Past, American Babies)
and Joe Russo (Furthur, Benevento/Russo Duo, American Babies) will be
touring all over the world this spring from Israel to Moscow to London
to the United States. Live touring on this scale is rare for Younger
Brother, so I wouldn't miss it if you're a fan of the band.
