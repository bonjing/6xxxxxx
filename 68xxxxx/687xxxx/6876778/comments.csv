change the mdm.dat
When you get the black screen, quit the application and put back the original mdm.dat file. Start the application again. Don't register, choose activate later. Worked for me - successfully installed Chinese Mandarin L1, L2 and L3. At least L1 seems to work OK - sound and pronunciation check working. Haven't tried L2 and L3 yet.

Good luck everyone :-)"
