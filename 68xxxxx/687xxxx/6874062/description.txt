  "El-Ahrairah" is a progressive rock album originally issued in Sweden
  1977 by Swedish musician Bo Hansson. The album were internationally released
  as "Music Inspired by Watership Down", and as this title suggests, the album is
  built around musical ideas inspired by Richard Adams heroic fantasy novel
  "Watership Down". The original release title was taken directly from the
  pages of "Watership Down", with "El-Ahrairah" being the name of a trickster,
  folk hero-deity rabbit, known as "The Prince with a Thousand Enemies".

  Bo Hansson passed away on April 23, 2010, at the age of 67.
