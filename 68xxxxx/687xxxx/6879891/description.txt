Filmed Live at the Beacon Theater in Boston, here is the fourth full-length comedy special by comedian Louis C.K.  If you enjoy this upload please pay the $5 to download it from the artist.  No Mafiaa, no middleman.  Just Louie connecting with his fans.  I have uploaded this version for those who can't afford the $5 or wish to try before they buy.
 
Message from the artist:
  
To those who might wish to torrent this video: look, I dont really get the whole torrent thing. I dont know enough about it to judge either way. But Id just like you to consider this: I made this video extremely easy to use against well-informed advice. I was told that it would be easier to torrent the way I made it, but I chose to do it this way anyway, because I want it to be easy for people to watch and enjoy this video in any way they want without corporate restrictions.
 
Please bear in mind that I am not a company or a corporation. Iâ€™m just some guy. I paid for the production and posting of this video with my own money. I would like to be able to post more material to the fans in this way, which makes it cheaper for the buyer and more pleasant for me. So, please help me keep this being a good idea. I canâ€™t stop you from torrenting; all I can do is politely ask you to pay your five little dollars, enjoy the video, and let other people find it in the same way.
 
Sincerely,
 
Louis C.K.
