From Wiki:



Black Label Society is a heavy metal band formed by Zakk Wylde, with nine studio albums, one live album, two compilation albums, one EP, and three video albums released since formation of the band.

In the early 1990s, Wylde had formed his own solo band Pride & Glory, playing a mixture of bluesy southern rock with heavy metal[citation needed]. However, after one album, they disbanded in December 1994. Wylde subsequently recorded an acoustic solo album, Book of Shadows (released 1996). In May 1998, after limited commercial success with Book of Shadows, Wylde and drummer Phil Ondich recorded what became Black Label Society's debut album Sonic Brew. It was decided, rather than the album being another solo album for Wylde, that they would form a long term band. It was known from the start that Nick Catanese would be retained as the second guitarist in the band (Catanese previously toured as rhythm guitarist for the Book Of Shadows tour). John DeServio, who previously worked with Wylde as a temporary replacement in Pride & Glory, joined as the band's bassist for the album's tour.

Sonic Brew was released in Japan on 28 October 1998. Due to delays in signing with a record label (Spitfire Records), the album was not released in the rest of the world until 4 May 1999.

The band's second album Stronger Than Death followed in 2000, with DeServio being replaced by Steve Gibb. Craig Nunenmacher replaced Ondich in July 2000, with his debut recording with the band being the live album Alcohol Fueled Brewtality Live +5. This was followed by 1919 Eternal,which was dedicated to Wylde's father and was released in 2002. Steve Gibb was temporarily replaced by Mike Inez during the Ozzfest 2001 tour, and then Robert Trujillo (Metallica) took over bass duties for the band the next year.

In 2003, Trujillo joined Metallica, leaving the bass position in Black Label Society open, which left room for Inez to rejoin the band for a short 2 week tour, supporting the band's album The Blessed Hellride. James LoMenzo joined the band in 2004 after the release of Hangover Music Vol. VI, which was the band's last release for Spitfire Records.

On the first four studio albums, Wylde played every instrument except for the drums, including vocals, guitars, piano, and bass guitar.

In 2005, after the band signed with Artemis Records, the album Mafia was released. In October, LoMenzo left the band (and joined Megadeth a few months later) and was replaced by the band's original bassist, John DeServio. In 2006, the band left Artemis Records and signed to Roadrunner Records, releasing the album Shot to Hell.

In June 2007, Black Label Society parted ways with Roadrunner Records.

As of July 2007, members of Black Label Society DeServio and Catanese both signaled the start of new bands as Zakk Wylde toured with Ozzy Osbourne. DeServio's band, Cycle of Pain (or C.O.P), has been shopping to major labels and is believed to have inked a deal. Catanese's band, Speed X, includes Mike Stone from QueensrÃ¿che and is currently recording. However, according to DeServio at a guitar clinic/autograph signing in Huntington, NY, Black Label Society was set to begin recording a new album in the fall of 2008, though this never happened.

Drummer Craig Nunenmacher left the band in February 2009, and was replaced by Will Hunt (of Dark New Day, Evanescence)

On August 10, 2010, Order Of The Black, their 8th studio album, was released. It reached number 4 on the Billboard 200 chart.

The band is currently touring in support of their new album. The Black Label Berzerkus tour started in Portland, Oregon, with Children of Bodom and Clutch sharing the main support slot and 2cents opening.[1]

In March 2011, Will Hunt left the band to record with Evanescence, and Danzig drummer Johnny Kelly (formerly of Type O Negative) filled in for him for the rest of the tour, however in May 2011, Mike Froedge of doubleDrive and Catanese's band Speed X joined the band.

Black Label Society will release The Song Remains Not the Same, on May 3 via Entertainment One Music. The offering features unplugged versions of material from their latest album, Order of the Black, as well as additional material recorded during the Order of the Black sessions. The Song Remains Not the Same was conceived, created and compiled by Zakk Wylde and the title is a nod to one of Wylde's favorite bands, Led Zeppelin[2]

On September 14th, 2011, in a hand-written letter, Zakk Wylde thanked Mike Froedge for his time behind the drums with the band, and introduced Breaking Benjamin's Chad Szeliga as the band's new drummer.

An interview with ESPN revealed an acoustic DVD entitled "Unblackened" was in the works for 2012. 







Sonic Brew  1999



Sonic Brew is the first album by the heavy metal band Black Label Society, however unlike the albums that followed, this album still possessed a distinct Southern rock overtone that up to this time had predominated Zakk Wylde's solo writing style. The album was initially released in Japan on October 28, 1998. It contained 13 tracks (lacking "Lost My Better Half" and "No More Tears"); the cover art was printed on clear plastic, with a separate paper booklet. The back cover was printed with golden ink, and the packaging was, overall, a lot higher quality than all later versions.

There was a long delay before it was released outside of Japan, because the drums and vocals were buried on some of the tracks towards the end of the disc, so it was collectively decided to remix it for the US release. Due to the delay, Wylde and drummer Phil Ondich decided to give the USA an added bonus and went to the studio in California and recorded the aggressive "Lost My Better Half" as a one-off bonus track for the album - the recording of which reportedly prompted Wylde to pursue a heavier direction for the band's music thereafter. Sonic Brew was finally released on May 4, 1999 with a standard gloss-printed booklet. Early copies came packed with a free Zakk Wylde guitar pick.

Subsequently the Johnnie Walker whisky company issued a cease and desist order to Wylde on the album cover, which had been designed to look just like a bottle of Johnnie Walker's Black Label Whisky. The band decided to reissue the album with a different album cover, this time merely the band's skull logo and as an added incentive, they wanted to record a further bonus track for the fans who wanted to buy this now-third version of the album. Wylde, Ondich, and Mike Inez of Alice In Chains (who alongside Wylde had helped write the original) recorded their cover of Ozzy's "No More Tears" accordingly.

"Bored To Tears, "Born To Lose" and "No More Tears" were released as promotional singles for the album, though no videos were made.

1919 Eternal 2002





1919 Eternal (also stylized as 1919 Eternal) is the third album by the heavy metal band Black Label Society. It was released on March 5, 2002 and was written for Zakk Wylde's father.

Five songs from the album sessions were written by Zakk Wylde for Ozzy Osbourne's album Down to Earth. Ozzy rejected the songs because they were "too Black Label", so Zakk kept them for this album.[citation needed] The songs were "Bleed for Me", "Life, Birth, Blood, Doom", "Demise of Sanity", an alternate piano version of "Bridge to Cross", and a demo presumably called "I'll Find the Way". The latter two were never released. These original demo songs featured drummer Christian Werr, a friend of Zakk's who happened to be in the right place at the right time to record the tracks. Later, when Zakk went to re-record these demos for 1919 Eternal, Christian's drum tracks were used for "Bleed for Me", "Life, Birth, Blood, Doom", and "Demise of Sanity", which is why Craig Nunenmacher does not appear on these songs.

The original title for 1919 Eternal was Deathcore WarMachine Eternal[citation needed]. Zakk decided to change it because of the events on September 11, 2001. The album artwork is based on a Nazi propaganda poster used to recruit Dutchmen into the Schutzstaffel (SS).

1.	"Bleed for Me" â€“ 5:31

The Blessed Hellride 2003


The Blessed Hellride is the fourth studio album by Black Label Society. It contains a mix of heavy (Stoned and Drunk, Stillborn) and lighter (The Blessed Hellride, Dead Meadow) tunes. The second track "Doomsday Jesus" was featured on the soundtrack to the game MTX: Mototrax, but with altered lyrics. The third track "Stillborn" is featured on the soundtrack of the game Guitar Hero: World Tour, Zakk Wylde was also a playable celebrity rockstar in that same game.

Ozzy Osbourne appears on the first single "Stillborn," though his name was not used to promote the track. He is credited inside the booklet, however, due to Ozzy being on Sony Records at the time, Spitfire Records were not allowed to promote this song with Osbourne's name - a sticker on the cover of the album said "featuring special guest star."

The Japanese bonus track "F.U.N." is a joke song, presumably recorded while Zakk and Craig Nunenmacher were horsing around in the studio. The song's lyrics poke fun at the cheesiest of the 1980s hairband's "party" lyrics.

A song called "No Other" was recorded, mixed, and mastered for this album, however, it remained unreleased until the next album, "Hangover Music Vol. VI."


Tracks: 

1.	"Stoned and Drunk" â€“ 5:02
2.	"Doomsday Jesus" â€“ 3:30
3.	"Stillborn" â€“ 3:15
4.	"Suffering Overdue" â€“ 4:29
5.	"The Blessed Hellride" â€“ 4:32
6.	"Funeral Bell" â€“ 4:41
7.	"Final Solution" â€“ 4:04
8.	"Destruction Overdrive" â€“ 3:01
9.	"Blackened Waters" â€“ 3:56
10.	"We Live No More" â€“ 4:02
11.	"Dead Meadow" â€“ 4:30








Hangover Music, Vol. VI 2004


Mid-Life Crisis Music, Vol VI is the fifth studio album by heavy metal band Black Label Society, released April 20, 2004. This album is a much more mellow affair than any other Black Label Society album, and some fans have recognized it as a nod back to Zakk Wylde's solo effort, Book of Shadows, from 1996. The album contains a piano version of Procol Harum's 1967 No. 1 "Whiter Shade of Pale" and a song entitled "Layne," which is written in memory of Layne Staley of Alice in Chains.

The song "No Other" is a leftover track from The Blessed Hellride sessions, which explains why Zakk Wylde played bass on this song, whereas other bassists played on the rest of the album. The song was also recorded, mixed, and mastered by the same team that was responsible for the production on The Blessed Hellride.

This was the last album that Black Label Society recorded for Spitfire Records - it was recorded as a contract fulfilling obligation, and therefore received very little promotion from the label. None of the songs from this album were performed live by the band until 2009 when "Damage Is Done" was performed.

1.	"Crazy or High" - 3:34

It is one of the band's most commercially successful releases selling over 250,000 copies in the U.S. The track "In This River" was written before the death of Zakk Wylde's friend and fellow guitarist Dimebag Darrell, but it has since been dedicated to him.

Shot to Hell is the seventh studio album by Black Label Society. It was released September 12, 2006 and was the band's only record to have been released by Roadrunner Records.

The band's signature skull, featured on their logo, can be seen on the 8 ball on the table.
