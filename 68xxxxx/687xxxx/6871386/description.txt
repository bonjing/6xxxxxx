Storyline:
A thriller in which a battle of philosophies between a fundamentalist Christian and an atheist escalates into a lethal battle of wills.
Ultimately, as a test of faith, or lack of it, the believer forces the non-believer onto the ledge of a tall building.
He then has one hour to make a choice between his own life and someone else's.
Without faith in an afterlife, will he be capable of such a sacrifice?
