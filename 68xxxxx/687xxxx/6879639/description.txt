NOTES:

Thanks to ILLUMINATI for the source files and got too say they were mint for a cam.The video was in 3 parts
so needed to rotate,crop and append all the parts.The res after crop was different on all 3 parts so went with one that
looked the best,but theres parts the AR might go slightly out,but it was the only to join all 3 without added black
borders YUK.
Video as been clean with heavy noise filter and all the normal stuff.....audio just needed to resync and remux.
And also on the joins there might be some slight video overlap,but tried to cut it as close as i could so you don't miss
any of the film.
Also got a sweet looking 720P done aswell coming soon
