Plot or Synopsis
Tripp ('Patrick Dempsey' ) walks into a bank to get some change and ends up as a hostage to two bank robber-teams, robbing the bank he is at.
In an almost Sherlock Holmesian way he has to solve this Agatha Christie inspired mystery and win the girls (Ashley Judd) heart.
But not everything is at it seems, and there are many twists and turns in this comedy.
