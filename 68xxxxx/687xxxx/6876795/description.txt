Tootsie is one of my favorite all-time movies for the truly lovely great
Christianly warm beauty and lovely gracious presence of the (arguably) 
goddess of Germanic beauty in this movie - Ms. Jessica Lange - born of a
German parent in fact.

Whenever I hear the theme song "it might be you" by Stephen Bishop 
(included here as an mp3 add-on bonus) I think of Jessica Lange handling
all my needs and cares for Christianly warmth and comfort in what is any
idea of a worthwhile earthly existence.

Dustin Hoffman is interesting in this choice of role, he is certainly
a talented actor and quite versatile in what he is able to attempt and
even pull off quite successfully I would say.

once again:
To protect the spirit of Jessica Lange is the highest calling of nobility in 
a worthy enough man
