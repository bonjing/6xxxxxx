::Plot::
The film opens with former U.S. Marine Tommy Riordan (Tom Hardy) visiting his father, Paddy (Nick Nolte), a former alcoholic who has become a Christian. Tommy becomes angry about his father's formerly abusive behavior, and Paddy fails to convince him that he has truly changed. The next day, Tommy enters a gym where he beats a professional fighter named Pete "Mad Dog" Grimes (Erik Apple) unconscious within seconds, in a fight which is filmed via video phone and later uploaded to the Internet where it goes viral. Tommy asks his father to help him train for a winner-takes-all mixed martial arts tournament called Sparta, but only under the condition that they do not try to reconcile their relationship. It is later explained that Tommy enters the tournament in order to give the money he hopes to win to the widow and son of his fallen friend in the Marine Corps.
