    While driving through the desert, a teenage girl is frightened by a      
    seven-foot giant which appears in her path. After escaping, she          
    returns to the site with her boyfriend and her father in an attempt      
    to find the giant. They do, and it proceeds to terrorize them and the    
    rest of Palm Springs, California.
