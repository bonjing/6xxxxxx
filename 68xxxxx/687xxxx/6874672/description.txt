plot:

There Glows The Neighbourhood!

Deck The Halls is a family comedy about one-upsmanship, jealousy, clashing neighbours, home decoration... and the true spirit of the holidays. For Cloverdale, Massachusetts optometrist Steve Finch (Matthew Broderick), no time of the year can compare to the glory of the Christmas season. And, for many years now, he's carried on a series of heartfelt but hokey Yuletide traditions that his family - wife Kelly (Kristin Davis), daughter Madison (Alia Shawkat), and son Carter (Dylan Blue) - at this point, can barely tolerate. Despite his family's exhausted protests, super-organized Steve has the December calendar chock full with everything from shooting the Finch's annual Christmas card photo, to their ritual tree harvesting and neighbourhood caroling night. There's also scheduled time for shopping, 'personal reflection,' and the town's yearly Winterfest carnival, which Steve joyously oversees.

But Steve's Christmas bliss is suddenly destroyed when slippery car salesman Buddy Hall (Danny DeVito) moves in next door and Steve finds himself going toe-to-toe with his new neighbour. Buddy quickly begins to undermine Steve's dominance as the local 'King of Christmas' when he sets out to festoon his new house with enough glowing holiday lights so it will be visible from outer space.
