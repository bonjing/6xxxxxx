A strange one for sure. Contains a few of Neil's lesser known classics (Mideast Vacation, Too Lonely, Prisoner of Rock n Roll) as well as one of his all-time worse songs, Inca Queen, which still manages to have a gorgeous melody. Around the World is sung with great passion & anger. Very much a mixed bag. But if you're a fan, you'll have to own it eventually
