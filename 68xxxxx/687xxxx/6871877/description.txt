A lot has happened in the four years since this book was first released. This second edition of Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen has been fully revised and updated to include new or changed websites, to delete dead sites and to provide new tips on using the Internet to locate people.

The Internet is the most powerful research tool available today, but there are tricks to using it to its full potential. Noel Montgomery Elliot reveals what he's learned over his 35 years of research experience, including the most common mistakes people make when trying to locate ancestors who lived a century or more ago. He reveals how the little-known science called onomatology is one of the keys to unlocking genealogical research in the distant past, and he shows how easy it is to open the door.

Whether searching for ancestors or descendents, or just looking to get in touch with friends from years ago, this is the definitive how-to research handbook. Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen is an exciting read about what is possible now and what will soon be available to those willing to surf on the cutting edge of technology.
