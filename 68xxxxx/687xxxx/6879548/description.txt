Are You Passionate? is a 2002 album by Neil Young which features Booker T. & the M.G.'s and Crazy Horse. It represents Young's foray into soul music, not sounding like anything he had previously released. Exceptions are rocker "Goin' Home", recorded with Crazy Horse, and the brooding "Let's Roll", a response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The album ends with "She's a Healer", an extended jam.

The album's title is a reference to The Jimi Hendrix Experience 1967 album "Are You Experienced?".
