This is a remastered CDset offering of the lovely Ms Deanna Durbin
Screen legends from the 30s and 40s whose acting talents are credited
with single handedly saving a studio from bankruptcy!

They just don't sing with such feminine charm anymore it would appear!


Enjoy! variable bitrates between 256k and 320k
