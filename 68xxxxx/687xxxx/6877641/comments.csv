,Kimoguri,2011-12-13T23:54Z,This book just aint worth the bandwidth. Entertaining however there's quite a few ideas presented here that aren't the authors. Slacko doesn't reference in particular Hynek or Vallee when he repeats their words. Otherwise called plagarism. There is nothing new here and in fact the style of writing is plain annoying. I guess that's why I picked up for a dollar last year in a 2$ shop.
