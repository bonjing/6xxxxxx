Jack White's Third Man Records Collection Vol 3 (Vinyl Rip) MP3@320Kbps

Credit to the Original Rippers.  I have taken the Origial FLAC and WAV Vinyl Rip
Files Converted them to MP3 @320Kbps, Correctly Tagged the files and In Some cases
for this upload I've increased the Volume as you could barely hear the Tracks from
the Original Rips but I've been conservative as I didn't want it to sound Processsed. 

ENJOY!
