There's a whisper of "Little Earthquakes"- era Tori Amos in "Ghost",the aching first single from Ingrid Michaelson's upcoming Album "Human Again," and as the singer seeks songwriting maturity, the darker shade that her latest full-length captures "A really dark time" of her, and "Ghost" appears to attack the notion that she can only pen adorable love songs.
