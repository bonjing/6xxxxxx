perfect copy of movie

the movie is in english

although the info above  says polish it does include polish  texted language  but the actual movie  IS in english  and has  no subtitles included but you can get them  at subscene:

Wonderland.(2003).DVDRip.XViD-DEiTY

thanks for the upload seemed to be a harder movie to find  but this one works great

reminds me of boogie nights the movie  "
