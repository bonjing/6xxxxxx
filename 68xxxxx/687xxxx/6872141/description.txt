Information
------------------------------

Using "virtual reality" computer simulations, social journalist James Burke traces the Earth's history of ice ages and warming trends, and presents several possible scenarios caused by the greenhouse effect during the 1990s to 2050. The video release consists of two parts, "The Fatal Flower" and "Secret of the Deep".


1)  The Fatal Flower 
The first part is based on history before 1990. It theorizes and tells facts about the effects global weather has had on the history of mankind and how some historical events happened also because of natural temperature change.

2)  Secret of the Deep 
The second part speculates about the future and especially the ways in which we could overcome the bad effects of global weather.
