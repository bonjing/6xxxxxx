London, England 1999
Date: 99-03-25
Venue: Wembley Arena

Recording: AUD
Quality: 8(-)
Menu: YES
Extras: None
Comments: Looks to be only a single cam (although it looks like a different angle right at the very beginning) shot from the balcony stage right. Fairly well-shot and the picture is OK but with a grainy/blurry combo. Audio is very low and weak. 2 DVD set.
