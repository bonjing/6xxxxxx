,CBMRACING,2012-03-02T15:18Z,I had the same problem. I watched your videos installed everything the way you said and Adobe still came in and turned it to a trial. I used the host and the i think the dll file. Olny one serial worked by that time so I have 4 days left on my trial. hey The Thingy I posted a message in the comments under I think the adobe tool did you ever get it and read it. 99.999% of the time he is perfect but he is human so he is allowed a mistake or two with out getting hounded on. Basically I think the problem is it is not blocking adobe from doing updates and getting into your computer. I called them once from a Starbucks cause I was having installation problems and when I gave then the serial they knew it was fake asap. Never gave them my name or anything but they knew as soon as I said the last charecter. Thanks for all your hard work
