POSSESSED features The Balanescu Quartet playing the songs of Kraftwerk, David Byrne and Alexander Balanescu.

Although there are three original compositions, including the title track, featured here, the majority of Possessed is made up of string quartet remakes of Kraftwerk songs. Given that the precision of the German electronic band\\\\\\\'s songs bear no small resemblance to Baroque classicism, the Balanescu Quartet needs to do little to make their covers work than to play them straight. ~ Jason Ankeny

Recorded at Air and Orinoco Studios, London, England; St. Augustine\\\\\\\'s Church, Kilburn, England.

Balanescu Quartet: Alexander Balanescu (violin, vocals); Clare Connors (violin); Bill Hawkes (viola); Caroline Dale (cello).
