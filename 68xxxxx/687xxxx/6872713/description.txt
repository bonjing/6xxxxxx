Sinterklaas & Zwarte Piet did their job for this year - IÂ´m
so sorry for bringing my gift so late to your eyesÂ´nÂ´ears,
but here it is:

Foreigner - I want to know what Love is (1984)


Taken from a NTSC-DVD file and transformed to:


Video: avc1 | H.264/MPEG-4 AVC 25 fps (PAL) 768x576 (4:3) 2.119 kbps
Audio: mp4a | MPEG-4 AAC LC 44.100Hz 320 kbps tot Stereo (2/0)
04:54.560 (m:s:ms)

= MP4


IÂ´ll work with those Apple-Toys, I hope... if not, feel free to shout!

You may transform the file to PAL-DVD without an enormous loss of
quality, I think...
