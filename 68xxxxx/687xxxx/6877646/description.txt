Inspired by the days when you had to ride your bike to the local arcade and stand for hours with a pocket full of quarters just to get the satisfaction of blowing up some two dimensional pixels, Code Avarice has brought back the retro feel of the old button mashing games that consumed hours of our time. DimensionZ explores the feel of the retro games with a refreshing twist of the new school modern game industry. Get your button pushers ready.. because we are going to blow some stuff up!
