DESCRIPTION
---------------

This modification for Dawn of War adds the Tyranid race,
from the tabletop war-game Warhammer 40k from which Dawn
of War was based on, to the game. The Tyranids are an alien
race, threatening the imperium from the edge of the galaxy,
living only to feast upon the flesh of their foes. They are
a fearsome adversary, but an even better ally! That's why
our mod allows you fight with and for the great Tyranid race,
swarm the enemy with hundreds of hormagaunts, stamp on your
foes with the huge carnifex and devour your opponent from
within with the deadly lictor. We aim to show players of Dawn
of War what the fantastic Tyranids are and attempt to keep as
true to the feel of the race as possible.

Tyranids 0.5b1 Release
--------------------

+HOW DO I INSTALL IT?+

Simple run the installer! It should locate your DoW folder and
automatically install into the right place. This will
overwrite 0.45SS if you have it installed, however if you happen
to still have 0.3 installed for original Dawn of War or Winter
Assault, or any of the Dark Crusade releases it won't alter those
installs.

+WHAT IF I'VE MODIFIED YOUR MOD?+

If you've modified anything in the /Tyranids/ mod folder or
subfolders, you will need to backup your alterations prior
to running the installer as it will delete the entire
directory before installing this version of the mod.
