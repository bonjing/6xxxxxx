It seems like only yesterday that we were telling you, gentle reader, about thesong. Facing criticism that it is simply an outlet for Internet piracy, the file locker service headed by Kim Dotcom created a star-studded video of celebrities quite literally singing the praises of the service. Sadly, as quickly as the bewildering video came into our lives (and our hearts) was it pulled from YouTube after a copyright complaint from Universal Music Group (UMG).

The video was commissioned byfounder Kim Dotcom and features the likes of P. Diddy, Kanye West, Will.i.am, Snoop Dogg, Alicia Keys, Jamie Foxx, Lil John,
Kim Kardashian,& more . The video went viral very quickly, making it to Twitterâ€™s trending topics within a short amount of time â€“ and then Universal Music stepped in.
