Hi, der TPB community.

I'm glad to present you with a high-quality version of this great book. I think it's well worth the bandwidth. 

Please seed at least 1:1 when you are finished. Thanks.

Enjoy! 

ps. To avoid confusion: The files have not been chaptered in any way, the program I used named and tagged them automatically, but the order is perfectly right, strangely beginning with no. 31 though.
