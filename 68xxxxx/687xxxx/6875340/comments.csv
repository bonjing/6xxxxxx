It is a key registry editor for Serious Sam 3. I had to make the folders though to make it work, but it worked like a champ. Steam\SteamApps\common\serios sam 3 folder. If you have those folders make sure to put it in the serious sam 3 folder and just run it from inside that folder. It worked for me. "
