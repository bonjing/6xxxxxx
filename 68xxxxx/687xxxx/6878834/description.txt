Episode 7

Having been taken off the case, Lund continues to chase the perpetrator but finds herself in danger. Justice Minister Thomas Buch faces the consequences of his predecessor's desperate actions and decides to go out on a limb in response - when a journalist steps forward to reveal a macabre, and thus unknown, fact relating to the suppressed military investigation. Raben is tracking his wife's movements and Special Branch, in turn, is tracking Raben's.
