If you are asking how I get the FLV file then I capture the Flash broadcast using REPLAY MEDIA CATCHER 4 from applian.com/download-videos/.

I am ALWAYS a day behind grabing the show and posting it, in case you hadn't noticed!

I post KickAxxTorrents kat.ph and Pirate Bay.  Someone on Pirate Bay also puts the torrents on btjxxkie.org.  There are many other sites also list them now.

You can search for me on Google by using ""GBTV"" and the date of the show, for example: GBTV 2011-12-07 or GBTV E56 (for the Episode you want).

KAT has ALL of my GBTV posts.  Maybe this weekend I will put them here also."
