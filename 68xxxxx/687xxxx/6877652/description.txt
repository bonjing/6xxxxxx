In this side-scrolling platformer/shooter you level up your character by literally going up to the next level. Each level-up earns you some points to spend on upgrades: more health, firepower, new weapons, skills, etc. Also, it's made of voxels, so you can destroy walls and dig tunnels or trenches to hide from enemy fire. The full game will feature many levels and upgrades, and boss fights where you can blast holes in huge bosses to get to the vulnerable spots inside them.
