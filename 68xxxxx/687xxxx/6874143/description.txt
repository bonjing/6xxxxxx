Robot Chicken 05x15: Casablankman II

Not much to say here, just that no one has provided the recent episodes in a portable device friendly version that isn't freaking huge (and didn't bother to normalize the audio).

Broadcast Date: December 04, 2011

AVI 720x400, Xvid, MP3 44.1 128k Stereo Normalized

Enjoy.
