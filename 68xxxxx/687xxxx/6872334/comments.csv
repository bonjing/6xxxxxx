Maybe you should examine your own kind and realize that we were doing just fine without a book for CENTURIES and you all needed a book 1st.  This book is just a way of showing the world what we do and how great it is...
I think it's funny that you won't download this book but you had to search for GAY SEX to find it.  Hmmm... maybe it's time you think about what you really are interested in!"
