From the retail supermarket outlets of huge, publicly traded corporations comes processed, manipulated, engineered "food products" â€“ produced by other wings of the same corporation. These artificial, toxic treats are then sold with the blessings of the Federal Trade Commission and Food and Drug Administration â€“ government organizations charged with safeguarding the public good â€“ laying the foundations for future disease and chronic ill-health for the consumer, and a guaranteed source of revenue for the medical and pharmaceutical sectors.

Kevin reveals the shocking truth of how drugs â€“ which are being advertised directly to the consumer, pushing their use to an all-time high â€“ are actually the cause of illness and disease climbing to near epidemic levels.

And, though it sounds dire, Kevin offers a light in the darkness and directs the reader to scores and scores of alternative therapies, medical practices, philosophies and â€“ most importantly â€“ potential cures that help your body regain its natural state of health and vibrancy.

So follow Kevin on an amazing journey through the behind-the-scenes world of corporate sponsored "nutrition" and "health," and learn about "Natural Cures 'THEY' Don't Want You To Know About."


About the Author
Kevin Trudeau is fast becoming the nationâ€™s foremost consumer advocate. Adopting as both his business and personal mission statement a vow to "positively impact the whole person," Kevin has been involved in a vast array of business enterprises that marketed or sold products that he personally used and believed in 100%. Having been personally responsible for over $2 billion in business world-wide, Kevin knows from personal experience how big business and government try to debunk individuals who promote products that could hurt the profits of the giant multinational corporations. Kevin spends most of his time spearheading a website that promotes education about natural healing therapies; and a website that exposes corporate and government abuse and corruption. Kevin is actively pursuing lawsuits against the individuals, corporations and government agencies that take advantage of the average consumer. He is also dedicated to the formation of various foundations to pursue these goals, and has donated much of his fortune for that purpose. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.
