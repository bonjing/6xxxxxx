However, I just noticed that episode 2 will not play, so I'm re-downloading it and I will upload a new torrent with the working version of episode 2. I have no idea how that file became corrupt, and I'm sorry that this happened. Please just delete episode 2 and re-download the new torrent when I upload it."
