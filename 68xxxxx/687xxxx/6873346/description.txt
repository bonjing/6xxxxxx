From Wiki:


Econoline Crush is a band from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada formed in 1992. Originally formed in Seattle, they eventually moved back to Vancouver. They have released four studio albums and have had notable singles such as "Wicked", "Home", "Surefire", "All That You Are", "Sparkle & Shine", "You Don't Know What It's Like", "Make It Right" and "Dirty".

After the release of their third album Brand New History, the band seemed to be on hiatus or disbanded, since vocalist Trevor Hurst started his own band called simply Hurst. However, during 2007, the band reunited and started touring around Canada with Alice Cooper. They released their latest album, Ignite, in 2008.

Econoline Crush was formed in 1992 when singer Trevor Hurst moved from Canada to Seattle and answered an ad for a new band in a local newspaper. In 1993 the band signed a record deal with EMI Music Canada after playing only 26 shows.

In 1994, the band released their first EP called Purge, with producer Dale Penner (Nickelback) at helm, and the band started building a steady following. The album even garnered them a nomination for a Juno Award in Canada. One year later, they followed it with the full-length album, Affliction which cemented their popularity in Canada even more. This album was produced by Rhys Fulber and they followed it with an extensive Canadian tour. They also toured Europe three times, with the Young Gods, Die Krupps, and Waltari, culminating in an appearance at the POP KOMM Festival in KÃ¶ln, Germany with Filter.

In 1996, the band signed with the management group Bruce Allen Talent and started recording at Sound City, with producer Sylvia Massy-Shivy, who had already worked with Prince, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Tool. A year later, they released The Devil You Know to much commercial success and critical acclaim. The album featured a slightly more mainstream sound that amplified the band's audience. They embarked on a tour with KISS, Foo Fighters, Green Day, The Tea Party and other bands. The album was released in the US in 1998 on Restless Records and they went again on tour with KISS, Stabbing Westward, God Lives Underwater, among others. While opening for KISS in Edmonton in '97, they were boo-ed off the stage after only a few songs by 18,000 people repeatedly screaming "We want KISS!"

The popularity of the band was such that some of their songs appeared on TV shows like Melrose Place, Psi Factor, ESPN, and others. The band also received their second Juno nomination for their latest album, and was asked to perform live at the televised Juno ceremony. The album also received gold and platinum awards.

The band went to California to work on their next album with producers John Travis, Bob Rock and DJ Swamp, and with collaborations from Chris Vrenna (formerly from Nine Inch Nails) and Paul Raven (Killing Joke, Prong, Ministry). In 2001, they released Brand New History to mixed reviews, despite some moderate commercial success. The album also contained the single "You Don't Know What It's Like", which was previously released in 1999 on Big Shiny Tunes 4, volume four of a series of Canadian rock compilations by Muchmusic.

The reception of their last album caused the band to temporarily disband, and each of the members dedicated time to other projects. During this time, frontman Trevor Hurst started working on a band of his own called simply Hurst.

In 2007, Hurst announced on his MySpace page that he was working on a new Econoline Crush record, while the band started touring with Hinder. The new lineup of the band is Brent Fitz, Scott Whalen, Kai Markus, and Hurst himself. Hurst and Markus (who had worked with Noise Therapy and Methods of Mayhem) co-wrote the songs for the new album which was recorded at Radiostar Studios in California. Their new album, Ignite, was released on January 15, 2008. Shortly after, the band went on tour with Three Days Grace and Seether.[1] In August 2008, they went on another tour with 3 Doors Down, Staind, and Hinder, and then with Alice Cooper in September and October 2008. In 2009 the band has been playing at festivals across Canada, including the Halifax Rocks Festival, with KISS, on July 18.

In April 2010 it was announced that Robert Morfitt is back playing guitar. The band embarked on a summer tour in 2010, joined by Greg Williamson (drummer) and bassist Steve Vincent from Alberta's Tupelo Honey (band). EMI then released "Surefire: The Best Of Econoline Crush" on September 14, 2010. The band released their latest EP "The People Have Spoken Vol. 1" on April 8, 2011.
