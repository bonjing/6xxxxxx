    Rare Demos: First to Last compiles all 24 publisher's demos that the country Music
    Foundation originally released as The First Recordings and Just Me and My Guitar.
    These are stark, moving recordings that cut to the core of each songs. Though the
    master takes are masterpieces in their own right, the demo versions are equally
    essential for dedicated fans, since they offer new insights to Williams' songwriting,
    as well as his performance technique.
