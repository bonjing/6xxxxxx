Bringing Up Bobby is the story of a European con-artist and her son Bobby, who find
themselves in Oklahoma in an effort to escape her past and build a better future.
Olive and Bobby blithely charm their way from one adventure to another until Olive's
criminal past catches up with her. Consequently, she must make a choice: continue with
a life of crime or leave the person she loves most in an effort to give Bobby a
proper chance in life.
