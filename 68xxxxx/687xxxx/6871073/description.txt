[/b][/color] When a brilliant and driven neurosurgeon???s career is cut short, she turns her unrivaled medical skills toward solving murders.
Every body has a story to tell and Dr.
Megan Hunt will find out what it is.

Dr.
Megan Hunt was a top neurosurgeon until a car accident ended her career as a surgeon.
Now that she can no longer help the living, Dr.
Hunt is Philadelphia???s most notorious medical examiner.
Although she???s amazing at her job, Dr.
Hunt???s reputation of being difficult precedes her wherever she goes.
She???s never encountered a boundary that she wouldn???t cross.
Her powerful boss tries to protect her as long as she doesn???t step too hard on the wrong toes.
Although he grudgingly acknowledges her skill, seasoned police detective Bud Morris is not as enthralled with her methods.
