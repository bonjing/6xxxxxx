
 Bo Hansson - Sagan om ringen (Lord of the rings) (Remastered) (2002) [MP3 V0] dussin

  "Lord of the Rings" is an instrumental progressive rock album originally
  issued in Sweden late 1970 by Swedish musician Bo Hansson. As its title suggests,
  it is a concept album based on author J. R. R. Tolkien's high fantasy novel.

  Today the album is considered by many critics to be a classic of the progressive
  rock genre as well as Hansson's best work. In addition, it can be seen as an early
  example of multi-instrumentalist rock, predating similar 1970s albums by artists
  such as Mike Oldfield, Rick Wakeman, and Brian Eno.

  Bo Hansson passed away on April 23, 2010, at the age of 67.
