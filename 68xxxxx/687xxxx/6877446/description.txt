Following on the heels of his hugely popular blockbuster, The 5-Factor Diet, celebrity trainer and nutritionist Harley Pasternak has searched the world to add a little variety and spice to your weight loss plan. The 5-Factor World Diet takes the 5-Factor principleâ€“five meals a day, five core ingredients, five-minute prep timeâ€“and incorporates the best foods and nutritional habits from ten of the world's healthiest countries.

While jetting to exotic locales with some of Hollywood's biggest stars as their personal health and fitness expert, Pasternak has sampled local cuisine from many corners of the world. Consequently he has made a fascinating discovery: the farther he journeyed from the United States, the easier it was to seek out foods that were both nourishing and slimming. Now he reveals the international diet secrets of the world's healthiest people, including

â€¢ the self-control technique used by the Japanese that prevents them from overeating.
â€¢ the trick to combating heart disease in France (it's not just the wine).
â€¢ the reason Swedes stay slim and trim year round and have among the highest average life expectancies (80.74 years).
â€¢ the key to Singapore' s low obesity rate (less than 2 % ).
â€¢ an explanation why notorious food-loving Italians are among the healthiest people in the world

Pasternak also shares helpful advice about ordering in restaurants, as well as pantry-stocking and cooking tips. With suggested menus and more than 120 delicious recipesâ€“from Japanese Chicken Yakatori and French Ratatouille to Chapchae Korean Stirfry and Oven Baked Swedish Meatballsâ€“ The 5-Factor World Diet will keep you healthy, fit, and looking your absolute best.

The secret to sustainable weight loss isn't counting calories or depriving yourself at the dinner table. Jean Fain tells us it's about cultivating awareness and self-acceptance wherever you are. With The Self-Compassion Diet, this Harvard Medical School-affiliated psychotherapist prescribes a practical program for transforming the way you think and feel about food and your whole self--a shift that, paradoxically, inspires physical change. Combining loving-kindness, self-hypnosis, and other winning weight-loss strategies, The Self Compassion Diet is available in two complementary formats to help you naturally progress toward genuine self-acceptance and a healthy, sustainable weight. 

With more than 30 different tools including quizzes, breathing exercises, and visualizations, the book explores four powerful weight-loss methods. The audio edition guides you through 11 key practices described in the book. Used together, this powerful combination can speed learning and boost success. Additional topics include: 1) how to appreciate the everyday activity of eating, and learn to trust your body's signals that it's nourished 2) Gradual change: a guided visualization for developing mindful eating habits 3) a meditation for getting to know the diet coach who knows you best--your compassionate "inner advisor." "Most dieters try to 'kill cravings' and break habits with self-discipline," teaches Fain. "Self-kindness can help quiet the shame that traditional diets instill, and establish a harmonious relationship with food." The Self Compassion Diet book and audio offer a treasury of heart-opening mind-body teachings and practices for improving the way you live, breathe, and eat.

In the distant past, making food choices was easyâ€”people ate whatever food was available. When and where food became more plentiful, people were able to be more discerning about what they wanted to eat. Personal ethics and preferences guided peopleâ€™s dietary decisions. They still do today, but a host of factorsâ€”including technology, farming methods, and environmental issuesâ€”make the decision of what to eat much more complex. Moreover, vegetarian and non-vegetarian groups have splintered into countless subgroups that support various specialized eating philosophies.
