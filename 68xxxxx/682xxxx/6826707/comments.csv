,chaotic82,2012-05-25T21:20Z,Just wanted to say that this torrent has a problem around 99% install...  I think the installer may be broken.
he torrent, extract the files into a folder on my desktop, then I run the setup. After all this, I click the icon that was created during the setup (to run the game) and I get a big black screen, after a while, I hit ctrl+alt+del and I can hear the sounds from the main menu, but then my computer crashes. My computer is fully capable of running this, I've played it before on my computer perfectly. Please help!"
