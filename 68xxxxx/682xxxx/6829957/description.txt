Of all the few early episodes with Lew Erskine's daughter Barbara, 
this is the most signifigant....even though it really doesn't go 
anywhere to advance the romance subplot between her and Lew's partner 
Special Agent Jim Rhodes. Lovely Lynn had little to do in her 
few remaining shows after this, and the writers did nothing 
to properly write her out of the series. Executive Producer 
Quinn Martin later used her as a guest in his "The Invaders" series.

Guest Stars --- Harold Gould, Pete Duel, Dabney Coleman, Crahan Denton,
