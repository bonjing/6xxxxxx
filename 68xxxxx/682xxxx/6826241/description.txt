PMDG MD-11
 

Precision Manuals Development Group, better known as PMDG released their long awaited MD-11 for Flightsimulator 2004 and X in October 2008. As always, system and model-wise they delivered a top notch job. As with the 737 and  747, a must have for every flightsimmer ; a real tribute to a plane once far ahead of her time. While -at time of writing- only KLM still operates the MD-11 in passenger configuration, many still soar through the skies, as freighters. Perhaps the MD-11 was not the most popular plane with operators around the world, one could say it has a big, loyal, almost fanatic fanbase.

Here at McPhat Studios, it was apparent from the start ; PMDG's MD-11 was going to be the plane we would love to get our hands on and give the (in?)famous 'McPhat One-Two'. Not just repaints for your flightsim, but a complete new set of textures, build from the ground up, at High Definition. Something users and customers have come to expect from our studios.

 

High level of detail (HDT)
While other developers gave us the possibility to utilize 200+ px/m (some even close to 400px/m) High Definition Kits, so we could release Ultra High Definition repaints (UHDT), PMDG's 37 px/m stock mapping, let us 'only' go as far as 145 px/m on a High Definition level.

As 145 px/m is more than 100 px/m, but less than 199 px/m, we dubbed these textures the High Definition Textures (HDT). Nonetheless, HDT or UHDT, it will do this majestic plane the justice it deserves.
