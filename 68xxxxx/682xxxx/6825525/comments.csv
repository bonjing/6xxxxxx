OK dumbshit, let me break this down so that even you can understand it.

If you download the torent, the name of the torrent, as it appears in the list is:

""[ www.TorrentDay.com ] - NOVA.S39E07.The.Fabric.of.the.Cosmos.Quantum.Leap.HDTV.XviD-FQM""

SO, in the list of names, all I see is the [ www.TorrentDay.com ] .  I could make the name list wider but why does his dumbshit website have to be first in the name.  Probably because he thinks that he is the most important thing here.

Do you get it now or do I have to make it simpler?
FUCKING WOW!

Next I expect you to say somthing stupid (again) like ""don't download it""."
