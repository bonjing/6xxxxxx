
Science turns superhero as it battles to save the planet and preserve the human race.

In California, physicist Jim Al-Khalili sees how the power of the world's largest laser could create a fuel to answer all our needs, while at Longleat Sir David Attenborough helps collect the DNA of an elephant for the Frozen Ark - a project to save all the world's species from extinction.

Mark Evans discovers a scientist in Holland who is growing pork in a petri dish; a way to feed the world and free up land from grazing animals.

Jim Al-Khalili also meets the scientist in Louisiana who thinks he has found a microbe that can help clean up oil spills, and Maggie Aderin Pocock gazes into the face of the sun at NASA's solar laboratory, where they are learning how to predict solar storms.

From the DNA banks at the Natural History Museum to the bayous of Louisiana, the programme celebrates the extraordinary efforts of scientists to preserve our future.
