RELEASE NOTES

 Years after taking Stilwater for their own, the Third Street Saints
 have evolved from street gang to household brand name, with Saints
 sneakers, Saints energy drinks and Johnny Gat bobble head dolls all
 available at a store near you

 The Saints are kings of Stilwater, but their celebrity status has not
 gone unnoticed. The Syndicate, a legendary criminal fraternity with
 pawns in play all over the globe, has turned its eye on the Saints and
 demands tribute. Refusing to kneel to the Syndicate, you take the fight
 to Steelport, a once-proud metropolis reduced to a struggling city of
 sin under Syndicate control
