The Bridge | season 1 | DVDrip

It is the role of the police to protect society - but who is there to protect the police?

Inspired by the experiences of a former police union head, The Bridge presents unique and realistic insight into the inner-workings of the police world. This exciting procedural drama lays bare the struggles of big city police union leader, Frank Leo. The charismatic and dynamic Frank represents an 8,000 strong army of cops, but has to battle criminals on the street while fighting his own bosses and political corruption in the ranks in order to protect his fellow officers and, ultimately, himself.

When broadcast on CTV it was shown out of order. For the DVD release the production company/distribution company released the show in the proper sequence, so now it makes sense. 

If you are more familiar with American tv than Canadian then yes, this is that show that was on CBS for 2 weeks (3 episodes) in the summer of 2010. CBS didn't show 10 of the 13 episodes.
