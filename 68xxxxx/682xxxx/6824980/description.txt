Plot: Failed filmmaker Zachary Wells is convinced by his best friend and hotshot director Topher into replacing him as a judge in their film schoolâ€™s annual festival. Zachâ€™s one-night stand with a student backfires when that student walks into an interview the next morning calling himself Danny Reyes, the name Zach went by when he attended the school. And Dannyâ€™s film, â€œJudas Kiss,â€ is a finalist in the competition Zach is judging. Zachâ€™s film, also â€œJudas Kiss,â€ won the festival years before. As Zach scrambles for answers, a mysterious, chain-smoking campus tour guide, counsels him: â€œChange the kidâ€™s past, change your future.â€ But how? Zach comes to believe he can mend his life by disqualifying Danny from competition, putting him on a different path than Zach followed. But will Zachâ€™s plan work?
