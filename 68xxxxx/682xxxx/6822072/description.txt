Book Description
The practical guide to deploying IPv6 in campus, WAN/branch, data center, and virtualized environments

IPv6 for Enterprise Networks brings together all the information you need to successfully deploy IPv6 in any campus, WAN/branch, data center, or virtualized environment. Four leading Cisco IPv6 experts present a practical approach to organizing and executing your large-scale IPv6 implementation. They show how IPv6 affects existing network designs, describe common IPv4/IPv6 coexistence mechanisms, guide you in planning, and present validated configuration examples for building labs, pilots, and production networks.

The authors first review some of the drivers behind the acceleration of IPv6 deployment in the enterprise. Next, they introduce powerful new IPv6 services for routing, QoS, multicast, and management, comparing them with familiar IPv4 features and behavior. Finally, they translate IPv6 concepts into usable configurations. Up-to-date and practical, IPv6 for Enterprise Networks is an indispensable resource for every network engineer, architect, manager, and consultant who must evaluate, plan, migrate to, or manage IPv6 networks.
