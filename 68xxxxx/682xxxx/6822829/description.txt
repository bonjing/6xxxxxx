Anticipate WordPress Plugin


Anticipate is a maintenance mode plugin that allows you to serve your visitors an alternate "coming soon" page while you work on building your website in the background. Once activated, all of your visitors will be sent to the Anticipate landing page. When logged in as a WordPress Admin, however, your normal theme appears, allowing you to build your website seamlessly in the background.
