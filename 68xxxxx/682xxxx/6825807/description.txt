Pilot :
What this documentary attempts to do is decipher the fact from the fiction and present the information in the novel the Lost Symbol in a realistic context. It spends a lot of time covering the real rituals of the Freemasons, the beliefs of Americaâ€™s founding fathers, and the true nature of noetic science. All of these ideas helped to move the novelâ€™s story forward, but like many of Dan Brownâ€™s books most of these subjects become obscured, and confusing to those who would like to separate the facts from the fiction.
