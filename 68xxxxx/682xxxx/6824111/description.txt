Frozen Planet: To The Ends Of The Earth

David begind his adventure by traveling to the North Pole one of the few places he has never visited. 
Six months of darkness in the area finishes with the return of the sun and a couple of courting polar 
bears end up revealing a tender side to their nature. At Greenland's ice cap waterfalls plunge into 
the heart of the ice, and a huge iceberg stands out. The largest gathering of seabirds on Earth are 
joined by some humpback whales to feast in rich Alaskan waters. In the Taiga Forest a pack wolves 
take on some bison prey.
