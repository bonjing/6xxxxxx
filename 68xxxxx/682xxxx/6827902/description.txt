Book Description
================
A compelling and contrary account of the Battle of Hastings on October
14, 1066, the most famous day in English history.

Harriet Harvey Woods fascinating and accessible book will change forever
our view of the Norman conquest of England. Although the prevailing
view is that the invaders brought culture and enlightenment to England,
Harvey Wood argues that the Normans aggressive and illegal attack actually
destroyed a highly developed civilization with long-established political
institutions and sophisticated art forms.

The Battle of Hastings explores the background and lead-up to the invasion
as well as the motives of the leading players, the state of warfare
in England and Normandy in 1066, and the battle itself. King Harold
ought to have won the battle of Hastings and enjoyed a peaceful and
enlightened reign; The Battle of Hastings shows that the result could
just as easily have gone the other way. This gripping book reveals how
and why England came to be defeated on October 14, 1066, and what the
country lost as a result.
