All of the OS X versions supplied are NOT bootable.  Meaning you cannot do clean installs on ANY of them.

Mac OS 9 (classic) is the only OS that works.  The other versions will install provided you already have an installed version of X on a compatible machine.

If you are trying to use these with XPostFacto they WILL NOT WORK."
