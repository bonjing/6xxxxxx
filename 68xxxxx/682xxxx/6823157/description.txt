    Billy Connolly's most requested comedy clips - in addition to 
    his first live TV performance.

    Billy is universally recognised as the master of observational 
    humour, and here we see the comic genius at his hilarious best.

    'You Asked For It' features extracts from Billy's most popular TV 
    and theatrical stand-up performances, as well as his first 
    ever TV special, broadcast in 1976.

    Notes

    As this has many different clips I've chosen to use an AR and crop
    that matches the widest clip in the set.

    Enjoy!
