Following three sell-out UK tours, 
multi award-winning comedian Sarah Millican 
presents her eagerly awaited debut live DVD.

The UK's hottest female comedian, star of Live at 
the Apollo, Mock The Week, Michael Mcintyre's Comedy 
Roadshow and if.comedy Best Newcomer, offers advice for 
life including non-fattening stress relief, the alternative 
to marriage and the acceptable face of adultery.

The sweet and filthy Geordie's stand-up was nominated for 
the prestigious Fosters Comedy Award at the Edinburgh Comedy 
Festival and was the first woman ever to win Chortle's Best 
Headliner Award.
