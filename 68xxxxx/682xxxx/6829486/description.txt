         Adrian "The Hunter" Pang steps back into the Legend Ring for      
         his first defense of the Legend Lightweight Title. Undefeated     
         at Legend, Pang intends to keep the Legend belt firmly around     
         his waist. Facing off against him will be enigmatic Mongolian     
         fighter Jadamba Narantungalag. Jadamba grabbed the MMA world's    
         attention after a three-round demolition of Japanese superstar    
         Akihiro Gono last year & a victory which put him in line for      
         the Sengoku Lightweight Championship. This match-up will be       
         one of the year's most highly anticipated contests in Asia-       
         Pacific MMA.                                                      
                                                                           
         In the co-main event of the evening, heavy-handed Chinese         
         Boxing specialist Liu Wenbo makes his Legend debut against New    
         Zealand Light Heavyweight Champion Sam Brown. Liu returns to      
         the ring following the birth of his son, and will be looking      
         to make a statement with a victory over the highly regarded       
         and always dangerous Brown.                                       
                                                                           
         Also on the Legend 6 fight card, always exciting Australian       
         brawler Rob Hill provides Korean standout Song Un Sik with a      
         trial-by-fire introduction to the Legend Ring. And former         
         Featherweight Tournament semi-finalists Yusuke Kawanago of        
         Japan and Wu Chengjie of China square off for top contender       
         status.
