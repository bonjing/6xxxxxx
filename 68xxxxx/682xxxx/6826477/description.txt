"Documentary Filmmaking : Redux"

When the school board asks Dean Pelton 
(Jim Rash) to make a new commercial for 
the school, he enlists the study group to 
star in his production. As he gets swept 
away with the project, more of the 
student body is pulled into the fray, 
including Magnitude (Luke Youngblood), 
Fat Neil (Charley Koontz), Garrett (Erik 
Charles Nielsen), Leonard (Richard 
Erdman), Star-Burns (Dino Stamatopoulos) 
and even Greendale alum and genuine 
celebrity, Luis Guzman ("How to Make it 
in America"). Meanwhile, Abed (Danny 
Pudi) films all the activities for a 
documentary.
