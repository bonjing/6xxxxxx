Seasick Steve Write Me A Few Lines/Levee Camp Blues
Limited Edition on 7 Vinyl.
Released: 2011
Label: Third Man Records
Format: Mp3@320


Train-hopping hobo blues sensation Seasick Steve teams up with Jack White and covers two classics by the legendary Mississippi Fred McDowell. 
The male/female vocals on â€œLinesâ€ captivate over a Zep-worthy rhythm section while the slow-burn slide of â€œLeveeâ€ is deep, down and dirge like the best of Delta blues.
