An inside look at one of the most grueling professional race series in the world; the AMA Pro Motocross Series. The AMA Pro Motocross Series is a melting pot of the best riders not only from around the US, but the world. With no judges, no time outs and no second chances every event is raced like itâ€™s the last.  At each drop of the gate every rider, whether seasoned veteran or eager rookie, has an equal chance at glory but also risks making that one mistake that could not only end their season, but also their career.  Finding success here requires a dedication like few sports have ever seen.  Itâ€™s more than just a game and it can all come to a thunderous end in the blink of an eye.
