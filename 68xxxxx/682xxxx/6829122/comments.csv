V: 10
A: 7 (low)
Audio fix:
use VLC media player, while playing the video, click on Effects and Filters from Tools, Enable the Graphic Equalizer in Audio Effects tab, set the Preset to Full Bass and Treble, use the main indicator on the same page to increase the audio level as much as you want, enjoy a fine film!"
 for the file size, specifically for this file size I'd rate it a 10.

Audio while very clear is VERY low and you really have to crank up your speakers to hear it so unfortunately I'd rate that a 5.5 (clear when you crank it up but you really got to boost it a lot to hear it)."
