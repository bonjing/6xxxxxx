I have an old pc and it still runs smooth

Windows xp sp3, E8500 with GeFroce 9500 GT"
game where I get ""video mode not supported"" 

The game is running in the background I can hear it, so my question is can I change the default resolution  via an INI file or something, I tried changing the Icon compatibility to run in 640x 400 without any luck. 

Or if any fellow gamers out there could fly me in blind as to how to change the res by means of, down, down, down, down, enter, down, enter, arrow left or something like that, any help would be very appreciated, :)
