The film starts in the 1980s. A young Shiva (Jeeva) is taught by his grandfather (Prakash Raj) to be bold and brave and fight against all odds, especially all that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s evil. Shiva grows up with his grandfather\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s words as the Bible. However, Shiva\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s parents (Jayaprakash and Lakshmi) want him to lead a peaceful life. Enters Priya (Shriya), a law college student. She is the daughter of a police official (Babu Antony). Obviously it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s romance between the young man and the woman. Meanwhile, Shiva is forced to earn the wrath of a goon (Ganesh Acharya) and also he crosses swords with another baddie called Gowri. The rest, which is supplemented by electrifying stunt sequences, is about how Shiva emerges victor against all odds.
