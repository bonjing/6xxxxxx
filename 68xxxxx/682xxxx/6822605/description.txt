Excerpted from the Daily Mail (UK) Newspaper website:

Starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer, directed by Robert Wise
and filmed partly on location in Salzburg, Austria, The Sound of Music was
the top-grossing film of its era, and remains the most successful movie
musical of all time.

Nominated for ten Academy Awards, it won five, including Best Picture, 
Best Sound Recording, and Best Scoring of Music (adaptation) by the legendary
Irwin Kostal.

From its first, record-breaking run on stage at Londonâ€™s Palace Theatre in the
early 1960s, through the zaniness of the sing-a-long A Sound of Music craze,
and the huge success of the West Endâ€™s current smash hit revival presented by
Andrew Lloyd Webber, The Sound of Music has always been one of Great Britainâ€™s
â€œfavourite things."

This is undoubtedly the greatest movie ever made - to show the supreme
spirit of Ms. Julie Andrews and its rightful place upon the throne as 
a far better alternative over the wisdom that otherwise seems to pervade
the planet even on the part of such misguided authoritarian characters as
that which is played by the talented Christopher Plummer (who really should
know better!).

This movie has made more than enough money that a sensible, Christianly 
spirited studio could long ago have afforded to make available on a cheap
five dollar HD disc - or else more rightly I think, settle for those that
make do with the versions we give away here instead - awaiting the prevailing
of better minds in the running of things in this industry generally speaking.

A 1965 movie is in any event a great candidate for the end of copyright
protection and the grace of public domain ownership - the cost of abuses by
this industry as I say once again.
