Before money and fame took over the game

It was self expression verbally venting agression

Every verse an unrehursed personal history lesson

To stop you from stressing now its all about petty possesions

Cars money and hoes getting your own brand of clothes

Spitting out club tracks with more hook than flows

Everybody knows its all about the music case closed

Two great tastes that taste great together.  Scatching and Freestyling the

culture, the artists, and the music all in one place.  I can\\\\\\\'t say enough good

things about this Dynamic Duo of Dope Documentarys.  Lodged in the core of this

torrent are some of the most captivating djs as well as some of the best 

freestyle artists you\\\\\\\'ll possibly ever hear.  I\\\\\\\'ve been searching years on

hundreds of dissapointing forum sites for just half of this collection. So enjoy

and I dare you not to get hyped up watching these Outstanding Documentarys of

TRUE hip hop culture from the mouths of the people who lived it and loved it.
