The IACP thought they could hold their 2011 annual conference in Chicago
unfettered by the clutches of insurrection. They must not have known their
conference starts on the Day of Action Against Police Brutality. They must not
have known that all over the world people are in the streets demonstrating
discontent with capitalism and the state. They also had no idea that for the
past few months black hat hackers have been owning their websites and databases.
They should have expected us.

In solidarity with the Occupation Movement and the International Day of Action
Against Police Brutality, allied #anonymous and #antisec vessels took aim at the
corrupt bootboys of the 1%: the police. We hacked, defaced, and destroyed
several law enforcement targets, leaking over 600MB of private information
including internal documents, membership rosters, addresses, passwords, social
security numbers, and other confidential data. According to the IACP\\\'s
development documents, their systems cost several hundred thousand dollars. We
are pleased to destroy it all for free, leaking their private info and defacing
their websites in one swift blow.

We attacked MatrixGroup.net, a multi-million dollar Washington DC based web
development firm, which serves over a hundred government, corporate and
association websites. Many lulz have been had as we owned their white hat
\\\"professional\\\" intranet, clients and employee wiki portals-- accessing records
and passwords, internal communications, company schedules, and development notes
for over a hundred clients. We intentionally excluded the unions and other
unrelated sites on their servers because, unlike the police and those who
support them, we will never betray our working class comrades. We realize our
role in the social struggle against capital and against the state, deciding
instead to set our sights on the police, military and other government websites
hosted by Matrix.
 
Our lulzboats also took aim at Boston Police in retaliation for the unprovoked
mass arrests and brutality experienced by those at Occupy Boston. We hacked the
Boston Police Patrolmens\\\' Association (www.bppa.org), releasing full names and
the cleartext, user-supplied passwords for a thousand members. Many lulz have
been had while perusing their emails and facebook accounts, and we are now
sharing their passwords for others so they can join in on the mayhem as well.
Let this be a warning to BPD and police everywhere: future acts of aggression
against our movements will be met with a vengeance so epic and relentless that
your children\\\'s children will puke at the sight of swine.

After exhausting both sides of Milli Vanillis\\\' \\\"Girl You Know It\\\'s True\\\" tape,
we also decided to attack Alabama law enforcement systems, releasing the names,
addresses, and social security numbers for 1000 Birmingham / Jefferson County
police officers as well as defacing and destroying the website
SherrifOfBaldwin.com. We are attacking Birmingham specifically because of their
notorious racial discriminatory practices including the savage beatings and mass
arrests endured by civil rights protesters during the 60s. Although we had
records of inmates, active warrant names, addresses, charges and social security
numbers the thought of releasing them never crossed our mind because we would
never betray our brothers and sisters shackled and chained behind prison walls--
our targets are the ones who beat and murder with immunity, the cowardly
carcases and lifeless hosts of power who hide behind a badge. 

We are also acting in solidarity with the dozens of alleged \\\"Anonymous\\\" members
around the world facing charges for \\\"hacking,\\\" including the Paypal LOIC
defendants in San Jose, Commander X, Recursion, Topiary, Stephen Watt, and more.
We are acting in solidarity with the thousands of prisoners in California on
Hunger Strike fighting for better living conditions and an end to prolonged
solitary confinement. We also call for the IMMEDIATE RELEASE of not only
political prisoners(Leonard Peltier, Mumia Abu Jamal, the MOVE 9, the Angola 3,
and more) but all prisoners everywhere including all Jon Burge torture survivors
still behind bars.

We are attacking the police because they are the vicious boot boys of the 1%
whose role in society is to protect the interests and assets of the rich ruling
class. They are not part of the 99%-- they are working class traitors who are
paid to intimidate, harass, and repress political movements that would possibly
stand a threat to the power structure of the 1%. We have no problem targeting
police and releasing their information even if it puts them at risk because we
want them to experience just a taste of the brutality and misery they serve us
on an everyday basis. We hope those working for the police who have any humanity
left refuse their orders and leak the police and their commanding officer\\\'s
vital secrets and dirt. We must realize that police are no allies of ours and
have violently attacked our movements all across the world throughout history.

In Chicago, where the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference
is taking place, the CPD has a particularly bloody and ruthless history of
brutality and repression of political movements. Throughout the 70s and 80s
under Jon Burge (chief detective) and former Mayor Richard M. Daley (prosecuter
at the time), dozens of CPD detectives many whom are still on the force tortured
hundreds of innocent black men, forcing confessions and giving out decades-long
prison sentences for crimes never committed. The CPD also operates notorious
\\\"red squad\\\" COINTELPRO operations that attempts to discredit and disrupt
revolutionary groups-- including the assassination of Black Panther Party
leaders Fred Hampton and Mark Clark. This repression continues today as they
beat and arrested over 900 protesters when the second War in Iraq broke out, and
just over a year ago dozens of protest organizers were raided by the FBI for
alleged affiliation with resistance movements. The CPD just announced a new
\\\'counter-terrorism\\\' operation (taking tips from the NYPD playbook) likely to
target protest organizers for the upcoming G8 and NATO conferences in May.
Although they try to intimidate us by training over 13,000 riot police for these
protests, we believe that they are the truly the frightened ones, and perhaps
for good reason: the high profile hacks will continue, and the protests against
the 1% are growing every day.

We are 99%. We are the working class that makes society function. We are not
intimidated by the States attempts to disrupt our resistance through unprovoked
arrests and harassments. As the violence of the cops, the courts, the FBI, La
Migra, and Homeland Security intensifies, so must our resistance: we will
continue to bring the ruckus on the streets and on the internet. We are
believers and practitioners of direct action against all governments,
militaries, banks, corporations, and police working towards our revolutionary
goal: the immediate dissolution of capitalism and the state.

Hackers, join us to make 2011 the year of leaks and revolutions!
