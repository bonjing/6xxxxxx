In this part of the world I sometimes get my hands on stuff way ahead of everyone else...like the movie ""The Kings Speach"". I got is several weeks before I finally saw it on torrents (DVD-rip, great quality) but I didn't know how to create and upload the torrent for it.

The porn shit was just a test...knowing that ""porn"" is a magic word making a lot of people take interest in the torrent I upload. In a matter of minutes I then  knew this will work whenever I decide to share something of true value.

Cheers, m8!"
