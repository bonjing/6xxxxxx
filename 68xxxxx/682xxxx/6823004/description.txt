It\'s called The Run. An illicit, high-stakes race across the country. The
  only way to get your life back is to be the first from San Francisco to New
  York. No speed limits. No rules. No allies. All you have are your driving
  skills and sheer determination as you battle hundreds of the world\'s most
  notorious drivers on the country\'s most dangerous roads. In Need for Speed
  The Run, you\'ll weave through dense urban centers, rocket down icy mountain
  passes and navigate narrow canyons at breakneck speeds, all the while
  evading a relentless police force prepared - and willing - to use lethal
  force to take you down.
 
  * From the Golden Gate to the Empire State - Compete in The Run, an illicit
    race across the most iconic and treacherous roads from San Francisco to
    New York. There are no rules and no allies in the cities, deserts,
    mountains and canyons than stand between you and the finish line.
  * You are Jack\'s Competitive Edge - Jack is in a race for his life, but he\'s
    got something the competition doesn\'t: You. Keep Jack one step ahead of
    the dangers from his dark past, both inside and outside the car. It\'s up
    to you to get Jack to New York in one piece and ahead of the competition.
