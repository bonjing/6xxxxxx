Easy Ways To Personalize:
- Add Style: Personas. Make Firefox match your style! Choose from thousands of Personas designed by users around the world, or create one yourself. With a single click you can dress up your browser however you want.
- Customize: Add-ons. Many of the most popular add-ons are extensions, little extras you download to add more bells & whistles to Firefox. Compare prices, check the weather, listen to music, update your Facebook profile â€“ all built right into the browser!
- Make It Work: Plugins. Plugins are small bits of third-party software built by companies like Adobe Systems or Apple to power videos, animation and games (examples include Flash Player or Quicktime). They can cause browser crashes or pose security risks when they get out of date, so weâ€™ve built an easy tool to help you stay current.
- Adapt Your Interface. The Firefox interface has been designed by a team of experts and tested by a community of millions of users around the world to make sure your browsing is as easy and intuitive as possible. But, everyone has their own specific needs, and you can always adjust the interface to be exactly the way you like it: re-arrange, organize, add or remove buttons or fields to change your browsing experience however you want.
- Stay In Sync. Sync seamlessly connects your desktop and mobile Firefoxes, so you can access your browsing history, passwords, bookmarks and even open tabs no matter which device you use. Now you can surf the Web on your desktop, get up in the middle of browsing and have your open tabs ready and waiting on your mobile, just as you left them. Your browsing will never be the same!



Blazing Performance:
- Making the Web Faster. Fasten your seat belts! With faster start-up times, rapid graphics rendering and improved page load speed, Firefox 4 is full of major performance enhancements youâ€™ll notice instantly. Upgrades to DOM and Style Resolution performance mean pages load faster, scrolling up and down is smoother, and web applications can run at breakneck speed. Itâ€™s an entirely new â€“ and fast â€“ browsing experience.
- Web Application Speed. Web applications like mail, video or games keep getting more awesome, but they also require additional processing power to run smoothly. To meet these increasingly sophisticated demands, Firefox 4 features a massively improved javascript engine called JÃ¤gerMonkey. As a result, Firefox 4 handles even the most dynamic applications smoothly and easily, allowing you to enjoy the very best the modern Web has to offer.
- Hardware Acceleration. Whether youâ€™re using Windows 7, Vista, XP or Mac OS X with Firefox 4, youâ€™ll also enjoy hardware acceleration for many common operations, such as watching videos or playing games. Firefox 4 uses a new layers-based graphics system that takes advantage of Direct2D and Direct3D on Windows and OpenGL on Mac to deliver amazing performance even on graphics-heavy sites.

Firefox Helps You Stay Safe:
- Protect YourPrivacy. When you browse, you leave a trail of data that potentially contains all sorts of personal information. We believe this info belongs to you and you alone (and least of all to overzealous advertisers), and have built in features to ensure thatâ€™s the case.
- Browse With Security. Whether itâ€™s buying a gift, paying your bills or simply signing in to Facebook, itâ€™s important keep your personal info out of the hands of any online bad guys who might be snooping around. Fortunately, Firefox is packed with advanced security features to help you stay safe.
- Stay In Control. The online world is always changing, which is why we give you easy-to-use tools to let you adapt and make smart choices as you go.
- Itâ€™s Part of Our Mission. Mozilla is a non-profit organization with the goal of making the Web better for everyone. Weâ€™re not trying to make money off our users â€“ we just want you to have the best possible experience online, and that includes keeping you and your personal information safe and private.
