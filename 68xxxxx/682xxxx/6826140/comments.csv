Can't generalize, but here's my situation and what I did to get it to work:

-I have the LT 2.0.
-By only burning the iso, it would get me the message ""Unreadable disk"". After burining twice, with brand new dvd's I knew dirt wasn't really the issue.

-The solution is patching this game with the LT 2.0 Topology, google ""Xbox Back up Creator"" and ""topology for LT 2.0""
-It is a VERY SIMPLE process that doesn't take more than 1 minute to be done.
-If I had a link to an english tutorial it would be here already.

SUMMIN UP: great torrent, 100% functional, great game, absolutely worth the download."
