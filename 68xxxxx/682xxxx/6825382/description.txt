     Twenty-something Michael Pinto has       
     grown up in a small Goan village,        
     believing everyone in the world to       
     be simple, kind and honest, just         
     like him. His world revolves around      
     a doting mother, a passion for music     
     and the memories of a childhood friend,  
     Sameer, who left Goa for Mumbai many     
     years ago and hasn't replied to his      
     frequent letters ever since. Pinto's     
     talent for music is only matched by his  
     knack for finding trouble in the unlike  
     liest of places often resulting in the   
     most outlandish and hilarious situations.
     When Pinto's idyllic world is shattered  
     by the sudden demise of his mother he    
     decides to head to Mumbai in search of   
     the only friend he knows. Will Pinto     
     find Sameer or will trouble find him
