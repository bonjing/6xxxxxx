A brilliant comedy from Roberto Benigni with some truly sad moments
of coming to terms with inane cruelty to the human spirit generally

This movie does show the greatest spirit of the kind peoples of Italy and asks
why anyone would want to call the nicest kid on the block "inferior" simply
for lack of want to be brutally inane - as were those set upon him at the
camp he was sent to - by his own family in true fact - none that sent him there
could deny him anyway - how terribly tragic for all mankind - never again indeed!
