The evolution of the volume and its chapters on global governance reform require some elaboration. Assembling the authors and their various perspectives on global governance reform took considerable effort, as I describe more fully at the end of this Introduction. One task, however, engendered some notable discussion among the authors and CIGI officials: identifying an appropriate title for this collection of global governance issues. At CIGIâ€™s 2006 annual meeting, at which a number of the authors presented their papers, several had time between panels to ponder an appropriate â€œcapâ€ or â€œumbrellaâ€ for the volume. Out of those discussions and several subsequent editorial ones, and not without some controversy, the volume carries the main title, Can the World Be Governed ?
