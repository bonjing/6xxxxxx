When she is nervous, her small town dialect comes out & she starts to shake.On her first day at her new school she is bullied by others. Coming to her help is a group of girls. The girls are Choon-Hwa (Kang So-Ra) - known for her strong sense of loyalty & excellant fighting skills, heavyset Jang-Mi (Kim Min-Young) - who badly wishes to have plastic surgery to get double eye-lids, Jin-Hee (Park Jin-Joo) - excellent when it comes to spewing profanity, Geum-Ok (Lee Yeon-Kyung) - interested in literature, Bok-Hee (Kim Seon-Kyeong) - dreams of one day becoming Ms. Korea and Su-Ji (Min Hyo-Rin) - always arrogant. Na-Mi quickly becomes part of their group. When the group confronts rival girls known as Sonyeo Sidae ("Girls Generation"), Na-Mi spews curse words she picked up from her grandmother. Because of Na-Mi the girls are able to avoid a crisis. These seven girls then form their own group named "Sunny". They also vow to stay together forever. The girls then prepare for a performance at an upcoming school festival, but on the day of their performance a terrible event occurs leading the girls to eventually going their own separate ways.
