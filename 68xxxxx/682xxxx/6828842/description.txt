Quest, featuring soprano saxophonist David Liebman and pianist Richie Beirach
plus a rhythm section, was active as a group between 1981 and 1991, though the
bulk of their recording activity took place during the last five years of the
band's existence. This two-CD set compiles all of three separate albums,
including Quest II, Quest III: Midpoint/Double Edge (a duo CD by Liebman and
Beirach), with bassist Ron McClure and drummer Billy Hart ably assisting on the
first two sessions. The six tracks from Quest II, recorded in the studio, open
the first disc. Beirach's "Gargoyles" is pensive with an unpredictable path,
never relenting from its brooding, mysterious setting. His "Pendulum" is a
daunting modal work fired by Hart's explosive drumming and Liebman's searing
soprano. Liebman's eerie ballad "Carrisma" and intense "Third Visit" provoke
some of the quartet's best performances. Midpoint was recorded in concert over
two nights in 1987 at the Montmartre in Copenhagen. The music encompasses
compositions by each member of the quartet. Liebman's "The Code's Secretcode" is
an extended work with progressively different sections, taking the listener on a
delightful journey. Beirach's "The Snow Leopard" begins with a rapidly darting
post-bop theme, and segues into avant-garde which leads into a dramatic feature
for Hart. plus a recap of the theme. McClure's "Midpoint" is a showcase for the
bassist, playing its moody theme with soft backing from Beirach, with Hart's
later brushwork and Liebman's haunting soprano rounding it out. Hart's turbulent
"Redemption" proves to be a very satisfying finale.

The duo selections are all familiar songs, though Liebman and Beirach present
them with novel interpretations. Choosing two John Coltrane works, they detour
quickly from the familiar theme of "Naima," giving it a more plaintive air,
while Beirach's strumming and picking of the piano strings adds a surprising
introduction to their driving, dramatic rendition of "India." Sandwiched between
them is a searing performance of "'Round Midnight" that is far from the usual
deliberate, spacious arrangement of this frequently recorded jazz
standard. Their setting of "On Green Dolphin Street" sticks to a straight-ahead
path instead of the familiar changes throughout each chorus. Beirach's
interpretation of Leonard Bernstein's "Some Other Time" can't help but be
influenced by Bill Evans' famous recording, with Liebman making a delayed
entrance, adding a bit of mystery with his offbeat flute. There are plenty of
fireworks and a darting run through Sonny Rollins' "Oleo," where the musicians
never get around to its theme until the conclusion.
