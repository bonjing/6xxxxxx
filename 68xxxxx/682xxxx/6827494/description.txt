* What is DXVA?
DXVA, or DirectX Video Accelleration, is a system built into Windows operating systems
since Windows XP that allows programs, if they support it, to offload the decoding of
certain media codecs to the GPU. Doing so reduces the strain on the CPU and allows for
even High Definition content to be played on a relatively weak system.
