Some of your new .MKV files are not playable with some Multimedia player (Briteview, LG TV etc.)
ex.  The Help,  One Day, Melancholia,
        The Man in the Iron Mask, Chalet Girl.

Played perfectly well on PC using VLC Player but the folder is in conflict with Divx Player DivXMFSource.dll (APPCRASH)

Your previous MP4 files are perfectly playable on PC and Mulitmedia Player as well"
