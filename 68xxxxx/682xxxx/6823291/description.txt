*** Paul McCartney ***

The Beatle who wrote â€˜When Im Sixty-Fourâ€™, now has been there done that. 
Such is the longevity of Sir Paul McCartneyâ€™s music career. McCartney released 
â€˜Memory Almost Fullâ€™ his 21st solo album earlier this year to a resounding 
response, having sold over a million copies worldwide.

His new material embraces his past, present and has him exploring how he would 
like to be remembered. Still a master at simple melodies, McCartney learnt to 
play the mandolin for this project, the result being the infectious â€˜Dance Tonightâ€™ 
which featured in a high profile iTunes campaign.

40 years after Sgt Pepperâ€™s and keen to explore new directions with his music, 
McCartneyâ€™s appearance at this yearâ€™s BBC Electric Proms, promises to be a truly 
memorable event.

*** BBC Electric Proms ***

This gig is part of the BBCs Electric Proms festival which takes place across 
Camden on 24-28 October. Over 80 artists are performing and they've all been 
encouraged to create something unique for their shows.
