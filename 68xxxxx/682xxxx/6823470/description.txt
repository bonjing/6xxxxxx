Quote:
â€œThe pairing of the cool Boulez with the more expressive Barenboim might seem a mismatch of styles; but with Boulez wielding the baton over Barenboim's Staatskapelle Berlin as the pianist tackles these two pillars of Liszt's musical temple, a magical balance is achieved that allows the music's character to surge forth with no recourse to the easy victories of clichÃ©.â€ The Independent, 7th October 2011 ***

â€œItâ€™s easy to garland these virtuoso concertos with tinsel and vulgarise the emotions. Barenboim, with Boulezâ€™s assistance, will have none of it. He phrases his fingerings with lyrical finesse, while Boulezâ€™s passion for clarity reaps large rewards in the play of colours and instrumental balance. Like restored paintings with the nasty varnish removed, the concertos emerge reborn, and newly powerful.â€ The Times, 21st October 2011
