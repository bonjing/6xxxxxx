In Clash of Warriors, we examine the backgrounds and personalities of the finest commanders of that century. Each episode takes two of the world's greatest combatants as they face their ultimate tests against each other.

Episode 11 : Buckner vs Ushijima - Okinawa 
With the war in Europe in its final throes and Japanese resistance crumbling, it was hoped that an American assault on the home island of Okinawa would be relatively straightforward. When the first waves of troops and Marines under Simon Bolivar Buckner went ashore against only token resistance, this hope seemed justified. But the Japanese commander, Mitsuru Ushijima, had other ideas, and soon the Americans were coming up against formidable defence lines manned by fanatical defenders. The battle became one of the bloodiest of the Pacific War, and before it ended, both commanders were dead.
