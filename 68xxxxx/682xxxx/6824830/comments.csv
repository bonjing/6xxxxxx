 huge files without installs) i have found it very simple to use the kaos installers not to mention the music is pretty cool as well im glad that i dont have to waist a ton of bandwith on huge files when i can get a smaller sized file that works perfectly the same as the big files that have to be mounted burned etc thanks man we need more people who can provide excelent quility downloads like yourself.. n to everyone who just keeps on begging for various games of there choice they really should just F-off because its not there choice on what gets uploaded on a torrent site nor do they have to take the time do the programing or what ever thats required they should be thankful for what they get or else go download something else
