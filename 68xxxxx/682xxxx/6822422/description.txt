
Seasick Steve - Write Me A Few Lines - 2011 (Single)MP3 @320Kbps

Train-hopping hobo blues sensation Seasick Steve teams up with Jack White and
Alison Mosshart and covers two classics by the legendary Mississippi Fred McDowell.
The male/female vox on â€œLinesâ€ captivate over a Zep-worthy rhythm section while
the slow-burn slide of â€œLeveeâ€ is deep, down and dirgey like the best of Delta blues.
