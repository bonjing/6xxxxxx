This book unravels the process of writing academic papers. It tells readers what good papers look like and how they can be written.
Busy academics must develop productive writing practices quickly. No one has time for trial and error. To pass external tests of research output we must write to a high standard while juggling other professional tasks. This may mean changing our writing behaviours.

Writing for Academic Journals, Second Edition, has been comprehensively updated to include the most recent research and theory in order to provide new knowledge on writing across the disciplines. Drawing on her extensive experience of running writing workshops and working closely with academics on developing writing, Rowena Murray offers practical and tested strategies for good academic writing.
