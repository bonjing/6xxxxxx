Pilot :
While Jeremy shook his film "Powered Up" about what is most important to him - a power, the other Top Gear presenters shook their own film called "Top Gear at the Movies". Hammond and May have focused the most important moments in movie history associated with cars.
The new thematic film series Top Gear will be able to see the reconstruction of the most interesting moments in the history of cinema, all performed by two presenters TG. Already on November 14 we will watch racing, tricks, stunts and amazing feats of great cars.
