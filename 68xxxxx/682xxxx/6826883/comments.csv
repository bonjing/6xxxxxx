And that gormless piece of baseless paranoia was not even part of the $100 million dollar investigation* that plagued the Clinton administration and just may well have distracted them for a moment when they should have been paying attention to Bin Laden - when they weren't balancing the budget for the first time in decades and actually producing a surplus. (*Starr's investigation eventually ended up costing ĂŻÂźâ20 million per blow-job, perhaps the most expensive non-penetration sex ever!)

I'd much prefer to see a companion piece on the very real crimes of the Bush administration.
Remember them? They're the guys who spent all of $9 million investigating 9/11, when they weren't flying Bin Laden's family out of the USA, days later - or strutting in flight suits before banners proclaiming ""mission accomplished"" and taunting Iraqi insurgents by sneering ""bring 'em on.""

What really happened indeed!"
