Intro to Unix and Linux

Boot from disk 1

============================================================================
DIRECTORY ORGANIZATION

Red Hat Linux (Evaluation) is delivered on two CDROMs. Disc 1
can be directly booted into the installation on most modern systems, and
contains the following directory structure:

/mnt/redhat
  |----&gt; RedHat
  |        |----&gt; RPMS         -- binary packages
  |        `----&gt; base         -- information on this release of Red Hat
  |                               Linux used by the installation process
  |----&gt; images                -- boot and ramdisk images
  |----&gt; dosutils              -- installation utilities for DOS
  |----&gt; README                -- this file
  |----&gt; RELEASE-NOTES         -- the latest information about this release
  |                               of Red Hat Linux
  `----&gt; RPM-GPG-KEY           -- GPG signature for packages from Red Hat

Disc 2 is similar to disc 1, except that only the RedHat subdirectory is 
present.

If you are setting up an image for NFS, FTP, or HTTP installations, you
need to get everything from the RedHat directory from both disc 1 and 2. On 
Linux and Unix systems, the following process will properly configure 
the /target/directory on your server.

    1) Insert disc 1
    2) mount /mnt/cdrom
    3) cp -a /mnt/cdrom/RedHat /target/directory
    4) umount /mnt/cdrom
    5) Replace disc 1 with disc 2
    6) mount /mnt/cdrom
    7) cp -a /mnt/cdrom/RedHat /target/directory
    8) umount /mnt/cdrom

============================================================================
INSTALLING

There are different boot images for booting your system; you will need one
of them to boot your system into the Red Hat installation and upgrade
program.  For CDROM and hard drive installs, use the boot.img file.  NFS,
FTP, and HTTP installations requires the bootnet.img image.  Installs
through PCMCIA adapters (such as for PCMCIA-based CDROMs or network
cards) need the pcmcia.img file.  These image files may be found in
the images directory on disc1.

Many systems will require additional device drivers that are not available
on the boot floppy. The images directory contains a drivers.img file which
contains many extra drivers. Put its contents onto a floppy before
beginning the installation process, and follow the on-screen instructions.

To make a floppy disk from any of these images, use either the rawrite
program in the dosutils directory or 'dd' under any Linux-like system.
These programs will transfer the image to physical floppies. Once the
floppy has been created, insert the boot floppy and boot your machine.

Many computers can now automatically boot from CDROMs. If you have such a
machine (and it is properly configured) you can boot the Red Hat Linux
CDROM directly without using any boot disks. After booting, you'll be able
to install your system from the CDROM. Note that booting from a CDROM is
equivalent to booting from the boot.img file; additional drivers may still be
required.
