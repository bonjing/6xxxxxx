Plot:
When Jack crosses paths with a woman from his past (Penelope Cruz), he's not sure
if it's love, or if she's a ruthless con artist using him to find the fabled 
Fountain of Youth. Forced aboard the ship of the most feared pirate ever, Jack 
doesn't know whom to fear more -- Blackbeard (Ian McShane) or the woman from his 
past.

Encoders note: 
FASM 1080p releases  have display resolution 1920x1080 and have 5.1 AAC sound.
Their size may vary but they are always smaller than 4GiB. The idea behind this 
is to be able to store them on FAT32 formatted pendrives, hard disk, because some
devices like PS3 dont recognise other file formats.
Wanna know how good the video commpression can be, check this out :)

Check out the new instruction for fixing your player problems.
Regards to all encoders especially Big thanx to Atom, FLAWL3SS and FraMeSToR crew
, Filix, Rok3r, Kempas, Stun, Askeen, Faolanscath and all who likes my work.
_________________________________________________________________________________
REMEMBER!
_________________________________________________________________________________
1. All FASM releases were done by THE PEOPLE for THE PEOPLE, so if you think they
   are worthy share them anywhere you want, but if you like the movie, show your
   gratitude to the creators by going to cinema or buying Bluray/DVD!
_________________________________________________________________________________
2. UNFINISHED/SAMPLE movies HAVE synchro problems, full movies DON`T. This is the
   nature of highly compressed content. The QUALITY of the display depends ALSO
   from the PLAYER you use. There are some buggy players which display those
   movies at the significant worse quality!! If you have any problems with your
   video player check "Instruction for fixing your player problems" folder.
_________________________________________________________________________________
3. Please COMMENT my work ONLY if you have actually seen it. If you LIKED this
   release - tell others about it. If you didnt, leave a comment saying  why, so
   I can learn from your opinions and provide you with something better in the
   future. Everything here has been done with the reason, so if you do not
   understand something dont assume its done bad. Of course we also make mistakes
   so any observation is welcome.
_________________________________________________________________________________
4. I have found that XBox360 can play stereo AAC directly and 5.1 through WINDOWS
   media center extender. For more info read this forum: 
  
_________________________________________________________________________________
5. WDTV devices are causing so much problems with AAC. I am not sure is this
   also the case with this release, so its better for me to give you straight link
   to the discussion regarding this: http://wdtvhd.com/index.php?showtopic=23287
_________________________________________________________________________________
6. Movies can be directly streamed through WWW using Adobe Flash Player 9 or new.
_________________________________________________________________________________
7. FASM Quality Enhancer Bitrate Squeezer is h264 compression method optimized
   directly for lowbitrate HD contents. It is constantly being improved,  each
   revision brings quality to a new level. Its efficiency over standard x264
   encoding is explained by the same reason as XVID encodes are better than DIVX3
_________________________________________________________________________________
8. Any subtitles made for different releases, but taken from the same source
   (Bluray) should also work with this release. If you are looking for them visit
   http://subscene.com/
_________________________________________________________________________________
9. AAC sound must be decompressed and send through HDMI or SPDIF as PCM. Please
   also note that if you do have video card with HDMI that means you do have two
   different sound cards. Please make sure you do send the sound to the correct
   one. Its quite different from AC3/DTS where you send compressed sound directly
   from the source.
