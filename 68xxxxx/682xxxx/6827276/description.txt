The story revolves around a woman named Lee Geum-ja (Lee Young-ae) who has recently been released from prison after 13-years for the abduction and murder of a young boy. Whilst serving time she began her journey of self discovery, invoking within her an angel which earned her the adoration of her fellow inmates. But her other side also began to surface and soon it was apparent that she was quite a cunning figure. Once outside we learn that her 13-years away was merely a prelude to a detailed plan which has her gather old friends with the help of her own intimidating ways in order for her to take revenge on one man â€“ Mr. Baek (Choi Min-shik), the real foe behind that tragic kidnapping. Geum-ja realises that she must atone for her sins and make peace with those around her, including her own daughter who has been out of her life for far too long.
