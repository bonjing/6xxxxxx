Background and themes:
--------------------------

Strangers on a Train is a psychological study of madness,entrapment, guilt, and complicity.

Madness and entrapment: Highsmith explores how both ordered and disordered lives can lead to â€œabnormalâ€ behavior and disturbed minds. The limits of entrapment,

innocence and guilt, and madness and sanity fade as the story develops and the reader is faced with a Guy who isnâ€™t 

completely innocent and a Bruno that can be seen as a victim.

The awakening of Guyâ€™s destructive desires suggests that conflict between conscious behavior and subconscious  desire may trigger the criminal potential in anyone, and

result in immoral action, the doubling of personality and the consequent ethical and psychological degradation.

Guilt and complicity: Patricia Highsmith once commented that she is â€œinterested in the effect of guiltâ€ on her heroes. This novel is a study of guilt, and the kind

of pressures that destroy a manâ€™s soul. The exploration of guilt also provokes a reflection on the definition and limits of complicity.
