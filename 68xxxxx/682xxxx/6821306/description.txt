The xK3y (also known as xKey, x360Key and XKey360) is the first optical disc drive emulator for the Xbox 360. 
The guys behind the Wiikey Team (known for Wiikey (Wii), D2Pro (Wii), D2CKey (Wii), HDMIKey (Wii), XenoGC (Gamecube), Qoob Pro (GameCube), Crystal Chip (PS2)) designed the hardware itself, the software comes from the developer TheArtificer who is responsible for the software aspect of the WODE (Wii Optical Drive Emulator) and many other hacks.
