Lyric of this song : 

Saturday moring 8:45
Light shines of the white walls into your eyes
The kitchensink throws a pittyful smile
You're way out of time
You're way out of time
Sit down coffee bluecheeze and serial
Living today is a god given miracle
Live in the moment is more than a life away
It's more than a life away


Saturday morning 9.21
You read of a war in the east that was won
By humaliation and panic the bombs
Came tumbeling down
Came tumbeling down
One more for the papers
People in offices
Spreading the news unaware of the comequence
Live in the moment is more than a life away
It's more than a life away


Blue skies white lines forests in stereo
Driving for hours with only hysterical
Radio dj's taking another call
About the weather and all
High on life is a beutiful time
Reach out if you can when they trough you the line
Turn down the radio avoiding the 3 o clock news..
I have nothing to choose


Saturday evening two past eleven
Pints down the road, on a fast way to heaven
Friend tells a story noone believes
Some tease, some bleed some attention they need
Looking away seems the only remedy
This is the end of me live in the moment seems
More than a life away
It's more than a life away"
