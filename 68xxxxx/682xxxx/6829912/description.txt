This is a very strange, radically surreal 1972 film directed by Jane Arden, based on her play Vagina Rex and The Gas Oven, and produced by Jack Bond. The cast includes Sheila Allen, Liz Danciger, Elaine Donovan, Ann Lynn, Penny Slinger, Susanka Fraey, Jenny Moss and Jane Arden herself.

Synopsis

Jane Arden's violent and powerful adaptation of her work with the Holocaust women's theatre troupe looks into the mind of a young woman labelled schizophrenic and finds, not madness, but tortured sexual guilt created by the taboos of society.

Juxtaposing visions of personal hell with group psychotherapy sessions presided over by Jane Arden herself, The Other Side of the Underneath is an unsettling experience and provides an illustration of the idea that insanity is a kind of death that must be followed by rebirth. The terrifying fantasy sequences are utterly convincing images of madness from the inside and convey the despair and destitution of a personality that has been fragmented.
