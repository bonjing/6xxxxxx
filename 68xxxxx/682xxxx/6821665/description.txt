Critically acclaimed comedian Micky Flanagan 
presents his highly anticipated debut stand-up 
DVD of his nationwide sell-out 'Out Out' tour.

One of the UKs hottest comedians, star of Live 
at the Apollo, Mock The Week, Michael McIntyre's 
Comedy Roadshow and The Royal Variety Performance, 
ruthlessly deconstructs the East End Myth with razor 
sharp observational wit. He tells a comic tale of a 
working class upbringing, where alphabetti spaghetti 
is a luxury. Micky has come a long way since then, 
thanks to a university education he is now a rare 
delight - an intellectual cockney. Not bad for the 
boy from Bethnal Green.

Having been nominated for the prestigious Edinburgh 
Comedy Award for best newcomer, his Radio 4 series 
What Chance Change? was an instant hit with listeners 
and critics alike.
