,liqidwash,2012-02-13T04:23Z,"@SkywayAvenue, I have heard of the sam issues with my sister's WMP. We watch korean Soap Opera and it certainly helps my friends to understand what is going on with English subs! 

What I used for her computer is VobSub. I found it highly effective and only pops up when in use. It is a plugin that works with your player to play SRT files. The only problem that I find, that makes it hard for most to navigate or use, is the fact that the movie and the SRT have to be in the same folder. 

It works two ways: If the SRT and the movie are in the folder, the subs pop up and you simply have to remove the SRT if you no longer wish to have subtitles on your screen.

I hope this helps! :-)"
