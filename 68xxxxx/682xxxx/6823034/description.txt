   'Rascals' is a comedy about the joys of    
   conning where Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgn   
   play two cool competing conmen trying to   
   out-scheme each other in consistently      
   amusing and surprising setups.             
   But when both fall for the same girl ,     
   the competition reaches an all new level   
   as both men constantly attempt to outwit   
   each other to win over the surprisingly    
   elusive Kangana!Since much of the comedy   
   involves people taking advantage of one    
   another, having everything put forward in  
   ]such a gossamer manner that 'Rascals'     
   becomes an enjoyable journey throughout    
   with an interesting twist at the end!
