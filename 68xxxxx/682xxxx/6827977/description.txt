As the bayimg.com site is down at the time I posted this torrent
I'm recycling an image we made use of previously in connection with a music
torrent related to the 40s war-era - couldn't find anything else that was
suitable from our bayimg lists of stuff we've done before since we started
saving the codes for reference.
