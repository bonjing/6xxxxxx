Review

"Welcome to hacker fiction-like sci fi, but you don't get to make the good stuff up."-Dan Kaminsky, Director of Penetration Testing, IOActive, Inc. "There have been many sensationalist books on hackers, and this isn't one of them. Get a feeling for what it's really about and follow through with the technical details. Fun like Star Trek, but comes with the blueprints."-FX of Phenoelit Recurity Labs GmbH "A great read, whether you're a geek or not. Hollywood should take notes...a gripping story centered around real tech."-Johnny Long, Professional Hacker, Best-Selling Author and Founder of Hackers For Charity, Inc. "Dissecting the Hack: the F0rb1dd3n Network is an educational thriller, the reader is thoroughly entertained and yet walks away with an understanding of the importance of information security theory and practice."-Stephen Northcutt, President, The SANS Technology Institute
