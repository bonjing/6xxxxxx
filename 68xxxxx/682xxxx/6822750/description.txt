The news in the last few weeks was dominated by the sexual abuse scandal at Penn State University, the revelation about the wide sexual abuses in the professional sports in the US, and the sexual harassment accusations against Herman Cain - the Republican candidate for the US presidency. These incidents are only tips of an iceberg, and more is expected to come in a highly hypersexual society.
