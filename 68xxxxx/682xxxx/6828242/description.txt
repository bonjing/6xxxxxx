Sorry, the picture engine seems out of whack today.

In mostly Czech and English, but a few other languages tossed in for extra points. The English subtitles cover only the non-English parts.  I haven't checked the copious other subtitles for aberrant behavior. Czech subs come in two varieties.

A bit more subtle on the humor this time around. A strange hybrid "mockumentary".  Hybrid in the sense that most of the subjects are played by themselves, and not really being "in the know", I can't draw a line where the reality ends and the fiction starts. It centers around Jarek Nohavica and the Czech folk musicians "Cechomor" who are very real. 

Some odd insight into spontaneous combustion is included.

The extras do not appear to be subtitled.  There are, however, two versions (100 vs. 108 minutes)of the film, selectable on the menu.
