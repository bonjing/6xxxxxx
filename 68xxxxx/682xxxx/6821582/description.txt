Panic over, he's back! Everyone's favourite 
grumbling funny man and star of BBC2's Mock The 
Week, Andy Parsons is back on the road with his 
brand new show, Gruntled.

Britain's foremost topical comedian returns to 
the stage and DVD for more logically rigorous, 
cutting edge comedy. Expect the usual clever 
politically inspired bemusements and disappointedly 
crushed enthusiasm. This is a sharp, thought provoking 
show by one of our most astute comedians in the UK.
