From his smash-hit new show 'Off On Tour We Go', 
Jason's new DVD is guaranteed to get you laughing, 
with hilarious tales ranging from shower mishaps and 
embarrassing stories to the phrases that people get 
wrong and dealing with nappies.

Renowned for his hilarious observations and loveable, 
friendly delivery, Jason has been a firm favourite with 
comedy fans of all ages since his first solo stand-up show 
earned him huge critical acclaim. Jason Manford is now selling 
out huge arenas, including the Manchester MEN, where this 
show was filmed, and the London O2. Jason is making his mark 
as the master of observational comedy.
