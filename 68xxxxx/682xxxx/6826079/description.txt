The Coming of the Third Reich
Synopsis

There is no story in twentieth-century history more important to understand than Hitlerâ€™s rise to power and the collapse of civilization in Nazi Germany. With The Coming of the Third Reich, Richard Evans, one of the worldâ€™s most distinguished historians, has written the definitive account for our time. A masterful synthesis of a vast body of scholarly work integrated with important new research and interpretations, Evansâ€™s history restores drama and contingency to the rise to power of Hitler and the Nazis, even as it shows how ready Germany was by the early 1930s for such a takeover to occur. The Coming of the Third Reich is a masterwork of the historianâ€™s art and the book by which all others on the subject will be judged.

The Third Reich in Power
Synopsis

The definitive account of Germanyâ€™s malign transformation under Hitlerâ€™s total rule and the implacable march to war

This magnificent second volume of Richard J. Evansâ€™s three-volume history of Nazi Germany was hailed by Benjamin Schwartz of the Atlantic Monthly as â€œthe definitive English-language account... gripping and precise.â€ It chronicles the incredible story of Germanyâ€™s radical reshaping under Nazi rule. As those who were deemed unworthy to be counted among the German people were dealt with in increasingly brutal terms, Hitlerâ€™s drive to prepare Germany for the war that he saw as its destiny reached its fateful hour in September 1939. The Third Reich in Power is the fullest and most authoritative account yet written of how, in six years, Germany was brought to the edge of that terrible abyss.

The Third Reich at War
Synopsis

An absorbing, revelatory, and definitive account of one of the greatest tragedies in human history

Adroitly blending narrative, description, and analysis, Richard J. Evans portrays a society rushing headlong to self-destruction and taking much of Europe with it. Interweaving a broad narrative of the war's progress from a wide range of people, Evans reveals the dynamics of a society plunged into war at every level. The great battles and events of the conflict are here, but just as telling is Evans's re- creation of the daily experience of ordinary Germans in wartime. At the center of the book is the Nazi extermiÂ­nation of the Jews. The final book in Richard J. Evan's three-volume history of Hitler's Germany, hailed "a masterpiece" by The New York Times, The Third Reich at War lays bare the most momentous and tragic years of the Nazi regime.
