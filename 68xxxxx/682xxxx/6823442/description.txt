Rippers Diary..~ Here it is, our desi version!
Video source was 720p, so, it was easy to downscale it and work on it to make it look natural.
Audio source was crap! Big headache. One of the worst piece i ever worked on!
More of noice and hiss than the movie sound, nothing was heard clearly.
Took me a long long time, more than couple of hours to figure out and clear the audio line.
Audio line is not so clear, but the best possible available at the moment.
Syncing, WOOH! I had to go through and re-edit the complete audio to make it sync with the video.
Finally, AV sync is correct. Sit back and enjoy the movie.
Quality, Above all! - aSTEEL
