This is an underrated movie. Good story, nice performances, especially that of Sharmila Tagore and Balraj Sahni and Laxmi Chhaya. A rather simple story about a loving couple who come to big city in search of work but get separated. The boy, becomes a Taxi Driver and girl, an actress.

Great Balraj Sahni, cast against type in a somewhat negative part of a filmmaker who turns good in the end. This is a story of small dreams that clashed with heartlessness of big city. Good music adds to the ambience but the end is somewhat otherworldly yet believable.

Laxmi Chhaya remained a gem of an actress whose talent was never fully explored. She was such a natural, for more of her, watch 'Mera Gaon Mera Desh'. She is electrifying.

Worth watching.
