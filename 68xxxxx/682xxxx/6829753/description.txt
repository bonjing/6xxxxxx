UPDATED: Added a GB ROM from xda-dev that you can flash using the cwm that is installed after you install drhonk's rooted kernel. Also added andriod-sdk tools to the interfaces directory (provides adb). Read the instructions in the folde that has the cwm flashable gb rom.



This is everything that you need to flash the Samsung/TMo OEM 2.3.6 (Gingerbread) rom to your Samsung Galaxy S 4G

* I added instructions for flashing GB and rooting- including screen shots.
* I added 32 bit (along with 64-bit) Samsung drivers.
* Includes 2.3.5 and 2.3.6 Samsung Gingerbread roms
* Root with drhonk's KJ1 kernel. This keeps the wifi working.


When I flash and root using the methods described in the PDF that is in the root directory of this torrent everything works, and works well.

If you have problems- backup tith Titanium Backup and do a wipe and restore before flashing GB and rooting.
