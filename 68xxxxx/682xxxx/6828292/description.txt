Mr. Robinson, You're Trying To Seduce Me. Aren't You?

Ben Bradcock is a little concerned about his future. He loves Elaine, but just screwed her mother. He must choose. In this true parody, Paul Thomas takes you into the lives of the newly Graduated Ben, his affairs with Mrs. Robinson and her daughter Elaine.

'Paul Thomas' 'Graduate' parody is one of he best examples of the genre,' states Paul Fishbein, one of the most respected authorities on adult entertainment in the world. 'Carefully re-creating the mood and sensibility of the original but never forgetting to make the sex hot and raunchy, this is a film that serves fans of parodies and hard-core sex flicks equally.'
