What they do to make them 'HD' (It's not really HD) is that these films were found on film tape, hence you need a projector to watch them, so they project these films onto a large screen and then they film that projector with a more sophisticated HD camera and that's how they transfer it onto Blu-Ray.

The reason they film the projected screen is because with a projector you can upscale the resolution of the film without making it look too shitty as opposed to up-scaling the film digitally."
