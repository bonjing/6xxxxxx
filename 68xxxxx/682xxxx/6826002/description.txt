Following the release of the fastest-selling debut 
stand-up DVD ever (not to mention the biggest seller 
of last year), John Bishop returns with his new live 
DVD. Seen by over 400,000 people across the UK, Sunshine 
was filmed live at Liverpool's Echo Arena on the last night 
of his sell-out tour of the same name.

The combination of John's ability to keep the laughs coming 
along with his unique brand of observational humour, his 
undeniable charm and unrivalled gift of creating a relaxed 
atmosphere means that the feel good factor of spending an 
evening in his company is absolutely priceless. Now audiences 
have the opportunity to enjoy that same experience with all the 
family with John Bishop Live - The Sunshine Tour released on 
DVD and blu-ray.

In this show John shares anecdotes about the ways in which his 
life has changed because of fame, he confesses to what his kids 
really think of him and he explains why this is his time 
in the Sunshine
