The premier reference on B. anthracis and anthrax for scientists and health professionals

Bacillus anthracis has played a major role in shaping our understanding of bacterial pathogenesis and innate immunity. Due to its potential use as a bioterror agent, it remains at the forefront of microbiology research. To combat this possible danger, scientists are interested in identifying and understanding the ways in which B. anthracis adapts its gene expression and basic physiology to the local environment, particularly during infection. Bacillus anthracis and Anthrax provides a comprehensive guide to all aspects of the organism, ranging from basic biology to public health issues associated with anthrax.

Bringing together a comprehensive collection of reviews on this important research subject, the book covers:

    * Historical perspectiveâ€”B. anthracis and its impact on humans throughout history
    * Basic biology of B. anthracis, including life cycle, differentiation, and cellular structure
    * B. anthracis genomics, including phylogeny and evolution
    * B. anthracis pathogenesis, including toxins, capsule, and other virulence factors
    * Interaction of B. anthracis with the immune system
    * Anthrax, including clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of the different forms of human anthrax, as well as a review of animal models of anthrax and their use in research
    * Epidemiology of anthrax in both animals and humans, and the ecology of B. anthracis within the environment
    * Prevention of anthraxâ€”vaccines, anti-toxin therapies, and other strategies
    * B. anthracis as a bioterror agentâ€”history, current threat, and countermeasures

Comprised of fifteen chapters, the book reports on all major aspects of anthrax biology, such as basic biology and pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, prevention of anthrax, and biological issues. It discusses systems-level techniques as well as traditional biochemical and genetic tools, a multi-level approach that helps define both global trends and the individual roles that key proteins play in allowing the bacterium to rapidly adjust to its surroundings.

Bacillus anthracis and Anthrax is geared toward microbiologists, medical professionals, public health professionals, bioinformaticists, immunologists, physiologists, and bioterror research and preparedness. Its appeal also extends beyond the basic science community into medicine, public health, and public policy.
