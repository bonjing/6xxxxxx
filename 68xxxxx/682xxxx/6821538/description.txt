Fresh from its win for Best Comedy at the National 
TV Awards, Benidorm is back! Expect the unexpected 
with more outrageous fun in the sun for the Solana 
regulars and some new faces too!

Gavin has returned to the Solana but this year without 
Troy. Instead he's brought with him his deliciously camp 
employee from back home, Kenneth. But will his appetite 
for the all- you -can- eat buffet and his taste in 
colourful hot pants prove too much for Gavin?

There's cross-dressing confusion at the poolside bar 
with Les, whose son Liam has arrived in Spain, determined 
to find a holiday romance. Donald and Jacqueline, Benidorm's 
King and Queen of the swingers, are back and always looking 
to make new friends by the pool.

So, kick off your flip flops, and enjoy a slice of life 
on the Costa Del Comedy
