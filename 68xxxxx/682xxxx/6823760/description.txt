Description: 
For the animals in the polar regions, autumn means 
dramatic battles and epic journeys. Time is running out - 
the Arctic Ocean is freezing over and the sea ice is 
advancing at 2.5 miles per day around Antarctica.
Polar bears gather in large numbers on the Arctic coast as 
they wait for the return of the ice. Soon, tempers fray and 
violent sparring contests break out. Meanwhile 2,000 
beluga whales head for one special estuary, a gigantic '
whale spa' where they will thrash their snow-white bodies 
against the gravel and exfoliate. Inland, the tundra undergoes 
a dramatic transformation from green to fiery red. Here, 
musk ox males slam head-first into each other with the 
force of a 30mph car crash as they struggle to defend 
their harems. Frisky young caribou males play a game of '
grandma's footsteps' as they try to steal the boss's female.
Down in Antarctica, Adelie penguin chicks huddle 
together in creches. When a parent returns from fishing, it 
leads its twins on a comical steeplechase - sadly there's 
only enough for one, so the winner gets the meal. Two 
months later and the chicks are fully feathered apart from 
downy Mohican hairdos - they're ready to take their first 
swim - reluctantly though, as it seems penguins are not 
born with a love of water! And with good reason - a 
leopard seal explodes from the sea and pulls one from an 
ice floe, a hunting manoeuvre that has never been filmed 
before. As winter approaches and everyone has left, the 
giant emperor penguin arrives and makes an epic trek 
inland to breed. The mothers soon return to the sea 
leaving the fathers to hold the eggs and endure the 
coldest winter on earth
