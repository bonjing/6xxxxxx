   study in HRMC but do not get along with     
   each other. When the time comes for their   
   institutes' 25th anniversary celebrations,  
   one of their lecturers' assigns them to     
   meet ex-students who were romantically      
   involved during their tenure in the         
   college, take photographs and make a        
   presentation during this event. Both, in

   with each other. While Vishal is more       
   interested in hooking up with college       
   hottie, Malvika Kelkar, Preity has her      
   sights on rock-star, Rahul Sareen. Both     
   then use their online social networking     
   skills by creating fake ids to befriend     
   the duo with considerable success - little
