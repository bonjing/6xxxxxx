Part 17: Ancient Cities Bordering on Latium
Ever wonder what happened to a territory after it was overthrown by the indomitable Roman Army? Within the Roman conquered territories of Latium and Umbria weâ€™ll tour several ancient cities including Alatri, Fregellae and Amelia, and see how the land was divided up between the defeated inhabitants and the soldiers who stayed behind to occupy the newly acquired land. Weâ€™ll even look around a spectacular new home of a wealthy Roman citizen.
