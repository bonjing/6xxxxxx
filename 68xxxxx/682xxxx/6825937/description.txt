This miniseries depicts Jennifer Fellows, mild mannered housewife by day, efficient assassin by night. She is no regular hired assassin, however, as she's picking her own targets for no profit, and is apparently revenging herself upon her criminal gang of uncles. The ultra-violent series is a mix of action and dark humor, and, as writer Garth Ennis admits in his first issue letter to the readers, is his overdue return to this style of writing that he's known for and had longed to write for some time after the last few years of his creative output had taken a decidedly more serious turn.
