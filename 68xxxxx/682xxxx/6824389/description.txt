RELEASE NOTES  
   
 
 Years after taking Stilwater for their own, the Third Street Saints 
 have evolved from street gang to household brand name, with Saints  
 sneakers, Saints energy drinks and Johnny Gat bobble head dolls all 
 available at a store near you.  
 
 The Saints are kings of Stilwater, but their celebrity status has not   
 gone unnoticed. The Syndicate, a legendary criminal fraternity with 
 pawns in play all over the globe, has turned its eye on the Saints and  
 demands tribute. Refusing to kneel to the Syndicate, you take the fight 
 to Steelport, a once-proud metropolis reduced to a struggling city of   
 sin under Syndicate control.
 
 Take a tank skydiving, call in a satellite-targeted airstrike on a  
 Mexican wrestling gang, and defend yourself against a highly-trained
 military force using only a sex toy in the most out- landish gameplay   
 scenarios ever seen, igniting a city-wide war that will set Steelport   
 on fire. Strap it on.
