In this text, a variety of modal logics at the sentential, first-order, and 
second-order levels are developed with clarity, precision and philosophical 
insight. All of the S1-S5 modal logics of Lewis and Langford, among others, are 
constructed. A matrix, or many-valued semantics, for sentential modal logic is 
formalized, and an important result that no finite matrix can characterize any 
of the standard modal logics is proven. Exercises, some of which show 
independence results, help to develop logical skills.
