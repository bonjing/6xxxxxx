
Includes Awakening prologue through Purification Level 2. A lot of these files exist on the web already, but this puts them all together into a neat, convenient torrent. I've maintained the file structure so that you can select which Level you would like to download, as opposed to downloading all 6 gigabytes. 

All the files are in FLAC (free lossless audio codec)

The instructions are included in the appropriate folders. This torrent also contains the Support Follow Up Letters (in audio format) included with Awakening Prologue. 


Enjoy, share, upload on other trackers...
