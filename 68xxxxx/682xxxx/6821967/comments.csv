exhavx, Yeah I think I have an idea who you are!! And I loved this movie:) Brilliant script and excellent work of multiple strong actors. The irony and humor play out so well. This is definitely my kind of movie and I would highly recommend this film to anyone. Particularly those with an understanding of the cinema will surely treasure this one!! The fact that you had only been acting for 11 months is likely why the characters come across so naturally, you haven't had time to pick up bad acting habits yet!! And yes, you truly have arrived!! Bravo and congratulations:)  "
