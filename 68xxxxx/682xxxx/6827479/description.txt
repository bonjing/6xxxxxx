Episode Details:
================

11 	"The Legendary Quincy"


While on another hollow fighting mission, Ichigo encounters UryÅ« Ishida, a fellow classmate belonging to a clan known as the Quincy, humans that can use spiritual power to manifest a bow to fight hollows. UryÅ« declares himself an enemy of all Soul Reapers and challenges Ichigo to a competition of hunting hollows. 

12 	"A Gentle Right Arm"

The contest between Ichigo and UryÅ« has lured hundreds of hollows into Karakura Town, endangering many of Ichigo's friends. Chad is forced to fight a hollow in order to save Karin. During the battle he is finally able to see the hollow clearly, and develops a new ability, an armored right arm capable of firing energy blasts. 

13 	"Flower and Hollow"

The situation worsens as more hollows appear in the human world, attacking the school where Orihime and her friends are. While defending them, Orihime develops her own power, the Shun Shun Rikka, a group of fairy-like creatures coming from the hairpins given to her by her brother, and defeats the hollow. Afterward, Urahara takes in Orihime and Chad to help them with their new powers while Rukia and Ichigo confront UryÅ«. 

14 	"Back to Back, a Fight to the Death!"

The legion of hollows force Ichigo and UryÅ« to team up in combat while the others watch. A giant hollow called a Menos Grande arrives on the scene, and is driven away after Ichigo inflicts a wound assisted by power from UryÅ«. However, he releases too much spiritual power in the process. The strain of his powers causes Ichigo to lose consciousness, and UryÅ« saves him by releasing the excess energy through his bow. 

15 	"Kon's Great Plan"

Tired of mistreatment from Ichigo, Kon runs away to find a better owner. But he finds his abuse continuing from girls due to his freaky nature. Ichigo makes an effort to befriend UryÅ« but is rebuffed. Rukia becomes conflicted with her attachment with humans. Rather than endanger Ichigo, she runs away to face the newly-arrived hunters from the Soul Society.
