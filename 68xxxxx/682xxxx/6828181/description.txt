Henry John Deutschendorf, Jr. (December 31, 1943 - October 12, 1997), known professionally as John Denver, was an American singer/songwriter, activist, and humanitarian. After growing up in numerous locations with his military family, Denver began his music career in folk music groups in the late 1960s. His greatest commercial success was as a solo singer. Throughout his life Denver recorded and released approximately 300 songs, about 200 of which he composed.
He performed primarily with an acoustic guitar and sang about his joy in nature,
his enthusiasm for music, and relationship trials.
