ight the plot synopsis is very misleading because nowhere in there is the word GAY mentioned even once!! And to top it off it is really about a man going back in time and fucking himself, literally!! I really wish I had not wasted 95 minutes of my life on this film. I would feel less gay if I had sat through an entire gay porno and probably would have seen less man on man too. I'm no homophobe, this movie is just way too gay for a straight pirate. If you are a butt-pirate then you will probably love it!!(or if you like the shit they show on MTV these days) Anyway the quality is good. V=9, A=10, M=1  "
