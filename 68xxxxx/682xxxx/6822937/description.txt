   each other. When the time comes for their   
   institutes' 25th anniversary celebrations,  
   one of their lecturers' assigns them to

   involved during their tenure in the

   interested in hooking up with college       
   hottie, Malvika Kelkar, Preity has her      
   sights on rock-star, Rahul Sareen. Both     
   then use their online social networking

   the duo with considerable success - little
