"Who We Are / The Breaking Point"

The Seaside Wellness group stages an intervention 
for a defensive and volatile Amelia, who has 
resurfaced after disappearing on a 12-day drug 
binge with her boyfriend, Ryan. During the 
intervention, Amelia mercilessly attacks her 
friends one-by-one, and Addison, in particular, 
has trouble seeing her sister-in-law in her 
present condition. Amelia makes the hard decision 
to enter a rehab facility, and finds strength in 
an 18 year-old girl, as they both go through the 
painful detox process. Meanwhile, Cooper's 
strengthening bond with his son is tested by his 
allegiance to a patient in need, Pete and 
Violet's marriage reaches a tipping point, and 
Addison collapses from her rigorous fertility 
treatments.
