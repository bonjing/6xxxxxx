He Poos Clouds is the second album by Canadian indie rock artist Final Fantasy, released June 13, 2006 on Blocks Recording Club in Canada and Tomlab internationally.

The songs on the album (excluding the fifth and tenth tracks) are loosely connected to the eight schools of magic in the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, and the title track's lyrics ostensibly refer to Nintendo video game series The Legend of Zelda, as well as The Chronicles of Narnia. Pallett has also said that the album is a reflection on how atheists confront death.[4]

The track "This Lamb Sells Condos" refers to Toronto real estate developer Brad J. Lamb, who had previously used the song's title phrase as an advertising slogan. In the song, Pallett imagines an argument between the eponymous developer and his wife that alludes heavily to various fashion designers.

The album cover art is by Robin Fry.

The album was named the winner of the 2006 Polaris Music Prize on September 18, 2006.
