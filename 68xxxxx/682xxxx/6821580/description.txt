Transformers 2007 BluRay 720p DTS x264-3Li

SUMMARY:
A long time ago, far away on the planet of Cybertron, an alien civil war was being 
waged between the two races of robots the noble hero Autobots led by the wise 
Optimus Prime and the devious evil Decepticons commanded by the dreaded Megatron for 
control over the Allspark, a mystical talisman that would grant unlimited power to 
whoever possessed it. When the Autobots managed to smuggle the Allspark off the planet, 
but Megatron blasted off in search of it. He eventually tracked it to the planet of 
Earth circa 1850, but his reckless desire for power sent him right into the Arctic Ocean, 
and the sheer cold forced him into a paralyzed state. His body was later found by 
Captain Archibald Witwicky, and before going into a comatose state Megatron used the last 
of his energy to engrave a map, showing the location of the Allspark, into the Captain's glasses, 
and send a transmission to Cybertron. But now the Earth is caught in the middle of an 
intergalactic war between the Autobots and the evil Decepticons, which are able to change 
into a variety of objects, including cars, trucks, planes and other technological creations. 
Meanwhile a century later, at school a teenager named Sam Witwicky, (nicknamed Spike by his friends,) 
buys his new car (who is actually one of the Autobots named Bumblebee) after when he promised 
his dad that he would pass his test. The two robots seeking the cube Allspark with opposite 
intentions: the Autobots intend to protect the human beings, while the Deceptions want to 
destroy them. But unfortunately the ultimate power is held by Sam for mankind 
in the extraordinary adventure.

SUMMARY:
A youth chooses manhood. The week Sam Witwicky starts college, the Decepticons make 
trouble in Shanghai. A presidential envoy believes it's because the Autobots 
are around; he wants them gone. He's wrong: the Decepticons need access to Sam's 
mind to see some glyphs imprinted there that will lead them to a fragile object that, 
when inserted in an alien machine hidden in Egypt for centuries, will give them 
the power to blow out the sun. Sam, his girlfriend Mikaela, and Sam's parents are 
in danger. Optimus Prime and Bumblebee are Sam's principal protectors. 
If one of them goes down, what becomes of Sam?
