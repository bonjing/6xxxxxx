,cscarly,2011-12-16T20:00Z,i cant get this video play while some others i can u help me with problem .
u generally upload games in the order they are played, 1pm first then 4pm then SNF/MNF. But I think it would be quite a good idea to include this in the title, such as:

NFL Week8 10-30-2011 4pm Cincinnati Bengals at Seattle Seahawks
  or
NFL Week8 10-30-2011 Cincinnati Bengals at Seattle Seahawks 4pm

This would help me out a great deal, because I really don't want to accidentally watch a late game only to have an early game spoiled by the announcers or a score update game break. Anyway, it's just a thought. Keep up the good work!!"
