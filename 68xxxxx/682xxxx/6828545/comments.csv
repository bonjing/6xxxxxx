,Suomisisu,2012-05-29T17:27Z,Everything I try and use to convert the .dmg to an .iso has failed so far. Tried UltraIso and PowerIso... neither have worked. UltraIso fails to open the file. PowerIso opens it as a 500Kb image.. then when trying to convert it fails at 45% as another user has stated... trying on Windows 7.
