Killer Love is the debut studio album by American recording artist Nicole Scherzinger, released on March 18, 2011 through Interscope Records. After beginning work on the project in 2007 under the title Her Name Is Nicole, the project was pushed back numerous times into 2008 and 2009 before Scherzinger finally shelved the album citing bad timing and creative issues as the reasons for its cancellation. She began re-recording the entire project in 2010, before enlisting producer RedOne to produce the majority of the album. Killer Love features mainly up-tempo songs which Scherzinger intended on performing live.Enrique Iglesias and Sting have guest performances on the album, although the Sting duet is leftover from the Her Name is Nicole sessions.
