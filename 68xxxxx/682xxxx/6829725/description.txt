plot:The Santa Clause: It's the night before Christmas when toy salesman Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) finds himself in an awkward predicament. The real Santa Claus has fallen off his roof and his "emergency card" instructs Scott to take his place. But by putting on the Santa suit, Scott unknowingly accepts all the responsibilities of the rosy-cheeked legend. With his young son by his side, Scott starts a comical new life of weight gain, beard growth, narrow chimneys and elves with attitude!

The Santa Clause 2: Santa's got problems and things quickly go south when he finds out that his son, Charlie, has landed on this year's "naughty" list. Desperate to help his son, Scott heads back home, leaving a substitute Claus to watch over things at the Pole. But when the substitute redefines naughty and nice, putting Christmas at risk, it's up to Scott to return with a new bag of magic to try to save Christmas!

The Santa Clause 3:Tim Allen reprises his role of Scott Calvin-aka Santa as he juggles a full house of family and the mischievous Jack Frost (Martin Short), whose chilling Santa envy has him trying to take over the "big guy's" holiday.
At the risk of giving away its secret location, Scott invites his in-laws, Sylvia and Bud Newman (Ann-Margret and Alan Arkin) to the North Pole to share in the holiday festivities and be near their daughter, Carol (Elizabeth Mitchell)-aka Mrs. Claus- as she prepares for the eagerly anticipated birth of baby Claus.
