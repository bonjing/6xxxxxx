ADDITIONAL NOTES


Seriously Rockstar Games, why use a protection that ends up punishing
people that actually buy your games? Team Bundi did an excellent piece
work on this game, and yet you made the game suffer with the protection
added to it. Some people that bought the game, can't even run the game,
because of this clever protection. Protections like this one can get
too clever, that it is the reason for lower framerates, and in the end
make the game almost unplayable for others.
