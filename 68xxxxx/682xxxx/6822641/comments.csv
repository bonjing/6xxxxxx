t V7 there are 1 or two points where the bottom half of the screen goes a little pixely, but it's only for a few seconds.

Also, for those downloading it, it opens with .mkv format so requires a Matroska compatable media player. (Windows media player and iTunes doesn't fork for this format)

The one I used, I got it free for windows from "" http://mpc-hc.sourceforge.net/download-media-player-classic-hc.html ""
For Mac i'm sure you'll find one easy enough on google by googleing 'Matroska player for mac' or something similar."
