Release Info:


It's called The Run. An illicit, high-stakes race across the country. The

only way to get your life back is to be the first from San Francisco to New

York. No speed limits. No rules. No allies. All you have are your driving

skills and sheer determination as you battle hundreds of the world's most

notorious drivers on the country's most dangerous roads.


In Need for Speed The Run, you'll weave through dense urban centers, rocket

down icy mountain passes and navigate narrow canyons at breakneck speeds,

all the while evading a relentless police force prepared - and willing - to

use lethal force to take you down.


From the Golden Gate to the Empire State - Compete in The Run, an

illicit race across the most iconic and treacherous roads from San

Francisco to New York. There are no rules and no allies in the cities,

deserts, mountains and canyons than stand between you and the finish line.


You are Jack's Competitive Edge - Jack is in a race for his life, but

he's got something the competition doesn't: You. Keep Jack one step ahead

of the dangers from his dark past, both inside and outside the car. It's up

to you to get Jack to New York in one piece and ahead of the competition.
