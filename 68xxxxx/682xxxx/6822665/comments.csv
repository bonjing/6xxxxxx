Three Musketeers maybe, but you can find that already on here and it's a great rip and encode. Joey3D does a good job with his, highly recommended. Anyways, sorry again for being AWOL. 

@Aresta - Glad you got it DL'd, not sure what the issue was.

@3Dazz - I don't know much about the LG box. From what I've researched, it's an LG product used to get SMART TV features on certain LG TVs that didn't have it built it. It says it has Dolby Digital support so first go to this webpage if you lost your manual.

Anyways, I assume your receiver is 5.1/7.1 capable so go to the audio menu within your SmartBox. Make sure that Primary Pass Thru is seleted as your audio output. Then if it still is having problems, it could be a frequency issue, so try changing the sampling frequency. Some receivers cannot playback audio at a certain kilohertz. I would guess that one or both of these options will fix your problem. Good Luck!

First off to all, I promise never to do another movie with the stock HD audio as I have learned it's not compatible with the majority of what's still out there. So from here forward, I'll stick to 5.1 AC3 audio. I see there are copies of Transformers DOTM already out there. I can do it as I have a Bluray 3D copy here, but don't like to duplicate good work already out there. Let me know I guess. I'm shooting for John Carter and the 4th Underworld next. They are due April I believe."
