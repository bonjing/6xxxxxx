         Amy and Steve uncover a history of unspeakable violent        
         crimes when a Florida couple claims to see spirits in         
         their home. Steve hunts down evidence of voodoo sacrifices    
         and rampant racism, while Amy is horrified by visions of      
          disfigured dead.
