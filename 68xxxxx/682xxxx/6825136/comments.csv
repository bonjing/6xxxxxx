ip step two if you have the 6.39 version)

2) Run one of the downgrader programmes (Chronoswitch or PSP Downgrader, choose one depending on your psp model - if it's the wrong one the device will turn off; don't worry, turn it on and choose the other one), which work just like pandora battery, and downgrade to OFW 6.39.

3) Find the 'pro PSP FIRMWARE Update' icon (it should be the last one on the list) and press the x button to run it. Once it has loaded, press the x button again to start the firmware.

4) Congratulation! You now can play iso games you have downloaded, run the emulators and many other things.

5) To configue the CFW, simply press the select button while at the main menu. (I recomment not changing anything, as I think that the default otions are ok)

6) If you want to turn the CFW off, just turn off your psp devvice (not sleep mode - you have to hold the power button down for about three seconds)


P.S.
The emulators won't work until you have run the CFW.

If you enter the Playstation Store while using the CFW, all options will be blank. Also, once you downgrade your psp, you won't be able to enter the shop.




If you want any more help just inform me."
