Solo con tu pareja (literally "Only with your partner", released in English-speaking markets as Love in the Time of Hysteria) is a 1991 Mexican film by Alfonso Cuaron.

This was the first full-feature film for Cuaron who had previously worked at Televisa, a Mexican television company. The stars of this film are Daniel GimÃ©nez Cacho (the narrator on Cuaron's second Mexican film Y tu mama tambien) and telenovela star Claudia RamÃ­rez.

After Alfonso Cuaron and his brother Carlos Cuaron wrote the script, they needed to secure financing. The government of Mexico's IMCINE (Instituto Mexicano de CinematografÃ­a) had already decided what films they would finance that year. Fortunately for the Cuarons, one of the projects was canceled and the IMCINE funds were assigned to Solo con tu pareja.

After the film was completed, the Mexican government refused to distribute it, but Solo con tu pareja was presented at several international festivals. It won awards at the Ariel Awards (by the Mexican Academy of Film) and at the Toronto Film Festival. After this international recognition the movie was finally shown in 1993 in its country of origin where it became a box-office success. It occupies the 87th place on the list of the 100 best movies of the cinema of Mexico.
