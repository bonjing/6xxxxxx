In 2006 Graham Lindsey packed up his guitars, banjo and two dogs and left his longtime log cabin home in the woods of Wisconsin. He traveled west to Montana where he married and began to compile and polish the stunning wealth of material that has become We Are All Alone In This Together. The twelve songs on this album were woodshedded out in a makeshift recording studio in Lindsey's cabin home in the mountains of Montana and fine tuned with the help of producer/engineer Steve Deutsch (Linda Thompson, Van Dyke Parks). An impressive cast of musicians joined Lindsey to unfold the latest chapter of his seldom sunny, often fiery, and always unapologetic bear-trap glimpse on the world. Since his critically acclaimed debut Famous Anonymous Wilderness (2003), to his equally heralded sophomore follow up Hell Under The Skullbones (2006), Graham Lindsey has been called every name in the book from 'the next Dylan', to the 'alt-country man-of-the-future', to 'Gillian Welch's male counterpart'. But with this new collection of songs, sometimes delicately layered, sometimes hauntingly solo, Lindsey's most recent and daring vision is poised to make important tracks in a place we have not yet seen.
