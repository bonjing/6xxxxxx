                Still trying to fulfil his destiny by becoming
                SuperHoodie, Simon saves Peter, a geeky comic-book
                nerd, from being mugged. Peter is in awe of
                SuperHoodie - at last he's found a real super-hero to
                idolise. Peter strikes up a friendship with Simon, a
                friendship that soon turns into obsession and
                threatens to destroy everything that Simon holds
                dear. Finally, Simon discovers the true sacrifices
                that you must make to become a real super-hero.
