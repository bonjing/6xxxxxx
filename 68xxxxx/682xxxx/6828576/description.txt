[excerpted from John Stossel's blog:]

There are enemies of free speech. This week, I report on:

Colleges that ban students from speaking their minds and restrict professors from free expression.

NPR, which takes government funding, canned Juan Williams for being honest on â€˜The O'Reilly Factor'.

And busybody politicians, who pass campaign finance "reform" laws that actually limit your free speech.

We should have vigorous, contentious debate about everything. And that includes topics that make people uncomfortable.

Free speech, and its enemies. That's our show this week.
