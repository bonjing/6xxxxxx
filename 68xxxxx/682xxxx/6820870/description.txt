More of the good stuff! Volume 12! Found this awesome background online, had to make a cover out of it. The Japanese Popstars sure don't sound as expected, stupid prejudice of mine. Last night sure describes the average club night of mine, only most clubs don't play my style of music, which is a shame.

It has been a while, busy doing useless stuff! Volume 11 has arrived, 

the mayor bomb is the Wonderman Remix! This is the release I started overhauling my website, I think it has been improved much. Pretty time consuming, but that's what hobby's do right?
