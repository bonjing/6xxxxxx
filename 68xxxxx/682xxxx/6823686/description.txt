The first situation-based 3-in-1 writing guide (including a rhetoric, reader, and research manual), Cheryl Glenn's THE HARBRACE GUIDE TO WRITING, CONCISE EDITION infuses the common genres and strategies with a rhetorical awareness in the context of actual local situations. THE HARBRACE GUIDE TO WRITING, CONCISE EDITION translates rhetorical theory into easy-to-follow (and easy-to-teach) techniques that help sharpen your ability to observe what words, assertions, or opinions might work best with a particular audience in a specific situation. This edition has been updated to reflect guidelines from the 2009 MLA HANDBOOK FOR WRITERS OF RESEARCH PAPERS, SEVENTH EDITION.
