BetterZip lets you quickly inspect archives without first extracting their contents.

* Extract Only Files You Really Need: If you only need a few files or
  folders from a larger archive, you don\'t have to extract the whole thing.
  Simply drag the files you need from the BetterZip window to any Finder
  window or the desktop.

* Open Archives Without Extracting: Not only can BetterZip open
  archives without first extracting them but you can also search for a file
  using the iTunes-like interface. BetterZip can open and extract archives 
  with the most common formats: ZIP, SIT, TAR, XAR, GZip, BZip2,
  RAR, 7-Zip, CPIO, ARJ, LZH/LHA, JAR, WAR, CAB, ISO, CHM,
  RPM, DEB, NSIS, BIN, HQX.

* Create Archives: Simply drag files and folders from your hard drives, 
  disks, or network places into your new zip file. You no longer have to
  copy all the files into a temporary folder first. The supported formats are
  ZIP, TAR, GZip and BZip2 compressed TAR, XAR, 7-ZIP, and RAR
  (using the external RAR commandline tool). Large archives can also be
  split.

* Protect Your Data: BetterZip can protect your data with a password and
  create WinZip compatible AES-256 encrypted archives. 7-zip and rar
  archives can also be protected.

* Update Archives: Add new or updated files to existing archives.
  Remove any file or folder from an archive, or even move files around
  inside the archive as if it were a normal folder.

* Make Archives Compatible: Strip Mac specific files and resource forks
  from archives for best compatibility with systems like Windows or
  Linux.
