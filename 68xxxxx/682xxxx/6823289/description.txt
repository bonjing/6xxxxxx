Barcelona, Spain 1997
Date: 97-06-30
Venue: Palau Val D'Hebron

Recording: AUD
Quality: 8
Menu: NO
Extras: None
Comments: The first song is apparently from Oslo and is shot from the balcony slightly left of center, the rest, which is all Barcelona, is shot from lower on the balcony at center stage. Image varies a lot in quality which the screenshots show. The camerawork is a bit erratic. Audio is pretty good although a bit distant.
