    Gary Rhodes is fanatical about the quality of the          
    produce he uses, in his relentless pursuit of             
    perfection in the kitchen. He's horrified to discover    
    that, not only have we lost the vast majority of our      
    cherry orchards, but hardly any of the cherries we eat     
    in the UK were grown here. His campaign takes him to      
    meet growers who are trying to buck the trend and fight  
    back, not only with new strains of sweeter, larger        
    cherries, but with old-fashioned heritage varieties.       
    Gary's powers of persuasion to make us fall back in       
    love with the British cherry come to the fore in the     
    'Revival' kitchen, where he prepares some exceptional     
    dishes, including his signature dessert - a delectable     
    cherry clafoutis.                                         
                                                             
    Award-winnnng food writer and restaurateur Yotam          
    Ottolenghi is passionate about nuts. He uses them in       
    many of his recipes as they are an integral ingredient    
    in Middle Eastern cookery. He discovers that although    
    Britain has a rich history of growing nuts, most of us    
    are completely unaware of this tradition. We can grow      
    fantastic walnuts in the UK but not enough for them to    
    be commercially viable, so most walnuts we eat are       
    imported. Yotam wants this to change and for us to get    
    behind our native nuts like the British cobnut - a nut     
    that most people have never heard of unless they live     
    in Kent, where it is grown. To get us to appreciate      
    these homegrown delicacies, he creates some fantastic     
    sweet and savoury dishes including a magnificent cobnut    
    crumble cream and roasted aubergines with an amazing      
    walnut salsa.
