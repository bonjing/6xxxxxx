Hey Nero... here is the Mighty Quinn movie............. The movie had 2 parts so i had to combine it... so in the middle where the movie joins there is a slight 5 second repeat... I was going to close the gap and edit it but I am on vacation and dont have my other laptop to do it... anyways hope you enjoy



When police officer Xavier Quinn's childhood friend, Maubee, becomes associated with murder and a briefcase full of ten thousand dollar bills, The Mighty Quinn must clear his name. Or try to catch him, which could be even trickier. Written by Renee Ann Byrd
