Madeline Walters, a university professor, and Kevin Fallon, a
widower, meet when his job as an architect brings him to work
on a project at her university. The pair hit it off almost
immediately. Only Kevin's 13 year old son Jordan and
Madeline's Maltese puppy Cinnamon have other ideas. Despite
doing her best to sabotage their flowering romance, the
insecure Cinnamon must devise a plan to keep Madeline all to
herself.
