  Filthy Rotten Scoundrels is the series that highlights the work of    
  environment officers across the UK, as they tackle astonishing and    
  flagrant cases of fly-tipping!                                        
                                                                        
  An enviro-officer in Leicestershire tracks the rogue who throws       
  dozens of bags of dog mess into the trees at a local beauty spot.     
                                                                        
  Enforcement officers in Hillingdon, North-West London set up an       
  elaborate sting operation to catch a car-scrapper who has flyposted   
  illegally, right across the borough.                                  
                                                                        
  Plus, in Bristol, one man's outrageous 15-year fly-tipping spree      
  comes to an abrupt end, when a local resident catches him in the act  
  on camera. He was jailed for two-and-a-half years.                    
                                                                        
  The hard-working and tenacious officers often go undercover to track  
  down criminals who dump thousands of tons of rubbish on our city      
  streets and country lanes. Investigators call on police back-up for   
  elaborate sting operations, and scan through hours of surveillance    
  footage. More than 3,000 fly-tipping incidents happen each day,       
  costing tax payers 55 million pounds a year to clear up.              
                                                                        
  Enjoy!
