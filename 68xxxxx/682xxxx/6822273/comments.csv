Internet bullying is truly funny. A couple anonymous people leave a comment on one of my torrents threatening me, and I'm supposed to take it seriously? Hardly. I do thank you for the chuckle.

For those of you who have been with me from the start, don't worry, I'm not going anywhere. As for the links being removed from the description, it was a small problem that was fixed. Seems a mod had added ""x.co"" to the spam filter, which removed the links. Talked to a mod, and they removed the filter, so links will show up correctly for the next set being posted. Which will be Ella, tonight sometime.

Btw, I've been paying for a membership to the FG site every month for over a year now. Can you say the same helpFG? Doubt it :)"
