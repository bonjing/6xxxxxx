Stephen Merchant, the Emmy, BAFTA and 
Golden Globe award winning co-creator of 
The Office and Extras in his first ever live 
stand-up comedy tour and it has been well worth 
the wait. The Guardian says "his performance is 
priceless...he can do funny just by being there" 
and The Times states that "the man is hilarious". 
Stepping into the lime light, Stephen Merchant is 
in search of a wife, discussing the problems of 
being 6ft7 in life, but also when it comes to the 
ladies, watching porn on VHS and re-enacting the 
first play he ever wrote! This is one not to be missed![/center]
