"Wallflower" 

When a man mysteriously dies by an 
invisible force, his body rapidly 
begins turning ghostly white. The 
Fringe team learns that this is not 
an isolated incident, and theres 
evidence that links the predator to 
someone who passed away with an 
unknown genetic disorder. Meanwhile, 
Olivia suffers from migraines.
