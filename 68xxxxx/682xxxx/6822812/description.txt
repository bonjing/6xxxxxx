13Floor Wordpress Theme


With this design I wanted to create something edgy, flashy and fun while still retaining an air of professionalism. I really focused on the homepage with this theme in hopes of giving my users the ability to really grab their visitor\'s attention. The homepage contains only a collection of page or post-based slides, but still gives you enough room to tell your readers what you\'re all about without drowning them in text.
