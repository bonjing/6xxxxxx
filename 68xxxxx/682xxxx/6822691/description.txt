I could find no subtitles that work for the dvd rip.

I went back to thank the original uploader of this torrent and I can't find it, and can't find it at any site, so decided to re-upload. I loved this series when it originally aired, and the early seasons were the best. I had originally just downloaded the first few episodes, but noticed that the seeders were disappearing fast, and even fewer peers, so I thought I had better finish it while it was possible. It was dismaying to see so many drop off as soon as their download finished. I have so far seeded the original at 3.280 ratio, and will continue to seed this one as long if I see support for it. It has been my experience from my other uploads that so many peers do not continue to seed at first, but eventually for a top notch series there are loyal supporters who want to share. I hope you don't disappoint me this time.
