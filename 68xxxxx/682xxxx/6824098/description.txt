RELEASE NOTES

Years after taking Stilwater for their own, the Third Street Saints
have evolved from street gang to household brand name, with Saints
sneakers, Saints energy drinks and Johnny Gat bobble head dolls all
available at a store near you.

The Saints are kings of Stilwater, but their celebrity status has not
gone unnoticed. The Syndicate, a legendary criminal fraternity with
pawns in play all over the globe, has turned its eye on the Saints and
demands tribute. Refusing to kneel to the Syndicate, you take the fight
to Steelport, a once-proud metropolis reduced to a struggling city of
sin under Syndicate control.

Take a tank skydiving, call in a satellite-targeted airstrike on a
Mexican wrestling gang, and defend yourself against a highly-trained
military force using only a sex toy in the most out- landish gameplay
scenarios ever seen, igniting a city-wide war that will set Steelport
on fire. Strap it on.
