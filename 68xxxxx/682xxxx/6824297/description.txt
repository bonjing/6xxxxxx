Well-meaning, but socially awkward, Sawako Kuronuma (Mikako Tabe) is nicknamed â€œSadakoâ€ by her classmates because of her similar hair cut with the main character from the horror movie â€œRinguâ€. Her life then takes a turn when Shota Kazehaya (Haruma Miura), the most popular boy in school, falls for her â€¦

Sawako Kuronuma has a gloomy appearance and, because of this, is nicknamed â€œSadakoâ€ by her peers. On the other hand, her personality is bright and caring. Her favorite motto is â€œdo one good thing once a day,â€ but she cares too much about others and cannot express her thoughts. This has made her somewhat of an outcast at school.
