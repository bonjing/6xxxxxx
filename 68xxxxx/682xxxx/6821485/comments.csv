VLC, you can sync the audio yourself (its barely out) and the frame rate is fine, definitely watchable, sure its not on par with some of the bigger releases, although its pretty much what you expect for a ski film - despite the crop.

Its also the best copy thats out at the moment. 

Someone else back me up that benztr is doing something wrong? Or maybe over reacting?
