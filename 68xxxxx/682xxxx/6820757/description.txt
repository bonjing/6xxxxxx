HONG Doo-shik, there is something special about him!! Heâ€™s a good-looking 31 year-old man who knows everything and knows how to do everything. Heâ€™s a delivery man for a Chinese restaurant. Heâ€™s a clerk at a convenient store. And heâ€™s even a singer at a live cafe! YOON Hae-jin is a righteous perfectionist and also a dentist. She gets fired when her â€˜supposed-to-be-threateningâ€™ resignation is accepted by the board! She moves to a small rural town to open up her own clinic.
