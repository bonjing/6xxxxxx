Academy award nominated for best actor and winner Golden Screed award (Germany)
this is one of the most popular movies for those who grew up around the 70s and earlier.

Disco gave a greater lift to the human spirit in a sense of a vibrant "can do"
mentality of accomplishment within an atmosphere of real care and finesse
in what were the tone of the lyrics and sound.

That's a bit of a stretch for some to consider perhaps, but then whats so human
about music that sounds like its from "star wars" fit mainly for R2D2 or
rap music that explicitly obliterates the romantic sensibilities in favour of the
inane. We were once too nice to allow it as equally welcome and its still an
extremely fringe offering in rare karaoke bars I'm happy to note.

enjoy the return to the Disco eh!
