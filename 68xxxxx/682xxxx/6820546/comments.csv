,chair_tard,2011-11-16T00:45Z,"thx for posting and plz excuse my rant here... I realize xart likely wrapped this in .wmv... but omg .wmv sucks so bad... its bad enough that .avi wrappers are still used in SD stuff, kills me that idiots are posting HD in .avi sometimes... but .wmv is just the most ridiculous wrapper to use. Any transcoders and encoders that read this, if you are posting in HD, H.264 (x264) encoding and matroska wrapper is the way to go, .mkv files, or at the very minimum .mp4 wrapper. Anyone that still actually chooses to use .avi or .wmv ... seriously something wrong with you. Again, C3Porno... I realize you probably didn't encode this, so Thx again for the upload."
