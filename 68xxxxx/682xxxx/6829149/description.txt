This is a full resolution, high profile x264 DVD rip of the SciFi Miniseries - The Lost Room.  These files may be a little large for some.  But if you aren't worried about space, and want a higher quality, to output to a t.v. or such, then this may be for you.  I've previewed the episodes and they look and sound great on a 50 inch LCD/surround sound system.

Encoding video with x264, there are two basic ways to choose how big the file will be: 1. You pick an average size (in bits) per second or 2. You pick an average quality (crf). #1 lets you predict how big the file will be, but the quality is unpredictable, while #2 lets you predict the average quality but not the filesize, since thereâ€™s no easy way to predict in advance how much space the encoder needs to achieve the desired quality. Some scenes/videos need more bits, some need less.  The standard 350mb encoding that you see doesn't take any of this into account, so the quality can be sub-par and can vary greatly across files. The files in this torrent are all encoded at a constant quality crf of 18.5 which is a very high quality factor.  You'll notice many "scene release" tv shows and movies vary in size.  That's because they're using CRF. 350mb/700mb encoding is dead. CRF encoding is the future of encoding.
