Recorded on the closing night of this yearâ€™s Montreux Festival on July 16, this concert features Deep Purple playing their classic hits with the accompaniment of a full symphony orchestra conducted by Stephen â€œBKâ€ Bentley-Klein. The orchestral arrangements give an added depth and range to the familiar songs and the band, who are clearly enjoying the experience, deliver one of their finest performances.
