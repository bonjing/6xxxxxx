,Mingfang47,2011-12-30T06:50Z,Look like what edisoncwc1 said is true but...... SuperACC and no-recoil still crashes in the survival game.
ying to buy weapon, the programme will give us that weapon and fill its ammo, so if we toggle the infinite ammo, the programme will be confused as the trainer want to lock the ammo amount while you are trying to add the ammo, and then there is a risk of crashing if your computer cannot figure it out...

Perhaps we should just ""un-toggle"" the infinite ammo cheat when buying the weapon (only the infinite ammo cheat, unless you want to die when buying weapon...), and then toggle it again will do..."
