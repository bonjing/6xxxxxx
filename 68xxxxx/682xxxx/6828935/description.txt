Tested:

I personally have tested the OS on many systems including i3, i5, i7 and quadcore PCs. I havent tested this on apple though!



FAQ:



1) Can I install the OS over VISTA/XP

Yes. You can install this OS over vista/xp. Just make a HDD space for this other than the vista/xp drive. Install this OS and u could see vista/xp while booting up in the Other windows section!

2) Does aero effects work ?

Yes. This is a high end OS. All features like avalon effects etc are enabled for the quality in appearence.

3) Can I install this OS via USB device ?

Yes U can install this OS via USB thumb drive with minimum capacity of 8 GB. Open the image with ultra ISO and go to bootable menu and select the Write Disk Image, select u r thumb drive and start writing. thats it. it ll boot up. However u mother board should allow the USB device booting. For more info see u r mother board carton.

4) Booting takes more time, what shall i do ?

Well the booting usually take 25,000 ms. if it takes more than it is, then Go to run &gt; type msconfig &gt; go to boot tab &gt; select the NoGUI boot and apply &gt; exit

Further more try to clean the OS with registry cleaner or ccleaner which i have provided.

5) Can i change the Boot screen as u did ?

Yes Ofcourse u can. The boot load updater [ by codeforlife, thank u mate ] is been added to u r documents folder. Open it and select the animation u have. U can download various others throu google. I have provided 3 animations.

6) Can I change the logon screen snap/pic ?

Yes ofcourse. I have provided a small application in documents folder. Select that and start changing u r screen! To check the pic enabled or not just press windows key plus L [ W + L ] it locks the computer at log in screen.

7) Can i use more registry tweaks ?

It is advisable not to add more registry tweaks that would cause additional issues to u r pc.

 Can I add more themes ?

Of course u can add millions of themes.

9) I get the freezy look after i install the antivirus !!

This issue is due to uxstyle theme service not working. If u come across this issue please install the UXCorestyle file [ in documents folder i have provided ] it ll work. this service takes not more than 420 KB of mem!!

10) Can I distribute this OS to my pals ?

Ofcourse u can distribute this OS to any one u want but with 2 things as contraints. U have to distribute it as FREE and with credits to ME [ Prince NRVL @ Neo Reconia Sys - 2011 ]
I have seen many of my OSs been sold, or redistributed or extra modded and is uploaded. This is really the hideous thing i wouldn't like to see.

Every modder of the OS has dream to help the USERS and also to build the good OS other than his shitty highness BILL GATES provide.. lolxx.

I have dedicated my real time and other stuffs to make this OS. I ask u to provide nothing but sheer respect for this OS!
