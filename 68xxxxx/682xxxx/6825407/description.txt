What are the rules for all planets out there in the universe? Did NASA rovers Spirit and Opportunity find the answers when they touched down on Mars in 2004?Are dust devils the reason for Mars condition long time periods.
Although we have extreme weather on earth, it is nothing in comparison to the wettest, dustiest and most brutal 'Alien Storms.' 

Radical weather is not uncommon in the solar system and storms on other planets are bigger, more powerful and stranger than their counter-parts on earth. This programme is an in-depth investigation into the source of such dramatic weather in the solar system and why it is so different from the weather we experience on earth. 

Watch how once the incredible dust storms on Mars have started, it can take months for the skies to clear and learn how Neptune's extreme winds can reach speeds of 2,500 an kilometres an hour.
