"The Prince in the Plastic"

After the remains of a female toy 
company executive are found shrink-
wrapped with a Prince Charming doll, 
the company's CEO gives Booth and 
Sweets access to the company 
headquarters' highly classified 
prototype lab, where details of the 
victim's personal life begin to 
emerge. Meanwhile, Sweets, with the 
support of his girlfriend, squint 
Daisy Wick, prepares for his gun 
certification test despite Booth's 
opposition to Sweets carrying a 
weapon. Mom-to-be Brennan, wonders 
whether she will be a good mother 
and uses the case as a way to 
understand the importance of toys 
and playing with her child.
