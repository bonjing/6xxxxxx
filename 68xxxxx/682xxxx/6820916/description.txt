                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Great British Food Revival ses diffferent chefs attempting to bring           
 traditional British produce back to the nation's kitchens.                    
                                                                               
 Angela Hartnett attempts to encourage the viewers at home to cook turkey outside
 the festive season. Raymond Blanc explores takes a look at plum orchards which
 have been suffering due to public indifference to their produce. He then creates
 some dishes with the fruit in a bid to get more people using it in their
 everyday cooking.
                   
                                 Enjoy!
