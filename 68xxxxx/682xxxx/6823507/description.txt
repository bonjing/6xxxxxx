The History of Science from 1895 to 1945
By Ray Spangenburg, Diane K. Moser
Universities Press | 1999 | ISBN 81 7371 192 5 | PDF xii + 164 pages | 12.7 mb

From 1895 to 1912, a series of extraordinary scientific finds and theoretical breakthroughs would suddenly turn the world of physics topsy-turvy and thrust a new, modern scientific era upon the world. At the same time, these discoveries would place more power, both constructive and lethal, than ever before in the hands of human beings. The result in 1945Ã¹the concluding year of World War II and of this bookÃ¹was a mushroom-shaped cloud that transformed forever the world in which we live and defined once again the complex and uneasy role of science in human history.
Our story begins with an enormously famous set of names: Wilhelm Rontgen, Marie and Pierre Curie, J. J. Thomson, Albert Einstein, Max Planck, Ernest Rutherford, Niels Bohr. Theirs was a time of great vitality, excitement and confusion in the field of physics, and their work ranks among the most exciting in the history of science.
This book, in the series called On the Shoulders of Giants, looks at how people have developed a system for finding out how the world works, making use of both success and failure. We will look at the theories they put forth, sometimes right and sometimes wrong. And we will look at how we have learned to test, accept and build upon those theories, or to correct, expand or simplify them.
We'll also see how scientists have learned from others' mistakes, sometimes having to discard theories that once seemed logical but later proved to be incorrect, misleading or unfruitful. In all these ways they have built upon the shoulders of other men and women of scienceÃ¹the giants who went before them.

The History of Science from 1946 to the 1990s
By Ray Spangenburg, Diane K. Moser
Universities Press | 1999 | ISBN 81 7371 196 8 | PDF xvi + 764 pages | 15.1 mb

In this short book, it is possible only to explore some of the exciting discoveries made in the second half of the 20th centuryÃ¹in light of the explosion of new finds and intriguing questions raised every day. At the end of this book, we've suggested several books for further exploration, as well as other resources, such as magazines and organizations. We hope you'll plunge into these, too, and discover for yourself some of the fascinating complexities and delightful questions our universe poses. For science provides us all, whether we are professional scientists or not, with a special window on the world that enables us to see in ways we might not otherwise see and understand in ways we would not otherwise understand. It is a special, and uniquely human, way of thinking.
