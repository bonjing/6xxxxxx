Beyond any consideration
6 June 2009 | by michaelwotruba (Milano)

Two kids survive the massacre of their family, made by a group of vindicative Indians. The boy enlists in the confederated army, the girl is kidnapped by the Indians. Casually the two meet some years after; and he realizes the pointlessness of war and of the resentment for the American natives. One of the worst westerns ever. A quite invisible budget production. A story - conceived by the director and Bruno Vani (who later on will try to recycle himself in the porn industry (""Angelina superporno"", 1982) - so much melodramatic and politically correct to become grotesquely ridiculous. A terrible photography by Gaetano Valle - who was a valid camera operator - who pretend to defend himself telling that the movie was ""so much poor [...] just made to do something."" The direction of Alessandro Santini is completely non-existent; at the point that the movie seems to grow up by itself, degenerating frame by frame. Elsio Mancuso's score is just pretty annoying. In the end the acting is more than embarrassing and the cast made by totally unknowns - with the exception of a couple of names like Marco Zuanelli (""Once Upon a Time in the West"", 1968 by Sergio Leone) and the protagonist Jeff Cameron, stolen from the grade-Z pictures by Demofilo Fidani. It could have been a must-see for the bad movies connoisseurs, but the lack of action and the general ugliness of the plot induce more to sleeping and/or irritability, than to laughter, though unintentional. Frankly, it's truly difficult do something worse.
