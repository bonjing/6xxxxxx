he the menu showed the full length as on imdb. Probably the dvd-s were badly copied or the they were scratched in some parts. I can't remember were I got them from.
One of the dvd was so badly mastered or copied that I had to use makemkv to make mkv then encode. Directly from dvd couldn't encode it, nor play. This is it, I can't help it. cheers"
