While keeping an eye on young Doc Brown's proverbial date with scientific destiny, Marty and 1980's Doc must prevent gang boss Kid Tannen from wreaking havoc on Marty's family, and erasing his girlfriend from the future. 

Upon escaping from Kid Tannen the night of breaking Doc out of jail, Marty begins to fade away. Doc and Marty both read the paper from the next day to find that Marty's grandfather, Arthur McFly, was gunned down in Courthouse Square, proven by Marty's father vanishing from a photograph of him. They decide to take the DeLorean back to 4 pm that afternoon, however, Doc is stopped by a local police officer out on the road and detained. Marty, just barely avoiding capture, sneaks around the DeLorean to start the engine and takes off for the not-to-distant past. Marty cleverly avoids his other self, who has since convinced Doc's younger self to work on the drill. Marty notices a man, Zane, getting closer to the Courthouse. Marty interferes with Zane's plans, preventing Arthur from being shot. Instead, Arthur is given chloroform and taken to the basement of the Sisters of Mercy Soup Kitchen where he is interrogated about the subpoena. Marty hides in a box and is carried to the basement by Cue Ball. From the bar, Marty witnesses the interrogation. He takes out the gang members one by one and rescues a drowsy Arthur. Marty places Arthur in the DeLorean and they drive out to the sign where they parked the DeLorean before and, coincidentally at the right time, finds the Doc being held up by the Police Officer from earlier/later and Martys past self escaping in the DeLorean. Marty drives past the other DeLorean, picks up Doc, and escape. Arthur desires to leave Hill Valley, but Doc and Marty quickly stop him, concluding that he must get together with Sylvia in order to have George McFly and subsequently Marty born in the process. They convince Arthur that meeting Silvia is part of a sting operation to stop Kid. After, Doc and Marty head back to 1986.
