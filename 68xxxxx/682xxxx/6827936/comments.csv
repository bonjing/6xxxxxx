inst anything more than mediocre government peons.  either stop this bullshit congress is doing trying to cesor the internet in the us or you are only making paper cuts on godzilla.
sure cops and fbi are there to act like we are all guilty but the congrees that makes the laws are more corrupt than them,  show congress a little bit of that useful hacking ability because that crap they are trying to pass hurts us all"
