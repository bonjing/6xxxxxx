THE ORIGINAL KING OF ACTION RETURNS!

Los Angeles. Under attack by aliens intent on stealing our chicks for breeding. Duke Nukem springs into action dealing damage like only he can, making his â€œinsightfulâ€ comments along the way. If youâ€™ve never played a Duke game, this is your chance to see why heâ€™s been a fan favorite since 1991, with over 18 original Duke Nukem games since that time. Duke Nukem is not the typical faceless hero â€” heâ€™s an in-your-face hero who has a personality that doesnâ€™t quit. Yes, itâ€™s a B-movie plot, but thatâ€™s what makes it fun!

THE PRESS HAS ITS SAY!

Metacritic Player Rating: 9.4 of 10.

â€œItâ€™s the ultimate game for unleashing all your pent-up aggression. It is the most astonishing game weâ€™ve laid our eyes on for ages! In fact, it makes pretty much every PC game weâ€™ve ever seen â€“ â€œDoomâ€ included â€“ like slightly dull. Honestly!â€ â€” PC Gamer

â€œItâ€™s more inventive, and more entertaining, than â€œDoom.â€ I know theyâ€™ve had long enough to get it right (but so have many others, whoâ€™ve tried and failed).â€ â€” Computer and Video Games

â€œItâ€™s rare when a game comes along that really kicks your ass. With its free-flowing 3D action, over-the-top weapons, and ruthlessly attitudinal protagonist, Duke Nukem will have PC gamers worldwide rubbing their rumps with spine-tingling glee.â€ â€” Gamespot

â€œI couldnâ€™t stop laughing while playing this extremely enjoyable trip through what unfolds like a 1950â€²s science fiction B-movie: Space Aliens Invade Earth for Women!â€¦Duke Nukem has what most first-person shooters donâ€™t â€“ character!â€ â€” PC Gameworld
