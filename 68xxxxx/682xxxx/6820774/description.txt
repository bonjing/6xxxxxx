Game information
=================

Grotesque Tactics 2: Dungeons & Donuts is the successor to the celebrated
RPG-parody Grotesque Tactics. Experience an ironic story-driven RPG with
humorous dialogue-puzzles in the style of Monkey Island as well as
a strategic combat system, where your party members are controlled
simultaneously. Our story starts as the citizens of the Kingdom of Glory
celebrate their victory over the Dark Church. While in the catacombs of
their former enemies, their revelry is disturbed by a sudden
all-encompassing fog. The citizens wrapped by the fog disappear screaming
into nothing. Those that remain alive after the strange attack, barricade
themselves in the depths of the catacombs. As time passes, food becomes
scarce and the people of the Kingdom of Glory begin to realize that they
might all meet their demise. The heroic Knights of Glory, shady
mercenaries and the arrogant high elves band together into guilds in order
to survive and escape the dank catacombs. Unfortunately, the guilds are far
too concerned with their distaste for each other and are oblivious to the
awakening of dark forces in the dungeons below
