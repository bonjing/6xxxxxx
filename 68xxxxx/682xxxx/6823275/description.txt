	..:PLOT:..

	This is Off the grid, the main movie of the dvd. 

	Our new DVD, Off the Grid, is a collection of films from two years on 
	the road - fishing and filming in an assortment of locations around the world. 
	All of the films are connected by a common theme: they showcase people, places and 
	fish, that for our crew, were out of the ordinary. We basically tried to avoid as 
	many of the "Big Name" waters, hatches and fishing grounds as we could. We do visit 
	a few regions that are by no means off the beaten path, but try to show them in a different light.

	The DVD total run time is 171 minutes and contains:
	3 Featured Films
	12 Short Films
	Action Cut and Extras


	..:NOTES:..

	Catch'Em Love'Em Leave'Em
	C&R = Win for all.
