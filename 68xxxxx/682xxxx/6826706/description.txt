The Thieves flirt with the classic outlaw archetype, too, kicking off the record with the stomps, hallelujahs, and amens of â€œI Am What I Am.â€ They talk of â€œplayin sinner,â€ chasing demons and grabbing â€œthat devil by the tail.â€

Across horizonless landscapes of rolling snare drum, plinking guitars and piano, each member singing, the band constructs a sound that is distinctly Northwest: rock music infused with a Western twang and restrained, deliberate folk. These outlaws donâ€™t feel much like bad guys in spurs; theyâ€™re nomads, thinkers, worriers, muses â€” heartbreakers whoâ€™ve had theyâ€™re hearts broken and are wandering as far as they can from the pain.
