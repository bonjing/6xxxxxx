me any error you get, don't get upset about slow FPS, the game is capped to 30 Frames for its pc version as it was just converted from console to pc and not really remade for pc. 

The voice acting is brilliant, and the game is awesome, i've seeded so far 9 gb and i will keep seeding as long as people want to download, great game diffidently worth the wait, i think i'll buy it once the price drops too, their worth it. "
