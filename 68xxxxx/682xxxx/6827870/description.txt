The Prague Cemetery - Umberto Eco,epub,mobi,KK

Eco's new international bestseller features what was perhaps historyâ€™s first and biggest conspiracy theory, the supposed meeting of influential Jews in a cemetery in Prague to plot world domination, a hoax that had untold influence, contributing to worldwide anti-Semitism and Nazi genocide.
Ecoâ€™s 19th century shocker has an Italian, Captain Simonini, as the man responsible, the only fictional character in the book. The story involves Freemasons against Catholics, Garibaldi against the Bourbons, Russian spies, German double agents, murky murders, plotting prelates, black masses and orgies.
If all this sounds like a richly sensational read, you couldnâ€™t be more wrong. Although the book starts promisingly when Simonini finds a mysterious priest seemingly living a Jekyll and Hyde existence, the narrative is soon overwhelmed by obscure historical detail and repetitive situations where only the personnel changes.
Ecoâ€™s black humour is really a single joke that wears thin, and all in all this is a truly tedious slog, relieved only by its punctuation with engravings from the authorâ€™s private collection, each one leaving the reader counting the pages until the next.
