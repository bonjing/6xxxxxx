So, I thought I'd share this old jewel. =)

In FLAC and OGG, for your convenience. Take your pick.

I don't really know anything about the artists on this compilation. It's an LP, bought in 1993 in Barbados. It's soca, plain and simple! "Breakdown" was a HUGE hit back then. "One step forward and two step backward..."

This is music that cheers me up, any day of the week! At least Serenader's and Hawk's songs.

Ripped by yours truly. I'd appreciate any comments, at least if they're longer than 4 words...
