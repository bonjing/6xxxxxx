Come on! It's the brand new DVD from the 
king of the one-liners Tim Vine!

Tonnes of jokes and silly songs and crazy 
homemade props and still no sign of any satire. 
Yes the Joke-amotive is pulling into your living 
room now. He's wearing platform shoes and he's got 
the carriage of a lion. What a goody choo choos. Here 
he comes! It's the gag rush hour. His disembark is worse 
than his disembite. Be on your guard. Take a deep 
breath and hold on tight. This train Timinates here.
