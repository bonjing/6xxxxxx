"Chuck Versus The Business Trip" 

Chuck (Zachary Levi) and Sarah 
(Yvonne Strahovski) go undercover at 
a Buy More convention to hunt down an 
assassin whose mission is to take 
down the new Intersect. Meanwhile, 
Morgan (Joshua Gomez) must deal with 
the consequences of having the 
Intersect. At the Buy More, Jeff 
(Scott Krinsky) begins to show a very 
different side of himself.

Evolve...or die.
