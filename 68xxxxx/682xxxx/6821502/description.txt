Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Tuesday edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with author and historian Webster Tarpley from Syria. The United States, EU, Turkey and neighboring states have called for Syria's president al-Assad to step down as rumors and reports of violence continue to make headlines in the corporate media. Tarpley is the author of 9/11 Synthetic Terror: Made in USA and Obama: The Postmodern Coup - Making of a Manchurian Candidate. 

Alex also talks with libertarian activist and businessman Mark Hinkle. He is the National Chairman of the Libertarian Party. 

Alex talks about a pending Supreme Court ruling on Obamacare and the dissolution of the OWS movement as the NYPD removes protesters from Zuccotti Park on Manhattan.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
