"Insanity"

Harry must practice some conflict 
resolution when Oliver and Cassie butt 
heads over an emotional case: defending a 
schizophrenic 17-year-old who shot and 
killed three college students on campus. 
Meanwhile, Tommy represents an owner and 
operator of two businesses: a "Green 
Mortuary" for eco-friendly burial, and an 
organic produce market. Unfortunately, 
his two businesses overlap resulting in 
his vegetables being fertilized with the 
decomposing bodies. Elsewhere, Chunhua 
returns to ask Adam for help when her 
family's dry cleaning business is seized 
through eminent domain in an effort to 
"develop" the neighborhood.

Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
