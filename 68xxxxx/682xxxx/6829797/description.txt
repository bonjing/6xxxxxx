Around 12 unreleased Amy Winehouse songs are to stay locked up in the Island Records vault.

Her record label have spoken out about the dozen or so tracks and have said that they will never be heard by the public, as Winehouse herself did not want them released.

According to Island executives the tracks are impressive, but because of the late singerâ€™s wishes, the versions that the label owns will never see the light of day. Island boss Ted Cockle says that the unreleased song â€˜Procrastinateâ€™ is â€˜lovedâ€™ by everyone who hears it, but added in an interview with Music Week: "If you ever hear â€˜Procrastinateâ€™, you have my permission to come into my offices here in Kensington and fire me."

However, as the Guardian have pointed out, a version of the track, called â€˜Procrastinationâ€™, is already available to hear on YouTube and has had over a million views.
