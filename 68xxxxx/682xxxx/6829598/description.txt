12 12 "Into the Astral Plane"   November 18, 2011 (2011-11-18) 

The episode begins with the ThunderCats traveling to the elephants' village in the Thundertank. On the way, Lion-O, Cheetara, and Tygra try to explain what the astral planes are to Panthro. Lion-O says he "finally has the hang of" his sword, and Cheetara congratulates him and tells him it is why the sword chose him. Lion-O then states "And it's the reason (Cheetara) will pick me as well" 
to Tygra after Cheetara goes into the body of the tank. Tygra then mutters to himself that Lion-O doesn't deserve the sword or to have Cheetara. This leads into a flashback to when Tygra was very young and was a guard and attempts to help a young Cheetara find where the clerics reside, attempting to show that tygra has had affections for her for awhile. Cheetara gets to the building and is let in by Jaga, but he tells her to work on her patience before she tries to be a cleric again and kicks her out. The flashback ends and they stop near the village to find that it has been taken over by Grune's forces. Grune is meanwhile frustrated because he keeps getting told by the elephants that the stone is in the hut. He gives the elephants until the third moon rises to tell him how to get the stone. Meanwhile, Lion-O and Cheetara plan to wait until 
nightfall and use stealth to attack Grune and the lizards. Tygra, however thinks they should attack as soon as possible and use the tank. They eventually go with Lion-O and Cheetara's plan, which leads into another flashback that takes place right after the previous one ends. Cheetara is still sitting outside of the clerics' building. She suddenly smiles and Tygra thinks it is because he is there, but it is because Jaga had return and she wanted another chance to join the clerics. After several more days of rejection, Jaga decides that she has learned patience and welcomes her into the clerics (although she is asleep). The flashback ends, showing the ThunderCats in a field adjacent to the village. Lion-O then talks to Cheetara about Tygra's jealousy, in which she responds he is jealous because Lion-O was always better than him. Snarf runs up to the Lizards guarding the village and creates a diversion, leading them straight into Panthro. The fighting soon begins. During the fight, WilyKit and WilyKat go to check on the elephants, who notice WilyKit and unintentionally blow their stealth operation. Grune then forces the cats to drop all of their weapons and tell him where the stone is. Lion-O agrees to show him where it is in order to save the elephants, and Tygra disappears, assumingly trying to do something that 
outshines Lion-O and impresses Cheetara. Lion-O opens up the gate to the astral plane with the Sword of Omens. Grune then takes the sword and tells his forces to kill the ThunderCats and the Elephants. Tygra returns in the Thundertank and rescues the cats and elephants, though his main goal was to outdo Lion-O. Lion-O then steals the sword back and Grune and his forces abandon the village. Lion-O then prepares to enter the astral plane. Cheetara wishes him luck and kisses him, leading Tygra to get angry and insist that he go in the gate as well. 
Lion-O barely agrees, and lets Tygra enter first. Before Lion-O enters, Anet warns him that Tygra will betray him by the next evening. After Lion-O enters, Mumm-Ra (then disguised as a crow) goes through the gate as well.
