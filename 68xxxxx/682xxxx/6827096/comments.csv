this morning dozen of torrents have been uploaded by your AKA and each one of dem had thousands seeds/peers after half an hour it has been uploaded - 

Did you upload them ? all had been deleted right now  but IF yuh had not uploading them i suggest YOU CHANGE your password on TPB to make sure your account doesn't get hacked.

A strong password would look like this :

abC%123%dEf%456%GHi  small/big letters/symbols and numbers.

Let me know plz .

Jah bless"
