* Plot :


The Heraklion King of Crete, Hyperion (Mickey Rourke), declares war on Olympus after the Gods fail to answer his prayers to save his family from illness, and starts searching for the Epirus Bow, a powerful weapon created by the God of War Ares (Daniel Sharman), which he intends to use to release the Titans from Mount Tartarus and destroy the gods.

Hyperion attacks several holy places in search of the Epirus Bow, and after kidnapping a virgin oracle priestess called Phaedra (Freida Pinto) to help him, advances towards a nearby village, where the young Theseus (Henry Cavill) lives with his mother. Theseus\' mother conceived him after being raped, and he is thus considered a bastard and prevented from evacuating the village with its other inhabitants by the soldier Lysander (Joseph Morgan). Theseus defeats him in combat, which he was taught by an old man (John Hurt), and Lysander is discharged by his commanding officer. Infuriated, he offers his services to Hyperion.
