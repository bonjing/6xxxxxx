The More than Complete DC-Now More Completerer!

This forty-sixth alphabetical installment is: DC from Swe-Td

What's This?
     It's a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.
       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those "Pre-DC" comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some "Post DC" comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c.875-885gb in total. It will take as long as it takes. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.

=================================
We are definitely in the home stretch now.

After this torrent, i.e. part 46, there are about 155-160gb to go in the projected 10 remaining torrents.

741gb Done so far

c. 920gb projected total

Projected remaining torrents and approximate file sizes. Several of these still have significant work needed and the size could go up or down. I'm betting on down for the last 3.

17G	47	Te-Tn
17G	48	To-Unk
18G	49	Unl-Wes
17G	50	Wet-Wn
14G	51	Wonder Woman, Wonder Girl
16G	52	Wor-Wq
14G	53	Wr-Z
17G	54	Fill Torent a-b
14G	55	Fill Torent c-i
16G	56	Fill Torent j-z

        And then goodbye to uploading, and this time, I mean it. There will be no nagging sense of incompleteness to bring me back as there was after the original MTCDC series. When this is over, I'm out of here. I may even drop the joshua13 identity entirely and do whatever else I still do on the internet as (name withheld). My accounts on torrent sites would still exist to preserve the torrents, but I would never log in to them.

     Tarzan got singled out to have everything I could find tossed in. I haven't always done for characters that have a long history with many publishers out of size concerns. So some times you just got a sampling. Phantom is the outstanding example of that. There is just a huge amount of scanned Phantom. I shared over 33gb in 3 torrents back in july 2009 and those appear to be still seeded according to thetorrent site. It wasn't actually all Phantom. There is a long running Indian comic that prints the adventures of The Phantom, Mandrake The Magician and others and I did not seperate out just the Phantom from that.

Here's links to the Phantom -  which was complete at the time and included newly scanned and never before torrented items. There have been comics printed and scanned since then.

Since TPB does not like links to other torrent sites, minus signs were added to fool the censor bot.

  


     I call doing this "The treatment". Star Trek got it, I've done other. Today Tarzan gets "the Treatment". There are probably a few Tarzan comics that have been scanned that I don't have, and there may plenty more that have yet to be scanned, but this is a pretty good set.
     I watched a lot of Tarzan movies and TV shows as kid, that's probably why I feel a soft spot for him. He remains a well known figure around the world. He's not at his height of popularity right now, but he's not out yet. You never know when he might make a comeback in the movies, TV or comics. Actually I am a bit surprised that there hasn't been a Hollywood movie about him in so long. They have been so interested in remakes and sequels, that I'd think they'd give this guy another go round. Last live action English language theatrical movie appears to have been in 1998, and that was the first since 1984. There were the Disney animated films, fine for what they are, but not what I'm talking about
     Where's that"gritty reboot" where Tarzan is "going all Batman" on poachers and terrorists in Africa? Meanwhile he's getting divorced from Jane after an affair with a Mossad agent he worked with fighting a terrorist plot that threatened gorillas as a side effect, and is struggling with a booze and cocaine habit - but he's been clean for 6 months. Some people think he's a loose cannon, but many see him as a genuine hero. Meanwhile "Cheetah" would probably not be in this, but if he were he'd  be the product of an unethical genetic experiment by some evil scientist, probably first step in a project aimed at creating animal human hybrid soldiers down the road They would totally steal as much from Planet of the Apes as they could, and any other recent successful movie. He'd have learned how to fire guns and plant explosives thanks to his enhanced intelligence, and he'd be waging war on poachers who kill Chimpanzees and others who destroy habitat Chimpanzees need. Estranged from Tarzan because of his embracement of extreme violence and possibly terroristic tactics in defense of animals, they come together once again in this movie to fight a threat so big, so horrible in it's conception, we can't reveal it for fear the very thought would make you whimper like an injured puppy. Plus I may want to sell this movie idea to Hollywood. We could use that line in the trailer voice-over.
