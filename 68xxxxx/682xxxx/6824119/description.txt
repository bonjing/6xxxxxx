"Educated Guess" 

A man in custody at a mental hospital claims to 
have witnessed a rape in a break room. Despite 
the witness' shaky credibility the SVU begins an 
investigation, but the alleged victim, Gia Eskas, 
denies being assaulted. Detectives Benson and 
Rollins struggle to piece together what really 
happened to this young woman, especially when her 
aunt and mother say Gia has been repeatedly 
institutionalized, and has cried rape in the 
past.
