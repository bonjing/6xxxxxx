Winner - 7 Academy awards including Best Picture

The Sting is one of Hollywood's best productions in family entertainment
in a spirit of jolly great fun I suppose.

In actual fact we see that some are addicted to gambling, a complete abandonment
of human reason and sanity being what they are playing at - tut! tut! Then again
some simply like being in on a "con" using excuses as revenge or whatever as mainly
they need to dress up their ill considered motives perhaps. After all why try to get even with a mobster if you're the guy that stole from him in the first place?
(As long as the rules are within what you'd expect I suppose)

In any event, enjoy this family sorta entertainment from the great Mr. Paul
Newman and Sir Robert Redford equally!
