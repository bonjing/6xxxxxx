The legend that inspired Bruce Lee's "Fist of Fury"
Legend of a Fighter focuses around the legendary Chinese hero Fok Yun Gap (known as Huo Yuan Chia in Fist of Fury) - the man who dispelled the Chinese 'Sick Man of Asia' image the Japanese so firmly believed in at the time this film is set. Taking elements of Snake in the Eagles Shadow and fusing them with that of Fist of Fury the take presented here on Fok Yun Gap sees him begin life as a mere shadow of his later self. Reprimanded for being the weak son by his father (a martial arts expert) Yun Gap is refused to be taught the Martial Arts of his family but is instead taken under the wing of his Japanese school tutor, Chiang Ho San, who secretly trains him. Later Fok Yun Gap reveals his accomplishments to his ageing father and becomes the representative for his families martial arts school which leads to him becoming known as the finest Martial Arts master in China. Once the Japanese get wind of this they deploy their finest fighter to crush this Chinese threat in what is a cruel twist of fate for Fok Yun Gap.
