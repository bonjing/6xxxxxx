 :::::[ PLOT SUMMARY ]:::::
 
                                                                       
   The seaside city of Kaitan is not a happy place ‼ the shipyard is   
   downsizing due to poor economic conditions, and the city's          
   residents are about to face another harsh northern winter.          
   Sketches of Kaitan City offers five of the many stories             
   concurrently happening in this city - A shipyard worker who has     
   lost his job and can't afford to take care of his younger sister,   
   an old woman who refuses to give up her home for redevelopment      
   facing forced eviction, a planetarium owner whose relationship      
   with his family is quickly deteriorating, a young owner of a gas    
   cylinder company with plenty to be frustrated about, and a          
   streetcar driver whose only son refuses to visit him on a trip      
   home from Tokyo. These characters may not seem like they have much  
   to celebrate about on this New Year's Eve, but they each discover   
   their own way to continue their lives.
