This is the upcoming Kate Bush CD in uncompressed .WAV format.It is not an upconversion from mp3 as I'm sure you'll agree once you hear it on a half decent system.It is standard 16 bit / 41 KHz stereo which will play on all home CD players once burnt to CD.

It is for people with older CD/DVD players or car stereos that can't play mp3's or just for audiophiles who like lovely music on good HI-FI's.

When burning remember NOT to include the .m3u playlist file - that is only for PC's and certain mp3 players that can handle WAV files.
