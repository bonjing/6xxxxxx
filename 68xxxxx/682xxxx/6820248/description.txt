If youâ€™re an experienced programmer willing to crunch data, this concise guide will show you how to use machine learning to work with email. Youâ€™ll learn how to write algorithms that automatically sort and redirect email based on statistical patterns. Authors Drew Conway and John Myles White approach the process in a practical fashion, using a case-study driven approach rather than a traditional math-heavy presentation.

This book also includes a short tutorial on using the popular R language to manipulate and analyze data. Youâ€™ll get clear examples for analyzing sample data and writing machine learning programs with R.
Mine email content with R functions, using a collection of sample files
Analyze the data and use the results to write a Bayesian spam classifier
Rank email by importance, using factors such as thread activity
Use your email ranking analysis to write a priority inbox program
Test your classifier and priority inbox with a separate email sample set
