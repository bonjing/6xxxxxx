After installing, the software I missed the connection to my built-in webcam. A message says"" can't connect to HP 101 webcam"" . When I verify the driver through Device Manager, it says"" This driver works perfectly"" When I update the driver it says"" you have the latest update"". The problem is that the webcam doesn't ignite (doesn't work for short). Have u an idea?"
