ChemDraw Ultra 12.0.3 for Macintosh

The long awaited version which allows double-clicking files to open them (dah!) and more importantly, allows two-way editing of schemes pasted in Word (v14.0.2 or higher) files.

ChemDraw Ultra is an outstanding package for chemical structure drawing and editing.

The Document Settings feature gives this package an edge when preparing chemical schemes for manuscripts that will be published. The graphics prepared in ChemDraw Ultra insures a professional and neat appearance.

ChemDraw Ultra allows you to import a variety of image formats that may be edited or modified as needed, including CML, GIF, BMP, JPEG, ISIS, MDL, TIFF and Galactic and Jcamp spectra files. This capability of ChemDraw avoids having to create and import or export new images from or to several different graphics systems in order to create or to edit an existing drawing.

System Requirements:Mac OS X 10.4 PowerPC, Mac OS X 10.4 Intel, Mac OS X 10.5 PowerPC/Intel;
