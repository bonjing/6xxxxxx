Providing the medical practitioner with a broad scientific understanding, this book discusses the causative organism, its requisite ecosystem, disease epidemiology, host-Borrelia interactions, diagnostic testing, clinical manifestations, therapeutic options, and long term prognosis. It explicitly reviews both the basic biology of the infection and practical clinical aspects, linking the two to demonstrate what is and is not attributable to this infection. It is an authoritative guide for medics and researchers involved with diagnosing and treating Lyme, covering biology, epidemiology and therapeutics.
