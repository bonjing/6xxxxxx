::Plot::
The story is all about the misuse of the social networking like Facebook and gives a very good message in the end. There are two groups in a college. The first group consists of Rahul (Nishant Dahiya) and Malvika (Tara Dsouza), who have good looks and great fan following in their college. Vishal (Saqib Saleem) and Preity (Saba Azad) form the second group who are creatively brilliant but are shy in expressing their views at public forums. Vishal is a good writer who pens lyrics for rockstar pal Rahul. Girls are crazy about Rahul, but Rahul seems indifferent towards them. Preity, good at photography, happens to be friends with Malvika.
