Review:

Sounding like a modern-day answer to Lynyrd Skynyrd or a funkier Allman Brothers, Tennessee's Screamin' Cheetah Wheelies' third album finds them exploring new lyrical themes and new musical turf. Produced by Paul Ebersold, who masterminded their debut disc, the band adds swirling keyboard work from labelmates Sonia Dada's Chris Cameron, even utilizing steel guitar on a couple of tracks. As always, the loud'n'proud shouting vocals of singer Mike Farris is the centerpiece on tunes like"Dragon Park," "Boogie King," "Groove Me," "It Ain't Nothing" and "Halcyon Days." On a lighter musical note, the album closer "Grace (Write Me)" and the largely autobiographical "Dandy Lion" are the lyrical high points of this interesting record. A rousing, funky cover of Dr. John's "Right Place, Wrong Time" is just the icing on the cake to a record that stylistically falls somewhere between the groups' two preceding albums, but one that simultaneously breaks new ground as well.

"Big Wheel", released in 1998, contained "Standing In The Sun" and "Boogie King", a rollick as at home in the mosh pit as it is cruising the local drag. In addition, "Boogie King" was featured on the soundtrack of the movie Bride of Chucky. Also, "Right Place, Wrong Time" was featured on "The Malcom in the Middle" episode "Home Alone 4", as well as "Songs from Malcolm in the Middle", the soundtrack to the television series which was released on November 21, 2000.
