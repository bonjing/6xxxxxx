Amma Ariyan (Malayalam: à´…à´®àµà´® à´…à´±à´¿à´¯à´¾à´¨àµâ€, translation: For the Information of My Mother) is a 1986 Malayalam film directed by avant-garde filmmaker John Abraham.

The story revolves around the incidents following the death of a young Naxalite, upon whose death his friends travel to the village where his mother lives to inform her of the death of her only son.

The film is made in a documentary style. As a part of the technique of intertwining fact and fiction, the film maker shot many actual leftist political strikes that took place in Kerala during that time.

Amma Ariyan is considered to be a complex movie. Since its release in 1986, critics have read several layers of meaning in its story.

The incidents that led to the production of Amma Ariyan are striking. A group of young friends of John Abraham who wanted to make it into a â€œpeople\'s movieâ€, constituted the Odessa Collective, aiming at production and exhibition of good cinema with active participation of the general public, without the intervention of market forces.

They raised money for the film by traveling from village to village and house to house, beating drums, singing and putting up skits and short plays at street corners and asking for contributions for the \'people\'s cinema\'. They collected the fund needed for the production of a movie. It was Odessa\'s first film and John\'s last Amma Ariyan re-wrote all the conventions of filmmaking.
