Like many other Need for Speed games, all of your racing will take place on the streets of a fictitious open-world city--here it\'s the Tri-City Bay area. You\'ll start with a lousy vehicle, but it won\'t be long before you\'re able to snag a pink slip to a nicer ride. As you progress you\'ll earn cash, which can be used to unlock (50+) new vehicles from manufacturers such as Nissan, Dodge, Cadillac, Ford, Porsche, Lamborghini, BMW, Aston Martin, Mitsubishi, and more. If you\'re into tuning individual aspects of your ride or purchasing individual parts you can do that, but if you\'re not into tinkering you can purchase an upgrade package and be on your way.
