 early days of hdtv, when it was called thor) HD group and one of the best. This is no scene fast encode.
As for bitrate, it is not really relevant. It is as is needed to be for the encode to be very close to transparency compared to the source. Which can vary greatly from movie to movie. 

And 1.5 mbit is the bitrate for audio only, as it sais. The video is 17 mbit.
