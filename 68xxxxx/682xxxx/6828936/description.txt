Disc One centers on reissued studio sessions in trio and quartet format. At the piano, Monk thrills with his use of unique tone clusters and devil-may-care keyboard rants. Thereâ€™s always a high level of energy, even though the tempo varies from a slow and deliberate â€œPannonicaâ€ to a jumpinâ€™ and jivinâ€™ â€œIn Walked Bud.â€ Jon Hendricks parades both lyrics and scat singing proudly around the classic tune.
Disc Two combines big bands in both studio and live sessions with solo piano and quartet segments in concert. Monkâ€™s piano work stands apart as powerfully percussive and full of vigor. The take presented here of â€œBlue Monkâ€ with studio big band swings with passion and heats up considerably. Soloist Rouse is in fine form. Itâ€™s a different take than that released in 1994 on the CD reissue of Monkâ€™s Blues. From a 1967 solo piano concert performance in Puebla, Mexico, Monk performs â€œDonâ€™t Blame Meâ€ with deliberately slow and meaningful expression. â€œI Mean Youâ€ is from Columbiaâ€™s 1963 LP Big Band And Quartet In Concert, also released on CD in â€™94 by Sony. Thad Jones, Charlie Rouse, Frankie Dunlop and Phil Woods contribute exciting solos alongside Monkâ€™s fresh performance.
Disc Three offers live Monk performances in concert and club settings, with both small and large ensembles. At the Newport Jazz Festival with Pee Wee Russell, and at the Monterey Jazz Festival with a nonet, Monk and Rouse swing heartily. In Stockholm, Monk is with a small ensemble that includes Johnny Griffin, Phil Woods and Ray Copeland. At the It club in Los Angeles, heâ€™s in vintage form with Rouse, Larry Gales and Ben Riley.
