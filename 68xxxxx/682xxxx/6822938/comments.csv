,muckymucks,2011-12-08T09:53Z,Many thanks for the up. I'm following Wonder Woman for the first time so it's a good change of pace to see how her character is different in Justice League and her own title. I love the interactions between the characters. They're still strangers to each and treat each other with suspicion but respect (sort of). Issue 4 introduces a new team member. He's not the most popular but I haven't really given him a chance either. Let's see how it turns out. If anything just for the art. Wow! Jim Lee does some amazing work.
