For the first time ever, comedy legend 
John Cleese brings his unique comedic 
perspective to DVD in John Cleese Live: 
The Alimony Tour.

Best known for his part in 'Monty Python's 
Flying Circus' and as Basil Fawlty in 'Fawlty 
Towers,' John Cleese draws on his many years in 
the limelight as well as some of his own personal 
interests. In Cleese's very own words: "it is an 
evening of well honed anecdotes, psychoanalytical 
tit-bits and unprovoked attacks on former colleagues, 
especially Michael Palin." 

Cleese has achieved a lot in his career which 
started as a sketch writer for BBC Radio's Dick 
Emery Show and then The Frost Report. After this 
stardom beckoned, and Monty Python was created 
with Cleese co-writing and starring in four 
series and three films. He went on to achieve 
further great success as the neurotic hotel 
manager Basil Fawlty in Fawlty Towers, which he 
co-wrote with then wife Connie Booth. After huge 
UK success John went on to crack the USA with A 
Fish Called Wanda (which he wrote and starred in 
with Jamie Lee Curtis). The late 1990s saw the 
unstoppable Mr Cleese appear in Bond movie The World 
is Not Enough and later Die Another Day. From writing 
to starring in plays, musicals, theatrical and comedy 
productions, to films and sitcoms, Cleese has done it all, 
and now it's time for him to tell you about his 
jam-packed life.
