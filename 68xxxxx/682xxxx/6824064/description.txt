"The Code War"

Angie, Max's high school girlfriend whom he 
dated before he figured out he was gay, moves 
back to town, and her arrival affects 
everyone: Penny is jealous of her (and then 
goes overboard befriending her); Alex 
develops her odd crush on Max; but the 
strangest reaction of all is from Max, who 
declares a "code war" when Dave and Angie 
date. Meanwhile, when Jane finds out Brad 
has a "work wife," she decides to get 
herself a "work husband" and sets her sights 
on the slightly unhinged head of Human 
Resources.
