To all appearances set in an anonymous South-American republic, the film is a moving story of the carceral system that Foucault could have used to illustrate his point. The word "ghost" refers here to a prisoner, ironically named JosÃ© Real, who gets his day of freedom after having served 10 years in prison. He is accompanied on the outside by an agent instructed to shoot at any sign of attempt to escape. Interwoven with the personal story of the prisoner is the plight of an oil town, as thick with oil wells as a metropolis with sky scrapers.
