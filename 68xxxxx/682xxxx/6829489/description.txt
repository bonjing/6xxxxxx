    Back by popular demand, this is a collection of soundbites I took from Family Guy a couple years ago when I was doing a live net radio show, to be placed in between songs for a nice blend to the heavy metal I played....fuck commercials, I did it because I liked it, not to get paid.

Bits that are hilarious from the show without needing visuals, these are a great addition to any playlist, whether sitting around with friends partying or anything else.

    I created these, even the ones that have been floating around other torrent sites....but if you get them from anywhere else they are a couple years old and I cannot guarantee them to be quality or bug-free because I only posted them here on TPB, and I don't know what others may have done to them before they re-posted them somewhere else. However, if you get them HERE only on TPB from me these soundbites are 100%

(As I stated before, the sound is generally leveled even across all bits, but making them at 3-4am there are some that are louder or more quiet than others, mainly in part Too, but get that TOO :D)

Enjoy
