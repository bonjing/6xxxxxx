::Plot::
The film opens with a man driving down a silent road with a cage. He meets up with another man, John, who wants to buy the tiger off of him, in hope to create a "Safari Ranch" including many other animals. He doesn't believe the tiger is dangerous and exciting enough, but when the seller tells him a gruesome story about the tiger, John immediately offers the full asking price for the tiger. His stepdaughter, Kelly (Briana Evigan), has an autistic brother, Tom, who she has taken to a special hospital in order for him to get the care he needs while she is at college. However, Kelly's check is rejected so she phones her bank, and is informed that John withdrew all the money from her account, claiming it is rightfully his despite it being for Tom's care.
