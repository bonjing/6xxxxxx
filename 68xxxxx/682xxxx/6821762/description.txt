"Burt's Parents"

Jimmy, Virginia, Burt, Sabrina, Maw Maw and 
Hope borrow a house to impress Burt's 
wealthy parents (guest stars Lee Majors and 
Shirley Jones) who have decided at the last 
minute to celebrate Thanksgiving with the 
family. Things get interesting when the 
real homeowners return early, and Burt's 
folks get a taste of what life is really 
like for Burt and Virginia.

18/Slower
Evolve...or die.

Enjoy :)
