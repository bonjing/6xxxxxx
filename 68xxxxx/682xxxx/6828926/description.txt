Digitally remastered deluxe two CD edition of the Rolling Stones' 1978 masterpiece including a bonus disc of previously unreleased recordings taped during the Some Girls sessions. A fresh, uncompromising attempt to incorporate then-modern pop techniques into the band's familiar sound, Some Girls opens with the Disco sass of "Miss You" and closes with the self-destructive punk of "Shattered." In between, you have an album that solidified their reputation as the world's greatest Rock 'n' Roll band. Some may cite Exile On Main Street as their finest '70s moment, but Some Girls is it's equal, if not a smidgen more exciting.
