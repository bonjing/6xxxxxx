n with the keygen would work at updating VMware Fusion 4.0.1 to 4.1.1, as it worked already for myself at updating from my previous version of 4.0 up to 4.0.1.

But I would like to give the following advice : VMware 4.0.1 release is an EXCEPTION TO THE RULE OF VIRLUALIZING MACHINES (VMWare and Parallels Desktop), not to allow virtualization of MAC ON MAC (I mean of LEOPARD or SNOW LEOPARD on LION host) but using the SERVER edition of those OS, from the fact it enables you instead to virtualize CLIENT editions of Leopard or Snow Leopard on Lion host. That so-called 'mistake' from VMware developers, violating Apple's rules, stirred up immediate warning from Apple, so that an update of VMware Fusion 4.0.1 is already released (4.1.1) correcting the said 'mistake' in disallowing the virtualization of CLIENT editions of Leopard or Snow Leopard OS on Lion host, and forcing back to use SERVER versions.

If you are interested in virtualizing on Lion those previous versions of Mac OS X, which support the emulation layer called 'Rosetta' enabling to run PPC apps not susceptible to be updated to intel versions, emulation layer dropped down by Lion, I would give the advice of NOT UPDATING that release of WMware Fusion 4.0.1 to 4.1.1 which will cancel the capacity of viritualizing CLIENT editions of Leopard or Snow Leopard. But, instead, of waiting for an independent download of VMware Fusion 4.1.1 to be proposed at TPB. So that you can install that further release IN PARALLEL of 4.0.1 in your Application folder, without replacing the previous one (the actual license key being awaited to work as well for that update)."
