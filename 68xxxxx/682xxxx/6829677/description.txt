Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas - Introduced by Judy Garland in the 1944 
MGM musical Meet Me in St. Louis, Cliff covered this Christmas classic in 2003

Mistletoe And Wine - Originally performed as part of the musical Scraps in 1976, 
this is Cliff's 99th single and became his 12th UK number one single, spending 
four weeks at the top in December 1988.

Saviourâ€™s Day - Written by Chris Eaton and produced by Cliff Richard and Paul Moessl, 
"Saviour's Day" was the 13th UK number-one single for Cliff and his third Christmas 
number one.

White Christmas - An Irving Berlin song reminiscing about an old-fashioned Christmas 
setting written in around 1940. Here Cliff covers this all-time favourite.

The Christmas Song - A superb cover of this classic - written in 1944 by musician, 
composer, and vocalist Mel TormÃ© and Bob Wells. According to TormÃ©, the song was 
written during a blistering hot summer.

Winter Wonderland - "Winter Wonderland" is a winter song, popularly treated as a 
Christmas time pop standard, written in 1934 by Felix Bernard (composer) and Richard B. 
Smith (lyricist). Through the decades it has been recorded by over 150 different artists. 
Cliffâ€™s rendition is superb.

Let It Snow - Written in July 1945 in Hollywood and one of the best-selling songs of 
all time, Cliff sings beautifully on this catchy Christmas tune.

The Millennium Prayer - A 1999 charity single by Cliff Richard. The song features 
Richard singing the words of the Lord's Prayer to the tune of "Auld Lang Syne".

Maryâ€™s Boy Child - A 1956 Christmas song, written by Jester Hairston, Cliff presents 
this often-used carol with an interesting new approach.

When A Child Is Born - The original melody was "Soleado", a tune from 1972 by 
Ciro Dammicco (alias Zacar), composer for the Italian group Daniel Santecruz Ensemble. 
The English language lyrics were written later by Fred Jay.
