I've used GOM for about 3 days some time last year, uninstalled it, and will never install it again.
Don't believe the hype!

This might explain why some people had a no audio issue with that Ghost Hunters Live 720p I released. - I told them to use VLC but their stubborn jackass mentality thought for sure GOM was the best player when it clearly is NOT.

The BEST all-in-one media player that truly is easy and powerful is VLC.

For even more power in fine tuning and codec settings the best route to go is the K-Lite bundle which comes with Media Player Classic."
