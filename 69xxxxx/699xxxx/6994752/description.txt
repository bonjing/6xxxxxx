Infernal Restraint\Fixated  Sister Dee   + Pics



Sister Dee has missed us so much. The feeling of cold iron on her body, the shock of Fifty-thousand volts of electricity running through her. It is how PD shows her how much he cares. Every time she screams it is a sign of her appreciation for his affection. Every time he hurts her it is to reinforce that message. They say absence makes the heart grow fonder. If she stays away much longer next time who knows what her welcome home will be like.
