Robin Leonard Trower (born 9 March 1945) known professionally as Robin Trower, is an English rock 
guitarist who achieved success with Procol Harum during the 1960s, and then again as the bandleader 
of his own power trio.

Trower was born in Catford, South East London, England and grew up in the seaside resort of 
Southend-on-Sea, Essex. In 1962, Trower formed a group that became The Paramounts, later including 
fellow Southend High School pupil Gary Brooker. The Paramounts disbanded in 1966 to pursue individual 
projects. During this time, Trower created a local three-piece band called 'The Jam' 
(not to be confused with the later group with Paul Weller) Trower then joined Brooker's new band 
Procol Harum following the success of their debut single "A Whiter Shade of Pale" in 1967, remaining 
with them until 1971 and appearing on Procol Harum's first five albums.
