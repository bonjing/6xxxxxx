Synopsis:

At a large country estate in the late 19th Century, a blind young man who rules his home through fear and intimidation 
clashes with the headstrong woman who has been hired to read to him and refuses to bend to his tyranny in director 
Tamar van den Drop\'s tempestuous period romance. Ruben (Joren Seldeslachts) lives in his family\'s sprawling country 
mansion along with his mother and the pair\'s substantial household staff. What he lacks in sight, Ruben more than makes 
up for in rage, and lately his tantrums have grown more threatening than ever. Arriving into Ruben\'s chaotic life of fear 
and bitterness is the emotionally scarred Marie (Halina Reijn). Marie loves books more than anything else, but believes 
herself to be physically repulsive as a result of her emotionally traumatic childhood. Reading to a blind man seems to be 
the perfect job for Marie since she won\'t have to be self-conscious about her looks. Yet despite her insecurities Marie is 
just as strong-willed as Ruben. Marie and Ruben are both outsiders, and as the winter rolls in Marie keeps turning the 
pages - her temperamental employer gradually warming to her soothing voice and soulful insight. Marie too begins to gain a 
profound affection for the misunderstood Ruben, but their unlikely bond is about to be challenged by the arrival of a doctor 
who claims that Ruben\'s sight can be restored thanks to breakthrough advances in modern science. Now, as Ruben begins to glow 
at the prospect of finally placing a face to the voice he holds so dear, Marie goes into a panic fearing that their love will 
die the moment he lays eyes on her.
