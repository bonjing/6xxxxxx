Disraeli Gears is the second album by British supergroup Cream. It was released in November 1967 
and went on to reach #5 on the UK Albums Chart. It was also their American breakthrough, becoming 
a massive seller there in 1968, reaching #4 on the American charts. The album features the two 
singles "Strange Brew" and "Sunshine of Your Love".

The title of the album is a mondegreen based on an inside joke. Eric Clapton had been thinking of 
buying a racing bicycle and was discussing it with Ginger Baker, when a roadie named Mick Turner 
commented, "it's got them Disraeli Gears", meaning to say "derailleur gears," but instead alluding 
to 19th Century British Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli. The band thought this was hilarious, and 
decided that it should be the title of their next album. Had it not been for Mick's turn of phrase, 
the album would simply have been titled "Cream."

The original 11-track album was remastered in 1998, and then subsequently released as a two-disc 
Deluxe Edition in 2004.

In 2003 the album was ranked number 112 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums 
of All Time. VH1 also named it their 87th greatest album of all time in 2001.
