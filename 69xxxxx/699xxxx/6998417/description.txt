Set in a detention camp in an America of the near-future, Punishment Parkâ€™s pseudo-documentary style (continuing Watkinsâ€™ subversive innovations with Culloden and The War Game) places a British film crew amongst a group of young students and minor dissidents who have opted to spend three days in â€˜Bear Mountain Punishment Parkâ€™. The detainees, rather than accept lengthy jail sentences for their â€˜crimesâ€™, gamble their freedom on an attempt to reach an American flag â€” on foot and without water â€” through the searing heat of the desert. The pursuit of Group 637 â€” a lethal, one-sided game of cat-and-mouse with a squad of heavily armed police and National Guardsmen â€” is contrasted with the corrupt trial of Group 638 by a quasi-judicial tribunal.
