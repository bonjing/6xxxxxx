This version corrects the missing frames (skipping) in the audio stream. A millisecond of the commercial breaks remain, but it's nothing too difficult to remove yourself.

This is a 6 megabit AVC file. If your CPU isn't powerful enough, it might stutter or lose a/v sync. Try enabling frame skipping, hardware decoding, and disabling post-processing and deblocking. If VLC doesn't work, then try GOM Player (my favorite) or KMPlayer. If using players that use external codecs, make sure your codecs and splitters are at least a couple months old.

This can be enjoyed immediately or can be filtered and compressed.

Suggested filtering (for encoders):
	IVTC (TFF) to replace combed frames with their progressive version, if available.
	Decimate to step the video down to 23.976fps, its original frame rate.
	YADIF to remove any remaining combed frames.
	Crop to remove the small black borders.
	Resize back to 1080x1920 or shrink to 720x1280.
	Levels (in low 16, in high 250 RGB or Y) to return pure black/white and proper colors for PC viewing.
	Minor deblocker.
	Temporal smoothing to eliminate some hf psychovisual noise.
	Normalize the audio stream.
