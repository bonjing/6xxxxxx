Chris.Moyles.Quiz.Night.S05E08.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 173MB]

[/b][/color] Channel 4 has got the fabulous Chris Moyles on board to host a brand new quiz show - and he's putting up his own possessions as prizes! Chris will pit his wits against the celebrity guests each week in an attempt to keep hold of his stuff, otherwise his flat will begin to look rather empty...

While the winner takes a bit of Chris' home, er, home, the loser will have to close out the show with a specially chosen karaoke song - accompanied by an eight-piece, all-female big band.
With personal possessions and karaoke embarrassment on national telly at stake, tension will be high.

The quiz is hosted by a different celebrity guest who will set the questions for the show, but with the master of mischief Moyles at the helm, expect energy and exuberance on tap.
