Merge is the visual file comparison (diff), merging and folder synchronization application from Araxis. Use it to compare and merge source code, web pages, XML and other text files with native application performance. Directly open and compare the text from Microsoft Office (Word and Excel), OpenDocument, PDF and RTF files. Compare images and binary files. Synchronize folders. Perform code reviews and audits. Work with folder hierarchies containing thousands of files. Merge integrates with many SCM (version control) systems and other applications.

At the time of writing, Araxis tests and supports Merge for Mac OS X on the following platforms:
Mac OS X v10.7 Lion (preliminary support tested with Developer Preview 4 + update)
Mac OS X v10.6.7 Snow Leopard (32-bit and 64-bit)

The following platforms are also expected to work and supported with a separate setup disk image, but are no longer subject to routine release testing:
Mac OS X v10.5.8 Leopard (32-bit and 64-bit, PowerPC and Intel Universal binary)

Merge is no longer supported on Mac OS X v10.4 Tiger. Customers may, of course, continue to use an older version of Merge (2009.3793 or earlier) that works with that platform.

System Requirements: 

Intel Mac, OS X.6 or greater
