*Note1= A Forgotten single, it was split with a track from Jesus Lizard (which I omitted), this is the real version and not a copy from the box set. The box set version has the lighter clicks removed.

**Note2= I extracted the audio from the DVD, and included noth, audio, and video rip. Sound quality is somewhat inconsistent. But mostly low quality, given the equipment used in that time period.

***Note3= I only included the 3 additional tracks not in the full box as the rest would be redundant content.

Enjoy and please seed!
