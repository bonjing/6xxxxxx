These were aquired by ordering bootlegs from magazines. for example, I had a legit studio recording of, ""help me I'm hungry"". different (better quality). All these songs may be lost forever if not put on the internet.  Thank you for this, awesome collection. But I have seen and heard many better versions of the songs on the box."
