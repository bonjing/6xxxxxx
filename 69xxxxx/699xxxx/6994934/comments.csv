,"This file will not play on my blu-ray player or PBO. I can usually fix these incompatability issues by running them through avidemux. However, according to avidemux this file is only 33 minutes long. Can't fix it. I finally re-encoded it using nerovision but guess what? The resulting file is only 33 minutes long! WTF is wrong with this upload? The quality of all TV releases has deteriorated lately. We get oversized files with no more quality than before & loads of glitches. Releases for season 2 of The Walking Dead are most notably sub standard."
