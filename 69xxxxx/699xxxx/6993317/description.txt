Were humans created by â€œgodâ€ as SLAVES?
Was Abraham the first human SPY?
Was Jesus an accidental MESSIAH?

In Slave Species of god, Michael Tellinger takes his readers on a remarkable odyssey of the true origins of humankind in which he:

* draws clear and startling analogies between new discoveries in genetic engineering and ancient archaeological findsâ€¦
* highlights emerging scientific information overlooked in the pastâ€¦
* unravels the Bibleâ€™s often obscure stories by linking these to their original forms in Sumerian clay tablets and other prehistoric writingsâ€¦
* provides explicit answers to why our modern world has become so senseless and chaotic by revealing the very secrets of our prehistoryâ€¦

While shattering myths about evolution and God, Slave Species of god enables evolutionists and creationists to finally co-exist in one pond. The arguments are compelling, simple and refreshing, retracing the path of human evolution from the murky distant past to the religious dogma that haunts humankind today. The question of who we are and where we come from takes on a new meaning as we discover that our DNA may have been manipulated by our CREATOR some 250 000 years ago to produce a less intelligent â€˜primitive speciesâ€™. In fact, the bookâ€™s evidence shows that Adam and Eve were not the â€˜appleâ€™ of Godâ€™s eye as first suggested in Genesis. Tellinger presents the many arguments and evidence succinctly and convincingly, pointing out the difference between â€˜GODâ€™ and god. How did this genetic manipulation affect humankind? How have we evolved in 250 000 years? Can we achieve immortality? These are just some of the questions answered in this gripping and astonishing work, challenging all those who are looking for new answers in the 21st century.
