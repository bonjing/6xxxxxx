"Moe Goes from Rags to Riches"

After Moe is heckled for not having any real 
companions, Moes best friend and beloved 
bar rag (guest voice Jeremy Irons) narrates 
his incredible thousand-year journey to 
Springfield.
Beginning in the Middle Ages, the bar rag 
was loomed into a beautiful and ornate 
medieval tapestry and traveled around the 
globe through the hands of royalty before 
finding himself found himself at Moes 
Tavern. Meanwhile, Bart begs Milhouse for 
forgiveness after the two friends get into a 
tiff, and when the bar rag goes missing, Moe 
realizes that he has more friends than he 
thought.
