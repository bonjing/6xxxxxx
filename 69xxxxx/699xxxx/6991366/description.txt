                           DESCRiPTiON 

 A team of professional con artists travel the country to catch out            
 unsuspecting members of the public with their fraudulent tricks in order to   
 teach them how to become more vigilant.                                       
                                                                               
                                                                               
 Former Hollyoaks star Sarah Jayne Dunn offers to sell three watches to a member
 of the public for the wholesale price. Paul Wilson poses as a security guard for
 a shopping precinct and informs a customer that a new TV she has just bought 
 does not really belong to her.
                                    
                                 Enjoy!
