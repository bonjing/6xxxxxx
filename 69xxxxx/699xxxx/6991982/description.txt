SOME TRIVIA FROM IMDB

The Tasmanian Tiger, also known as the Tasmanian Wolf, thylacine or Thylacinus cynocephalus, the latter which is Greek for "dog-headed pouched one", is an extinct species of carnivorous marsupial. It is so called a Tasmanian Tiger because of the stripes on its back.

An end title card reads: "Traps and snares are illegal in Tasmania". 

Willem Dafoe had to deal with leeches during production filming in the Tasmanian wilderness in Australia. In a media interview, he joked how he didn't lose any blood, ironic because his previous Australian film Daybreakers had been a vampire movie. Both movies co-star Sam Neill.

The film's source novelist Julia Leigh is also a writer-director herself, writing and directing Sleeping Beauty, another Australian movie released in the same year as this film. Leigh however did not actually work on the screenplay nor direct this film.
