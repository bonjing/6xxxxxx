Room.101.S12E01.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 122MB]

[/b][/color] Supposing you could get rid of your worst nightmares, what would they be? Each week, a different celebrity guest has their chance to cast the things they hate most into Room 101 - the most horrible and frightening place in the world, as created by George Orwell in his dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.
The series was hosted until 1997 by Nick Hancock, and then Paul Merton hosted it from 1999 until the final episode in 2007.
