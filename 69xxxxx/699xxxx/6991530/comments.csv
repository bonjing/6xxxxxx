 My comment was more advice than critising. No matter how good a cam is it's still a cam and putting the word quality anywhere on a cam files title, notes, comments is just asking for bad feedback.
I upload on this and other sites under another id and know how easy it is to change a cam then upload it. If your spending more than half an hour tinkering with an already blurry cam then you need some advice as one of your previous cams u added in your notes "" 8 hours work on this"" which is ridiculous."
 to understand what the uploader means at least ? by the way if someone knows a site or have conditions to upload blurays first then the cams please be my guests and put the links vailable for everyone take a look but that in one condition : totally free downloading , not movie sites where you have to pay to watch the movies ... see all of you and give me a break having the correct analysis about what it is said about the movies on the descriptions or comments and believe me , i always search for the best file possible under the circunstances with the available originals , when i finish the work , my conscience is always more clean as possible for the presented file ... just comments talk .. have fun and i am waiting for links to free sites with new nice movies in bluray without paying anything ... bye and happy day to all of you ."
