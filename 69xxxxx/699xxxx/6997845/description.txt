      Genre       :     Action                  
                                                
                                                
 The film begins with Prabha burying his        
 own brother in a deserted area. And then,      
 it's time for the flashback! Prabha has        
 a never-care-for-anything kind of attitude.    
 His way of expressing things is different      
 because of which he ends up in trouble         
 everywhere. It's almost like troubles          
 follow him wherever he goes. Prabha's          
 father and brother do not have a great         
 opinion about him and according to them,       
 he is a useless vagabond. On the other hand,   
 Prabha's brother is a much disciplined,        
 well settled youth who works with a local      
 TV channel as a cameraman. Prabha's brother    
 always tries to find fault with him which      
 leads to lots of problems.                     
 Prabha, a great volleyball player, applies     
 for a job in Railways under sports quota.      
 Meantime, Prabha gets a job as a volleyball    
 coach in a local girls' college, where he      
 meets Anitha and obviously, they fall in love!.
