Where is Keith?  Who said he could take a vacation or a sick day?  Bill Press is even more egregiously awful than David Schuster, whose voice reminds me of trying to shave with a cheese grater.  Press can do the straight stuff, but he should be barred from even attempting any semblance of comedy, let alone irony.  Please don't let him even do ""Time Marches On.""  At least only Keith seems to be allowed/capable to do ""Worst Persons."""
