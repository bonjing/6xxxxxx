           When sheriff Barnum investigates the death of an       
           elderly rural resident, he discovers a teenage         
           grandson living in the basement. Raised by his         
           grandparents, he has experienced the world only        
           through books, never leaving the family farm. He is    
           sent to a state home for boys where he has trouble     
           fitting in socially. His odd appearance and unusual    
         abilities cause the small town residents to fear and  
        ridicule him. However, not all are afraid. Some        
        begin to view his potential and gifts with              
        wonderment.
