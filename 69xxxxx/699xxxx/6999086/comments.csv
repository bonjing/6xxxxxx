The English track also sounds like it's playing through a cellphone inside a hippo's ass. The video quality is shit too, major artifacting. Oh yeah and the movie itself blows. All in all, a complete and miserable failure. Skip it, skip it, skip it! 

(but DO definitely get the first Disney's Notre Dame, which was outstanding)
