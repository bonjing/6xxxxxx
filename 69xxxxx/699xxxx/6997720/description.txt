Plot:
The Morgans, a loving and strong family of Black sharecroppers in Louisiana in 1933, face a
serious family crisis when the husband and father, Nathan Lee Morgan, is convicted of a petty
crime and sent to a prison camp. After some weeks or months, the wife and mother, Rebecca
Morgan, sends the oldest son, who is about 11 years old, to visit his father at the camp.
