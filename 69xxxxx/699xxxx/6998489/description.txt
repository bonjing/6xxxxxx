This is a three part miniseries from 2005 shown on BBC outlets

Its ostensibly about the voyage to Australia by the great sort of folks
that did head for the land of great beauty in what spirit they brought 
collectively as it were - but hardly equally I daresay as Darcy (of
Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice)is not the equal to The Rt Hon Mr. Malcolm
Turnbull for instance (possibly the next great Prime Minister of Australia - 
he has the true Germanic spirit of excellence).

Indeed if you wish proof of he bad manners I speak of in respect of Darcy's personality type, witness the "Aggressive sex" forced on a woman in some 
degree of distress that her protest appears too weak in what are her sex's
naturally limited abilities in such situations as it were - all the man
has to say for himself (looking rather mean spirited and seeming certainly
deliberately ugly to her own spirit that is) is "gee don't say this is 
something you haven't been through before" (he then dares to suggest that perhaps
a coin or two might satisfy hr virtue (without actually using the words that is).

Oh well, actions speak louder than words and if one is to maintain that
h is a true gentleman, let him show it in not being a mean spirited 
cad and scoundrel when the test of his character is at hand - as it always
should be.
