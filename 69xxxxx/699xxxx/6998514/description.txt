Louis Armstrong (August 4, 1901 â€“ July 6, 1971) nicknamed Satchmo or Pops, was an American 
jazz trumpeter and singer from New Orleans, Louisiana.

Coming to prominence in the 1920s as an "inventive" cornet and trumpet player, Armstrong was 
a foundational influence in jazz, shifting the music's focus from collective improvisation 
to solo performance. With his instantly recognizable deep and distinctive gravelly voice, 
resembling the sound of a trumpet, Armstrong was also an influential singer, demonstrating 
great dexterity as an improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song for expressive 
purposes. He was also greatly skilled at scat singing, vocalizing using sounds and syllables 
instead of actual lyrics.
