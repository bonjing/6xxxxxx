Fresh Cream is the debut studio album by British supergroup Cream. It was the first LP release of producer Robert Stigwood\\\'s new \\\"Independent\\\" Reaction Records label, released in the United Kingdom as both a mono and stereo version on 9 December 1966, the same time as the single release of \\\"I Feel Free\\\".o The album was released a month later, in January 1967, in the United States by Atco Records as both a mono and a stereo version.[5] To date, neither the original UK nor US mono versions have been officially released on CD, only the stereo versions, though \\\"I\\\'m So Glad\\\" was only mixed into mono. 

In 2003, the album was ranked number 101 on Rolling Stone magazine\\\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.
