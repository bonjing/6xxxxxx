,fcrulezz,2012-01-30T15:52Z,"6000 kbps looks nice. Good luck to you! :) You can also just put the files into DRM-less MKVs.
For encoding I advise level 3.1 or 4.1, preset slow (or others slower), original 23.976 fps.
For example, in Handbrake it would be high profile, then 5 or 9 reference frames (for level 3 and 4 compliance), adaptive b-frames optimal, motion estimation uneven multi-hexagon, subpixel me 8. You can go with 4000 bitrate.
Good luck, more decent torrents is good :)."
hy I bought it in the first place.

Thanks for the comments!"
