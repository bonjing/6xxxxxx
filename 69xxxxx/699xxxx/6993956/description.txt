Episode 8. The Silly Season

Danish drama series about the fight for political power - and the personal sacrifices and consequences this has for those involved on and behind the political stage.

It is summer, and not much is going on in parliament. Yet when Michael Laugesen announces that he has written a book - to be released in a few days - containing disclosures of all sorts from his years in politics, something happens. Kasper is forced to deal with people and events from his past which he has fought to put behind him. When Birgitte realises she must make an effort to win back her family life, she spontaneously plans a holiday for the whole family.
