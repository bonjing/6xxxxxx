PLOT: 

A stretch of road the locals call Death's Door has taken many lives over the years. It turns out to be the playground of a reaper we'll call RAILROAD JACK. When a group of ten teens set out on a field trip to a Railraod Museum, Railroad Jack makes sure their bus crashes on the way back.
As they explore Railroad Jack's carnival, the reaper picks them off one by one. His weapon of choice? A pick axe.
