Plot..........: EAST WEST 101 is the story of two men whose destiny is 
                irrevocably intertwined. Malik is driven by a hunger for
                justice. He was twelve and at the till, when a masked 
                gunman held up the family shop. Malik refused to hand 
                over the money. His father was shot and injured. Since 
                he joined the Force, Malik has been looking for the 
                shadowy figure who pulled the trigger. 

                When he finally finds him, MalikÃ†s belief in the justice 
                system is challenged by a powerful desire for revenge. 
                As he hunts down the truth it is revealed that Crowley 
                had a part to play in the original investigation. But 
                will Crowley help or hinder Malik in his quest? He is a
                man whose vision has been blighted by pain and prejudice.
                
                CrowleyÃ†s son, Paul, was found dead of a drug overdose 
                sold to him by a Lebanese dealer. When the drug dealer,
                who sold Paul the heroin, is found murdered, Internal 
                Affairs come asking questions. Looking for answers. 
                Not just from Crowley. Malik also. He was involved in the
                case. Crowley is at the mercy of Malik. Will Malik end 
                his career? What will Crowley do to stop him? 
                
                ThereÃ†s an edge of danger as these two men circle one 
                another. This might look like the battle between two 
                strong men for dominance - but it is also a metaphor for 
                the fear that exists between East and West - as two men 
                search for love, approval and forgiveness.
