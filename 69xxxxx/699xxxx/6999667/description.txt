Release Notes....: As usual the Pro Bowl is the most boring and pointless game of the
                   season. If you want to see linemen playing patty cake, this is the
                   game for you. Oh, and isn't it great that the MVP of the game wins
                   a brand-new SUV? I'm sure he was hard up for cash and that's
                   exactly what he needed to get by. Or maybe the reason that he says
                   he's going to give it to his mom is because a GMC Yukon is a cheap
                   piece of shit when you have a 5-year,$47 million contract. I'm not
                   sure. You decide.
