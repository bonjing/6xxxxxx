Sonny Rollins No Problem 
Released 1981 
Recorded December 9â€“15, 1981 
Label Milestone
Format: Mp3@320


Tenor sax legend Rollins (who played with jazz giants Max Roach and Thelonious Monk in the 1950s) takes it easy here with a set of easy-listening style tunes. Many of the tunes have an appealing "island vacation" feel to them--note the warm, bouncy calypso feel of "Coconut Bread" and the strutting light funk of "Joyous Lake." "Jo Jo" reflects Rollins' 1960s freewheeling hard-bop jazz sound, and Dolly Parton's "Here You Come Again" gets a playful workout. "Illusions" features some steely yet soulful ballad playing.

Rollins' playing is melodically direct, full-bodied and gently rollicking, and guitarist Bobby Broom and vibist Bobby Hutcherson provide a shimmering, dancing backdrop. Drummer Tony Williams (who played in the superb Miles Davis Quintet in the 1960s) provides what can be best described as a rocking swing beat. No Problem is not for the fans of the Rollins classics , but smooth jazz-fans who are hungry for a bit of grit would do well to check this out.
