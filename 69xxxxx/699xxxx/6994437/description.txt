A key film in the unimpeachable cry-in-the-wilderness corpus of Peter WatkinsÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â¥a major filmography long marginalized and only now being prepped and released on any form of videoÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â¥ Punishment Park (1971) is an act of howling political righteousness, a dystopian critique intended for the peace-movement years but possibly even more relevant today. The premise is so simple it leaves singe marks: Watkins begins with the very real McCarran Act (just as he had based The War Game on Britain's own nuclear-warfare cost analysis and contingency plans), which grants Ashcroftian summary-judgment powers to the president in times of potential "insurrection." The Nixon-'Nam years were those times, and so the film follows two groups of arrested protesters as they're led to the Western desert, interrogated by a tribunal and then sent running, with national guardsmen and riot police following on the hunt.
