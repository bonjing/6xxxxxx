After listening to this audio, consider writing your congressman, your state electors, you know? the people who work for you and want your family to be safe. Tell them that you do not want fluoride in your drinking water. If you really want Fluoride, you should be given the choice, but not be forced by having it. We have the right to be able to choose fluoride or fluoride-free toothpaste, but why not water?
