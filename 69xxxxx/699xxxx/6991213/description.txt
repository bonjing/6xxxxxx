NOTES:

Sources, russian video was ok not great but with some TLC could be pretty nice....
Audio is ok for cam ,some talking and coughs here and there ...

Readnfo ,is becuase there is 15mins just under missing .....hence the reason we opted to do no work to the
video nor audio as it was pointless ...audio missing in 4 places so had to cut the russian video out on these parts.
Only reason for doing it,is i know a few trying to sync this and want it either way so ...this is for them and any
other leechers.

Once we get new audio we'll then sync it to the complete video and go to town on it,but till then this is it
