This is the iconic Starman of the 90s featuring Jack Knight. The son of the original Starman, Ted Knight, Jack was never supposed to be the hero, but after his brother's death he takes up the Starman mantle reluctantly. 


Unlike other DC heroes, he does not wear a flashy costume, but wears a tshirt, sneakers and his favorite jacket,goggles, with a sheriff's star being the only symbol of his superhero status

Considered one of the few gems of the 90s, this is definitely worth reading. Enjoy and seed

PS this will be a long initial download. Expect to see it finished Monday or so
