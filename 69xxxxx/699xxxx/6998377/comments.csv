lude a ""cover"" image that shows on this page by doing the following:

1.  Go to bayimg.com
2.  While uploading, click on ""settings"" and Check ""Resize to"".
3.  Leave the pulldown at 300x300 pixels.
4.  Click ""Upload"".
5.  On the next screen, grab the last part of the URL (usually 9 random characters)
6.  Put that in the box labeled ""Image tag from bayimg"" when uploading the torrent.

I haven't downloaded this yet, but you get points for not zipping or rarring the torrent.  No previews isn't great, but it's really bad when the uploader zips the torrent -- if you did that, no one would have a clue what's in the torrent until they've downloaded the whole thing.

W4B does some GREAT stuff, so I'm sure some of the downloaders are comfortable grabbing this without any previews.  I know I am."
