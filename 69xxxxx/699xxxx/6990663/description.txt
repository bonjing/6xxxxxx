Real Answers to Real Questions asked by Lightroom User

Review
This edition of the ongoing series, [...] weighing in at over 100,000 words, is jam-packed with tips and information [...]  It\'s one of the most useful resources we\'ve read on the topic and is well worth the [money]. --Rob Galbraith
Product Description
When you have a Lightroom question, where do you look?

Do you trawl through thousands of web pages looking for the information you need?
Perhaps post on a forum and wait hours for anyone to reply?
Maybe try to ï¬gure out the Help ï¬les?
From now on, you look right here!

This is the reference book that should have shipped with Lightroom.

Adobe Lightroom 3 - The Missing FAQ is a compilation of the most frequently asked questions, presented in question and answer format so that you can easily find the answers you\'re looking for.

Whether you\'re a new user who likes to dive straight into new software and figure it out as you go along, a more experienced user wanting to learn how to get the best out of Lightroom, or you\'ve just got a burning question you\'d like answered, this book is for you.

These are real-world answers to real questions asked by real Lightroom users. It not only covers how to do things, but also why they work the way they do.

Lightroom may have a mind of its own... but now you can learn how it thinks.

The story behind the book... and a FREE bonus!

The Adobe Lightroom - The Missing FAQ series was originally intended to be a searchable PDF eBook, however once the book was released to the public, a demand arose for other formats too. Anyone purchasing this Kindle version is invited to contact the author via her website to access the main color PDF format, ePub format, and any future LR3 Kindle updates absolutely FREE.

**SCREENSHOT QUALITY - Thanks to Karol for pointing out the problem with the screenshots being too small to read in the first release. The file has now been rebuilt with maximum size images which are much clearer. Anyone who has already purchased is welcome to contact the author for the update.**
