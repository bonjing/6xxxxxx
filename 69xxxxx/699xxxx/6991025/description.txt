PS3 SDK 3.70 with PhyreEngine.

Note, to actually use the samples you need a PS3 Debug station, the self files (as far as i am aware) do not run on CFW (if you have found a way let me know).

BUT 

The code is usefull to use as reference for programmers who want a better understanding with what is being used and even more importatntly how it is being used.

Hopefully the phyreengine will be one day used for notes to recreate an engine for the PSL1GHT users, but we will have to wait and see.
