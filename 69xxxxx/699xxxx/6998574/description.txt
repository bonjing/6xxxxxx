                Professor David Blood has banned Rich from visiting
                Grace in hospital and Rich is suffering. Alo tries to
                keep him out of trouble with band practice, but Rich
                is committed to his love and he stands outside the
                hospital waiting for Grace's call. Eventually the
                call comes and Rich finds a way past security and
                breaks into Grace's room. The lovers are reunited,
                but they have a problem - Blood is moving Grace to
                another hospital in Zurich. Rich goes to Grace's
                house to appeal to Professor Blood, but finds they've
                already gone. Rich moves into the house, and sleeps
                in Grace's bed until Alo tracks him down and pledge
                to help his best mate. But Alo has other things on
                his mind and cracks begin to develop in the boys'
                friendship so it falls to Liv to bring the fractured
                group back together again.
