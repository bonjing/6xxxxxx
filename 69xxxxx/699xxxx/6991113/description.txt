blocklist manager for bittorrent programs.

to block anti p2p- companies, spyware and many other thinks.

*your anti-virus maybe give a warning but it's a false warning, because of the ip scan in the block list manager*

just follow the steps on the website, for utorrent it's easy and for other bittorrent programs that use ipfilter.dat.

for vuze use safepeer.

* the block lists are from bluetack :)


Enjoy :)
