Possibly the largest collection of engine sounds assembled on the net. Include exotics like the Soloviev D30 and PW PT6A-114 turboprop. These are mostly FSX specific sounds, but some included packages offer a FS9 version. Packaged as a directory so you don't have to wait for the entire 2.44 gigabytes - but if you want to show thanks, seed this entire torrent to insure it survives. Many of the file share sites that facilitated the assembly of this package are now defunct.
