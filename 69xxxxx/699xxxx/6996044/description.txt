The Cars are an American rock band that emerged from the early New Wave music scene in the late 1970s. 
The band consisted of lead singer and rhythm guitarist Ric Ocasek, lead singer and bassist Benjamin Orr, 
guitarist Elliot Easton, keyboardist Greg Hawkes and drummer David Robinson. The band originated in Boston, 
Massachusetts, and were signed to Elektra Records by George Daly, then A&R head, in 1977.

The Cars were at the forefront in merging 1970s guitar-oriented rock with the new synth-oriented pop 
that was then becoming popular and which would flower in the early 1980s. The Cars started fresh with 
their debut album The Cars which went on to go platinum in late 1978. The Cars' debut album was called 
a "genuine rock masterpiece" by Allmusic. Probably the most successful and well known song from the album, 
"Just What I Needed", started as a demo in 1977. The song was sent as a mix tape to a local DJ in the 
Boston area, who played the song in heavy rotation. This soon caught the attention of other DJs, which 
led to the signing of the band by Elektra Records in 1977. The Cars have mentioned this numerous times 
including in their "last" interview in June 2000.
