Whenever a phrase is impossible to understand I enclose that phrase in brackets
in the subtitle with the word \"Idistinct.\"

Whenever a phrase is almost understandable I put it in parantheses in the subtitle so a better man than I can guess what was meant. Often times if I listen to it later on a different audio system it becomes clearer.

Composing subtitles was long overdue.
