The Sims 3 with all expansions and store content together with keygens and crack for newest version (v1.29.55  date: 29/1/2012)

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
I take no credit whatsoever. I simply compiled everything together so that it is easy to install and update.
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

The store content is a part of the mods included, so if you do not install the mods the content from the online store will be missing.

I also added some mods of my own besides the store content. You can remove thoose you do not want to have installed.

The mods added:
(store content)
AI-fixes (alfixes.package)
No censur (NoMosaicWA.package)
Modern computer (M4RK13_MacBookPro_v1-01.package)
Modern phone (M4RK13_iPhone4HomeScreen.package) // Mabye broken :/
No intro videos (nointro.package)


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Install all games from 01 to 10
NOTE: The Sims 3 Pets installation is not in .iso format, but instead .rar
To install simply extract the rar and run the Sims3EP05Setup.exe

2. Use correct keygens or serials

3. Launch S3Launcher.exe in your installation folder (As default located in; c:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\bin)

4. Update the game using the button in the launcher (1/29/2012 the newest was 1.29.55)

5. Open the "TS3 Crack 1.29.55 - TSV.rar" and extract TSW3.exe and TSLHost.dll to your sims 3 installation (NOT THE EXPANSION!)
As default you should extract the two files to c:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\bin


6.(Optional) Move Mods.rar to "My Documents\Electronic Art\The Sims3\" and extract the content here, 
so that there is now a folder inside called "Mods". And inside that folder there should be 3 things; 2 folders (Overrides & Packages) and 1 file (Resource.cfg)

You can add or remove mods from the mods\package folder to customize your gameplay. I've already added a few of my favorites.
To uninstall mods, simply remove the file(s) from the packages folder.

7. Play!


I found no virus or malicious software in any of the cracks/keygens or files. 


Enjoy!
