I compiled the 12 games and patched them all to English for those that weren\'t (over half) for you fire emblem fans.

It was moreso to save the hassle of patching it all yourself and finding the roms, but yeah.
It would be a ton smaller if I hadn\'t included Radiant Dawn and Path of Radiance, but I decided anyways, because the version of Radiant Dawn is the only one that\'s ran smooth for me.

I won\'t stop seeding this, but from the size, it is going to need more than just me.
