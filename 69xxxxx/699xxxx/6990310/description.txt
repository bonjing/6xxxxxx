Information
------------------------------

Series in which Iolo Williams shines a spotlight on his favourite Welsh landscapes and wildlife.


1)  Water 
Iolo examines how water has shaped the natural beauty of Wales and allowed industry to flourish. He explores a hidden gorge in Snowdonia, kayaks down the river Wye, tries his hand at coracle fishing on the river Teifi, and ventures deep beneath the Brecon Beacons to witness an amazing natural wonder.

2)  Mineral Wealth 
Iolo focuses on Wales's mineral wealth, learning how it has been exploited and how these processes affected the land and the creatures residing there. He goes underground to explore an impressive disused quarry, witnesses how lapwings are thriving amongst one of the largest industrial sites in south Wales, and observes that the abandoned railway lines and canals of the industrial era are now wildlife habitats.

3)  Lowlands 
Iolo explores the largely man-made landscape of Wales's lowlands and some of the 1,700 miles of coastline. He observes a wood warbler amongst the oak trees of Coed Crafnant, looks at the Dee estuary from the point of view of a local fisherman and goes underwater at Llyn Peninsula to witness the variety of marine creatures living just offshore.

4)  Uplands 
Iolo starts his journey in the wild uplands amongst Iron Age hill forts. He finds ravens nesting in a gorge in the Brecon Beacons, explores the Rhinogau mountains to hear the birdsong of the ring ouzel and whinchat, and visits the wood ant nests of Coed-y-Brenin. Finally, he joins soldiers training at the Epynt army range, where redstarts and crossbills can still be found.
