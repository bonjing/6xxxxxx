"Livin' on a Prayer"

When Stewies new best friend falls ill, 
Lois takes him to the hospital where she 
finds out he has a critical, but 
treatable, disease. However, the boys 
parents refuse treatment due to their 
religious beliefs, leaving Lois no choice 
but to take drastic measures to seek 
treatment for the boy herself. Meanwhile, 
Peter has a religious experience of his 
own.
