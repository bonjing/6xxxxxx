The Closing of the Muslim Mind: How Intellectual Suicide Created the Modern Islamist Crisis

People are shocked and frightened by the behavior coming out the Islamic world--not only because it is violent, but also because it is seemingly inexplicable. While there are many answers to the question of "what went wrong" in the Muslim world, no one has decisively answered why it went wrong. Until now.

In this eye-opening new book, foreign policy expert Robert R. Reilly uncovers the root of our contemporary crisis: a pivotal struggle waged within the Muslim world nearly a millennium ago. In a heated battle over the role of reason, the side of irrationality won. The deformed theology that resulted, Reilly reveals, produced the spiritual pathology of Islamism, and a deeply dysfunctional culture.
