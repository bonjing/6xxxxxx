SURPRISED THAT THIS ISN'T AVAILABLE HERE ON TPB...

MANY OF THE TRACKS ARE WAY BETTER THAN ALBUM VERSIONS AND IF YOU'RE A DM FAN,THIS IS

ESSENTIAL.

I'LL SEED TO A 4.0 RATIO AND THEN IT'S UP TO YOU TO DO THE SEEDING...

P.S. THEY SHOULD ENTER THE STUDIO IN MARCH,SO HOPEFULLY MAYBE THIS YEAR THEY'LL

FINISH THEIR NEW ALBUM

ENJOY AND SEED...
