On October's 2nd 2011, Mtv Brazil broadcasted this Special program as a tribute to the band that announced their break up just a few days ago (based on this, they put a "Rest In Peace" logo on screen).

This show was presented in the same weekend of my father's death.
Despite the funeral, the last image I have him was a good one, and due to this the sound too.
This torrent is dedicated him.

"Thank you for being there for me/ Thank you for listening/ Goodbye ..."
