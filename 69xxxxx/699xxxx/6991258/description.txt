Knuckle
How do you resolve a long running family feud? By brutal, bare-knuckle fist fights, of course. At least you do if you re the Joyce or Quinn-McDonagh families... The Irish travellers have been fighting for so long that they can no longer agree quite how it started. Over a decade, director Ian Palmer is given unlimited access their world, where generations of men exchange threatening videos, then meet up regularly on quiet Irish lanes to beat the life out of each other. Charismatic James McDonagh swears that every fight is his last if only he can learn to turn down the sizeable purse which comes with each win...
