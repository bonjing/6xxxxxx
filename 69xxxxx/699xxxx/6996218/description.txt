The.Cleveland.Show.S03E09.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 59MB]

[/b][/color] Cleveland has kind of had enough in Quahog ??? he kind of realizes that he wants his own friends, his own sidekicks, his own stories.
So he sets out to California to make it in a way that we'll have to keep a secret until the show starts, and then he ends up somewhere else, which we'll also keep a secret until the show starts.
But he basically goes home ??? he goes to his hometown in Virginia and rekindles an old high school flame.
