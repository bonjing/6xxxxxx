With the folk genre being continuously divided into increasingly specific subgenres, itâ€™s a breath of fresh air for a band like I Am Oak to show up out of the blue (read: Europe) with some engaging, first-rate classic sound . On their first album, On Claws, the Dutch band, headed by Thijs Kuijken and supported by various others in live performances, does everything that a good folk band should; the album swings from mood to mood with little warning, from brooding sorrow to frolicking apathy, to endearing honesty and back again, all the while maintaining a unified, mellow quality through gentle, hummable melodies and understated guitar and banjo. It might take a couple of thorough listens to get hooked, but once you realize the delicate power contained in songs like â€œHearthâ€ and â€œStorm,â€ itâ€™s hard to not want to follow Thijs Kuijken and friends on the rest of what hopefully will be a long and successful career.
