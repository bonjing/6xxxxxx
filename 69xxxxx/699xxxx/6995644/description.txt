Carpenters were an American vocal and instrumental duo, consisting of sister Karen and brother Richard Carpenter. 
The Carpenters were the #1 selling American music act of the 1970s. Though often referred to by the public as 
"The Carpenters" the duo's official name on authorized recordings and press materials is simply Carpenters 
without the definite article. During a period in the 1970s when louder and wilder rock was in great demand 
Richard and Karen produced a distinctively soft musical style that made them among the best-selling music 
artists of all time..
