Duane Eddy (born April 26, 1938) is a Grammy Award-winning American guitarist. In the late 1950s and early 1960s he had a string of hit records, produced by Lee Hazlewood, which were noted for their characteristically 'twangy' sound, including Rebel Rouser, Peter Gunn, and Because They're Young. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 (wikipedia)
