DESCRIPTION:

When police detective Will Grayson and his partner, Helen Walker, 
investigate the violent death of Stephen Bryan, a gay academic, their first thoughts are 
of an ill-judged sexual encounter or a fatal loversâ€™ quarrel: The manâ€™s face was like 
a glove that had been pulled inside out. But they soon shift focus to the book 
Bryan was writing about the life and mysterious death of fifties film star Stella Leonard. 
While Bryanâ€™s sister puts herself in danger by conducting her own investigation, 
Grayson and Walker peel away the secrets of a family blighted by a lust for wealth and 
power and by its perverted sexuality. 

On the heels of his critically acclaimed Frank Elder series, John Harvey delivers 
a page-turner both subtle and devastating.
