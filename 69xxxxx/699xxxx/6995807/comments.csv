Click download as normal
once it appears in utorrent window, click on it to highlight it, then go down on the L/hand side and click on files, the individual files will appear in the lower window, R/click on the ones you want to remove and select 'do not download'
you will see it skip these selected files
Hope this is a help to everyone"
