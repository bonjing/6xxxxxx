Ok, this was requested. I tested the installer works, but I do not use voice so I did not complete the install - what I am saying is it probably works. I still have a ton of stuff to up so I likely won't seed this long, next will be the Accusim version P-40 and I have a really nice Pitts from Alabedo, it looks way nicer that the Icarus version but to be honest, I have been so busy with TPB stuff I haven't had time to try it. Also got Aerosoft Anchorage and ORBX Ketchikan, so, stay tuned.
