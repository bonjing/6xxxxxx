This wonderfully candid film shows the home water birth of Dusty, who arrives into the world with the help of a midwife, her father, a doula and her big sister. It is a hard labour as Dusty is in a posterior position and the intense pain is described in a voice over as Dusty's mother works to manage the contractions, her other child and her strong maternal instincts.
