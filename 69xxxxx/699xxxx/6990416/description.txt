Copenhagen Airport (KÃ¸benhavns Lufthavn, Kastrup) located just 8 kilometers south of the center of Copenhagen is the largest Scandinavian airport. Besides servicing all of Denmark and the southern regions of Sweden directly; it functions as one of Scandinavian Airlines System's (SAS) major international hubs making it a vital transit airport in the Northern European region. 21.5 million passengers passed through the airport in 2008 making it one of Europe's 20 busiest airports.


This new scenery from Scansim provides a detailed scenery, without sacrificing good framerates. This package features the complete Airport built in Gmax with photorealistic ground textures (Summer, night and winter variation) in a sensational resolution up to 0.6m/pixel. The scenery features exact coastlines, mesh and a completely new designed airport located 100% correct. This add-on also includes dynamic apron traffic, as well as road traffic in the vicinity of the airport. The included detailed AFCAD and AI Aircrafts compatible with default traffic, makes it a lively and highly realistic airport to fly to. You might find scenery with better graphics, but this will be at the cost of framerates - The EKCH Copenhagen Airport is designed to be usable in conjunction with great scenery's like Denmark Scenery rendering a detailed Copenhagen city center right next to the airport.
Let's go fly to Copenhagen Airport!
