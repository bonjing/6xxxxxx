It seems to be much better put together, it seems the winger @magic1987 doesnt care for the overall quality of the upload. I would rather have a few songs with a pointless large file size than a bunch of correct size and all not numbered.
This has more seeders because it is seen as the better choice for more people. suffer in your jocks supersnazz2000. lol."
