ENCODER'S NOTES..:
Movie: Source was completely out of sync, so we had to fix sync issues and applied some filters, so enjoy..
Our first release of this movie was in a smaller size, so it would be difficult for others to re-encode,
so we decided to make a larger copy with higher quality for others who needed it in mkv.

Subs: Subs are still the same with all the copies we have now, just looking for a volunteer who can make better English subs although if you follow the movie, the subs should not be a problem.
We only renamed accordingling to match movie title so they can be recognized by VLC Player
