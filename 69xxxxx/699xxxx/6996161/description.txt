Matt Smith presents action from today's fourth-round ties, including Sunderland v Middlesbrough 
at the Stadium of Light and Arsenal v Aston Villa at the Emirates Stadium. Local rivals the Black Cats 
and Boro had not met since the 2008/09 campaign, when Sunderland's 2-0 home win and a 1-1 draw at 
the Riverside contributed to their rivals' relegation from the Premier League. Elsewhere, the Gunners 
were aiming to improve on their poor home record against the Villans since moving to their new ground, 
which had seen them win just one of five contests between the clubs.
