Information
------------------------------

Three days flying around the UK in flimsy machines whose engines can cut out at any time: welcome to the mad, bad and sometimes downright dangerous world of competitive amateur microlighting in the Round Britain Rally. This documentary follows three teams of microlight enthusiasts, who navigate their way across Britain armed with a map and compass, sleeping under the wing, and doing their best to keep their aircraft in one piece - while at the same time clocking up more miles than everyone else. Microlighters wax lyrical over the poetry of the skies, but they all have tales of brushes with death; disaster is never much more than a stalled engine away. As one of the pilots says: 'You're putting your life in the hands of what is effectively a chainsaw attached to a deck chair.' But that won't stop these enthusiasts from taking to their magnificent flying machines in an attempt to capture the true spirit of amateur aviation.
