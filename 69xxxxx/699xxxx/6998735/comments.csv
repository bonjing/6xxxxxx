There's no way to know if the voter even downloaded the torrent, let alone know whether they're rating the quality of the torrent's preparation, or the quality of the photography, or the attractiveness of the model, or something else entirely.

Reading a comment like yours means much more to me than the rating.  Even if the comment is negative -- feedback on what I'm posting is always helpful.  If someone doesn't like a model because she doesn't bleach her asshole, it's much more useful to post that as a comment.  Others can read that and go, ""Oh, I don't care about that""... or ""Fuck, I don't want this one then!"" and so the comment benefits everyone.  Same goes for a comment that says ""The photography is all out of focus!"" --  Obviously that's something most people are going to care about.

Monicca has 8 more sets -- I'll see about getting them up soon.  "
