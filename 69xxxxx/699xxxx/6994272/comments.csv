I've made many boot-able discs with no problems in the past, but this ISO does not boot at start up, does not boot in windows, and doesn't have any auto installation feature, only shows the ISO file every time I try to make a disc out of it. So unless I'm doing something wrong, I wouldn't waste your time with this one. No offense Pirate0610. I was really hoping this would work."
