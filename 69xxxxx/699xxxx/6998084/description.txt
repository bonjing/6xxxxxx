Dimmuborgir (note: not Dimmu Borgir, as the band's name) is a place in northern Iceland, where local legends purport that it is an entrance or gate to hell. "Dimmu" means dark, and "borgir" can mean city, town, castle, rocky hill or shelter.

In 1994, tracks for a mini LP called "Tusen Vinters..." were recorded but never released.
