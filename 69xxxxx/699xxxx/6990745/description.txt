About the game :

King Arthur II: Dead Legions is a Stand-Alone - you don't need the
full version of King Arthur II to play.

This is a tale of revival, resurrection and revenge the
chronicle of how the greatest adversary of King Arthur came into
power and the terrible price he had to pay.

Our journey begins in Eboracum, in one of the greatest
cities built in the Roman provinces of Britannia. But that
was a long time ago, and Eboracum slowly turned into a
magnificent graveyard of marble palaces, populated by
the living, breathing ghosts of a fallen empire. Until a
young monarch in the south, a Briton called Arthur pulled
the enchanted sword out of the stone and changed everything.

And now, after the catastrophe has struck in the south and the
Once and Future King lies wounded, the time is right to make the
former provinces great again. The fate of the Romans lies in the
hands of a noble man called Septimus Sulla. Betrayed and full of
anger, he embarks on his quest to restore the glory of Eboracum.
Nothing will deter him: he will wage war against both the savages
of the north and his fellow nobles he will unearth the secrets of
Hadrian's Wall and he will even venture into the mists of the
underworld to find to the fabled ghost legions of Rome.
