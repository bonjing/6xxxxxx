                Drama about a newly-trained midwife in 1950s London.
                Jenny is placed on the district nursing roster for a
                few weeks, to extend her experience of community
                practice. During her rounds she attends to Joe, a
                gentle old soldier, and a friendship forms. At the
                antenatal clinic Trixie and Cynthia enrol Winnie
                Lawson, a new patient. In her forties, Winnie had
                thought her days of nappies and babies were long
                gone, and seems upset by her pregnancy. By contrast,
                her husband Ted is overjoyed by the news. However, at
                the baby's birth everyone gets a bit of a surprise.
