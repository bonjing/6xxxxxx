SMS Spy Deluxe is the extension of the popular Android app SMS Spy. With SMS Spy Deluxe you can spy, lock and wipe the phone, SMS Spy Deluxe is installed on, with just a simple SMS.

You also receive a simple SMS with location and provider details, if/when the SIM card in your phone has been changed or you can let your phone play a noisy sound with a SMS, even if the sound has been deactivated before.

And if you have activated the NEW Move Protection feature of SMS Spy Deluxe, your phone plays a noisy alert, if somebody tries to steal you phone from your unobserved desk.

Additional features compared to SMS Spy:

1. Increased de-installation security via 'Android Device Adminstrator'
2. Password protection for SMS Spy Deluxe
3. Wipe/Reset your phone with a SMS
4. Sound Alert on your phone with a SMS
5. SIM card change detection
6. NEW: MOVE PROTECTION

No need for a special app for the locator or for registering for a special service. Just install SMS Spy Deluxe on your phone, and if you've lost your phone or it has been stolen, just use any phone with simple SMS functionality to locate your phone.

SMS Spy Deluxe for Android is mainly a background service and needs to work no explicit starting. If you have once activated SMS Spy Deluxe in the preference screen, SMS Spy is always on, even after a reboot!
To be fair: SMS Spy Deluxe is no 100% protection against lost or theft. There are still available means to bypass the protection for skilled people, but it's far more than no protection.

SMS Spy Deluxe includes no (hidden) behavior, that hasn't been documented here. It uses for 100% the official Android APIs and doesn't replace or change anything within you phone.
SMS Spy doesn't track or save anything, neither does it report anything to anybody, not even to us, the developers of SMS Spy Deluxe.
And after de-installtion of SMS Spy Deluxe nothing of this app will remain on your phone!

SMS Spy Deluxe is (a new) software, and the nature of software is: It usually contains bugs. Thus we can't guarantee that it will always work properly and on any Android device (there are so many out there, we can't test them all).
But please feel free to contact us whenever you like, ask and report bugs (especially before you comment).

We really want to help and to support. For this use the contact details within the market or email to oliver.lauer@mobinauten.de
BTW. We will provide additional functionality in the future, so if you have a good idea, please let us know.

PLEASE USE SMS SPY DELUXE ONLY ON AUTHORIZED PHONES!

What's in this version:

- Version 1.3.3 When the device was in locked sleeping modus the 'Move Protection' didn't work properly and didn't detect a move fast enough, hope this release fixes this bug.
