I am unable to find more details of this short movie on IMDb.

However, I found a lot of information just by Googling:


By this search, I found out that I have been in this region several times before!!
In fact, I married my thai wife there. (ISAN area). My wife was born in this area and I knew it was near the Lao border.

At any rate, to any "Farangs" out there that married a thai wife, if you want to
learn more about her, try posting a torrent then doing a Google search!  :-D

Geographic Area: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isan

Music Background: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Thailand

At any rate, the original DVD was not that great of quality; the reason
I kept the format in the original native format.

Enjoy!
