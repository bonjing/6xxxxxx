Description:

  Released on January,24 2012 this is the second Ep from the Chino Moreno of Deftones and Shaun Lopez of Far side project.


 
 
 This stuff is kind of similar to Team Sleep at first glance, Yet very different in many ways. It\'s pretty percussion heavy with a lot of spacey, dark guitar riffs. It has a lot of electronic samples,sounds and textures that create a dreamy atmosphere that compliments Chino\'s trademark crooning vocals and lyrics. If you\'re into Chino\'s and Shaun\'s other bands then I\'m sure you will dig this. I\'ve Included some art work and photography associated with the band. Also I\'ve included the Stem files for the second track \"Prurient\" for any one who is into doing remixes.

Track list:

1.Frontier

2.Prurient

3.tElepathy

4.tRophys

5.1987


Note: Word out to MOSHP1T. Also all of the t\'s are stylized crosses but TPB won\'t let me display them but all of the labels are correct in the torrent.


Seed that shit.
