Soccer America Magazine is a national American magazine devoted to soccer founded in the early 1970s and is still being published. Its primary focus is soccer in the United States, but it also covers the international game extensively. It was begun by publisher Clay Berling during a period of increased interest in youth soccer and new pro leagues. It has been a primary source of information for American pro soccer leagues, from the NASL to Major League Soccer. It also covers college and the American men's and women's national teams.
