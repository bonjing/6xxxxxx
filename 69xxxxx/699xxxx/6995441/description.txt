    Stark naked man comes out from the sea and begins to walk the            
    streets, interfering in daily episodes, always in search of justice.     
    He names himself Finis Hominis (The End of Man, in latin), and soon      
    becomes sort of a modern Messiah, capable of performing miracles. An     
    adulterous woman and a cheated husband are among his most faithful       
    followers, as well as a group of hippies.
