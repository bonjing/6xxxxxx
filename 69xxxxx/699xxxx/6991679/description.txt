Join the adventures of Chris and Martin Kratt as they encounter incredible wild animals, combining science education with fun and adventure, while traveling to animal habitats around the globe. Each adventure explores an age-appropriate science concept central to an animalâ€™s life and showcases a never-before-seen wildlife moment. Itâ€™s all wrapped up in engaging stories of adventure, mystery, rescue, and the Kratt brothersâ€™ brand of laugh-out-loud-comedy that kids love.

The real-life Chris and Martin introduce each Wild Kratts episode with a live action segment that imagines what it would be like to experience a never- before-seen wildlife moment, and asks, â€œWhat if...?â€ The Kratt brothers transition into animation and the adventure begins, bringing early-elementary school children into the secret lives of extraordinary creatures, many of which have never been animated before â€“ including proboscis monkeys, draco lizards and caracals!

Aided by the brilliant hi-tech inventor and scientist Aviva Corcovado and her team, the adventuring brothers can activate their Creature Power Suits to fly with peregrine falcons, tag along remora-style with a great white shark, or dive to the bottom of the sea with whales and colossal squid!

From meeting a young elephant who uses the physics of suction to bring water into her trunk, to poison arrow frogs who use chemistry as their defense, to peregrine falcons who harness the force of gravity to fly so fast, the brothers and viewers learn that animals can take you anywhere in science!
