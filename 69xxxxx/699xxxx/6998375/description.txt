The final countdown?
On December 21, 2012, the Mayan calendar will complete its thirteenth cycle. According to the Mayan belief system, the world will end. And if you donâ€™t believe the Mayans, you can check in with The Bible Code, The Nostradamus Code, or The Orion Prophecy, all of which predict planet-wide doom. Then again, maybe the year 2012 is just a new opportunity. Could 2012 bring us good things instead of bad? This book gives readers a look at what the Mayan prophecy is all about, what it means to them, and much more.

â€¢ Addresses Mayan predictions about global warming and climate change
â€¢ Includes a glossary of terms and symbols, resources for a changing world, and exercises to assist the reader in their journey
â€¢ The existence of almost 600,000 websites on 2012 indicates a huge fascination with this subject
