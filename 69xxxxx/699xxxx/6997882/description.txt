   Ramakrishna is an orphan from a village     
   and has an insatiable desire to become      
   a genius; he thinks a human brain is        
   capable of a lot of constructive activity   
   but one doesn't use it completely. The      
   indulgent man lands in the city in search   
   of a job and gets himself shot on the video 
   so each and every expression of his is      
   captured and once successful he can show it 
   to his folks in the village. But there is a 
   hitch, he cannot get a job as he is not a   
   certified genius, has no degrees.
