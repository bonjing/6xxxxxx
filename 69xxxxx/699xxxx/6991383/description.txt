[/b][/color] Face Off is a competition/elimination series exploring the world of special-effects make-up artists and the unlimited imagination that allows them to create amazing works of living art.
The contestants are tasked with elaborate feature challenges including executing full body paint make up on models and creating their own horror villain.
Not only will the show incorporate effects make-up, it will include a wide range of skill sets including prosthetics, 3-D design, sculpting, eye enhancers, casting and molding.
Each episode involves incredible reveals of the competitors' finished work, and the drama of one contestant being sent home by the panel of expert and celebrity judges.
It all culminates in one winner and one grand prize that will launch a career.
Face Off is a production of Mission Control Media with Michael Agbabian and Dwight Smith serving as executive producers.
