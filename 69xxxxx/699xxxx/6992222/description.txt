           Henry Hackett is the editor of a New York City         
           tabloid. He is a workaholic who loves his job, but     
           the long hours and low pay are leading to              
           discontent. Also, publisher Bernie White faces         
            financial straits, and has hatchetman Alicia Clark,   
           Henry's nemesis, impose unpopular cutbacks. Henry's    
           wife Martha, a hugely pregnant former reporter of      
           his, is fed up because he has so little time for his   
           family. He is therefore considering an offer from      
           Paul Bladden to edit a paper like the New York Times,  
         which would mean more money, shorter hours, more      
        respectability... but might also be a bit boring for   
        his tastes. But a hot story soon confronts Henry with   
        tough decisions.                                       
                                                                   
                                                
     
                                        
                  
                     
                            
                                                               
           Nothing much.
