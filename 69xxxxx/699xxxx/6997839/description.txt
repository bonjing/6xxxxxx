UPDATE  --&gt;&gt; This has been running for 2 weeks now, seems to work fine.


READ THE NFO.NFO file

This is a working version of Dragon Naturally Speaking PROFESSIONAL - NOT Premium!

This is an ISO that I DL'd, and checked with Vipre Antivirus as clean.

It has been installed and is running on a machine running Vista x64 SP2

It is already registered, but I have NOT tested it exhaustively, so I cannot guarantee that it works flawlessly, but so far, so good.

NOTE ----&gt;&gt;&gt; The Install will come up as the GERMAN version 11, 
             and will go through the COMPLETE install as such! 

             Google Translate as needed, but pretty straightforward

             AFTER completing the install, install the Update, 
             and you have the option to configure it as English.

Also, it has been quite some time since I have UL'd anything, so forgive any errors in the torrent.
