This is the owners manual from my 1968 Johnson MQ 9 1/2 horsepower outboard motor.  The Evinrude was the same with a different colour paint job.  I included some of the other information that came with the manual as well.

Please take the time to scan and share manuals you may have.  I personally have a large collection of old outboards, and would appreciate any information I could get for them.
