DESCRIPTION:

A growing body of research is showing that mindfulness can reduce stress, improve physical health, and improve oneâ€™s overall quality of life. Jan Chozen Bays, MDâ€”physician and Zen teacherâ€”has developed a series of simple practices to help us cultivate mindfulness as we go about our ordinary, daily lives. Exercises include: taking three deep breaths before answering the phone, noticing and adjusting your posture throughout the day, eating mindfully, and leaving no trace of yourself after using the kitchen or bathroom. Each exercise is presented with tips on how to remind yourself and a short life lesson connected with it.
