Note: Ripped from retail dvd9 included in the DVD/BD combo pack. English subtitles hardcoded for your convenience. This is from the studio that brought you things like Helldriver, and Tokyo Gore Police, so you know what to expect. If you're a fan of these wacky Japanese gore flicks, you're enjoy. Our apologies to the re-encoders. Nothing exciting for you this itme
