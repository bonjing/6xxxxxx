This book avoids the Android SDK wherever possible. All you need to follow along
with the vast majority of examples is a text editor and the most recent version of Google
Chrome (a cutting-edge web browser thatâ€™s available for both Mac and Windows at 
http://www.google.com/chrome). You do need to have the Android SDK for the Phone-Gap material in Chapter 7, where I explain how to convert your web app into a native
app that you can submit to the Android Market
