Caroline Quentin: A Passage through India
Caroline Quentin will take viewers on an epic journey through India for a brand new ITV1 series. Produced by Tiger Aspect, the 3x60 documentary Caroline Quentin: A Passage through India will provide a deeply personal insight into one of the world's most remarkable and diverse countries though the eyes of one of our best loved stars.
Starting in the far north, and working her way over 3500 miles to its southernmost tip, Caroline's eye-opening adventure aims to discover the rich spectrum of modern Indian life as well as challenge preconceptions, including her own, of the subcontinent. And to do that Caroline will plunge headlong into Indian society at every level: from Maharajas to mahouts, staying with local families en route.
Caroline will experience India's remarkable contrasts, from expansive, breathtaking landscapes such as Kanha National Park to dense, humid metropolises including Kolcutta and Mumbai, which encompass the extremes of wealth and often desperate poverty in close proximity. Taking in everything from ancient treasures to the high tech modernity of this self-styled 21st century Tiger state, the scale of her journey is immense. With Caroline at the helm the series will tell a human story as she connects with the lives of the ordinary Indians she meets along the way in order to explore what - in this country of incredible, often incongruous diversity - modern India really is and what its future holds.


1)  Episode 1 
The actress immerses herself in Indian life as she travels the sub-continent from north to south. She begins in the chaotic city of Varanasi, taking a boat ride on the River Ganges and attending an evening ceremony in which thousands of people light lamps and pray to the river. After catching a sleeper train to Jodhpur, Caroline gets the chance to see the Taj Mahal in Agra, before visiting an infertility clinic in the small Gujarat town of Anand, where couples from other countries hire Indian women to carry their children

2)  Episode 2 
The actress travels by camel to the 'Golden City' of Jaisalmer, Rajasthan, where she meets Princes Shakti and Vikram Singh and hears about the history of the fort in which many of the population still live. Caroline then returns to Gurjarat to attend an Indian festival at Ahmedabad, before ending the second leg of her journey in the cosmopolitan city of Mumbai. Here, she learns more about the stray dogs that roam the streets, receives fashion tips from a Bollywood actress and watches a display of gymnastics

3)  Episode 3 
The actress travels through Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu to the sub-continent's southern tip, visiting the 'City of Palaces' Mysore, where she receives a guided tour by a snake guru. Caroline ventures into the Malnad region to track down a healer who claims he can cure cancers, before helping to bathe elephants in the Keralan backwaters. Her journey ends with a dip in the holy waters of Kanyakumari, where the Bay of Bengal, the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea meet
