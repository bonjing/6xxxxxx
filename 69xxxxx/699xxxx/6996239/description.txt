A fan version of Return of the Jedi. The source is from a blu-ray rip. Two changes have been done to this version of the film:

1. Vader's "Nooooooooo" has been removed.
2. Hayden Christensen's scene has been replaced with the original scene by Sebastian Shaw

Otherwise, it's the same as the Blu-ray release.
