Macross - Do You Remember Love (2012 Remaster) [H.264-AC3-SUB]


So now that I got your attention know that this is not a "real" remaster, but I have used the DVD image to create a great looking and sounding mkv file with Handbrake.  Handbrake's de-noiser makes this image look IMMENSELY better when blown up on an HDTV.  The pictures a little soft, but it looks more like the original cel animation  as opposed to the worn film element that was used for the DVD.  I also transferred the AC3 over without any re-compression and cropped the image perfectly to remove all dead space.  Who knows if this will ever get a Blu-ray release so I hope my "remastering" is well received by you Otakus :-)
