Soulver helps you do quick calculations and work things out. It's quicker to use than a spreadsheet, and smarter and clearer than a traditional calculator.

You type out your problems as you would on paper, and Soulver calculates your answer as you type. You can do calculations over multiple lines, and use words alongside your numbers so they make sense.
