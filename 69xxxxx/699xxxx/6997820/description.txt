From England to Australia in a World War I Bomber..."Vimy I, cleared to land," radioed the control tower. "Welcome back to Darwin after all these years." With those words, the dream of Peter McMillan, an American, and Lang Kidby, an Australian, was realized: to recreate a 1919 flight from England to Australia that showed the feasibility of long distance air travel. This journey chronicles this record-breaking flight that marked the beginning of commercial aviation. Resurrecting original blueprints, McMillan and Kidby built a World War I era Vickers Vimy biplane bomber with open cockpit and cotton-covered wings, fitting it with modern engines and navigation gear. You'll witness the joy of cruising over the Taj Mahal and the aftermath of a crash landing on Sumatra. This story interweaves the 1919 and 1994 adventures, separated by 75 years but united in a common spirit of daring in The Greatest Flight. Alcock and Brown's flight happened when a spirit for adventure and incredible skill combined to accomplish a truly heroic act. Today, significant pioneering and invention often happens at the far reaches of science and at the molecular level; invention appears out of reach today.

The Vimy project was organized in 1993 by Peter McMillan and Lang Kidby to build a flying replica of the 1919 Vickers Vimy and relive its historic flights across the globe. This Vimy has flown nearly 40,000 miles (64,000 kilometers) at this point, touching down in 35 countries, reminding all who see her of the bravery, proficiency, and self-reliance demonstrated by the pioneers of aviation. This machine has truly become the "Galleon of the Skies," as she was known in 1919. The project has been driven entirely through volunteer enthusiasm with the critical assistance of corporate and media partners including the National Geographic Society. The Vickers Vimy replica that flew across the Atlantic has become almost as famous as its original ancestors, whose feats also include the first London to Australia flight in 1919 and the first London to Cape Town flight in 1920.
