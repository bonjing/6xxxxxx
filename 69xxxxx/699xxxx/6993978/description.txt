ÃžÃ›Ã     Deep within the Depths of Thurl, a man of pure power and speed makes
ÃžÃÃ     his home. This man, Kovo, enjoys the simple pleasures of life: a      
 Ã›      little music, a soft place to rest his feet and, of course, his       
 Ãž      polymer pal, Paco. Enter The Satellite of Wub, a monstrous villain    
 Ã›      that dares to strike down Kovoâ€™s plastic pet flamingo. With a shake   
 Ã›      of his mighty fist, Kovo begins his journey to exact revenge upon      
ÃžÃÃ     the beastly machine that trashed his friend and home. Follow Kovoâ€™s    
ÃžÃ›Ã     adventure as he traverses his home planet, defies an inexplicably evil 
ÃžÃž      factory and finally leaps from vessel to vessel to destroy the        
ÃžÃ›Ã     colossal Satellite of Wub.
