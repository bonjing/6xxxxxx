When the fighters and the annoucers (Mike and Joe) talk it doesn't quite match up with what is going on in the back ground! I guess the one good thing is, it is not as bad as some of the ones from UFC 140 and UFC 141! I would say watch on pc and delete, Don't waste your time converting to Dvd!
I think the UFC has figured out they can't stop people from recording it, but they can do the next best thing, make it less enjoyable!"
