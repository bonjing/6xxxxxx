L'Inde FantÃ´me (aka Phantom India) (Malle, 1969)-aNaRCHo

ENGLISH SUBS INCLUDED FOR ALL EPISODES AS SUB + IDX

"Phantom India: Reflections on a Journey" is an epic 7 part cine-essaylogue (travelogue + cine-essay) during which we are shown the people, places, practices, customs, Gods, celebrations, festivals, rituals, cultures, mythology, traditions, castes, religions, gurus, minorities, food, art, economics, politics, and various ways of life found throughout India, as seen through the camera lens of Louis Malle. Malle does not remove himself from the documentary in an objective way, rather, we are poetically led through the documentary as if experiencing India from the eyes and mind of Malle himself- much like Chris Marker, but with more vanity and ego. It is absolutely fascinating being immersed in late 60's India, and seeing it through the reflections of Malle makes it interesting, entertaining and at times even humourous! Malle does not hide the fact that he is is essentially ignorant to many (if not most) of the practices and customs of which Indians (especially the Upper Castes) cling to and hold so dear. Some of them he finds intriguing while others he finds to be nothing but exploitative.

Episode 5 is ripped at a different aspect ratio with black bars on the sides....i apologize for this....this was the best i could tweak it without making the AR all wonky....the episode had black bars on all sides on the DVD (the only episode like this) , looked like they forgot to resize it or something.
