The son of the legendary Leonard Cohen, all his life Adam had sought an artistic space beyond the reach of his father s looming shadow. But in January 2007, at the age of 34, Adam Cohen owned up to his legacy. After years of declining to sing in public so much as a single note written by his father or to participate in any tribute, on stage in Barcelona, Adam sang Leonard s classic song Take This Waltz in Spanish. Intimate, romantic yet shrewdly reflective, Adam s songs on Like A Man evoke something of his father just as in any child you can discern the echo of the parent. But there is Adam s own unique and distinct voice and perspective too a plain-speaking style freighted with disarming candour. Like A Man is steeped in my recognizing that I am in the family business. Despite my efforts to carve out a different identity, really I belong to a long line of people who have embraced their father s business. And to have my father pronounce that I have world-class love songs on my record Like A Man and What Other Guy is a deeply gratifying compliment. Born in Montreal, Canada in 1972 to Leonard Cohen and his then-wife Suzanne Elrod, Adam has been a musician ever since he could walk, always banging on teacups and the backs of chairs, stomping my foot and trying to whistle . A home full of instruments encouraged Adam s unabashed musical fearlessness and, though only formally tutored on violin, he taught himself to play drums, piano and guitar moderately well . Adam grew up immersed in Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, Randy Newman and Bob Marley albums, unless I was hanging out with my dad when the turntable skewed more to Hank Williams, or, with my mother, to Marvin Gaye. Adam is not alone as a musician both helped and burdened by the legacy of legendary parents. I've spent time with Jakob Dylan and Sean Lennon. Chris Stills and I have long been close friends, and Rufus Wainwright is now part of my family he fathered my sister s child. I can assure you there is no secret handshake in the sons of club. Yes, we all inherited good names, and possibly even some talent. But when you're in a room alone, your last name is not writing songs for you or making good decisions for you. Stronger than your last name is your personal ability and strength to forge your own voice. Rufus, for example, really found his voice early. I came to mine embarrassingly late.
