A bored and domesticated Shrek pacts with deal-maker Rumpelstiltskin to get back to 
feeling like a real ogre again, but when he's duped and sent to a twisted version 
of Far Far Away -- where Rumpelstiltskin is king, ogres are hunted, and he and 
Fiona have never met -- he sets out to restore his world and reclaim his true love.
