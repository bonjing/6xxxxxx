DESCRIPTION:

With the surge in popularity of small flash photography, this guide is a timely resource for shutterbugs looking to take full advantage of a growing trend. Studio flash systems are expensive, unwieldy, and often require the help of a hired assistant. The advent of the small flash allows working photographers to avoid large investments, gives them mobility when traveling to off-site photo shoots, and offers them functionality for illuminating small areas.
