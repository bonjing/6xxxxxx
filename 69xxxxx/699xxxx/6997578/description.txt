Get ready for an all new experience with Amnesia. Your name is Daniel and you're lost. Wandering around in the cold forest you find a unknown door. Without thinking you enter it, without knowing the consequences. Upon entering, you notice something is following you. You run, as fast as possible but it's already too late. Upon waking up, you think of one thing. Get out of here, as fast as possible.
