What is Raduga?

Raduga is the software that makes radio automation easier.

Raduga lets you create a playlist simply by dragging audio files from the Explorer into the Raduga window. You can rearrange the songs by dragging them with the mouse from one position to another. When you're finished with the playlist, turn on your radio equipment, press the play button and you are on air. That's it.
