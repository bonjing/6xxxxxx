 Safari Vet School is presented by Steve Leonard. The series follows the       
 different fortunes of some student vets, as they come face to face with some  
 of Africas larget animals during a life-changing two week summer placement at
 the 15,000 acre Amakhala Game Reserve in the Eastern Cape of South Africa.
