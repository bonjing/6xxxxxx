Not even a dual layer DVD is that big to start with, since the maximum you can fit on a dual layer DVD is 9.3 GB.
The whole point in using an AVI file format for video file sharing is to create much smaller files than the MPEG format VOB files on the DVD.

You still haven't learned how to turn a DVD into an AVI file of a predetermined size.
Most AVI files are in the 700 MB to 1400 MB range.

Download AutoGK, and then start making proper AVI rips that others will want.
