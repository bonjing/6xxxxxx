 Imagine a make-up girl who became an extra  
 and then the most wanted heroine of the     
 early 80s.Chronicling the meteoric rise     
 and steep fall of the erstwhile screen      
 sensation - Silk Smitha, The Dirty Picture  
 is set against the colorful and entertaining
 backdrop of the South film industry of the  
 80's.The quintessential siren, Silk, knew   
 her audiences, and it didn't seem like      
 anything would stop the fiercely ambitious  
 starlet, till it did, in the shape of       
 unrequited love. To the world, she was the  
 queen of sensuality. But at heart, Silk was 
 just another woman craving true love.
