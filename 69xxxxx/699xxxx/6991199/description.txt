Episodes 1-4, the Adventures of the ASOS Brigade 

Despite the series title, Haruhi Suzumiya is anything but melancholy: she's an eccentric, outspoken high school girl who's searching for "aliens, time travelers, and espers." To aid her search, she founds a new club, The SOS Brigade, and blithely usurps space, shanghais members, and steals equipment. When she gives orders, Kyon, the long-suffering narrator, obeys, as do the three other members. Although she doesn't realize it, Haruhi has actually found what she's looking for in her recruits: Yuki is an alien, Mikuru is a time traveler, and Itsuki is an esper. Kyon is normal--at least superficially. Haruhi possesses extraordinary but unrevealed powers that draw the exotic cast to her. Based on a series of best-selling novels by Nagaru Tanigawa, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya overflows with zany energy. Like Dokkoida and Magical Shopping ArcadeAbenobashi, the characters make fun of the clichÃ©s of anime and otaku culture. The challenge for the filmmakers is to maintain this level of insanity while presenting a coherent story. (Rated 13 and older: cartoon violence, risquÃ© humor) --Charles Solomon
