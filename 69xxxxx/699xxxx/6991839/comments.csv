ut most of the numbers in mp3 compression originally came from a psychoacoustic model derived from electrodes connected to dissected living frogs ears. Apart from the disturbing nature of this, there is not enough similarity between human and frogs ears for this baseline to be satisfactory. I would hope that nobody ever intends to carry out similar experiments on living humans. If you want mp3's so much just re-encode it. The reason mp3's are so much smaller in filesize is because they use lossy/lousy compression which removes data that the model predicts will not be heard by the human ear. On computer playback with cheap/standard speakers there is little difference to be honest. But the discarded sound information does become noticeable under two circumstances that I have seen non-natural sounds (techno/drum-and-base/acid and even some johnny cash tunes) or when played back on high end speakers. Then it is a matter of garbage in garbage out. I choose flac. It is trivial to go from flac to mp3 but impossible to go from mp3 to flac, because once you have thrown the information away it is not possible to get it back. "
