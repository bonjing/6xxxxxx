Vive Le Tour! (Malle, 1962)-aNaRCHo

ENGLISH SUBTITLES INCLUDED AS SUB + IDX

"Vive Le Tour" is an intimate, bizarre, somewhat  humourous- and very cinematic- look at the intricacies and internal politics of the Tour de France. Existing somewhere between comedy and documentary, Malle gives us the privilege of observing the tour, it's riders, the fans, and even the journalists like never before. Chock full of non-diegetic sounds and epic musical numbers we watch as journalists feast, sleep and basically live on their motorcycles while they cover the racers; as injured racers are airlifted in coffins attached to the outside of an oldschool medivac copter; and as racers stop, run into restaurants and raid everything from beer to soda, which they carry with them and drink as they ride (after which the Tour is billed lol). If you aren't impressed by how some riders are able to urinate without stopping...then I don't know what will!!! A truly bizarre and entertaining look at the Tour de France like you've never seen! Interesting to note that "doping" was a serious problem that was threatening the sport even in 1962!
