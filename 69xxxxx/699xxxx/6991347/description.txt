Three Dead Zed is a 2D action platformer game intended for digital distribution on the PC. It is being developed by a small team of programmers and artists who, for years, have been working for "The Man" and developing games more for educational purposes with limitations imposed by clients. Implementing our bizarre sense of humor, we have been given the opportunity to bring you a game that feels original, despite having zombies.

It's no secret the government wants to weaponize the dead. Just look at how many zombie games there are! But this time, it's all different. You are the project. You are the zombie. Unlike the thousands of other zombies, you're a bit smarter. You don't just run about aimlessly looking for your next meal. You can understand speech and can take orders. Project Z.E.D. has finally broken through and made a zombie into a potential weapon. In addition to understanding, you are imbued with the ability to change form, switching between zombie abilities.
