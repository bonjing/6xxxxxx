Plot: Lives of three very different sets of friends dealing with the ups and downs of friendship. The first story follows Halley and Avalon, best friends who are overjoyed when a publisher wants to turn their fashion blog into a magazine, but their friendship is put to the test when they learn that the magazine only wants one of them to stay on as senior editor. The second story follows the inseparable science-whiz Jake and his dog, Murray. Jake is excited to introduce Murray to his new science project partner (and crush), Julianne, but thereâ€™s something about her that Murray just doesnâ€™t like â€“ and the feeling is mutual. In the last story, tomboy Savannah, who comes from a large high-energy family, meets privileged uptown girl Emma, who looks like her twin. The two girls become fast friends and decide to trade places for a while, but realize that life on the other side isnâ€™t all that itâ€™s cracked up to be.
