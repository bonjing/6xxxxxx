The Alex Jones Show
Sunday, 29 January 2012


[sebaygo1]


The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events.

The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.

Today on this live Sunday, January 29 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex takes on the full spectrum of attacks facing society. From new wars, a domestic clampdown, the on-going economic crisis and the bombardment of food, water and environment with dangerous chemical compounds, humanity is under attack. Alex also talks about a proposed New Jersey ban on ammunition, a de facto circumvention of the Bill of Rights' guarantee to the right to bear arms. The Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) culture of lying is also in focus, with the recent release of Infowars' viral video TSA: The Greatest Liars on Earth. In other news, police fire tear gas and rubber bullets on Occupy Oakland protesters while the former Federal Reserve boss Herman Cain seeks to deliver his Tea Party supporters to the Newt Gingrich presidential campaign. The ACTA bill, like the SOPA and PIPA acts, threaten the future of Internet freedom.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
