NOTES
============
Whoever is copying my torrents from The Pirate Bay to BTJunkie, there's no need.  I actually post my torrents to BTJ FIRST... unfortunately, their server takes about 12-24 hours to display the torrent in their search results.  -_-;

Concerning web seeds:  I only have space for about 4 of these videos.  Older ones will be deleted to make room.  Don't forget to keep seeding!

Screenshots of this and other ~450MB MKVs can be viewed here:


**MKV files are compatible with media players such as Media Player Classic, VLC, ALLPlayer, foobar2000 and PowerDVD.  For other compatibility, try installing The Combined Community Codec Pack, or consult the website of your preferred media player.

PLEASE SEED LIKE CRAZY (That is, um, if you don't mind...)  Expect moar torrents from yours truly of single episodes, and another for the full season as the episodes come out; until then, I will continue to seed this and other single-video torrents that need it.

Enjoy your ponies, and don't forget to support the show and its community!  :D
