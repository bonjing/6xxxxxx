    Kathi Seenu (Nikhil) is a good young      
    man but a troublemaker. His activities    
    bring trouble to his family but his       
    Bava (Krishna Bhagawan) supports him.     
    However, one incident challenges Kathi    
    Seenu to find a girl, fall in love and    
    marry her. In this process, he comes      
    across Meghana (Pooja) at a wedding and   
    falls in love with her.However, Meghana   
    is allergic to love and she rejects       
    Seenuâ€™s moves. On the other hand, the     
    notorious Liquor Shankar (Sayaji) is      
    searching desperately for Meghana. Who    
    is Liquor Shankar? Why does he want       
    Meghana? What happens to Kathi Seenuâ€™s    
    love story? All this forms the rest of    
    the story.
