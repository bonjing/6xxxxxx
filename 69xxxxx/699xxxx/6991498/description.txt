Ben Ravencroft, a famous horror writer of whom Velma is a big fan, assists the Mystery, Inc. gang in solving a case at a museum. Afterwards, Ben invites the gang to his home town of Oakhaven in New England. But when they arrive, they find that the town has been built up by Mayor Corey into a tourist attraction, complete with a replica of the town in the 17th century and the supposed ghost of a witch who haunts the town. Mayor Corey and pharmacist Mr. McKnight explain that the ghost is Sarah Ravencroft, a relative of Ben's, who was persecuted as a witch by the town in 1657. But Ben says that Sarah was actually a Wiccan who used natural herbs to heal people, and even has a diary of all her patients that Ben wants to find to prove her innocence. Scooby and Shaggy find what appears to be a shoe buckle, and then go to a local diner for food, owned by the friendly Jack.
