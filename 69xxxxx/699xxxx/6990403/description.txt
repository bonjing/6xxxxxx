[/b][/color] Touch follows the lives of three people: Kazuya and Tatsuya Uesugi  identical twin brothers  and Minami Asakura.
They ve lived next to each other since they were babies, and their parents even built a playhouse in the yard in order to keep them from damaging the houses.
As they grew into their teens, they suddenly noticed that one of them was a girl, and Kazuya and Minami became closer.
Kazuya, the younger twin, was an excellent student  as was Minami .
