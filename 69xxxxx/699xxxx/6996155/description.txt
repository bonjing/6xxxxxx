We are proud to release the results of 3 days of hard work doing mostly nothing, a pre-release alpha version of alterMW3. Only matchmaking is implemented at this point, and other features (FOV changing, possibly modification support, dedicated servers, friend inviting, ...) will come at a later time.

Be aware the game is not guaranteed to work, and might cause the DemonWare server to crash heavily.
