NOTES:

Ok first thanks to Asda for the vobs files ....nice looking dvd so nothing major done to it except crop,resize and sharpen.
Audio had to tracks so took the 448 5.1 track and remuxed to our rip.
Now readnfo ....
If you scroll up you'll see the IMDB link and another ....the IMDB link says 2002 and seems to be a limited release from then,however
the second link show you the actually dvd was never released till 23.1.12 ......seems they thought hmm tom hardy lets release that after
hes been in warrior and starring in batman and earn a few quid.
Anyway checked all my topsites and can't find a rip of this so here you go
