Description:
Documentary celebrating the life of legendary 
New Zealand comedian, Billy T James. Directed 
by Ian Mune (Came A Hot Friday).

The film explores Billys extraordinary talent 
as musician, singer, comedian, actor, writer 
and artist (and even attempts to uncover the 
source of his trademark giggle). The film tells 
of Billys meteoric rise to national fame and 
his tragic downfall into ill-health and financial 
collapse.

Featuring digitally re-mastered footage of Billys 
performances and never-seen-before archival images, 
Billy Ts story is set alongside interviews with 
his family, friends and colleagues.

Notes: Contains footage in 4:3
