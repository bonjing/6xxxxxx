Plot:

Will and his father live a simple and pastoral life in the mountains, unconcerned with the goings-on of the neighboring lowlands. When Willâ€™s father is killed by a dragon, Will must journey down the mountain and use a mysterious family connection from years earlier to start squiring for Sterling, a once-wealthy land owner and knight. Unwelcomed for his backward, mountain ways, Will is put to work on the struggling farm. He soon befriends Sterlingâ€™s headstrong daughter Kate, and the two of them begin working together to uncover the secrets of their familiesâ€™ connection and to prepare Will for his final battle with the dragon, in which he will avenge his fatherâ€™s death and prove himself a man.
