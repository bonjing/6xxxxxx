Another family of mine, hollow-core slab, 220mm thick, 1200mm wide. Created in Revit Architecture 2012.
The parameters you can modify are the bars'material, slab's material, length, bars'extension.

I created the family for my 4th semester project.

This family as well as the other one http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6987670/HCS_180_United_Precast_Concrete_Slab are based on the danish manufacturers, but if you require different thickness feel free to modify the family or let me know, i can do it for ya.


Hope it will be useful to you.
