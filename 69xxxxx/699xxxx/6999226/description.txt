[/b][/color] Little Mosque On The Prairie is a Canadian sitcom on the CBC, which focuses on the comedic outlook of a small Muslim community interacting with the citizens of a little prairie town in Canada.
The sitcom reveals that although we are different in ethnicity and in skin color, we are all surprisingly similar when it comes to family, love, the generation gaps, and our attempts to balance our secular and religious lives while trying to understand those of others in the community.
