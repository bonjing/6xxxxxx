The story of a non-accomplisher richly married Italian aristocrat who falls on love with a Russian girl and travels to 19th century Russia to find her again, told by the same man to a Russian passenger on a cruise ship several years later. An amazingly good looking film written by Mikhalkov, Aleksandr Adabashyan and Suso Cecchi D Amico.
