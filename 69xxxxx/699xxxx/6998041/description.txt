XTC were a New Wave band from Swindon, England, active between 1976 and 2005. The band enjoyed 
some chart success, including the UK and Canadian hits "Making Plans for Nigel" (1979) and
Senses Working Overtime" (1982), but are perhaps even better known for their long-standing 
critical (rather than commercial) succes

Early years: 1972â€“1977

First coming together in 1972, the core duo of Andy Partridge (guitars & vocals) and Colin 
Moulding (bass & vocals) went through many band names (including The Helium Kidz and Star 
Park) over the next five years. As the Helium Kidz, they were featured in a small NME article 
as an up-and-coming band from Swindon. Drawing influence from the New York Dolls, particularly 
the "Jetboy" single and the emerging New York punk scene, they played glam rock with homemade 
costumes and slowly built up a following. Drummer Terry Chambers joined in 1973. Keyboard player 
Jonathan Perkins followed, replaced by Barry Andrews in 1976, and the band finally settled on 
a name: XTC.
