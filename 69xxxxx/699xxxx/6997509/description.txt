This is the one people were looking for, found it at Kaskus. It has the Accusim 1.2 update. Seed it because I will have to free up my bandwidth for subsequent uploads.

I am seeing a lot of requests for titles I have, but I can't keep up with all the torrents' comments. If you post in my thread or send me a PM there is a much better chance what you want will get made into a torrent.





Please visit my thread in the Suprbay forums. There you can see the latest news, drop a comment and use the private message system to contact me directly. That forum has a rating system similar to the quality field found at the top of all torrents. Perhaps you'd like to say hi or show your support.
