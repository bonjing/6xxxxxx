In this eighth book of the series, former CIA assassin Donovan Creed finds himself at odds with mob-connected Tony Spumoni and practically everyone else he knows, including his boss Darwin, lover Gwen, daughter Kimberly, protege Callie, co-worker Lou, physician Doc Howard, assorted board members, terrorists, and even a zoo full of angry monkeys! Preliminary reviews: â€œI know this makes me appear insane, but all week Iâ€™ve burst into laughter at the most inappropriate times because of this book!â€ â€œI wanted to stop turning pages, but couldnâ€™t!â€ â€œVintage Locke: lightning-fast dialogue, crazy situations, insane twists and turns, and general craziness!â€
