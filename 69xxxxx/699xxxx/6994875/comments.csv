,jimbuck2,2012-01-30T07:11Z,Two personal favorites are mobi pocket (mobipocket.com) and fbr reader (fbrreader.org).  Mobi is the more popular reader and tends to provide better graphics but sometimes won't open a file.  That's when fbr reader kicks in.  These two readers will work for most mobi and epub files.
