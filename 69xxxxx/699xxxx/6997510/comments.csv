Then all comments would simply be well done, love your work and a/v quality
Why not be part of the solution and just seed  the best or latest one like everyone else?
 It helps no one, except yourself maybe?
You just make it harder to sift through the quagmire of poor copied uploads and scammers. 
Once again really appreciate uploaders but still can't understand why you think it is helpful to upload a worse version
Surely ripoff larger poor quality uploads is exactly what the comments section is for moaning about, that and why we don't have flying cars yet of course
Once again hope my original comment was helpful"
