Are you stressed out over how to feed your family a nutritious meal at the end of a long, busy day without turning to convenience foods or the drive-through? Now, the nationâ€™s most trusted authority on heart-healthy living presents a cookbook bursting with nourishing, flavorful recipes to please the palates of family members of all ages. Since the main dish is usually the starting point of meal planning, more than half the recipes in this book are for entrees.

Hereâ€™s how theyâ€™re organized:
â€¢ Everyday Dinners
â€¢ Busy Nights
â€¢ Plan-Aheads
â€¢ Cook Once, Eat Twice

To help you incorporate additional vegetables, fruits, and grains into your familyâ€™s diet, weâ€™ve included Make It a Meal, a special feature that suggests accompanimentsâ€“salads and soups, vegetable and grain side dishes, and even dessertsâ€“for many of the main dishes.
