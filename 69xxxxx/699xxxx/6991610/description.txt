My eighth bundle for Tiesto's Club Life radio show.  I plan on seeding forever, unless I have a hardware crash or ISP issues, both of which are short-term situations.  I would appreciate other people helping to seed, and please be patient as my upload speed is not very fast.


The episodes were sourced from DJLellone, mika7272, and Talion.  Bundles tend to survive better than single torrents for each episode, so let's keep this one going forever!


Trackers used:

And of course, as always, DHT and PEX.
