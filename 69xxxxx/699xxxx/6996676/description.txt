         Two sisters have encounters with a wealthy family.       
         The younger sister is rejected by the son of the         
         wealthy family. The older sister becomes a good          
         friend of the wealthy mother, whose most cherished       
         possession is their cottage at Howard's End,             
       and wishes fervently that Thompson could live there,    
      as they are kindred spirits. Over the course of years,   
      the older sister marries into the wealthy family,         
      and the family tries to keep her from taking             
      possession of Howard's End.
