COSMO TECHâ”¤s psytrance style is opening cosmic windows to the attention of trancers worldwide and has moved on to first base this time with his new digital EP release "Base 1", available now on 24/7 Records.
The first base is comprised of 2 solo tracks from Cosmo Tech, one uplifiting and full on, the other one deep and solid with underground tones. Track 3 is a remix of Kronicâ”¤s all time hit 
"Behind The Sun", an interesting techy twist on the much loved classic.

Cosmo Tech is the psy trance project formed by the DJ Yuri based in Brasilia (capital of Brazil). His music is marked by groovy bass lines and fresh new synthesizer sounds.
