Described as a childrens version of Survivor, the show features two teams of children (BjÃ¶rnarna and Lejonen) competing with each other in competitions in the Swedish forest KolmÃ¥rden, where they live together until the show is over and the winners of the final win a trip to Africa. Unlike Survivor, however, a new contestant joins the competition every week and no one gets sent home. The new contestant joins the team that won that weeks competition. The goal is to have as many contestants as possible in ones team as it will give the team an advantage in competitions and eventually the final.

Original description:
This is Wild Kids from Spring of 2005 on SVT (Sveriges Television). Only Swedish
speech, and no subtitles. Video quality for 10 of the episodes is ok. One episode
was only available in Real Media format. Its quality sucks. The last episode came
out right after SVT.se upgraded their video to a higher bitrate, so the final episode
is great quality.
12 1-hour episodes of a great TV series. Excellent supplement for people learning
the swedish language.
