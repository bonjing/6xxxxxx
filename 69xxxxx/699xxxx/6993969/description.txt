 ,Set in modern Birmingham, "Land Gold Women"  
 revolves around a small British Asian family  
 caught between their traditional past and     
 the tumultuous, faction-driven present.       
 Nazir Ali Khan, a soft-spoken, 45-year-old    
 professor of History at a University in       
 Birmingham, emigrated from India in the       
 1980's. He made Birmingham his home with his  
 conservative wife Rizwana and their two       
 children, Saira, 17 and Asif, 14. He indulges 
 their interests in all things English and     
 Western but now finds himself increasingly    
 nostalgic about his roots. Saira, with a year 
 to complete her graduation, is excited at the 
 prospect of going to university to pursue her 
 interest in Literature. She also hopes that   
 this will give her more time to spend with    
 David, her aspiring writer boyfriend. At this 
 critical juncture in her life, Nazir finds
