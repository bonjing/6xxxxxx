Lord, another one of these ""at least he uploaded something"" crap....

Yeah, something you can already freely download directly from Microsoft hella faster than here.

You strike me as the kind of person who would wash a clean car and demand credit for it. 

Tell you what, I'll hurry up and go upload a bunch of public domain freeware from the net and password protected null files. Will that make my opinion anymore valid? Atleast I uploaded something, right? Idiot."
