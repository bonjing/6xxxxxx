Christmas Conspiracy part 2 (episode 23)
----------------------------------------

Oh my god, it hurts. Oh go on then, just a small turkey sandwich and a few quality street with my cuppa then. Sit back and relax with some choice cold cuts as we say goodbye to 2011.

====== About the Comfort Conspiracy =============


Comfort Conspiracy is a fortnightly music podcast brought to you by Phil â€˜Jentulmanâ€˜ , Darren â€˜Stretcher Monkeyâ€˜ and Stephen â€˜So-Fiâ€™, based mainly around electronic, beat and bass driven styles it often features, but isnâ€™t limited to, Drum and Bass, Dubstep, Electronica, Hip-Hop and House.

We are all enthusiastic bedroom producers and DJâ€™s and decided that a podcast would be a great way to share the music we love with each other and the rest of the world, plus itâ€™s a lot of fun to sit with your mates listening to and talking about music; So why not record it at the same time?

Whilst the episodes reflect our personal tastes and therefor lean towards more electronic productions with a bias on beats, breaks, and bass, we have the good fortune to have friends with excellent taste who between them listen to a vast array of genres, so weâ€™ll be throwing in some curve balls into the mix, and inviting guests in on occasion to come and shake up the genres.

The main mission though is that each episode weâ€™ll be bringing you excellently produced tunes that weâ€™re playing loads personally in the week running up to recording and hopefully we might get a chance to introduce you to something that might have slipped by unnoticed.
