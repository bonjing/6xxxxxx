Aussie rock goddess Orianthi put on a rocking good show at the KL Live Center on Wednesday (04.08.2010).

Orianthi burst onto the stage shortly after 8.30pm, much to the excitement of the crowd. Decked in a black leather jacket, sequinned top and black and red leggings; armed with a red electric guitar and flanked by a bassist, guitarist and a drummer, the rock chick opened the show with her song "What It's Gonna Be".

Orianthi barely took a breather as she performed hit after hit, which includes "Suffocated", "Drive Away", "Think Like A Man", "Find It", "Bad News", "He's Gone", "Song For Steve", "Crazy" and her famous rock anthems, "According To You" and "Shut Up and Kiss Me". After rocking to several uptempo songs, Orianthi slowed it down a notch as she shared an intimate moment with the audience with her ballad "Courage".

Throughout the night, Orianthi demonstrated her awesome shredding skills which made her the superstar guitarist she is today. She proved a point during a three-minute guitar solo during her finale song "Voodoo" as the crowd went crazy.

BUT Sorry for the Sound Quality

Enjoy it
