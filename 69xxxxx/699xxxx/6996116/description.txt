Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 is the sequel to the three million selling, award winning real-time strategy game Red Alert. Red Alert 2 brings players back to the alternate universe of Red Alert with an onslaught of new units, tactics and strategies. As in the original, gamers can choose to lead Soviet or Allied forces. Soviet commanders will invade North America and try to claim it for mother Russia. Allied commanders will fight to push back the invaders and save liberty. Both sides are well armed with conventional weapons and experimental technology. The Soviets can engage in psychic warfare, wield nuclear weapons and fry all they survey with Tesla technology. Allied forces can teleport with chrono technology, conduct covert operations with the help of Gap Generators, and rain down lightning bolts through weather control. Supporting these high powered, advanced weapons are massive conventional forces, including armies, air power and navies.
