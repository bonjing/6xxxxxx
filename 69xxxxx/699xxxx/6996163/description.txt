Loaded Magazine UK â€“ March 2012

Loaded is the original, funniest and best mens magazine. Created in 1994 by a bunch of 
blokes with a love of football, girls, music and comedy, Loaded launched the mens lifestyle 
market. 17 years and over 200 issues have passed, but the magazines mantra still remains. 
Alan Partridge, Kevin Keegan, Frank Skinner, Noel Gallagher, Britney Spears, Kelly Brook 
and Vikki Blows have all graced the cover over the years. So whether youre after beautiful 
women, cutting edge journalism, interviews with the best actions and musicians, or just 
irreverent silly buggery, loaded will never disappoint.
