           Hamlet, son of the king of Denmark, is summoned        
           home for his father's funeral and his mother's         
           wedding to his uncle. In a supernatural episode,       
           he discovers that his uncle, whom he hates anyway,     
           murdered his father. In an incredibly convoluted       
           plot--the most complicated and most interesting in     
           all literature--he manages to (impossible to put       
           this in exact order) feign (or perhaps not to feign)   
           madness, murder the "prime minister," love and then    
           unlove an innocent whom he drives to madness, plot     
           and then unplot against the uncle, direct a play       
           within a play, successfully conspire against the       
         lives of two well-meaning friends, and finally take   
        his revenge on the uncle, but only at the cost of      
        almost every life on stage, including his own and       
        his mother's.                                          
                                                                   
                                                
     
                                        
                  
                     
                            
                                                               
           Although FRAGMENT released this movie a while ago -    
           due to demand, here's a version with 6ch AC3 sound     
           and higher video bitrate.
