Information
------------------------------

Spin 
David Shrigley is a Glasgow based artist, animator and cartoonist. On commission from BBC THREE, he spent a week creating public art from the daily news agenda for a programme called Spin. 
The aim is to show art responding quickly to daily preoccupations and Shrigley admits the rapid turnaround of at least a piece a day has been a challenge. 
So far his interpretations of daily events have led him to send a giant wearing the slogan "Binge drinking is our national heritage" into various Nottingham bars offering to buy members of the public a drink, and to post a giant billboard of a potter at the wheel with the catch line "Legalise pottery" outside Lancaster Boys School, that David Cameron was visiting.
