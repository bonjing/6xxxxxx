It started as a joke. Mick Turner one of Creamâ€™s roadies was discussing with drummer, Ginger Baker, how he fancied one of those bikes withâ€™ Disraeli gearsâ€™. He meant, of course, derailleur gears, but the band found the mistake hilarious and so the name of one of one of the UKâ€™s premier psychedelic albums was born.

By 1967 Cream had had one rather false start. Fresh Cream, their first album had been a rushed and rather too purist collection of blues standards and curios, and as such was already by 1966 considered out of step with what was occurring around them. â€œI Feel Freeâ€ had hinted at the wild lysergic undercurrent, but theyâ€™d yet to find their heartland in the London underground. One reason this had happened was because of the bandâ€™s backgrounds, not only in the blues (as Eric Clapton defected from John Mayallâ€™s Bluesbreakers) but also in Jazz; both Jack Bruce and Baker having served time with Graham Bond. Luckily this wide-ranging set of backgrounds was invaluable in their next step.

Second time around it was far different. Chemicals had been imbibed, Clapton had struck up a friendship with Australian artist Martin Sharp who not only provided the lyrics of â€œTales Of Brave Ulyssesâ€ but also came up with the splendidly baroque cover. Meanwhile Jack Bruce was now working with underground poet, Pete Brown, whose lyrics were equally trippy. â€œSWLABRâ€ (it stands for â€˜She walks like a bearded rainbowâ€™), â€œDance The Night Awayâ€ and â€œSunshine Of Your Loveâ€ were perfect encapsulations of the point where the blues got psychedelic and in turn got heavy. â€œSunshineâ€¦â€â€™s riff is at once iconic and defines the power trio aesthetic that was to prove so popular with the bandâ€™s many disciples.

The other creative catalyst was producer Felix Pappalardi. Co-writing both \\\"World Of Pain\\\" he also helped transform the blueswailing â€œLawdy Mamaâ€ into the slinky â€œStrange Brewâ€ â€“ a contender for best album opener of all time. Claptonâ€™s guitar had by now been exposed to the effects heavy stylings of Jimi Hendrix and his heavy use of wah-wah gives Disraeli Gears just the right amount of weirdness, making this probably the most experimental album he ever made. The modish inclusion of Ginger Bakerâ€™s rendition of â€œA Motherâ€™s lamentâ€ was the edwardiana icing on the cake. By the bandâ€™s demise, two years later Clapton had returned to his first love â€“ straight blues and the band had become the barnstorming power trio hinted at here. For a short time they were bringers of peace and love.
