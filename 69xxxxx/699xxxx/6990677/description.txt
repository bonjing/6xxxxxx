Previously we reported a firmware 4.0 mod by a developer name ps3hen. Today he has released
an updated version of his mod, namely PS3 4.0 Hybrid Firmware. In this second release he
has added debug XMB items, the removal of the PS Plus item and cinavia removal. Please
note that this requires you to be on custom firmware 3.55 and below, also a hardware flasher
is required.

Remember only retail signed .pkg can be installed with this. Have fun. THIS HFW WILL
NOT ALLOW HOMEBREW!
