Live wallpaper of Goku's Kamehameha vs Vegeta's Galick Gun from Dragon Ball Z.
Goku's Kamehameha vs Vegeta's Galick Gun from Dragon Ball Z. This is a live wallpaper inspired by one of the most memorable fights in DBZ history during the Saiyan saga.

Watch as Goku and Vegeta battle it out right on your homescreen. Filled with animations around the energy ball clash as it goes back and forth. This animated artwork is not meant to represent the anime version 100%, but rather my interpretation of a more realistic looking Kamehameha and Galick Gun.

Also, you could change the aggressiveness of the aura around Son Goku and Vegeta through the settings page.

Not a big fan of Dragon Ball but I'm releasing it couse is the only one out there so dedicated for the youth, Enjoy it!
