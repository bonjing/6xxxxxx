Better Day is the 41st studio album by American country recording artist Dolly Parton. It was released on June 28, 2011, as the second album from her Dolly Records label.

Better Day has received positive reviews from most music critics. The New York Times writer Nate Chinen offered praise for Parton's 'almost ageless' vocals. While Holly Gleason of Paste Magazine stated that Parton, 'juxtaposes superstardom with her down-home comfort zone' and continued that the album is a 'pop-country gem that empowers as it punches country radio's cliches with a freshness'. Allmusic's Steve Leggett commended that Better Day is, 'an energetic, spirited, and hopeful outing that rocks and soars with enough musical sunshine to light up even the grayest day' and wrote that Parton, 'has never sounded fresher or more spirited, she shows she still knows how to write a timeless song.'
