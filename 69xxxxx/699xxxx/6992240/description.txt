 The raw Project Bluesmote logs have been recompressed from
 GZIP into XZ format to reduce their size from 54GB to 18GB.
 Decompression speeds are as fast so enjoy the smaller logs.

 Then grep " PROXIED " was performed (notice the space) and
 dataset was further split into useful "data" and "dash"-ed
 lines, the entries which contain mostly dashes and no info.
