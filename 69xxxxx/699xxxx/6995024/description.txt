For the past 11 years TMT Sports has sold the most popular jump training program on the
market, Air Alert II: The Complete Vertical Jump Program - Revised. Although Air Alert
II has become a favorite around the world, we have worked to improve it. The Air Alert
III upgrade is the improved Air Alert. We changed the number of sets and reps, and, most
importantly, we changed the number of days per week that the program will be
completed which will help with overall muscle recovery and strength development. We
also added one new exercise, Squat Hopsâ„¢ to greatly benefit your vertical. Any topic
that you see on the Air Alert III upgrade MUST BE READ and followed as written.
When you see a word "CHANGE" beside of a heading, this means that a change has been
made from Air Alert II to Air Alert III.
