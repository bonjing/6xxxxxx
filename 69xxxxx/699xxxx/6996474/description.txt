Goku and Bulma set up a shelter to sleep in. At night, Goku goes out looking for some food. He sees a ship fly overhead, and, thinking that it is a bird, goes running after it. The ship belongs to Mai and Shu, who are servants of Emperor Pilaf. The Emperor is also looking for the Dragon Balls. Goku saves them from wolves, and heads back. In the morning, he finds a Giant turtle who is looking for the sea. Goku volunteers to take him there, so he picks up the turtle on his back and begins running, with Bulma following on her motorcycle.
