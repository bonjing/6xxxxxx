Napoleon.Dynamite.S01E03.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 85MB]

[/b][/color] Fans of the hit movie of the same name will be glad to see Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) and his weird family and friends are back, this time in a weekly animated series.
Napoleon is a 16-year-old who believes he is destined for greatness, although most people around him can't see why.
He lives with his unemployed 32-year-old brother at his grandmother's house in rural Idaho.
His friends, Pedro and Deb, are the faithful type, who see past Napoleon's strangeness and stand by his side through it all.
