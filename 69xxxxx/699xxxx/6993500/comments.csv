,panamalynn,2012-01-28T22:24Z,I know I don't say thanks every single day and I want you to know how much I truly appreciate what you do.  I live in Central America and without people like you I would have nothing from North America.  I live in a tiny fishing village with no video store or movie theatre.  We are so very fortunate to actually have internet.  Not fast but it does the job.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
