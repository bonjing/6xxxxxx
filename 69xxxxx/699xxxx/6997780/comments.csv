I have a little problem with the program. It has loaded fine but when I check via IE on whatsmyip.org it tells me my real ip address. When I check via Firefox it gives me the psuedo IP address I selected from the program! Also, I just checked on TPB and this website is showing my real ip address, too. I am on this website via IE.
Do you know of any problems?
Again, many thanks for your great work, no probs if you can't answer but if anybody else can help, much appreciated."
