It takes five minutes. It will terrify you. \'The Magic\' is regarded as the scariest short story ever published. Only 6% of readers will be able to follow the two pages of instructions all the way to the end. The other 94% will be to scared. Good luck...




\'The Dare\' cannot be tried alone - you MUST have at least one other person with you when you try it and you will need to allow an hour for the entire experience to unfold.

It is a uniquely horrifying experience which you will remeber for a long time, especially if you are brave enough to make it all the way to the end.

Make sure you can thrust the people whom you ask to join in \'The Dare\'
