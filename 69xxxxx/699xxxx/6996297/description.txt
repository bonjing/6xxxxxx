Recorded at the former Ess Lounge in Raleigh NC, this was the set I played as opening act for Treasure Fingers Fools Gold Records]. This one's got lost of garage-y, wobbly baseline goodness, but the 4x4 backbeat remains :)

All files are 320kbps, 44.1 sample rate, joint stereo mp3's

From FM:
"All my music is available here for free, but if you'd also like to support me (i.e. help me pay for rent, groceries, gas, etc), please visit my website and buy a track or two! I have no record label, no marketing machine (other than me), no gimmicks, just me and my choons! ...peace and beats :) -FM"

 


FM and Roy thank you :)
