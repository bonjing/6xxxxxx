Capture photos like a pro with ProCapture.

ProCapture adds advanced features to the Android camera experience. Multiple advanced shooting modes supported: Timer, Burst, Reduced Noise, WideShot and Panorama.

- Real-time on-screen histogram helps you get better exposed photos.

- Simple UI with easy access to all features.

- On-screen remaining photos indicator.

- Save to internal or external storage (please email us if external storage is not supported on your phone).


What's in this version:

- Fixed freeze while shooting in Reduced Noise mode with the histogram option on (last update wasn't a complete fix)
