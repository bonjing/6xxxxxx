A deliriously hyper-stylized masterpiece of Japanese art cinema, Zigeunerweisen inaugurated Suzukiâ€™s Taisho Trilogy and achieved instant cult status, earning the awestruck admiration of Wong Kar-wai, Jim Jarmusch, and Quentin Tarantino, and hailed by many critics as the best Japanese film of the 1980s. â€œSet in a 1920s Japan saturated with decadence and nihilism, Zigeunerweisen is the tale of a disparate quartet drawn together by unseen strings of fateâ€”and nearly driven mad by their own fears and desires. Aochi, a Japanese professor of German, vacations in a seaside town and discovers Nakasago, a former classmate, full-time vagabondâ€”and suspected serial killer. During their reunion, they both fall hard for the beautiful local geisha Koine. But when Nakasago marriesâ€”and abandonsâ€”eerie Koine-lookalike Sono, the men's mutual obsession for Koine escalates into paranoia and treachery spiked with undercurrents of witchcraft and the sinister presence of supernatural denizensâ€ (~Ian Stimler, KIMSTIM).
