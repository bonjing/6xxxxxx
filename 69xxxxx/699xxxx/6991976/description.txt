A pivotal figure in UK pub rock, punk rock and new wave, Lowe has recorded a string of well-reviewed solo albums. Along with vocals, Lowe plays guitar, bass guitar, piano and harmonica. He is best known for his songs Cruel to Be Kind (a US Top 40 single), and I Love the Sound of Breaking Glass (a top 10 UK hit), as well as his production work with Elvis Costello, Graham Parker, and others.

Lowe produced Elvis Costello's first five albums, including My Aim Is True, This Year's Model, and Armed Forces. He also produced The Damned's first single, New Rose, considered the first English punk single, as well as the group's debut album, Damned Damned Damned. His early 'rough and ready' production style earned him the nickname Basher (as in 'bash it out now, tart it up later'). Upon moving from Stiff to Jake Riviera's Radar and F-Beat labels, Lowe became selective in his choice of production tasks.
