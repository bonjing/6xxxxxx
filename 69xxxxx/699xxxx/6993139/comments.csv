Suppose there's a large file that I want. I come to TPB and I find one upload of it, and there are 100 people seeding. I'm thrilled, I'm able to download it VERY quickly from 100 people working together, and as soon as I'm done there are now 101 people, including me, seeding it, so the next person is very happy too.

Now, imagine that I come here for that same file. This time, I find that 100 different dupes of it are available, each with one person seeding it. I choose one at random, having no clue which one might be best, and it takes hours, perhaps days, perhaps weeks for me to download the file from that one person. When I'm done, there are now only two seeders on that version, and still just one seeder on each of the other 99 versions. The next person who wants that file finds that no matter which of the options he picks, the download still takes hours, maybe days, maybe weeks.

Now do you see why SEARCHING and NOT UPLOADING DUPLICATES files is crucial to the existence of any torrent site? Many sites, in fact, ban all dupes and ban the members who upload them. This one does not, but when people like me report unnecessary dupes, or uploaders who don't get it after repeated warnings, the files and/or members are eventually removed. That's the ONLY way to keep things moving here with any speed at all. Dupes are BAD for a torrent site. Yes, that's right: if you don't search first, uploading is BAD for TPB, even if you think you're doing the right thing.

(And that doesn't even speak to the lesser problem of clutter. All those duplicate files just increase the clutter that we all have to look through while we search for the file we want. That's not as big a deal, because the search function here works very well. But because it does work so well -- for god's sake, USE SEARCH, and do NOT UPLOAD DUPES!!!)"
