AND MIDSIZE BUSINESSES

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Large or small, every company can profit from efficient streamlined
processes, insightful business intelligence, and systems
that are flexible enough to grow with changing business needs.
But the solutions that deliver these benefits can strain the
budgets of even large companies. For small and midsize businesses
limited by finite time, IT personnel, and finances, the
power of comprehensive enterprise solutions has seemed out
of reach. SAP puts the power of integrated business solutions
within the reach of smaller companies with mySAP All-in-
One, a prepackaged, industry-specific version of mySAP
Business Suite with built-in content, tools, and methodologies
for a cost-effective, turnkey deployment. Partners can utilize
SAPÂ® Best Practices as the foundation for prepackaged, readyto-
use, mySAP All-in-One solutions.

and adapt their mySAP All-in-One solutions so that it can
support even the largest organizations. Preconfigured business
scenarios help you rapidly realize business benefits without
