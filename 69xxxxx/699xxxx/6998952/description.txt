From IMDb:

Two punks live in Salt Lake City. The film covers their all-day routine. The realism of the character-narrated movie may be discussed. One of the punks gets ill, stays in hospital for three weeks, comes out again. Three parties are covered and one concert including a fight between punks, rednecks and others.

I'm pretty new to creating torrents, so I might be doing something wrong. This is my own rip of SLC Punk, straight from the widescreen DVD. I couldn't find a copy anywhere with 5.1 surround audio, not to mention in the correct format for the AppleTV. Of course, anyone should be able to play this on their computer or streaming media box. It's got the subs off the DVD as well (though their in all caps... stupid closed captioning format). Great movie and, if I do say so myself, a great rip.
