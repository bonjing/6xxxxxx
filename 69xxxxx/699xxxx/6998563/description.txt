 Party Paramedics is a documentary series which takes a look at the culture of 
 weekend binge drinking which is gripping the country and also takes a look at 
 drink related problems in popular holiday destinations in Europe. In an effort
 to help deal with the problem mobile medical units, known as 'Booze Buses',   
 are being used in towns around the country to help ease the pressure on       
 overstretched A&E departments.
