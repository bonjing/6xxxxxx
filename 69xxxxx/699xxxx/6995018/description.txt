    Unusual to see this bad dvd mastering from Anchor Bay..                  
                                                                             
    A very chilling movie, which starts with a crazy and surrealist          
    dance, where naked women dance all over, and old men scream towards      
    the sky. Then a coffin has dragged open, and a man (Coffin Joe?) is      
    broad back to life. Then the story goes to an eerie hostel, where all    
    kinds of men come in one stormy night. Coffin Joe tells the visitors     
    some very strange stuff like "All thats nothing will be everything"      
    (???!). The moody story ends up in a knockdown-ending, but the story     
    still continues veery eerie for its last a couple of minutes. Lots of    
    violence, and corny nudity, its normaly regarded as pure exploitation    
    trash. But if you look it, in another way, its a masterpiece of eerie    
    horror-movies.
