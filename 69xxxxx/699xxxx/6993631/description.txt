Original 1969 Columbia Recording of Berio's landmark piece, performed by the New York Philharmonic, conducted by the composer, and the Swingle Singers. The original version has four movements - and the work was later revised and a fifth movement added. There is a recording of that, but it lacks the intensity of this one, which - to my knowledge - has never been released in any format but vinyl. "It is one of the musics of the future...Not a dull moment anywhere" - Harold C. Schonberg, New York Times
