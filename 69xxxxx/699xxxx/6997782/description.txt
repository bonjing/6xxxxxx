SpyHunter v4.8.13.3861
SpyHunter is a powerful, real-time anti-spyware application certified by West Coast Labsâ€™ Checkmark Certification System and designed to assist the average computer user in protecting their PC from malicious threats. SpyHunter is automatically configured to give you optimal protection with limited interaction, so all you need to do is install it for immediate and ongoing protection.

As malware continues to evolve and become more sophisticated to avoid detection by anti-spyware/anti-virus programs, SpyHunter responds with advanced technology to stay one step ahead of todayâ€™s malware threats. SpyHunter offers additional customization capabilities to ensure every user is able to custom tailor SpyHunter to fit their specific needs.

SpyHunter has the ability to detect and remove rootkits, which are used to stealth install rogue anti-spyware programs and other trojans.

Rootkits use hidden and encrypted files and folders to avoid detection by traditional security software. SpyHunterâ€™s newly integrated advanced rootkit detection technology allows it to perform an instant rootkit scan and promptly display a message upon detection. SpyHunter will then ask the user to reboot the computer and will remove the rootkit during the reboot process.

In order to remove rootkits completely, Windows must be stopped upon boot because rootkits utilize other files that load and run with Windows. Therefore, to prevent rootkits from regenerating on a userâ€™s computer, weâ€™ve added a Compact OS into SpyHunter that allows your system to be booted without Windows so that the rootkit may be removed from your computer.

If SpyHunter is not able to automatically remove a malware object, the Spyware HelpDesk, an interactive feature integrated into SpyHunter, allows our technicians to remotely analyze your machine and directly deliver a custom fix to specific malware problems that may be unique to your computer.

Key Features
* SpyHunter Scanner
SpyHunter has been carefully engineered to be powerful and complete enough for the most demanding technical professional, yet simple enough for a first-time computer user to utilize safely and effectively. With just a simple click, SpyHunter Scanner will scan your computerâ€™s memory, registry, cookies, and files. Items found to be infected will then be listed for you.

To find out more information about a specific object, merely select it. When you are ready to remove any infected files, all you have to do is check the box next to the item and hit the â€œStart Removeâ€ button. All objects that you remove are then placed in SpyHunterâ€™s quarantine area. Simple as that!

* Spyware HelpDesk
New to SpyHunter, is the Spyware HelpDesk, a unique and highly effective interface through which you can contact our support department to solve any malware related issues for absolutely free! The Spyware HelpDesk consists of two separate sub-systems: the SpyHunter Support Ticket System, and the Custom Fix System.
If you experience any issues with SpyHunter whatsoever, or have any questions, comments or suggestions related to SpyHunter, we strongly encourage you to utilize the SpyHunter Support Ticket System. If SpyHunter is unable to remove an infection from your computer, our technical support department will be happy to generate a customized fix for you, which through SpyHunter you can execute to eradicate any infections lurking on your system. Please note, however, that these services are only available with the FULL version of SpyHunter.

System Guards
SpyHunter features an improved System Guards feature that integrates several proactive protection elements into one integrated panel. SpyHunterâ€™s new System Guards automatically blocks malicious process from executing and running on your system. System Guards incorporates guards against Active X control, Registry protection and Process control. Each of these built-in functions provides computer users with automated parasite blocking capabilities.

The System Guards Process feature is designed to give you complete control over which processes are authorized to run on your system and allow you to identify and stop malicious processes before they are executed. Using System Guard, you are able to allow certain processes to run, while blocking those do might feel are malicious or unnecessary. A list of processes is available to you to edit as you see fit.

* Network Sentry
SpyHunterâ€™s Network Sentry is included within the Settings panel area. The Network Sentry is designed to give you complete control over your system networking settings, and to prevent malicious objects from modifying and disrupting your Internet connection. In addition to HOSTS file protection, SpyHunter also offers an option to protect other Windows system files from unauthorized modifications.

SpyHunter also contains advanced functionality designed to prevent malware from hijacking your desired Internet Explorer homepage. Lastly, SpyHunter has the ability to monitor your DNS servers and notify you if an unsolicited modification takes place. This prevents tricky Trojan and malware organizations from redirecting you to a phishing or malware site.

* Scan Scheduler
SpyHunterâ€™s Scan Scheduler can be setup and easily configured through the Scan Scheduler area under the Settings panel. The advanced Scan Scheduler feature allows you to run a complete SpyHunter scan at a pre-set time, even if you are away from your computer. Easy to access and use, the Scan Scheduler allows you to pre-set the scan time at daily, weekly and monthly intervals.

If you opt for the daily scan, you can choose to run the scan every day, every other day, every weekday, or at any interval of days that you choose. If you choose the weekly scan, you will be able to select the day of the week that your scan will be scheduled for, and for the monthly scan, select the day of the month that your scan will be scheduled for. Please note that your computer must be powered on at the time that your scan is scheduled to run. If the computer is not turned on, the scan cannot execute!

* Cuatom Scan
SpyHunter includes a new feature called Custom Scan. Custom Scan allows you to save time by limiting your scan to specific sections of your computer. With SpyHunters Custom Scan, you will be able to select the following scan types: Memory, Registry, Cookies, Files or Rootkits.

A Custom Scan may only take a fraction of the time that a Full Scan would require. Even though a Custom Scan may not catch some residuals, it is an excellent choice for occasional system scans when you are trying to save time.

* Backup
Included as part of SpyHunterâ€™s new scan functions, is an easy and convenient Backup feature that allows you to restore backed up objects using the rollback feature. In the event that an object is removed by SpyHunter, you can choose to restore the object using the built-in rollback feature. The selected object will be restored to its original location as if it were never removed by SpyHunter.

* Exclusions
New to SpyHunter is an Exclusions Panel. The Exclusions feature in SpyHunter allows you to select objects that you wish to exclude from detection in future SpyHunter system scans. In some cases, SpyHunter may detect programs that you do not desire to remove. In this case, the exclusions panel will allow you to exclude individual programs from being identified. Once selected, the programs selected in the exclusions list will not be included or detected in any future scan processes.

When you are ready to add an item to the Exclusions list, it is very easy to do, simply right-click on a detected item in the SpyHunter Scanner results and select â€œAdd to Exclusionsâ€. Removal of an item in the exclusions list is just as easy, simply select the checkbox next to the item that you wish to remove and then click the â€œRemoveâ€ button.

* General Settings
SpyHunterâ€™s new Settings panel was designed with you in mind.
