Finch...Take the guesswork out of your time reporting and start working with empirical data.
Finch is a time tracking application that monitors what windows are open on the screen at any given time. Using the application's tagging system allows for detailed reports of how much time is spent working on different projects.

Set it, and forget it

Starting with Finch is as simple as running it, and then proceeding with your work. Finch will quietly sit on your Mac OS menu bar until the end of the day. No messy configuration, just turn the app on and let it go!

Export to CSV

On the reports view, specify your filter preferences and you can export straight to CSV. Get control of your data (it's yours after all)

Privacy

Competing apps have a habit of uploading your content to their servers. Finch will never have your data as it is stored locally on your own machine. Finch does not require an internet connection and is completely private.
