I have always liked this movie because I fell in love with the truly
Royal charms and Grace (pardon the pun as it were) of Princess Grace Kelly
of Monaco, the star of the show - other than Jimmy Stewart who is a bit
tiresome and "deliberately repulsive" to her (her own words to be sure)
as he is more of a George Bush personality type as scripted - and therefore
not suited to be "courting perfect Hillary" to put a comparison before you.

Its a Hitchcock murder mystery as it were -  with gory details along the way,
however somehow or other it seems to be easy enough to sit through those
aspects of it - as the old fashioned charm and appeal of our dear princess
of Monaco makes up for it all given her beautiful spirit on the screen even more!
