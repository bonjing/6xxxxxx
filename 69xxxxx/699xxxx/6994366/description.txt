Owners manual for 8 Horsepower Tecumseh Snow King snowblower engine.  Covers models 143.816022, 143.816032, and 143.816042.  This is the engine manual that comes with the Craftsman C950-52708-0 and C950-52728-0 8 Horsepower snowblower.  I assume this engine would have been used in other models, and looks exactly like the one on my much newer, differently branded snowblower.
