Copenhagen Airport (KÃ¸benhavns Lufthavn, Kastrup) located just 8 kilometers south of the center of Copenhagen is the largest Scandinavian airport.

This new scenery from Scansim provides a detailed scenery, without sacrificing good framerates. This package features the complete Airport built in Gmax with photorealistic ground textures (Summer, night and winter variation) in a sensational resolution up to 0.6m/pixel. The scenery features exact coastlines, mesh and a completely new designed airport located 100% correct. This add-on also includes dynamic apron traffic, as well as road traffic in the vicinity of the airport. The included detailed AFCAD and AI Aircrafts compatible with default traffic, makes it a lively and highly realistic airport to fly to. You might find scenery with better graphics, but this will be at the cost of framerates - The EKCH Copenhagen Airport is designed to be usable in conjunction with great scenery\'s like Denmark Scenery rendering a detailed Copenhagen city center right next to the airport.
