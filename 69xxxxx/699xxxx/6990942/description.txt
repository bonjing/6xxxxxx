JOHN FAHEY THE YELLOW PRINCESS
Released 1968
Recorded 1968 at Sierra Sound Laboratories, Berkeley, CA Genre Folk 
Label Vanguard
Format: Flac

Originally released in either 1968 or 1969 depending on your sources, The Yellow Princess saw a post-philosophy degree, subculture-aware Fahey branching out from his earlier, more traditional work. He earned his name back in 1959 at the age of 20, with his Blind Joe Death debut album. Following that album Fahey engaged in a wide stylistic range, from Appalachian-style fingerpicking to delta blues, but this album and its partner Requia, both for the Vanguard label, took Fahey to places for which, as it turned out, his audience was unprepared. Their lukewarm reception drove Fahey to follow the albums with a Christmas album, of all things.

In 1967 John Fahey signed with Vanguard Records, the formidable folk label for Joan Baez and The Weavers. The pact produced two LPs, the downbeat Requia and the much livelier The Yellow Princess, which has some of the most technically accomplished playing of John's career.
