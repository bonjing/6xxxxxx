Murderers Timothy Vail and Timothy Morgan plan to break out of the Elmira Prison in New York by chipping a hole through the concrete ceiling of their cell. Vail discovers an escape route via the roof, but it requires breaking through the ceiling of a top floor cell. Morgan has a cell on the top of F-Block, so Vail applies for a transfer to share with his buddy. The request is granted. On the run for two days in the woods, the two are finally captured by police in a dramatic takedown.
