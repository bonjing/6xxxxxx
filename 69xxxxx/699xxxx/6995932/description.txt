Top.Gear.18x01.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 392MB]

[/b][/color] Top Gear is a BAFTA and Emmy award winning British television series about motor vehicles, primarily cars.
It began in 1977 as a conventional motoring magazine show.
Over time, and especially since a relaunch in 2002, it has developed a quirky, humorous style.
The show is currently presented by Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, and has featured three different test drivers known as The Stig  the first dressed in a black racing outfit, and the second and third dressed in a white one .
