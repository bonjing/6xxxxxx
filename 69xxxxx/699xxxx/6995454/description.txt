NOTES:

Right source was pretty nice but had borders left still and also bad ivtc ...also seemed too bright.
Audio was nice and nothing could really improve it.
Loaded the avi file into vdub fixed the ivtc and still had bad interlace issues so have to use a blend aswell TWICE
to remove all the issues.However this makes the source more blurry so had to add some sharpness back to it.
Also lowered the brightness and increased the contrast....also changed the RGB colours slightly and increase the chroma.
Audio was just stripped and remuxed :) 
Got too say not the best Q ever but looks better on the tv,kids just watched it :)
