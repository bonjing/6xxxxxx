Release Notes....: If we had decided to remove half of the frames from the source I'm
                   sure we would have won the race.  Unlike LMAO's lazy ass, we encoded
                   at 60fps as it should be.  We also included some screenshots in 
                   Sample dir to compare the two encodes.  Either Joe Rogan is very 
                   pissed off or LMAO's chroma is off.  Choose whichever you like.  
                   Enjoy!
