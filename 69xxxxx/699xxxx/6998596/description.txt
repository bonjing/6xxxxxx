Got 'Til It's Gone (Ummah Jay Dee's Revenge Mix)

A single produced by J Dilla, Janet Jackson, Joni Mitchell and Q-tip

Production of "Got 'til It's Gone" was officially credited to Janet Jackson, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. However, the hip hop collective The Ummah (composed of Q-Tip, J Dilla, and Ali Shaheed Muhammad) contest that they are the actual producers of the track. In an interview, J Dilla himself stated that he, Q-Tip, and Muhammad produced the original after Jackson met Q-Tip on the set of the 1993 film Poetic Justice. In a story published with Pitchfork, writer Nate Patrin commented on the production of the song, saying the song "bears all the hallmarks of The Ummah style: neo-soul electric pianos, subdued kicks paired with prominent snares, and bass that burbles so thickly that it flows instead of pops". J Dilla made a remix of the song titled "Got Til' Its Gone (Jay Dee's Revenge Remix)" where Patrin claims J Dilla was the actual producer saying "The revenge in question, then, is simply a matter of cranking up those aforementioned trademarks until the source is unmistakable. The bassline congeals, the keyboards are run through a rippling wah-wah, the titular Joni Mitchell loop fades in and out of focus-- it's the difference between a neon sign and a lava lamp".
