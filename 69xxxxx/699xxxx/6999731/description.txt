
The Quileutes close in on expecting parents Edward and Bella, whose unborn child poses a threat to the Wolf Pack and the towns people of Forks.
The makers of this fourth film in the series based on Stephenie Meyer's vampire bestsellers follow the example of another lucrative franchise, the Harry Potter pictures, both in offering no helpful synopsis to newcomers and in filming the final novel in two parts. Breaking Dawn Part Two will be an explosive treatment of the vampiric Armageddon launched by the evil black-clad elders known as the Volturi, led by a grinning Michael Sheen. They figure briefly in Part One, the second time during the end credits as a curtain-raiser for next year's finale. Otherwise this part deals exclusively with matters matrimonial and obstetric as 18-year-old, small-town sheriff's daughter Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) from Washington State marries pale, ageless vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and surrenders her virginity on a honeymoon in Brazil.
