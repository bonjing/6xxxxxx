WinRAR - What's new in the latest version


Version 4.10 beta 4

1. Improved detection of UTF-8 encoding in file names in ZIP archives.
WinRAR attempts to recognize Unicode names, even when UTF-8 flag
is not present in ZIP archive headers.

2. Bugs fixed:

a) If switch -t was set in RAR environment variable, WinRAR "View"
command failed to open archived files;

b) ""Autodetect" string" option in "Define volume sizes" dialog
did not work;

c) If "Split to volumes, size" in default compression profile was
set to "Autodetect", "Delete" and "Add comment" commands refused
to modify ZIP archives.
