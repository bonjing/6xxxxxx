e were problems with the file, you wouldn't be alone asking for a re-upload. Maybe a few hiccups on opening the file but ÂŤalmost all photos darkÂť... By dark, you mean black? What PDF reader are you using? Also provide version number. I just checked with the 3 most popular freeware PDF readers (Adobe Reader X, PDF XChange Viewer and Foxit) and no problem."
