This also includes the second disc, Fly On The Wall 

From Allmusic.com:

The bonus disc, Fly on the Wall, contains 20 plus minutes of excerpts from the countless hours of tapes from the Get Back sessions. No song is heard in its entirety, most are heard in shambolic snippets of 30 seconds or less, and even if the fidelity is considerably cleaner than that on the monumental (and monumentally boring) nine disc Get Back Journals, its still hard to make out the conversations on this disc, and even hardcore Beatles fans will likely tune out this disc after a few minutes. It would have been better if this set was released with a disc devoted to Let It Be... Naked

Enjoy!
