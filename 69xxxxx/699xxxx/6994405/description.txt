Growl is the is ultimate notification system for the Mac. It's the easiest way to know what is going on with other applications while you are working on something else. When you start up a Growl-enabled application, it will just work. There's no complicated setup; just install Growl once and your apps can start displaying notifications right away.
Growl centralizes all your notification preferences into its preferences - you can control them all from one place, and you know exactly how they are going to behave.
