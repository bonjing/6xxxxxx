                Ramakrishna is an orphan from a village                
                 and has an insatiable desire to become                
                a genius; he thinks a human brain is                
              capable of a lot of constructive activity              
              but one doesn't use it completely. The                
            indulgent man lands in the city in search            
             of a job and gets himself shot on the video         
            so each and every expression of his is             
              captured and once successful he can show it          
            to his folks in the village. But there is a           
             hitch, he cannot get a job as he is not a             
             certified genius, has no degrees.
