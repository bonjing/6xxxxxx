King Arthur II: The Role-Playing Wargame Fix Proper

29-01-2012........Release Date <-> Protection..ParadoxInteractive
Strategy/RPG.........Game Type <-> Disk(s).................HOTFIX

PROPER FIX NOTES

This Hotfix is made by us, but you might wonder why you can't find this
hotfix on the Paradox Interactive homepage?

Instead Paradox Interactive offers their customers, to download the
full 15GB package once more, to get a game with a working cursor and a
few updated/missing files. Claiming it's the "only" way to fix the damn
problem.

This is just ridiculous!

Especially since Paradox Interactive could have fixed their shit, with
very little effort, just like we did. No wonder people perfer a scene
release, rather than a lazy publisher/developer with no respect for
their customers. And remember, we do this because we can, not because
we want people to get to play games for free.

What bugs us even more is that the same bunch of hoodlums, that we
mentioned the other day, released a fix to correct the cursor problem.
A fix have been floating on several boards since we released the game,
but these hoodlums have no clue, that they need to do it properly.

RELEASE NOTES

Critically praised by reviewers and gamers alike, King Arthur was
received one of the biggest surprises to emerge on the gaming scene in
2010. Now the Fantasy/Roleplaying RTS returns in a sequel set to push
the boundaries of the genre even further.

of the stone, united the war-torn land of Britannia, gathered the
Knights of the Round Table and secured peace in Camelot aided by the
might of the Holy Grail. Where legends normally end, King Arthur II
begins on its own gruesome tale.

Dark fantasy setting. King Arthur is now the Maimed King, trying to
mend a land torn asunder as he strives to heal himself.

and terrifying foes.
