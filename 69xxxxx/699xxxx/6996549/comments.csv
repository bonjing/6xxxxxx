These photose are *.jpg-pictures, i.e. they are not saved pixel by pixel (as *.bmp-pictures) with all informations (brightness, colour, etc) at each point of it and therefore tons of megabytes for a photo. *.jpg-pictures are compressed. The information saved in the data script are only one time brightness and colour completely and then only the difference to the neighbourhood pixels. If you have a one-colour-background, there are no differences between the pixels, so you save a lot of memory space. Compare it with a picture set taken in the nature with its colourful backgrounds... The smallest size you have is: a pale girl in white clothes in front of a white background we saw often in the last time!
