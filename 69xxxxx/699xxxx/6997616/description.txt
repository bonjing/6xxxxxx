DxO Optics Pro v7.2 supports 4 new cameras and allows importing of version 6 database.
New version features greater stability.
Both the Standard and Elite editions of version 7.2 support four additional cameras: the Canon Powershot S100, and the Panasonic GF3, Panasonic G1, Panasonic G2.
The production rate of DxO Optics Modules is accelerating, thanks to the recent optimization of its calibration processes. This means that DxO Labs is now able to provide support for new cameras more quickly, all while consolidating its modules library by adding camera models already on the market - notably compact hybrids. Since January 1st, more than 250 camera/lens combinations have been added.
This new version includes a tool that allows users to import all their projects and image processing information from DxO Optics Pro 6, and to integrate them into DxO Optics Pro 7 by merging both databases.
This DxO Optics Pro update also includes greater general stability as well as giving users the ability to crop photos in a more intuitive way.
