NOTES:

Ok first thanks to Asda for the vobs files ....nice looking dvd so nothing major done to it except crop,resize and sharpen.
Audio had to tracks so took the 448 5.1 track and remuxed to our rip.
Now readnfo ....
If you scroll up you'll see the IMDB link and another ....the IMDB link says 2002 and seems to be a limited release from then,however
the second link show you the actually dvd was never released till 23.1.12 ......seems they thought hmm tom hardy lets release that after 
hes been in warrior and starring in batman and earn a few quid.
Anyway checked all my topsites and can't find a rip of this so here you go 

PLOT :

Starring Tom Hardy (Inception, Warrior, The Dark Knight Rises), Deserter is a tension-packed war thriller set during AlgeriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bloody fight for independence. It comes to DVD on 23rd January and to mark itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s release, we have 3 copies to give away!

Based on a true story, a young Englishman, Simon Murray (Paul Fox), joins the French Foreign Legion. His idealistic illusions are soon shattered when he encounters his fellow recruits, including Dupont (Tom Hardy), who have all volunteered to escape a past far less innocent than his own.

After a sadistic training regime, the fully-fledged Legionnaires set out to do battle and face deadly fire fights, ambushes and danger at every turn. But soon, a change of allegiance threatens to tear loyalties apart and turn comrade against comrade. As Murray and Dupont now stand on opposite sides, who will become the hero and who will be the deserter?

Deserter is out to own on DVD 23rd January 2012.
