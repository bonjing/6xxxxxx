Information
------------------------------

In early October the Andong Mask Dance Festival takes place, continuing Korea's rich mask dance tradition, which is fun as well as highly ritualistic. Dance troupes, local and regional, perform mask dance dramas that once provided social commentaries.
A part of the festival is the traditional dance games, such as the Men's Battle dance, which involve masses of participants and are uniquely Korean. Cultural events take place at Hahoe Folklore Village, where the community lives and preserves centuries old Korean culture.
