To large for an EP and to small a CD Release! But one thing is Sure though it contains all of Suzi Quatro's Biggest Hits! Susan Kay "Suzi" Quatro (born June 3, 1950) is an American singer-songwriter, bass player, and actor. She scored a string of hit singles in the 1970s that found greater success in Europe and Australia than in her homeland, and had a recurring role on the popular American sitcom Happy Days. 

Please SEED fpr others to Enjoy!
