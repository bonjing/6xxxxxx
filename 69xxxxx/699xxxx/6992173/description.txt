           Melvin Smiley, a successful young hitman, is living    
           a normal all-day life for his jewish fianc Pam, but   
           kills for money in Paris' organization. In addition,   
           he has a relationship with a beauty from the           
           neighbourhood and gets bothered by a pimply video      
           store guy, because he did not return "King Kong        
           Lives" for two weeks. He and his three teammates       
           Cisco, Crunch and Vince one day decide to kidnap the   
           daughter of super-rich businessman Jiro Nishi - off    
           the record. What they do not know, is that Jiro just   
           went completely bankrupt due to a successless movie    
           production, and, even worse, that his daughter Keiko   
           is the god-daughter of Paris, the boss of the          
           kidnappers. He and his men are now searching for the   
           kidnappers in order to grind them up properly.         
         Meanwhile, handcuffed Keiko falls in love with        
        killer Melvin while both preparing a kosher meal in    
        order to satisfy Pam's visiting parents, who are out    
        of the house with Pam - with a body in the trunk.
