Inaki Sandoval Trio - Usaquen (2008) [FLAC]


After the big success of Sausolito (AYVA 035), his first album as leader, IÃ±aki Sandoval presents UsaquÃ©n, his new album recorded with his stable trio, featuring Horacio Fumero on bass and David Xirgu on drums. All the songs from UsaquÃ©n are original compositions, including two songs written by bassist Horacio Fumero.

Out of the 14 tracks of this large length CD (69 minutes), we can highlight songs as Hotel Existence, UsaquÃ©n, Alejoâ€™s Pub or Peewy, dedicated to the memory of Peer Wyboris, who played drums in Sausolito, and died a few days after this recording was made. The CD edition contains two bonus tracks: a new version of Luna Llena and a piano solo version of UsaquÃ©n.
