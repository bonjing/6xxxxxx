The.Firm.S01E05.Chapter.Five.480p.WEB-DL.x264-mSD [MKV 197MB]

[/b][/color]    The Firm    continues the story of attorney Mitchell McDeere and his family 10 years after the events of the film and novel.
As a young associate, McDeere brought down the prestigious Memphis law firm of Bendini, Lambert   Locke, which operated as a front for the Chicago mob     and his life was never the same.
After a difficult decade, which included a stay in the Federal Witness Protection program, Mitch and his family now emerge from isolation to reclaim their lives and their future     only to find that past dangers are still lurking and new threats are everywhere.
