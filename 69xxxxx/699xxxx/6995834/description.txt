Top Gear 18x01 HDTV XviD-FoV

Motoring show. Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May head to Italy for a 
supercar shootout featuring the Lamborghini Aventador, the McLaren MP4-12C and 
the Noble M600.

Their trip starts at the incredible Nardo test track, a facility so massive 
it is visible from space, before heading north for a nerve-wracking drive 
around the centre of Rome. The journey concludes at the legendary Imola 
circuit, a track challenging enough to have embarrassed many an F1 driver, 
with a timed challenge against the incredible skills of the Stig.

Back in the studio, the presenters look forward to some car highlights of 2012 
and another top celebrity guest takes the wheel of the Reasonably Priced Car.
