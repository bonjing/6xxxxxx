Drudge is the King. The reason people like Rush and Mark Levin use him is due to the fact he gets breaking news and interesting rumors out there extremely fast.

Drudge is the best thing to happen to conservative media on the web. He pushes more traffic than major nets or newsgroups could dream of."
