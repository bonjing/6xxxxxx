What can I say .. WMV just SUXX !
Not only does it look like sheit compared to the mp4-version, it also requires more resources to
play back .. 
I don't care what anyone says, HDD-space is DIRT-CHEAP ! My first HDD cost me 400$ .
For 420 mega-BYTE storage . So, please stop crying, HDD-space is cheaper than CD/DVD's !!"
