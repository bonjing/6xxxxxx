A compilation of the Writings of Baha'u'llah, it includes everything which has been translated to English. The 600-page compilation includes a table of contents, with each book sorted first by the Prayers and Meditations, then by chronological order. 

This is a great way to learn about the Baha'i Faith and what exactly the Revelation includes. The best source of a religion is its original scripture. 

I hope you enjoy! If you have any questions about this compilation, feel free to e-mail me at wesley.esmada@gmail.com.

Thank you!
