SOME TRIVIA FROM IMDB

Benicio Del Toro, Brad Pitt, Josh Hartnett and Nick Nolte were originally slated to appear.

Swiss actor Philippe Vonlanthen who met director Bruce Robinson at a London book signing of his novel "The Peculiar Memories of Thomas Pennman" in 1999 was considered for the role of Digby. 

At one point Benicio Del Toro was to direct the film. 

When Sanderson introduces Paul Kemp to Chenault, and asks if they've met before, Kemp states that he thought they might have met on the plane. This is a reference to the original novel, where Kemp first meets Chenault on the plane to San Juan.
