This is Alfred Hitchcock's best movie in my view. And perhaps the most
important movie ever made to expose the mind of evil in what is man.


The key actor referred to as having a "malicious personality" even in
his humour especially, (by the young woman in the movie) is exposed as
a bitter, hateful, cruelly inane, retarded imbecile at the
business of human existentialism. He wants to do evil for its own sake
and as the ultimate testament to his "superior" form of being that thinks
this way.

Why not murder - just for the thrill of it?


Well, why not indeed. Thank goodness for the death penalty or
these minds might never relent- whenever the mood was to strike perhaps.
But then few of this mindset are wanting be so brazen in how they
act out their perverse desires for the world to witness. Evil never
wins at the end of it all - it never has and never will. As time will tell -
yet - and in this I believe, forever more, amen!


This is from the ntsc movie version - so happy hunting if you require subtitles
for English language content - although this world would be a much better place
if none were unable to articulate in this language as a bridge between all that
is mankind - amen!
