Episode 7. See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Speak No Evil

When surveillance equipment is found in the offices of an extreme left-wing political party, it looks like the work of the Danish Security and Intelligence Service - but why? Illegal monitoring of a legal political party is a serious offence, and it quickly becomes clear that Birgitte and minister of justice Hoxenhaven have very different opinions of the case and its consequences. Birgitte's home life suffers from her absence. Katrine, who has otherwise been in good spirits, must make a difficult decision.
