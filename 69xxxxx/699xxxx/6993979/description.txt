  ,Set in modern Birmingham, "Land Gold Women"  
  revolves around a small British Asian family  
  caught between their traditional past and     
  the tumultuous, faction-driven present.       
  Nazir Ali Khan, a soft-spoken, 45-year-old    
  professor of History at a University in       
  Birmingham, emigrated from India in the       
  1980's. He made Birmingham his home with his  
  conservative wife Rizwana and their two       
  children, Saira, 17 and Asif, 14. He indulges 
  their interests in all things English and     
  Western but now finds himself increasingly    
  nostalgic about his roots. Saira, with a year 
  to complete her graduation, is excited at the 
  prospect of going to university to pursue her 
  interest in Literature. She also hopes that   
  this will give her more time to spend with    
  David, her aspiring writer boyfriend. At this 
  critical juncture in her life, Nazir finds
