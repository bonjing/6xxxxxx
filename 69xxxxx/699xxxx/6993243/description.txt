This movie is a look back to the days of segregation, a look at
racial tensions amid violence related to different camps having
different ties.


The tragedy of the movie for me was the the most of all improper treatment
of violence towards women (poor Ms Frances McDormand) - as men are never to
treat women as capable of being brutally beaten as though they were men equally.
A real man (sensibly so) never could and true women will always go insane from
witnessing such ideas gaining acceptance
