If you are looking for this you probably already know what it's for. If you don't, please do your research on pyffi'ing Oblivion (and other game) meshes to optimize game speed

Uploading this because i couldn't find it anywhere else on the net and i noticed a lot of people on the Oblivion forums were asking for it but because of legal reasons everyone was too shit scared to upload it. well fuck that

It's the vanilla non-GOTY Oblivion Meshes.bsa file which has already been optimized to save you the 10 hours it would normally take (on a multi-core cpu)



If you don't know what this is, it's an optimized version of the main polygon models (think characters, buildings, objects, weapons) in Oblivion and should gain everyone a few FPS over the vanilla unoptimized version

I only had to do this because Bethesda are fucking lazy shits and couldn't do their own optimization, though I forgive them because they make otherwise fucking amazing games



before you ask, i don't think it will work on GOTY, so someone else can learn pyffi and do GOTY and upload it here
