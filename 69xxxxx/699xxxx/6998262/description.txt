Jesper Lundgaard has for many years held an international reputation as a world-class bassplayer. For his trio he has chosen two Danish colleagues, Hans Ulrik and Niklas Knudsen who share similar musical outlooks and have outstanding versatility. With Jesper playing acoustic and electric bass, Hans on tenor and baritone saxophone and Niclas playing various guitars, the trio has a wide range of dynamics in interpreting their material. Here the music of Cornelis Vreeswijk is their inspiration and they bring into focus many new aspects in 12 of the compositions of the greatly-missed artist Cornelis. (touchemusic.se)
