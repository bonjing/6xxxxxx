The Rolling Stones - The Complete Woodstock Rehearsal Tapes
non-label 4cdbox bootleg

lineage: Original silvers -> WAV (EAC) -> FLAC (flacfrontend) -> you

Bearsville Studios, Woodstock, New York, May 19th 1978 (onwards)

Comments:
Here's the Woodstock rehearsals of 1978. Excellent stereo soundboard. Great and loose rehearsal...enjoyable listen.
This bootleg features the same stuff as the VGP 4cd release "The Complete Woodstock Tapes"
But on this [non-label] bootleg, and also on the "Red Devil" release, there is 1 or 2 "bonus songs" at the end of each CD.

The artwork for this box will not match CD-cases, as it's a video-sized box with no "jewel cases"
So included is the artwork for the "Red Devil" release, as it has the same content as this one.
(Note that track 17 of disc 3 is not mentioned on the artwork, while track 17 of disc 4 is mentioned...but NOT included on the CD itself)

I know this material have made the rounds on torrent-trackers a lot of times, but I got a request for this bootleg a couple of months ago.....that's why I chose to rip & torrent it.

Enjoy....Erik_snow
