A small collection of scripts I made to make it easier to activate and deactivate mods in the game Warzone 2100 (wz2100.net)

If you like them, a thank you would be nice. If you think you can do it better, be my guest. I'd love to see a GUI that could do what these scripts are meant to do, I just don't know how....

So, over to legal... I don't claim copyright to any of this, I release it for anyone to see and use and improve upon. So I guess I'm saying the license is Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)

In short, if you use and/or improve this, I'd be happy to be mentioned. Other than that, do what you want.
