Space Dogs is based on the heart-warming true story of Belka and Strelka, two dogs who were sent to space by the Soviet Union in the 60â€™s. In this fun-loving fi lm, Belka, the amazing flying dog is unexpectedly hurdled into the streets of Moscow when the rocket she is in malfunctions during one of her circus routines. Fortunately the crash leads her to meet a streetwise dog named Strelka and her irredeemable rat friend Venya. Together with other amusing friends found along the way, the three find themselves in a space program-training center where they get sent away in a rocket, leaving planet Earth. We follow them through all the trials and tribulations in their battle of survival in space and their attempt to make it back to Earth safe. This touching story unravels with humor and adventures that are sure to be extremely entertaining.
