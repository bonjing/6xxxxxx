And the whole story is not accurately told.  And that the best way of showing off this series, is to have a compiliation of all the major fight scenes, that will fit onto one DVD - leaving the minor fight scenes out.  I have made one up - but my uploading bandwidth is so very small - I have to offer it to anyone wanting to?  And Bruce Lee fans would appreciate this immensely for sure!
While not an accurate bio - it still has enough in it to make it worthwhile viewing.  Though it has slow and irrelevant? parts and unsatisfactory bit present.  Note - I have not viewed this particular download.."
