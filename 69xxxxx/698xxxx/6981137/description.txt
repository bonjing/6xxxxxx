Charlie Parr is guaranteed to leave you feeling good. Manic, plucky folk music that wiggles its way into your brain and stomps around. Top that all off with Parrâ€™s strong folk/gospel vocals, and youâ€™ll be damned if you donâ€™t start having a better day.
Keep Your Hands on the Plow. with Parrâ€™s amazing slide guitar going full force, and spectacular gospel backing vocals rounding it all off is another great foot-stomping folk session.
