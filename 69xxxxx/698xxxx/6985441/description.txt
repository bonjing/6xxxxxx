Notes: AMAZING SHOW!!!! I say this as a fan and as an spectator. Deftones seems to be in their best; Chino sounds gigantic, his voice is in the best shape possible since 1998, Stephens\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s riffs and excentric 8-strings guitars blew my mind, I was standing below him and those riffs where like fucking axes cutting down a tree. Abe destroyed his drum kit, he was hitting it very hard, like always. Sergio surprised me actually, I thought he was just touring, playing some songs and all that shit, but he putted his own sound on the bass lines; since he plays with picks instead of fingers, the bass sounded very brutal. Frank was doing his great mixes and soundscpaes, chillin\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' out and enjoying the show.
I went to the show without great expectations, I was thinking that I was going to the greatest party ever and, partially, I was correct since Cypress Hill blew the motherfuckin\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' venue!! But Deftones demostrated that they can do their thing better than a few tours ago, they are musically and personally more matures and it was a pleasure to see them like that. Also, curious thing, from where I was standing from, when \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Change\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" started, the light effects on the stage showed me that Chino was looking physically like 10 years ago, so that took me back to 2001 when this song came out and... well, I can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t really described the emotion, it was like White Pony was just released the last month and they were touring to support it. Call me exagerated, but I felt that way.

Thanks: I really want to thank my girlfriend, who taped the whole show from the right balcony; the people who contacted me and gave me their videos for free (Thanks a lot guys, hope you like this and sorry for the months of waiting), Jeff Keiler for making the video mix, without you Jeff this would be shitty stuff :P, the bands that played: Pork (local band with a cool fan base), Cypress Hill was very intense with an incredible great fan base, and Deftones, well... read above what I think; and all the amazing crowd that was that night at the Malvinas Argentinas Stadium (too bad for the usual thieves that are always in the pit).

Hope you can enjoy this recording as much as I enjoyed the show!!
