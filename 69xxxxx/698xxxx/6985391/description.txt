ReleaseNotes:

Seems the major labels are full of surprises these days.  One minute I hear how none of them are signing new acts due to the state of the Ã´Music BusinessÃ¶ (if you can still call it that) these days, and then I find myself getting pummeled by this complete band of newbies out of an unlikely place like Omaha, NebraskaÃ with a major label backing.  All I can say is Ã´Kudos to the suits upstairs at AtlanticÃ¶!  Not since they signed Shinedown have we heard such a dirty force of high-octane Rock-N-Roll complete with well-written hooks that pack more heat than the fuzz at a 50-Cent concert!

We rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.
HHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)
