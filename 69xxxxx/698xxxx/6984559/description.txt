Details:

Sydney band The Rumjacks will release their debut album, Gangs Of New Holland, through Laughing Outlaw Records on Friday October 5th.
Gangs Of New Holland was produced by Dave Hammer (The Snowdroppers, Rex Banner, Mz Ann Thropik) in Sydney and recorded at Big Jesus Burger Studios. It is an unrelenting 14 songs as a soundtrack for life, from teat to the tomb.

The resulting full length album, Gangs Of New Holland, contains not only the band's truest take on the traditional influences they hold dear but also manages to up the ante on arsekickin' energy.

Having spent the last two of years peddling their blue collar brand of folkloric 'rotgut n' roll', The Rumjacks are forging their own sound, over rattling bottles and twisted tales, long nights up and down the East Coast of Australia and likely as not, sprawled on the floor when the sun comes up.

With their first two EPs (Hung, Drawn & Portered and Sound As A Pound), The Rumjacks captivated the people; from swingin' rockabilly cats to fans of hardcore punk and old school rock n' roll... even a quiet acoustic gig or two didn't daunt these brave young fellows, they proved themselves to be at home anywhere they could set up and play.

Having shown the ability to fit in (and rise above) anywhere, anytime, The Rumjacks have shared the stage with acts as diverse as Gogol Bordello, UK Subs, Leftover Crack, Magic Dirt and Regular John. They also headlined the National Celtic Folk Festival this year.

To celebrate the release of the album, The Rumjacks will do what they do best and that is play live! September saw them playing all regional shows along Australia's East coast and in October they got to support punk-rock legends GBH on their national tour taking in all capital cities.
