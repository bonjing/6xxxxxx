Venue: The Summit

Recording: AUD
Quality: 9
Menu: YES
Extras: None
Comments: Full show upgrade, supposedly straight from the master. Image quality is excellent, just a little blurry/washed-out when the lighting's bright and slightly grainy when it gets darker. Audio is both original and remastered and kicks ass despite some slight distorsion on the kick drum (bass frequencies have been upped a bit too much).
