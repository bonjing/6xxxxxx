WinRAR is a shareware file archiver and data compression utility developed by Eugene Roshal, and first released in autumn of 1993.[3] It is one of the few applications that is able to create RAR archives natively, because the encoding method is held to be proprietary.

WinRAR supports the following features:
Complete support for RAR (WinRAR native conversion format) and ZIP archives, and unpacking of ARJ, LZH, TAR, GZ, ACE, UUE, BZ2, JAR, ISO, EXE, 7z, and Z archives.[5]

The ability to create self-extracting and multi-volume (split) archives.
Data redundancy is provided via recovery records and recovery volumes, allowing reconstruction of damaged archives.
