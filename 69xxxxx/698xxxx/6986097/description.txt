Dynastic bluesman Bernard Allison is a second-generation star now shining in his own right. The guitarist-vocalist son of the late legend Luther Allison paid his early dues leading Koko Taylor's crack Blues Machine band, learned the family business leading his father's electrifying group in Europe, and has now created his own catalog of fine recordings. Storms of Life is the most eclectic and uniformly excellent example yet. After the sizzling solo slide guitar opener "Slip Slidin'," Allison roams wide and free, confidently overlaying his blues personality on material ranging from the reggae-tinged "Just Do Me Any Way You Want" to the R&B title track, which glides over a cushion of keyboards and extra percussion. A bouncy, horn-powered rendition of "Goodbye Little Girl" that recalls Bobby "Blue" Bland provides a fitting conclusion. Allison surprisingly, but effectively, mixes a wide variety of cover material, including everything from ZZ Top's "I Wanna Drive You Home" to Mark Knopfler's "I Think I Love You Too Much" to mentor Johnny Winter's suitably manic "Mean Town Blues." The well-chosen covers, including tunes by Anders Osborne, Leon Russell, and papa Luther, convincingly demonstrate his gifts as an interpreter.
