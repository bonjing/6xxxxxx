[/b][/color] REMODELED centers around modeling industry veteran Paul Fisher as he tries to bring together hundreds of small agencies around the world in a new venture called The Network.
The Network will give Paul the leverage to change the industry from the inside out.
He has two missions: to make sure agents in small towns no longer get screwed, and to empower models to take control of their careers and lead healthier lives.
REMODELED is from Fly on the Wall Entertainment and Sony Pictures Television with executive producers Allison Grodner (???Big Brother,??? ???You???re Cut Off,??? ???She???s Got The Look,??? ???Plain Jane???), Rich Meehan (???Big Brother,??? ???You???re Cut Off,??? ???She???s Got The Look,??? ???Plain Jane???), Amy Palmer (???You???re Cut Off,??? ???Plain Jane???), Paul Fisher (???I Want To Be A Hilton???), Greg Seuss (???What???s Wrong with Virginia,??? ???Tug???) and Erik Stone (???Aisha Tyler Is Lit: Live at the Fillmore???).
