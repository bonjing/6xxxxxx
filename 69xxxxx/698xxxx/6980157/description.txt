Release notes:
DEFACED release has yet again repeating cd1 footage at the beginning of cd2. See for yourself
we merged cds and cut a sample. They also overcropped 2px on the right sight, sample included

Judging by the superior quality of our encode there is no doubt defaced used a re-encoded
source for theirs
