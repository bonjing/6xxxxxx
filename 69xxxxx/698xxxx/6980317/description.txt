UPDATE ON SOPA:

SOPA and PIPA has been shelved indefinitely, this is due to the large protest by people who actually cares...its a temporary victory, but we must never let our guards down, as they can strike on our backs like serpents...continue to be aware and continue fighting for a FREE INTERNET, NO TO SOPA!
