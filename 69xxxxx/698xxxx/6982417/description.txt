I have used this book for the last 8 years when I do a garden. It almost always has the detail I need for a particular vegetable. Example: My tomato plants look great . The book covers a wide varity of vetables & herbs well. It is very good on basics. It does have a few weaknesses. No interior color pictures, good black & white drawings however. Printed on newsprint. Because of it's age the newer varities are not listed & the ones listed may not be available. It doesn't cover wide beds..............................
