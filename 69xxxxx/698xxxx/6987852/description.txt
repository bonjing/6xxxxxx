LibreOffice (pronounced /ËŒliË.brÉ™ËˆÉ’.fÉªs/) is a free and open source office suite developed by The Document Foundation as a fork of OpenOffice.org. It is largely compatible with other major office suites, including Microsoft Office, and available on a variety of platforms. LibreOffice has no licensing fees, is available in a large number of local languages and gives users the opportunity to participate in its development.[4]
LibreOffice is a hybrid word, meaning "Free Office". Libre means free (as in freedom) in French and Spanish.
LibreOffice has been downloaded approximately 7.5 million times since its first stable launch in January 2011.[5] It is the default office suite in many Linux distributions, such as Fedora,[6] Linux Mint,[7] openSUSE,[8] and Ubuntu.[9]
LibreOffice can be run on Microsoft Windows 2000 (with Service Pack 4 or newer) or newer, Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger or newer, and Linux-based systems running Linux kernel version 2.6.18 or newer.[1] Ports for FreeBSD and OpenBSD are being maintained by contributors to those projects, respectively.[10][11][12]
