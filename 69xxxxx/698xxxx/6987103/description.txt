    After being expelled from high-school,     
    Kishu returns home to work with his        
    disapproving truck-driver father,          
    Someshwar, who bends the law, bribes       
    the police to transport hand-grenades      
    packed in egg-boxes. Kishu\'s life          
    undergoes a major change when he gets      
    smitten by Houston-based Sapna, the        
    niece of Dr. Sinha, who is on a            
    research assignment in secluded areas      
    of Bihar. She goes to the Superintendent   
    of Police, Vikram Kapoor, to seek an       
    escort to accompany her, but is            
    cautioned that even police are reluctant   
    to visit the areas she wants to tour.      
    Kishu volunteers, she initially rejects    
    him, but relents when he impresses her     
    with his knowledge of Devi Maa Durga.
