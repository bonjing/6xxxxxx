And after messing around with the settings; was able to launch the actual game (although it was a bit buggy because I haven't properly configured my Wine yet).
1) Mount ""sr-oilrush.iso"" with Archive Manager or any other disc image mounting software.
2) Use Wine to launch ""Oli_Rush_1.o.exe"", extract the folder to where-ever you choose.
3) Open the ""Oil Rush"" folder.
4) Use Wine to activate ""launcher_x86.bat"".
5) Set the options to specifications your system can support.
6) Click on ""Run""
7) Enjoy!"
