Based on the classic Ã‰mile Zola novel, Jean Renoirâ€™s La bÃªte humaine was one of the legendary directorâ€™s greatest popular successesâ€”and earned star Jean Gabin a permanent place in the hearts of his countrymen. Part poetic realism, part film noir, the film is a hard-boiled and suspenseful journey into the tormented psyche of a workingman.
