SHORT DESCRIPTION ON SRI AADI SANKARAACHARYA:

Adi Sankaracharya (788-821 CE) was a great saint & philosopher who consolidated 
the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta, a sub-school of Vedanta. His teachings are based on 
the unity of the soul and Brahman, in which Brahman is viewed as without attributes. 
He hailed from Kalady of present day Kerala. Sankara travelled across India and other parts of South Asia to propagate his philosophy through discourses and debates with other thinkers. He founded four mathas (monasteries), which helped in the historical development, revival and spread of Advaita Vedanta. Adi Sankara is believed to be the organizer of the Dasanami monastic order and the founder of the Shanmata tradition of worship.

His works in Sanskrit concern themselves with establishing the 
doctrine of Advaita (Non-dualism). He also established the importance of monastic life 
as sanctioned in the Upanishads and Brahma Sutra, in a time 
when the Mimamsa school established strict ritualism and 
ridiculed monasticism. Sankara represented his works as elaborating on ideas found 
in the Upanishads, and he wrote copious commentaries on 
the Vedic Canon (Brahma Sutra, Principal Upanishads and Bhagavadgita) in support of 
his thesis. The main opponent in his work is the Mimamsa school of thought, 
though he also offers some arguments against the views of some other schools like 
Samkhya and certain schools of Buddhism that he was partly familiar with.
