Three Dead Zed

Description:

Three Dead Zed is an action/puzzle platformer drawn completely by hand. Breaking out of a testing 

facility, players take control of an experimental zombie that can transform into three unique and 

distinct forms. With quick reflexes, a little problem solving, and some rescued kittens, players make a 

violent exit that wonâ€™t be forgotten by their captors.
