What is the difference between Office 2011 Home and Student and Office 2011 Home and Bussiness?

1. Work product from the Home & Student edition must be for exactly that, home use or student use. The license stipulates that you cannot use this version for commercial, governmental, non-profit organization nor any other activities outside of literally home & student use. 

2. The Business version contains Outlook, the Student edition doesn't. 

3. Both versions have multiple-license options. The prices listed here for the Home & Student version appear to be the single license. The Home version does have a 3 license option available at some retailers.
