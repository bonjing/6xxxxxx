This is a sobering look at the extremist ideas of multicultural proponents
for Britain especially. Rather than real romance, abusive entanglements are
all we find in a cultural gap as wide as the grand canyon and just as deep
as a sink into the abyss of a volcanic mountain.

Anyways, a rather stupid waste of a beautiful British gal who finds
only "hate" in return for what she gives of herself, to an Indian businessman
and only the gay fellas in the movie persist on finding acceptance for themselves
in a way as to prevail with their experiment.
