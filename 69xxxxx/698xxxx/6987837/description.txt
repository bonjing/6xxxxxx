Hoest is the creative force of the band; the rest of the lineup is highly unstable.

The band was formerly known as Thule (1993-1995); HÃ¸st then changed the name to Taake (the Norwegian word for "fog") in 1995 because he wanted the name to reflect the genuine Norwegian spirit of his music and lyrics. It is also a patriotic tribute to the fog that surrounds the seven mountains at his hometown ...
