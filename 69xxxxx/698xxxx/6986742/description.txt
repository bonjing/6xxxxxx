Developer Evilnat, aka nathanr3269 has released an update to his PS3 homebrew tool,
PUP Unpacker & Decrypter v2.2. This latest version allows users to decrpyt and unpack
Core_OS. With this tool, you can do things like unpack PUPs, and decrypt SELF files. This
application works for Cygwin and Ubuntu, and not on CMD for Windows.
