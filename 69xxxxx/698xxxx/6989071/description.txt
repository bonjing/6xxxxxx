The TV guide said this was "New" so I figured why not. It seems Blaine is back with new tricks up his sleeve. Cameras follow world renowned street magician David Blaine as he travels to both the Grand Canyon and New Orleans, among other places, astounding viewers and bystanders alike with an array of masterful illusions and magic tricks topped off by one of the riskiest performances; the Bullet Catch.
