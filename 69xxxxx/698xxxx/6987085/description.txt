     After being expelled from high-school,     
     Kishu returns home to work with his        
     disapproving truck-driver father,          
     Someshwar, who bends the law, bribes       
     the police to transport hand-grenades      
     packed in egg-boxes. Kishu's life          
     undergoes a major change when he gets      
     smitten by Houston-based Sapna, the        
     niece of Dr. Sinha, who is on a            
     research assignment in secluded areas      
     of Bihar. She goes to the Superintendent   
     of Police, Vikram Kapoor, to seek an       
     escort to accompany her, but is            
     cautioned that even police are reluctant   
     to visit the areas she wants to tour.      
     Kishu volunteers, she initially rejects    
     him, but relents when he impresses her     
     with his knowledge of Devi Maa Durga.
