What does LibreOffice give you?

Writer is the word processor inside LibreOffice.
Use it for everything, from dashing off a quick letter to producing an entire book with tables of contents, embedded illustrations, bibliographies and diagrams.
The while-you-type auto-completion, auto-formatting and automatic spelling checking make difficult tasks easy (but are easy to disable if you prefer).
Writer is powerful enough to tackle desktop publishing tasks such as creating multi-column newsletters and brochures. The only limit is your imagination.

Calc tames your numbers and helps with difficult decisions when you're weighing the alternatives. Analyze your data with Calc and then use it to present your final output. Charts and analysis tools help bring transparency to your conclusions. A fully-integrated help system makes easier work of entering complex formulas. Add data from external databases such as SQL or Oracle, then sort and filter them to produce statistical analyses.
Use the graphing functions to display large number of 2D and 3D graphics from 13 categories, including line, area, bar, pie, X-Y, and net â€“ with the dozens of variations available, you're sure to find one that suits your project.

Impress is the fastest and easiest way to create effective multimedia presentations. Stunning animation and sensational special effects help you convince your audience. Create presentations that look even more professional than the standard presentations you commonly see at work.
Get your collegues' and bosses' attention by creating something a little bit different.

Draw lets you build diagrams and sketches from scratch.
A picture is worth a thousand words, so why not try something simple with box and line diagrams? Or else go further and easily build dynamic 3D illustrations and special effects. It's as simple or as powerful as you want it to be.

Base is the database front-end of the LibreOffice suite.
With Base, you can seamlessly integrate your existing database structures into the other components of LibreOffice, or create an interface to use and administer your data as a stand-alone application. You can use imported and linked tables and queries from MySQL, PostgreSQL or Microsoft Access and many other data sources, or design your own with Base, to build powerful front-ends with sophisticated forms, reports and views. Support is built-in or easily addable for a very wide range of database products, notably the standardly-provided HSQL, MySQL, Adabas D, Microsoft Access and PostgreSQL.

Math is a simple equation editor that lets you lay-out and display your mathematical, chemical, electrical or scientific equations quickly in standard written notation. Even the most-complex calculations can be understandable when displayed correctly. E=mc2.

LibreOffice also comes configured with a PDF file creator, meaning you can distribute documents that you're sure can be opened and read by users of almost any computing device or operating system.


System Requirements

Linux

As a general rule, you are recommended to install LibreOffice via the installation methods recommended by your particular Linux distribution (such as the Ubuntu Software Center, in the case of Ubuntu Linux).
This is because it is usually the simplest way to obtain an installation that is optimally integrated into your system. Indeed, LibreOffice may well be already installed by default when you originally install your Linux operating system.


The community-supplied LibreOffice installers are provided for users having special needs, and for out-of-the-ordinary cases.


Some Linux distributions ship with their own â€œnativeâ€ version of LibreOffice, which may have different features from the community-supplied version of LibreOffice. In many cases, you can install the community-supplied LibreOffice alongside a â€œnativeâ€ version. However, you may prefer to remove the â€œnativeâ€ version before installing a community-supplied version.
For details on how to do that, please consult the user help resources provided by your particular Linux vendor.


Please make sure you have enough free memory in the temporary directory on your system, and please ensure that read, write and run access rights have been granted. Close all other programs before starting the installation process.


The software and hardware prerequisites for installing on Linux are as follows:

* Linux kernel version 2.6.18 or higher;

* glibc2 version 2.5 or higher;

* gtk version 2.10.4 or higher;

* Pentium-compatible PC (Pentium III, Athlon or more-recent system recommended);

* 256Mb RAM (512Mb RAM recommended);

* Up to 1.55Gb available hard disk space;

* X Server with 1024x768 resolution (higher resolution recommended), with at least 256 colors;

* Gnome 2.16 or higher, with the gail 1.8.6 and at-spi 1.7 packages (required for support for assistive technology [AT] tools), or another compatible GUI (such as KDE, among others).


For certain features of the software - but not most - Java is required.
Java is notably required for Base.


It is a recommended best practice to back-up your system and data before you remove or install software.
