,sale123456,2012-05-30T02:43Z,there is a troyan virus in crack
 ""interrupted"" every time i try but it still asks me to reboot when it finishes.
b) the patch installer doesn't seem to do much of anything.
c) the crack tells me that I don't have permission to open it even though I try to run it as an administrator and have changed all the permissions.

I may just be too dumb to make it work, but those are my issues so far."
