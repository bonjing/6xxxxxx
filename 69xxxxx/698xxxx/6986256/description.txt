  Australia Day 2002. In South Australia's Woomera detention centre,    
  protests by asylum seekers erupted. More than 200 of the detainees    
  were on hunger strike, some had sewed their lips together. The        
  atmosphere was explosive. At the height of the conflict, a            
  bare-chested young man climbed on to the perimeter fence and,         
  without warning, jumped on to the coiled razor wire below. Ten years  
  on, this program revisits this disturbing story and asks: Who was     
  this man? Why did he jump and what happened to him? (Commissioned by  
  SBS)
