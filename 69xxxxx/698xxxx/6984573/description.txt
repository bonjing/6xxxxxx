     Dig, fight, explore, build! Nothing is impossible in this                 
     action-packed adventure game. The world is your canvas and the            
     ground itself is your paint.                                              
                                                                               
     Grab your tools and go! Make weapons to fight off a variety of            
     enemies in numerous biomes. Dig deep underground to find                  
     accessories, money, and other useful things. Gather resources to          
     create everything you need to make the world your own. Build a            
     house, a fort, or even a castle. People will move in to live there        
     and perhaps even sell you different wares to assist you on your           
     journey.
