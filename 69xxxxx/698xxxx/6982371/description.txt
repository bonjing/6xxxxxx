Mplus 6.12 is a latent variable modeling program with a wide variety of analysis capabilities:

-Exploratory factor analysis
-Structural equation modeling
-Item response theory analysis
-Growth modeling
-Mixture modeling (latent class analysis)
-Longitudinal mixture modeling (hidden Markov, latent transition analysis, latent class growth analysis, growth mixture analysis)
-Survival analysis (continuous- and discrete-time)
-Multilevel analysis
-Complex survey data analysis
-Bayesian analysis
-Monte Carlo simulation

Mplus allows all these modeling features to be combined in a fully integrated general latent variable framework.

Instructions:
1. extract
2. install by running the appropriate (i.e. either 32 or 64-bit) executable
3. have fun :)

For x86 and x64 Windows systems.
