DESCRIPTION:


In his first two Commanders books, Tom Clancy teamed with armor and 
infantry General Fred Franks, Jr., and Air Force General Chuck Horner to provide 
masterful blends of history, biography, you-are-there narrative, insight into the 
practice of leadership, and plain old-fashioned storytelling. 

Shadow Warriors is all of that, and more, for in the words of 
Lieutenant General Bill Yarborough, "There are itches that only Special Forces can scratch.

The training, resourcefulness, and creativity of the SF soldier make him capable of jobs 
that few other soldiers could handle, in situations where traditional arms and 
movement don't apply. 

Carl Stiner was only the second commander of SOCOM, the U.S. Special Operations Command, 
responsible for the readiness of all the Special Operations forces of the Army, Navy, and 
Air Force, including the Green Berets, Navy SEALS, Rangers, Delta Force, 
Air Force Special Operations, PsyOps, and Civil Affairs. 

Together, he and Clancy trace the transformation of the Special Forces from the 
small core of outsiders of the 1950s through the cauldron of Vietnam and to the 
rebirth of the SF in the late 1980s and 1990s as the bearer of the largest, most mixed, and 
most complex set of missions in the U.S. military. 

From Vietnam and Laos to Panama and El Salvador to Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and 
Iraq, these are stories of raids, counterterrorism, hostage rescues, reconaissance, 
counterinsurgency and psychological operations-and also of building settlements, 
teaching civilians, cleaning up water supplies, and saving lives. 

It is a front-row seat to a man, an institution, and a way both of war and 
peace that together make this an instant classic of military history.
