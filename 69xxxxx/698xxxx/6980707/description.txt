The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo 2011 REAL DVDSCR XVID AC3 HQ Hive-CM8

Thx Hive

CM8 Doing it right the first time


Source: DVDSCR DVD-R  Thx Une
not that riskees avi

Notes:
We had the DVD-R long before riskees version came up.
(added a proof pic of the source dvd along with the avi and 2 samples)
I dont think that riskees even had the dvd itself, maybe something from the 
street. anyway, there are already a couple of reencodes out, even the russian dubbed their own cam audio on that riskees rip, reencoded the file and used 
higher bitrate, and that file got english dubbed again by another group. mhh 
dont see the point in that. they are all done from that low bitrated riskees 
avi. time to get you some quality rip from the source itself  

Encode:
The DVD was nice just a bit dark and colours were slightly off, also an annoying
watermark "for your consideration" was popping up all the time. the watermark 
was very small and half in the video half outside in the black border. So by 
just cropping 3 lines the property problem was gone, there isnt really anything
missing from the video itself. Added sharpness, brightness and contrast
Video looks a lot better now, since it came along with 5.1 audio, it does look
like a retail rip now, no need for a dvdrip in the future.
got very nice
enjoy
