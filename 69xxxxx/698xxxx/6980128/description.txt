Hello all,

Torrent #4, and this one is an obscure one!

This is DK's "My Amazing Human Body." For those of you who don't know what this is, here is a description:

In this fantastic and funny anatomical
interactive adventure, children join
Seemore Skinless, a mischievous 3D
skeleton, in a variety of games and 
activities aimed at answering commonly 
asked questions about the body. Theyâ€™ll 
learn about human anatomy, health, 
nutrition, and much more through fun activities 
like â€œbuildingâ€ a body and â€œa day in the lifeâ€ of 
Seemore. Beautifully presented information, 
engaging activities and terrific reference 
resources all combine to create an anatomical 
adventure children will return to again and 
again!

Just mount and enjoy! This is the only one like it on TPB! I haven't tried it but I imagine that this is burnable.

Seed and have a great day!
