Release Notes....: Sorry we missed this the other week and sorry that crimson is full of
                   idiots.  Their release is overcropped on the right and substantially
                   on the left.  Also, the color is way off on theirs. This is likely
                   because they are capping from an analog source but of course we will
                   never know as long as the tv-xvid section remains without a source 
                   request rule. You can even see a substantial lack of detail in their 
                   encode. Look at Dog's wrist and the tattoos on the guy's arm sitting 
                   on the couch. Screenshots included in Sample dir. Enjoy a proper 
                   encode!
