The sequel to \'Happy Feet,\' the Academy Award-winning animated smash hit, \'Happy Feet Two\' 
returns audiences to the magnificent landscape of Antarctica in superb 3D.

Mumble, The Master of Tap, has a problem because his tiny son, Erik, is choreo-phobic. 
Reluctant to dance, Erik runs away and encounters The Mighty Sven--a penguin who can fly! 
Mumble has no hope of competing with this charismatic new role model. 

But things get worse when the world is shaken by powerful forces. 

Erik learns of his father\'s \"guts and grit\" as Mumble brings together the penguin nations 
and all manner of fabulous creatures--from tiny Krill to giant Elephant Seals--to put 
things right.

\'Happy Feet Two\' features the voices of Elijah Wood, Robin Williams, Hank Azaria, 
Alecia Moore (Pink), Sofia Vergara, Anthony LaPaglia, Magda Szubanski and Hugo Weaving, 
with Brad Pitt and Matt Damon as the Krill.
