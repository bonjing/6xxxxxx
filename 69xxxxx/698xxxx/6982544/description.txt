Pack of Bright C4D\\\'s

Over time Ive got to like really colourful/Bright vector type sigs and large pieces but the bits to use in them are all scattered about in different packs or singularly around the sites.
So all Ive done is to take the hours and hours of searching for them and put them all into 1 big folder and hopefully save peeps some time to do the work you want to really do.
The thanks and credit go to our talenyed C4D makers in our graphics forums.

I hope you can find a use for them as theres some great ones amongst them.
Love and Peace
