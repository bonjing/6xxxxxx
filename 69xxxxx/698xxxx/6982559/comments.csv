Are you really that clueless to realize that NO drug company is going to research Vitamin C. That probably means you are unaware that it is a essential nutrient for humans and without it you will die. The next time your sick and dying in a hospital, your wish there was a Dr Klenner in your hospital room.

So I guess that means that Dr. Klenner was a wack job and the people who he saved were just a bunch fakes who really had nothing wrong with them. I assume those who had polio were probably not saved by Dr. Klenner, they were probably cured of their polio by the fluoridated water they were drinking, or maybe it was just a bus driving by or a their fairy god mother.
