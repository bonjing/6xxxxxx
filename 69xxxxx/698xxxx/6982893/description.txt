Doubt. Denial. Anger. Helplessness. Anguish. Hope. Life . . . These are inspiring accounts of people who battled extraordinary situations.

The influence of hormones on our behaviour
the promise of stem cells in our battle against disease 
the pitfalls of having too much too soon
a first-hand account of bypass surgery by the surgeon who operated on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
the anguish of a care-giver

These stories recount our efforts to understand the body and mind, to lessen pain and misery, and to come together in our endeavour for a better life and health.
These are experiences that touch our livesâ€”coming to terms with a rare condition; the challenges of staying away from home; getting over grief, addictions and phobias; and actor Lisa Ray's resilience in her combat with cancer. Beautiful narratives of the alleviating warmth of compassion, and empathetic guidance regarding the prevention and cure of afflictions.They have been related by people who are in need, and by those who reach out to help others.
Best of Health is a collection of stories published in the health supplement of The Week over the past three years. Coming together in this volume, they remind us of the value of good health and motivate us to create holistic wellness of the mind, body and spirit
