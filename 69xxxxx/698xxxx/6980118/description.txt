I just hacked the minecraft launcher. It now will allow any user to play on single player for free. This the just the modified launcher, simply move your application folder and run. 

1. move to application folder.
2. run the launcher.
3. type whatever you want for username.
4. check force update.
5. click enter.

It will now proceed to download a fresh set of application support files (true game)
All you have to do is go on the launcher and click single player. It loads perfectly, only lagging at startup on occasion. Multiplay WILL work, as long as you direct connect to a hacked (underground) server. This is my first torrent upload, so please leave me the feedback! (:

I will seed for a few weeks, but thats it. Hopefully more will seed.

P.S. Sorry about large file size and being mac exclusive... This required lots of java and osx coding, Enjoy.
