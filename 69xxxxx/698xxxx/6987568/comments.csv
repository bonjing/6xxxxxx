Loading any of the expansions causes a ""serious error"" on Cubase 5 (also by AiR, works fine otherwise). 

I'm guessing there's an incompatibility between the two given the way AiR's crack handles the content imports. 

Not saying this is a bad torrent, its VERY good and encourage others to download and seed.

I just need a solution to this. Tried installing the content after installing Nexus. Then tried uninstalling Nexus, reinstalling and letting it scan for these expansions. All show up fine, they just crash Nexus."
