DESCRIPTION:

In the old days, professional service firms could survive without much marketing effort. 
Put together a team of good people, deliver strong service to clients, and 
you might get by just fine on repeat business and client referrals. 
For many, those days are gone. While repeat business and referrals are still necessary 
to grow, they're no longer enough to succeed. You need smart, effective marketing and
a culture of business development success to bring in a steady stream of clients to 
grow your business.
