This film is about the clash between East and West in a way which drives home
the point that when people get together, they have to leave feeling 
somehow edified by the experience - otherwise, why bother making
the effort in the first place?


An East Indian man has a negative experience with "English peoples" whom he 
describes as "always sticking together". For her part, the British actress
in the movie has to recover from rape amidst the most ghastly circumstances, 
followed by a terrible ordeal that challenges her sanity the point of extinction
perhaps!

For the British, the allure of India is a discovery that could be well
sorted out before beginning the journey - with a view to better 
defining what goals they wish to meet and what to expect of it all for
all others of those concerned with their desires on the planet as stakeholders
as it were.
