A hard-to-find gem from director Carl Franklin. I've never seen it anywhere, so I decided to make my own--first torrent ever.

Source: VHS (dubbed directly to DVD, ripped with HandBrake)
Format: .avi
Codec: XviD
Sound: stereo mp3/128 kbps

If there's any demand for the original .VOB file (3.63 GB), I'll upload that, as well. Enjoy :-)
