    Four girls go on a romping weekend at a lake, and have car problems      
    on the way home. A nice local boy takes them back to his farm, where     
    he lives with his father. Something ghastly happens, but the father      
    helps his son as he has in the past. When the boy meets a girl and       
    begins falling in love, the father worries about a repeat                
    performance.
