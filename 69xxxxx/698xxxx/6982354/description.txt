Big Arrow Menu! adds a menu to your menu bar in Mac OS X versions 10.6 and 10.7. The menu is broken into four sections:

* Directories

* Open Applications

* System Preferences

* Big Arrow Menu!

Directories

This section shows a list of commonly accessed directories on your computer. You can navigate these directories using submenus. Selecting any directory will show that directory in the Finder. Selecting a file will open that file using the appropriate application.

If you hold down the option key while opening a submenu, hidden files will be included in the submenu.

Open Applications

This menu section shows the applications currently open on your computer. If you hold down the option key while opening the menu, background applications will be included in the menu.
Clicking on any application will activate it. There is also a submenu for each application. This submenu has four options:

* Activate - this will bring the application to the front

* Hide - this will hide the application

* Show in Finder - this will display a Finder window with the application
  file highlighted

* Quit - this will send a Quit request to the application. If you hold down
  option while opening the submenu, this item will turn into Force Quit,
  which will force the application to quit.

This submenu shows numerous preferences which can be set on your computer.
