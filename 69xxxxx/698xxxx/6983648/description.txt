Mohombi - Bumpy Ride LYRICS

CHOURS] X3
I wanna boom bang bang with your body-o
We're gonna rough it up before we take it slow
Girl let me rock you rock you like a rodeo
(It's gonna be a bumpy ride)

[VERSE 1]
I'm gonna pull you over, pull you under
Make your body surrender to mine( heeeee hooooo)
Girl you can make me suffer, do whatever
Cuz i know you're one of a kind
(heeeee hoooooo)

Tell me who can love you, nobody
Hold you, nobody
Make your body whine, like me
You will never find someone like me

Who can love you, nobody
Hold you, nobody
Make your body whine, like me
You will never find someone like me

[CHOURS] X2
I wanna boom bang bang with your body-o

Girl let me rock you rock you like a rodeo
(It's gonna be a bumpy ride)

[VERSE 2]
Imma spin you around, push your buttons
Oh I ain't pallin' to stop (heee hoooo)
Let me take you down, to the bottom
Work you all the way to the top

Tell me who can love you, nobody
Hold you, nobody
Make your body whine, like me
You will never find someone like me

Who can love you, nobody
Hold you, nobody
Make your body wine, like me
You will never find someone like me
