I would like to thank the original uploaders for rips that are not mine. Most of these ups have dissapeared so I don't know who upped them so a big Thank You! I had some trouble using EAC with a couple of my rips - The Lost Crowes, Disc 1 Track 6 has a few seconds of some audible skips due to scuffed disc. Also, tracks 9 & 10 of Southern Harmony has some timing problems but no audible skips. Both were ripped using burst mode. Also included is the vinyl version of Before The Frost... Until The Freeze. Audiochecker log included.

From Wiki:


The Black Crowes are an American rock band formed in 1989. Their discography includes nine studio albums, four live albums and several charting singles. The band was signed to Def American Recordings in 1989 by producer George Drakoulias and released their debut album, Shake Your Money Maker, the following year. The follow-up, The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, reached the top of the Billboard 200 in 1992.

After a hiatus between 2002 and 2005, the band released Warpaint, which hit number 5 on the Billboard chart.[1] After the release of a double album, the greatest hits-like and mostly acoustic Croweology in August 2010, the band started a 20th anniversary tour that will be followed by a second hiatus for an undefined length of time.

The band has opened for various rock acts such as Heart, Robert Plant, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, the Dave Matthews Band, the Grateful Dead,[2] Aerosmith[3] and ZZ Top,[4] and performed live with Jimmy Page and Oasis, among others. The band has sold over 30 million albums,[2] and is listed at number 92 on VH1's "100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock".[5] They were also labeled by Melody Maker as "The Most Rock 'n' Roll Rock 'n' Roll Band in the World"[6] and the readers of Rolling Stone voted them 'Best New American Band' in 1990. 





Shake Your Money Maker 1990


Shake Your Money Maker is the debut album by the American blues-rock band The Black Crowes, released in January 1990 on Def American Recordings. It is the only album by the band to feature guitarist Jeff Cease. The album is named after a classic blues song written by Elmore James. The Black Crowes have played the song live many times over the years, but it is not included on this album. Shake Your Money Maker peaked at number 4 on the Billboard 200, and two of its singles, "Hard to Handle" and "She Talks to Angels", reached number 1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. "Jealous Again", "Twice As Hard" and "Seeing Things" were also charting singles in the US.

The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion is the second album by the American blues-rock group The Black Crowes, released on May 12, 1992. It was the first record by the band to feature Marc Ford on lead guitar, replacing Jeff Cease, who was fired the year before. It features four hit singles; "Remedy" (#1 on the Album Rock Tracks chart for 11 weeks), "Thorn in My Pride" (#1 on the Album Rock Tracks chart for four weeks), "Sting Me" (#1 on the Album Rock Tracks chart for two weeks), and "Hotel Illness" (#1 on the Album Rock Tracks chart for six weeks). It was a record for an album to feature four album rock number-one hits (previously set by Tom Petty in 1989, with three). The album itself reached the top spot of the Billboard 200 album chart, propelled by the success of these singles. In 2006, the album was ranked number 100 on Guitar World magazine's list of the greatest 100 guitar albums of all time

Amorica 1994



Amorica is the third album by The Black Crowes. It was released in late 1994 on American Recordings and re-issued in the US and UK in 1998 with two bonus tracks. The album cover's depiction of pubic hair, from a 1976 United States Bicentennial issue of Hustler magazine,[4] caused controversy. The record company ended up putting out an alternative cover that blacked out the offending image. Amorica eventually reached Gold status in the United States, shipping 500,000 copies.

By Your Side 1999



By Your Side is the fifth studio album by American rock band The Black Crowes. It was released in early 1999 on Columbia Records, following the band's move from American Recordings. Second guitarist Marc Ford and bassist Johnny Colt had left The Black Crowes in 1997. Audley Freed and Sven Pipien were hired as the band's new guitarist and bassist, respectively, though Rich Robinson played all the guitar parts on By Your Side. The album was recorded in New York City during the second quarter of 1998 and produced by Kevin Shirley. By Your Side comprised songs written in the studio, revised songs from pre-production and re-recorded songs from the shelved album Band (1997).

The Black Crowes promoted By Your Side by performing on numerous television programs in North America and Europe. The album debuted at its peak position of number 26 on the Billboard 200 and generally received positive reviews. While some critics depreciated By Your Side for its similarity to albums by Rod Stewart and The Rolling Stones, most reviewers lauded The Black Crowes' return to the straightforward approach of their debut album, Shake Your Money Maker (1990). Chris Robinson's singing and Rich's guitar playing also won praise from critics, though reviews of the lyrics were mixed.

Lions 2001


Lions is the sixth studio album by American rock band The Black Crowes. It was released in 2001 as their first album on V2 Records following their departure from Columbia, and is their only studio album to feature guitarist Audley Freed. Lions was recorded in New York City in January and February of that year, and was produced by Don Was. Bass guitar duties were shared by Rich Robinson and Was, as Greg Rzab had left the band and was not replaced until the tour that followed the release of the album.

The album debuted on the Billboard 200 at its peak position of 20, selling more than 53,000 copies in its first week. Lions received mixed reviews; although the overall sound of the album generally garnered praise, a frequent complaint was the lack of "memorable" songs. The critics who rated Lions lowest considered it a poor imitation of the band's influences, such as Led Zeppelin.

The band supported Lions with two North American tours (one with Oasis co-headlining), and a short tour of Europe and Japan in between. Soundboard recordings of several concerts were available for download to those who owned the album. Following the tour, the band went on hiatus until 2005.

Before The Frost... Until The Freeze 2009



Before the Frost...Until the Freeze is a 2009 double album by blues-rock band The Black Crowes. It was recorded before a live audience at Levon Helm's Woodstock, NY studio, The Barn in late February and early March, 2009. [1] The album was produced by long time band collaborator Paul Stacey, and released on Silver Arrow Records. The CD itself is designed to have the appearance of a vinyl record. Originally, only the Before the Frost portion of the double album was available on CD, and the CD purchase came with a code allowing download of the Until the Freeze portion from the Black Crowes website. A vinyl version was also released, featuring all songs but in a different running order.


Before the Frost...Until the Freeze received generally favorable reviews upon its release, receiving a 75/100 critic score and a 9/10 user score on MetaCritic.[9] Paste Magazine noted the album "captures the best aspects of one of rockâ€™s finest eras: a balance of structured songwriting and loose grooves, catchy choruses and meandering solos, hard rocking songs and easy-going attitude,"[10] while All Music Guide note that the band "wear their years proudly on this terrific album, sounding like the veteran roadhounds they've always aspired to be."[11] Many critics also noted the renewed stylistic approach of the band on Before the Frost..., with Uncut Magazine calling the album "an inspired move"[12] and The Record Review commenting that the record "feels right, as if this is exactly the record that they needed to make at this point, both to separate from their musical past as well as to open up the future."

Live at the Greek: Excess All Areas is a double live album by Jimmy Page and The Black Crowes, released by musicmaker.com on 29 February 2000 and later by TVT Records on 4 July 2000. In October 1999, Page teamed up with The Black Crowes for a two-night performance of material from the Led Zeppelin catalogue and old blues and rock standards. Due to contractual problems with their record company, The Black Crowes were unable to release any of their own songs which were played at the Greek shows. These songs, on which Jimmy Page played with the Crowes, included: "Wiser Time", "No Speak No Slave", "Remedy", "Hard to Handle", and "She Talks to Angels". The double CD was released in stores by TVT Records on 4 July 2000, and featured a different track running order, an extra song, an enhanced Quicktime video and photographs taken during the concert. The Japanese version of the album also features "Misty Mountain Hop" and "In the Light", recorded in 2000.
