These Sensational recordings of Stan Getz at the famous jazzscene 'Harlem' in Nalen, Stockholm from 1959, have been lost for 52 years.
Luckily, the tapes were found in the spring of 2011.
You'll find Getz at his very peak together with the late great Swedish pianist Jan Johansson, American bassplayer Daniel Jordan and the Danish drum-virtuoso Wlliam ShiÃ¶pffe. All the guys are playing at the top of their game. If you're a Getz fan this record is a must! World class!! Enjoy!!
