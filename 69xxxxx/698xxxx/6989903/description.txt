The latest offering from Celtic Woman is enchanting, beautiful music that once again expands from its Celtic music base to include music from other genres (such as Bridge Over roubled Waters and the inspirational You'll Never Walk Alone) that they easily bring under their distinctive umbrella of excellent interpretations. Gone are Lynn, Alex, Mav, and +rla, as this latest edition of Celtic Woman features the marvelous angelic voices of Lisa Kelly, Chlo? Agnew, the newest vocalist Lisa Lambe, along with M?irad Nesbitt's marvelous fiddling. The highlights include the fiery vocal and orchestral drama of "Awakening" with all three singers. "The Foxhunter" has Nesbitt's high-energy fiddling stirring up a swirling jig. "The Water is Wide" is a true love song
of equal cooperation featuring Kelly and Nesbitt. The lovely updated "Black is the Colour" gets a modern-day spin and Lisa Lambe is glorious amid strings and flutes. Chloe's "Ave Maria" is indeed heavenly and quite touching. And perhaps best of all, the "Songs From The Heart" duo, "Teir Abhaile Riu" and "The Parting Glass" with high-energy performances by all four ladies that virtually
define what the Celtic Woman experience is about. Recorded in excellent sound. Kudos to David Downes. My Highest Recommendation.
