Frankie is a successful business manager for BT in Newcastle. Sahara is a successful textile manager working for a big fashion chain. Lee works in a workshop fitting stereos into Japanese cars. At the start of the film they all have one thing in common, they have decided to throw in their traditional careers to take up a career in pornography. Despite being 38, married and a mother, Frankie starts out with a simple boy/girl shoot before moving onto girl/girl and more intense stuff. Sahara's unique looks get her work quickly and is soon progressing well. Lee is finding out that very few men are actually suited to the demanding requirements of a male porn actor. Their experiences are different and highlight aspects of the industry.
