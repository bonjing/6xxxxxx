In Jersey City, an African American hit man follows "Hagakure:
The Way of the Samurai." He lives alone, in simplicity with
homing pigeons for company, calling himself Ghost Dog.
His master, who saved his life eight years ago, is part of the
local mob. When the boss' daughter witnesses one of Ghost Dog's
hits, he becomes expendable. The first victims are his birds,
and in response, Ghost Dog goes right at his attackers but does
not want to harm his master or the young woman. On occasion, he
talks with his best friend, a French-speaking Haitian who sells
ice cream in the park, and with a child with whom he discusses
books. Can he stay true to his code? And if he does, what is
his fate?
