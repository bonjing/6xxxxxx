I wrote lots of programs for it, I could write capitals and small type, characters for many languages, I had fabulous astronomy programs, about 600 programs of all kinds, I had it plugged to a Canon BJ200 printer, I had a modem to connect to the primitive networks, I didnt need anything else, but the internet changed that...."
n I got that Casio thing - I never used it much."
