American Blend (2006)

This is a story of a blended Indian/American family. Somehow they've managed to make a family life, except Maya calls Raj by his name, not Dad like Niki and Brijesh. Raj runs the Bollywood Cafe, which is in LA. Jamie has a dance studio with a small class of students, including Maya, learning Kathak. And each night at suppertime, they all sit down together like a real family. But the family harbors a secret that is like a bomb with a fuse that is slowly burning down...
