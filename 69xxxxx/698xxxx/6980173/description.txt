Eleven months after driving his car into Cuddy's house, three of which were spent on the run and the other eight in prison, House goes before the parole board and learns he has five days left before he is released. Before he does though, a gang leader demands twenty Vicodin as an "exit tax". As House scrambles to pay up, he tries to treat another inmate (Sebastian Sozzi) with joint pain while turning Dr. Jessica Adams (Odette Annable) to his point of view.
