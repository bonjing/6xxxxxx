In August 2011, Cohen completed work on a forthcoming studio album, Old Ideas, with producer Ed Sanders
and on October 18, 2011, the official release date leaked to leonardcohenforum.com. During the 2008-2010 tours,
Cohen showcased some new songs which were supposed to be released on the album: "The Darkness", "Lullaby",
"Born in Chains", and "Feels So Good", while some other songs titles, like "Amen" and "The Street",
were announced. Some of these songs were co-written (and co-produced) with Sharon Robinson and Anjani Thomas.
At least one more song has been tried out at the daily sound checks ("My Oh My"). 
The first new songs were presented back in 2006, on KCRW radio, where Cohen played two demo tracks, 
"Book of Longing" and "Puppets". But in August 2011 statement to the leonardcohenforum, Cohen confirmed that
only one song, "Darkness", made it into the final cut, while the others are deemed unfinished and left for the next
(i.e. after Old Ideas) album.    -source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_cohen
