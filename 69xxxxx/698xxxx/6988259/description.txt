[/b][/color] Hosted by rock legend Dave Navarro and judged by icons of the tattoo world, Chris Nunez and Oliver Peck, 10 of the country's most creative and skilled tattoo artists descend on NYC to compete for a hundred thousand dollars and the title of INK MASTER.
The stakes couldn't be higher with 'Living Canvasses' donating their skin to be permanently marked in this adrenalized competition elimination.
