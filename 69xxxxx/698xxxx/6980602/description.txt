Intervention.S12E04.Kimberly.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 179MB]

[/b][/color] A new documentary series, INTERVENTION  profiles people who are losing the battle with their addictions, and whose friends and families feel the only remaining option is to hold an intervention.
Each documentary follows the lives of these addicts, taking an unflinching look at the impact of their addictions on their everyday lives, all the while the addicts are unaware that an intervention is being planned.
Each airing ends with the friends, family and a professional interventionist urging the addict to get treatment.
If the individual should choose treatment, the addict immediately enters a widely respected treatment facility.
