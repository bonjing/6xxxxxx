How.To.Cook.Like.Heston.S01E04.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 115MB]

[/b][/color] After years of passionately seeking culinary perfection, Heston Blumenthal demonstrates not just how to cook, but why certain things do or don't work, as he dispels some of the myths inherited from our mother's kitchen.

Britain's most visionary chef delivers meticulously tested tips and techniques to help viewers transform their dinners from bog standard to reliably brilliant without even breaking a sweat.

Each episode concentrates on one everyday ingredient - eggs, chicken, beef, chocolate, cheese and spuds - and features recipes for big favourites such as roast chicken, the perfect steak, and how to pull off the ultimate chocolate cake.

The series is packed with straightforward advice, while special cameras show what actually happens to food as it hits the pan or roasts in the oven.
