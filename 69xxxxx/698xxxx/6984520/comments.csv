in 1987 in England. Originally listening to Punk rock, metal and alternative music, it wasnâ€™t until hearing Atari Teenage Riotâ€™s DIY ethics to making music it began influencing him to make his own music in 2003 as the Teenage Angst Brigade, a anti-tribute to the band itself. after the discovery of the uprising of the breakcore scene and infinate usuage of samples, this would later influence his later work.

Thanks, dramacore. I'm down for the music. Cheers."
