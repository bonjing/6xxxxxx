 It has been eight years since "An Introduction to the Grammar of English" was first published. The 
 second edition is completely revised and greatly expanded, especially where texts, example 
 sentences, exercises, and cartoons are concerned. It continues to provide a very lively and 
 clearly written textbook. The book introduces basic concepts of grammar in a format which 
 inspires the reader to use linguistic arguments. The style of the book is engaging and examples
 from poetry, jokes, and puns illustrate grammatical concepts. The focus is on syntactic analysis
 and evidence. However, special topic sections contribute sociolinguistic and historical reasons
 behind prescriptive rules such as the bans on split infinitives, dangling participles, and preposition
 stranding. The book is written for undergraduate students and structured for a semester-long course.
