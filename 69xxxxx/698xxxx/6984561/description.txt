India's greatest epic comes to life on the silver screen in director Babubhai Mistri's sweeping film of the ancient Sanskrit legend. Two clans, the Kaurav and the Pandav, vie for the vast kingdom of Hastinapur. The five heroic Pandav brothers endure treachery, attempted murder and 13 years of exile at the hands of their envious Kaurav cousins, never losing their determination to regain the throne. Ultimately, the sovereignty of Hastinapur is determined by a historic war of enormous proportions between the Kauravs and Pandavs.
