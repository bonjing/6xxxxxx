                           The Complete Season 1


Prime Suspect is an American police procedural television drama series.

The crime drama Prime Suspect takes a look inside a New York City homicide department. The series stars Maria Bello as tough-as-nails NYPD homicide Detective Jane Timoney, an outsider who has just transferred to a new squad where her new colleagues already dislike her. Jane is confident and focusedâ€”and also rude, abrupt and occasionally reckless. She has her vices, and rumors about how she got the job follow her everywhereâ€”but at the end of the day, she is an instinctively brilliant cop who can not be distracted from the only important thing: the prime suspect. The series allows us to plunge into the life of Jane Timoney as we also investigate New York crimes and uncover intriguing mysteries.
