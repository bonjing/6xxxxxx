the commentaries I have are from NTSC DVD rips I made over the years with commentary encoded as an additional track. From what I remember, there mostly encoded as AAC stereo 192kps. For a 2 hour movie this usually comes in at around 120-150mb. I think its a good size for decent quality audio. 

I'm going to be uploading more commentaries in the future. There fairly hard to come by in the filesharing world so I hope I can inspire others to share their's as well."
