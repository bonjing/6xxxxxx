Borderlands 1.3.0 + update 1.4.1 (Jimbus edition), just install, update and play.
--------------------------------


Features of this edition:

- Two files: the game updated to the 1.3.0 version (which includes the three first DLC: Ned, Moxxi and Knoxx) and with the videos semi-ripped to be able to make a DVD-5, and the update to the 1.4.1, which also includes the "Claptrapâ€™s Robot Revolution" DLC. So, you can burn the game in one DVD and its final update to another one.

- The game is only in English and Spanish and works online.

- It includes a savegame with everything unlocked and a hunter with awesome weapons and items.


Because of the video ripping, this edition is specially thought for those who have already played the game and know the story but want to replay it with friends cooperatively.
