
From executive producer J.J. Abrams (FRINGE, â€œLost,â€ â€œStar Trek,â€ and the recent blockbuster â€œSuper 8â€) comes ALCATRAZ, a thrilling new series that follows a unique trio investigating the mystifying reappearance of 302 of Alcatrazâ€™s most notorious prisoners and guards, 50 years after they vanished.

When San Francisco Police Department DET. REBECCA MADSEN (Sarah Jones) is assigned to a grisly homicide case, a fingerprint leads her to a seemingly impossible suspect: JACK SYLVANE (guest star Jeffrey Pierce), an Alcatraz inmate who died over 30 years ago. Given her family history â€“ both her grandfather and surrogate uncle, RAY ARCHER (Robert Forster), were guards at the prison â€“ Madsenâ€™s interest is immediately piqued. When the enigmatic, knows-everything-but-tells-nothing government agent EMERSON HAUSER (Sam Neill) tries to impede her investigation, she becomes doggedly committed to it.
