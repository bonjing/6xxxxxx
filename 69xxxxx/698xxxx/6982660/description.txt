Shameless.9x04.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 217MB]

[/b][/color] Blisteringly funny, offbeat drama following the rollercoaster lives and loves of an anarchic family from Manchester.
Meet the Gallaghers.
Mum went AWOL years ago, Dad stayed at home with the six children only to hit the bottle.
And sometimes the kids... The real head of the family is big sister Fiona  20 , who looks after Carl  11 , Debbie  9  and baby Liam  3 . She is occasionally helped, more often hindered, by reluctant virgin  Lip   16  and the actively gay, but very private, Ian  15 .   Welcome to a hectic world of sexual adventures, triumphs, love, scams and a fair bit of crime on a rough Manchester housing estate, where wheel-less cars are the norm and the moving ones are stolen.
