Storyline

In 1944 Poland, a Jewish shop keeper named Jakob is summoned to ghetto headquarters after being caught out near curfew. While waiting for the German Kommondant, Jakob overhears a German radio broadcast about Russian troop movements. Returned to the ghetto, the shopkeeper shares his information with a friend and then rumors fly that there is a secret radio within the ghetto. Jakob uses the chance to spread hope throughout the ghetto by continuing to tell favorable tales of information from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"his secret radio.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Jakob, however, has a real secret in that he is hiding a young Jewish girl who escaped from a camp transport train. A rather uplifting and slightly humorous film about World War II Jewish Ghetto life.

This is an important story, and please keep in mind it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a 2 hour movie. I
will not compromise this story with a small file size. I have reviewed the entire
movie and I did not note any problems.


I made this upload, because I will seed it. There is another similar torrent that
leaves 20+ down loaders stuck at 70%. I know because I was one of them.

Again, this is a 2 hour movie, and the reason why the file size may seem too large.

If you enjoy this torrent, please help to seed.
