His advise is generally quite good and sensible. I also give him credit for bringing others on the show to give health advice and tips."
e Gary his say on things, and Dr Oz has a point, its hard to cut out allot of things and stay on only certain foods for your whole life, whereas changing your diet a little makes it easier, the comment previous seems to have nothing but anger and vendetta against a very good doctor, who's shows are informative and interesting, it is too bad that when a person only sees though a narrow mind, they only see what they want to see and not the actual truth."
