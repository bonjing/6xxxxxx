Criticism of the Western Civilization - Collection 14 (Imperialism, Culture of War):

It is only a few weeks since the official end to the war in Iraq, and the warmongers and arms manufacturers and dealers are already banging the drums for the next war; the target this time is Iran. With a tightening economic crisis in most of the Western countries, another major war has a double benefit; more people can be brought to work in the flourishing death industry and the publicâ€™s attention and focus will be diverted to the war. Actually there is a third benefit to the West; the fools in the rich Arab countries in the Persian Gulf will pay the bills of the war.
