i take it u r on a fileshareing forum.copy & past the link into ur http:// bar & go.you will then be showing a page saying preamium/regular download,click regular,free or slow,not preamium.it will ask u to wait aprox:30seconds,then click download and save to ur comp.
sometimes the file might be in a compact file called winrar,to unpac this download winrar from tpb and right click on file to open.
this may sound complicated but you will soon get the hang of it,let me know how u get on.
u can always send me a pm on the site in question.good luck."
