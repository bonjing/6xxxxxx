DJ FM's 4th release, "Influenced" (2009), is a complete departure in style. A collaboration between FM and NC-based hip-hop MC Big Hop, the album contains a blend of drum&bass, hip-hop, and rock which will make you want to jump up and RAGE! 

All files are 320kbps, 44.1 sample rate, joint stereo mp3's

From FM:
"All my music is available here for free, but if you'd also like to support me (i.e. rent, groceries, gas, etc), please visit my website and buy a track or two! I have no record label, no marketing machine (other than me), no gimmicks, just me and my choons! Thanks always...peace and beats :) -FM"
