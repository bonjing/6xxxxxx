Call.Me.Fitz.S02E04.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 128MB]

[/b][/color] Set almost entirely in a used car dealership, Call Me Fitz follows a handsome, substance abusing scoundrel, Fitz, who torments his naive co workers, sleeps with any woman who has a pulse and thinks his life is perfect.
 In an attempt to secure a hold on ???Salesman of the Year,??? Fitz takes a potential customer for a test drive ??? and she winds up in a coma.
The accident itself unleashes something in Fitz: the last unblemished corner of his damaged soul.
Larry shows up on the Fitzpatrick lot intent on rehabilitating Fitz's battered psyche and the entire Fitz family's sleazy way of life.
This is not as easy as he'd hoped, as daily events include impromptu porn shoots, black market kidney trading, sniper shakedowns, cowboy themed bachelor parties, long nights in the drunk tank and more brain damaged sex than even Fitz can handle.
It???s all in a day's work at Fitzpatrick Motors.
