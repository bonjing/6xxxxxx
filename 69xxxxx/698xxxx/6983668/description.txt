Baby Bink couldn\'t ask for more; he has adoring
(if somewhat sickly-sweet) parents, he lives in
a huge mansion, and he\'s just about to appear
in the social pages of the paper.
Unfortunately, not everyone in the world is as
nice as Baby Bink\'s parents; especially the three
enterprising kidnapers who pretend to be photographers
from the newspaper. Successfully kidnaping Baby Bink,
they have a harder time keeping hold of the rascal,
who not only keeps one step ahead of them, but seems
to be more than a little bit smarter than the three
bumbling criminals.
