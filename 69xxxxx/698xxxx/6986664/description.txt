      SPECiAL NOTES : This rip is from the newly released Miramax
                      Collector's Edition DVD.  The considerably remastered
                      video alone makes this a worthwhile rip, since we all
                      know that a better DVD = a better DVD-Rip. For some fun,
                      check out the Trivia subtitle stream.

                      To view the subtitle streams install DVobSub available
                      from www.doom9.net.
