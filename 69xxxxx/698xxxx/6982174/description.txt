Tony Parisi is a real "man's man" and all around "good guy". He works hard at his job. He's a loyal friend. And, he's devoted to his fiance.
He also happens to be completely and utterly homophobic. Tony takes great pleasure in ridiculing his new, gay co-worker, Steve. That is until fate and a magic Christmas ornament step in to teach him a lesson.
Two weeks before his wedding, Tony finds that he is suddenly gay, while Steve learns he has mysteriously turned straight.
Now, truly a man's man, Tony must scramble to straighten out in time for his wedding. But, not before he walks a mile in Steve's shoes
