Screenshot Utility[CRACKED][Team Nanban][TPB]

VERSION: 1.0

DESCRIPTION:

Screenshot Utility is a small, easy-to-use screen capture program that sits in the Windows system tray. When you press a hotkey, it captures and saves a snapshot of your screen to a JPG, GIF or BMP file.

Screenshot Utility Features:

- Redefinable hotkeys
- Can capture active windows
- Runs automatically on system startup
- Can play sound alerts
- Automatic screenshot file naming
- Can copy captured screenshots to the clipboard

Supported Graphic Formats:

- JPG (JPEG images)
- GIF (Compuserve GIF images)
- BMP (Windows bitmap images)


You can define your own hotkey, choose default path for saving files, and select area to capture (entire screen or active window). After a screenshot was captured, Screenshot Utility alerts you with a message or a sound. You can choose an option for automatic saving (the program will automatically increment file name counter for each captured screenshot), or you can select the filename manually after each capture.

Screenshot Utility is small, simple and easy to use. You don't need to read any manuals to get started. Just install it and capture your screenshots!
