Gregorian Chant in it's purest form. Here the Schola Cantorum of the Saint Bavo cathedral in Ghent, Belgium, performs 31 songs from different times of the liturgical calendar. Amongst these the 7 songs from the Liturgia Defunctorum (the Mass of the Dead) are of the very best ever performed. The same goes for the advent- song 'Rorate Coelis'. More details on the choir, performers and conductor as well as the textes from the songs (in latin) are to be found in de included pdf- leaflet. All songs are in high quality flac files. Production dates back from 1988.
