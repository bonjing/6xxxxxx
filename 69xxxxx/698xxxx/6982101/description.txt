Art of Survival
By painting, performing and by virtue of bare-faced cheek, the four artistic adventurers have just their art and inspiration to survive on as they make their way across Europe, with the winning team being the pair that has made the most money throughout the trip.In a gruelling contest, tensions mount as the teams beg, blag and bicker their way across Europe in search of food, a place to stay and a (preferably free) ride. This forty day adventure proves tougher than any of them ever thought possible, as the money dries up the teams are forced to push themselves harder than ever before in the struggle not only to survive but to make it to the final.Art of Survival is the definitive arts hustle and the ultimate answer to the age old question: what is art really worth?


1)  Part 1 
Four artists, including 2 cellists, an opera singer and an award-winning portrait painter have been dropped in Athens, Greece with no money, no credit cards and only their talent to get them back home for a prestigious appearance at the Edinburgh Festival. Singer Lindsey Crow and cellist Li Lu take on artist Johan Andersson and cellist Janie Price in a race from Athens to Edinburgh, financed only by the cash they make from their own art

2)  Part 2 
With empty pockets, Janie and Johan take a big risk when they take a detour to Capri. Meanwhile, an undercover police officer puts an end to Li Lu and Lindsey's moneymaking in Rome.

With just ten euros, Lindsey and Li Lu take a huge gamble when they check into a 250-euro-a-night hotel in Venice. Meanwhile, Janie battles for a slot on a Florence radio station.

4)  Part 4 
While Janie and Johan are forced to sleep on the streets in Zurich, back in Italy, Li Lu and Lindsey make a 4,500 pound trade that changes the entire course of the competition. Johan and Janie take a trip to the Basel's prestigious Laleh June Galerie to see if Johan can sell them a painting.

With ten days to go, just 143 pounds separate the two teams. Cellist Li Lu and soprano Lindsey busk in Paris, while artist Johan and singer Janie hope to strike it rich in Dusseldorf. The girls have run out of money and are weighing up their options.
