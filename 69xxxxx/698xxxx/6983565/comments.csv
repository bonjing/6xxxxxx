log that I was using a illegal copy and that my game might crash. When I pressed ok and continued it worked fine untill I tried to go in to any city, then it crashed.. I hope someone can fix this problem beacuse I did everything right with the installation, and when that was complete I copied the files to the right location.. So somthing isnt right.."
