SOME TRIVIA FROM IMDB

The budget for the film was so small that the Scottish wedding wasn't filmed in Scotland, and the extras had to bring their own suits to the weddings.

While making the film, Hugh Grant thought the movie was awful. 

As of 1999 it is the highest-grossing British film in cinema history with worldwide box office in excess of $260 million. 

The first British film since A Fish Called Wanda to top the US box office charts. 

Hugh Grant had to learn British Sign Language for his scenes with his deaf brother, played by David Bower, who is deaf in real life.

Rowan Atkinson's favorite film of his own. 

For his audition, Hugh Grant played a tape of when he was best man at his brother's wedding.
