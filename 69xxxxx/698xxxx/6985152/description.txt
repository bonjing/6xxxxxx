"All my music is available here for free, but if you'd also like to support me (i.e. help me pay for rent, groceries, gas, etc), please visit my website and buy a track or two! I have no record label, no marketing machine (other than me), no gimmicks, just me and my choons! ...peace and beats :) -FM"
