,Carbon254,2012-04-22T05:20Z,"mse DID catch trojan G.exe (threat level severe) when transfering files to USB.

Then USB would not boot. Trojan being integral to boot menu.

I re-installed to USB using ultraISO, which installs its own boot loader.
mse did not pick up the trojan this time, having been removed automatically the first time.
Thankyou Microsoft!

Installed fine and seems to be ok, so far.
Though sp1 will not install.

WARNING!!!! DO NOT BURN TO DISK AND INSTALL. SEVERE TROJAN INSIDE."
