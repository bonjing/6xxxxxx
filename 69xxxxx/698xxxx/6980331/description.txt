The film focuses on two separate love stories in Chennai; one takes place in the period of a day, while the other ensues for months.

Amudha (Ananya), a naive village girl from Trichy arrives in Chennai for a job interview, but her sister is unable to meet her and direct her to her destination. Amudha enlists the aid of a complete stranger Gautham (Sharvanand), who agrees to take her as far as the bus stop. However, he ends up reluctantly travelling with her the entire day, waiting for her during her interview, and finally dropping her at her sister's home in the evening. In the course of the day, she comes to understand him as a person and becomes fond of him, and, while remaining calm and reserved, Gautham too reciprocates her feelings. The following day Amudha returns to Trichy, where she realizes she has fallen in love with him even though she doesn't know his name and rejects other marriage proposals that come her way. She eventually decides to return to Chennai to meet him. Meanwhile Gautham realizes that he has fallen in love with Amudha and decides to go to Trichy to find her despite not knowing her address and other any details except her name.

A parallel story follows Kathiresan (Jai), a metal shop worker, who harbor love towards his neighbor Manimegalai (Anjali), a nurse. Being shy and soft-spoken, he doesn't talk to her, but continues to watch her every morning for six months. Manimegalai, however, is more bold and forthcoming; she agrees to his love and orders him around mercilessly. She puts him through several tests; having him meet her father (a policeman), her former one-side lover on his own, performs a HIV test, and gets him to agree to organ donation. She wants him to decide on the basis of all that she's put him through as to whether he wants to marry her and spend the rest of his life with her; Kathiresan responds affirmatively. The two grow to love each other unconditionally with the consent of their families.

Kathiresan decides to take Manimegalai to visit his family in a village Arasur near Villupuram, and the two board a bus to take them there. Meanwhile, Gautham boards a bus to return Chennai from Trichy - the same one that Kathiresan and Manimegalai are travelling in. Simultaneously, Amudha boards a bus to return Trichy from Chennai in order to without seeing Gautham. Few glimpses of other passengers are also seen: a mother and her child, an all-girl athletic team, a newly married couple, two college students who are attracted to each other, and a man returning from Dubai to see his five years old daughter for the first time

At a distance from Villupuram, on the Chennai-Suryapet highway, both the buses collide head-on, killing about 35 people on the spot. Many others die en route to the hospital or at the hospital including Kathiresan. Gautham sees Amudha, severely injured, on the other bus and she is rushed to a hospital. Manimegalai stays at the scene to help the wounded. By the time she reaches the hospital along with Gautham, Kathiresan has already succumbed to head trauma. At the hospital, Gautham confesses his love to Amudha at her bedside, and she manages to regain consciousness. Kathiresan's body is taken away by a hysteric Manimegalai and his grieving parents. The site of the crash is declared an accident prone area, and the film ends with a message on road safety.
