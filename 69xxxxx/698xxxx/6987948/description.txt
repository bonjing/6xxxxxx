SOME TRIVIA FROM IMDB

Sofia Coppola was very interested in directing this project, but she was only willing to direct one part of 'Breaking Dawn', which Summit wanted to split in two parts. 

Stephenie Meyer has a cameo role as a wedding guest. She can be seen as Bella walks down the aisle. 

A Summit studio official and Stephenie Meyer met with Mark Waters and Gus Van Sant to discuss the possibility of directing.
