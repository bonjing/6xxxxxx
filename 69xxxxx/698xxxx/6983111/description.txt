Arts series. In Jennifer Lebeaus film, Simon and Garfunkel: The Harmony Game, Paul Simon and 
Art Garfunkel talk openly and eloquently about an extraordinarily creative period in their career
the making of Bridge Over Troubled Water. The story behind what was to become their final album 
has long been shrouded in rock and roll mythology and is told in gripping detail in these rare 
interviews. Archive footage is used to reveal technical breakthroughs and the emotional feelings 
the two artists had for each other.
