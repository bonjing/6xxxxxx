you download FROM your ps3s net connection?
or from your lappy/pc then upped to the ps3 via disc/usb flash dongle? Only use ps3 for games 2 b honest but the codecs are different to the conventionaltorrent ones,whereas most on here have Klite codecs on computer-but not on the ps3(though these files play on my bog standard windows 7 lappy-no codex at all) Id try the file on ya pC/Lappy first & eliminate from there....-cheers for this one WTC-SWE"
