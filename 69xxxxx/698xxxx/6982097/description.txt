Title speaks for itself. Virtual machine of Android 4.0.1, and can run on almost any PC. It's designed to be universal so certain sound boards and wifi etc. won't be supported unless you fix them in order to get the best compatibility for everyone. Can be run in Virtual Box or VMware, check the links to see how to set them up. Uncompressed folder is around 900MB. 

Great for tinkerers and developers, remember to seed!
