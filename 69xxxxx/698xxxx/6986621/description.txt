                                  . ..: PLOT :.. .
     
               This movie is concerned with intelligence as the division
               between animal and human, then asks a question; what is
               the next division? Technology is treated as irrelevant to
               the quest - literally serving as mere vehicles for the
               human crew, and as a shell for the immature HAL entity.
               Story told as a montage of impressions, music and
               impressive and careful attention to subliminal detail. A
               very influential film and still a class act, even after
               25 years.
