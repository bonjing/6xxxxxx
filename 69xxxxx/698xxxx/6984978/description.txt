                           DESCRiPTiON 

 DIY SOS is a makeover show of people's properties. Each week Nick Knowles and 
 the team transform different rooms in viewer's houses.                        
                                                                               
 Nick and his team get the help of a local community in Dartford to help to help 
 a woman who was forced to call a halt to renovation work on her post-war pre-fab 
 home after her son was diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder. 
                                                                       
                                 Enjoy!
