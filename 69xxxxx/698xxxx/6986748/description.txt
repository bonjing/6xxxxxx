Another update from developer Evilnat, aka nathanr3269 has also released an update for
his PS3 PUP/Dev_Flash File Spoofer v3 Tool. This tool set will allow users to spoof the
necessary files from a PUP, or Dev_Flash files. As with his other release, this will not work
on CMD for Windows, and is intended for use on Cygwin and Ubuntu.
