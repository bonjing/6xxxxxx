Synopsis:
-----------

46 6 "Riddle of the Sphinx" Seung-Hyun Oh James Felder December 16, 2011 694-046 

The gang go to Cairo, Egypt, where Black Knight has teams investigate the Sphinx's secret tomb. 
When Holiday discovers a tomb with a nanite as an emblem on the wall, Rex uses his nanites to 
open the door, but accidentally reawakens Garan-Set- an E.V.O. mummy, who is in shock to see Rex's 
astonishing abilities. Black Knight follows the guys as Garan-Set awakens. Garan-Set displays power 
over nanites, which have been around for centuries, and immunity to Providence technology. 
Garan-Set escapes using mummies re-animated by a staff he wield similar to a nanite disruptor. 
Garan-Set makes his way to the Sphinx statue to reawaken his stead, the Sphinx. As Holiday, Six, 
Bobo, and Black Knight fend off a nanite/mummy hoard, they discover a nanite generator and technology 
similar to the technology which had created the nanites, being the Hall of Records. 
Meanwhile, Rex catches up with Garan-Set, whose powers visibly deteriorate, causing a cave in at the 
group's position. Garan-Set's final words were that he could have stopped the hunger, wars, and plagues, 
and reveals that his "father" told him all about Rex, much to Rex's surprise and shock.

Later, Black Knight destroys the Hall of Records after taking what she needed from the Sphinx's tomb. 
This prevents Rex and his team from learning the truth of how nanites were made in ancient times, and 
who had created Garan-Set. On Black Knight's airship, she is last seen looking at a hieroglyph of 
Van Kliess- indicating that Breach had sent him to ancient Egypt in the second season finale, and that 
Black Knight has some connection to what is really going on.
