Bayou Billionaires

In a modern day rags to riches story, Bayou Billionaires tells the story of the Dowdens of Shreveport, La. -- a hardworking family of modest means who recently discovered their home sits on the fourth largest deposit of natural gas in the United States. After years of pinching pennies and balancing budgets, the over-the-top Dowdens are ready to enjoy the finer things in life, sparing no expense. Bayou Billionaires follows Gerald and Kitten and the rest of their family as they experience the perks of belonging to a brand new tax bracket. Each half-hour episode features this outrageous family reaping the benefits of their new fortune, from hiring personal trainers and exploring new business ventures, to traveling to places they never imagined they'd go. In the series premiere, the entire family takes the local country club by storm when they pay a visit to see how the other half lives.
