I don't believe this is available on CD or as a download.
Recorded from vinyl using Linn Sondek LP12 turntable, Shrynx arm, Audio Technica OC9 cartridge (stylus costs over -รยบ300!), Musical Fidelity X-LP preamp, Philips CDR951 CD recorder, edited on PC hopefully removing any major crackles.
In other words better than CD quality!
