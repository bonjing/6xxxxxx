Storyine: The new â€œHarold & Kumarâ€ comedy picks up six years after the duoÃ¢Â€â„¢s last adventure. After years of growing apart, Harold Lee and Kumar Patel have replaced each other with new best friends and are preparing for their respective Christmas celebrations. But when a mysterious package arrives at Kumars door, his attempt to deliver it to Harolds house ends with him inadvertently burning down HaroldÃ¢Â€â„¢s father-in-laws prize Christmas tree. With his in-laws out of the house for less than a day, Harold decides to cover his tracks rather than come clean, and reluctantly embarks on another ill-advised but hilarious journey with Kumar, taking them through New York City on Christmas Eve in search of the perfect Christmas tree.
