When a client hefts in a 1900s penny scale from the Santa Cruz boardwalk, Rick and his crew tighten their belts. Can they successfully slim down this massive mechanism or will their weighty workload tip the scales? And later, a picker strolls in with a 1930s Taylor Tot walker. Can Ron and Brettly properly push this baby buggy bargain along or will this toddler transaction need a time out?
