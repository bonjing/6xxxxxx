I am a bit astonished the scene hasn't released this one yet - could it have something to do with the weird authoring and lots of titlesets accessed through the playing of the disc? I know I struggled myself authoring it right and removing
the obsolete titles. I thought TXF would have released this by now since the retail date in Finland was 20.01.12. Oh well, here you have a proper rip uploaded to TPB, since this site was the site that got my interrest in video-encoding going.
