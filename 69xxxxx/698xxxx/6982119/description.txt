Dreamzone, is a special world in the Galaxy, 
ruled by the kind hearted King â€œMaximusâ€ but 
unknown to him, his brother â€œBadmessâ€ is     
plotting to overthrow him. Unlike most       
superheroes who are born, Super K, a kid is  
created by Badmess using the powers of all   
the Dreamzonians. But a goof up causes Super 
K to turn out a freak, unable to control his 
powers and hence deserted by Badmess. Badmess
befriends the evil Dr. Ozox, who has his own 
sinister plan of taking over Dreamzone. Super
K and his friends, come together to protect  
Dreamzone from the evil clutches of Dr. Ozox 
but at the same time Super K has to learn to 
control his powers.
