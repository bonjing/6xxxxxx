[T],thetorrentlord,2012-01-27T02:18Z,It looks like the US big dogs have pretty much stopped direct downloading of files as most of the sites I have checked have deleted everything on their servers. Seems to be only a few from outside the US  that still have valid download links. Can BT be far behind???
