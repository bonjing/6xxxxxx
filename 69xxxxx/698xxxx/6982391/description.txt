Your English is so good, better than mine, I really thought that you must be from England !!
 
Aberdeen would not be my first chouice of a place to live. I lived for a time in Shetland and in Norway. I preferred both those places.
But I was born here, and I guess that I will die here !!
 
Some of the English in EE sounds very "Londonish", but I don't believe that people there really say things like "sling yer hook" and " let's have a knees up". That's language from the fifties !!
 
Debra is a nice name, but it does't sound very Polish. Is it short for something ?
There was a Debbie that was a very large part of my youth, Debbie Harry. 
Every schoolboy's fantasy !!
 
I think that I missed my chance with Jorunn, many years ago.
But we are still very close, and I can still dream !!
 
You should download the new series "Call the midwife". It is very good.
