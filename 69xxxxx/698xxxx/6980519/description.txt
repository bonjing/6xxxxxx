Truly Original...

Unprecedented...

Unparalleled...

Unimaginable...

For decades 3D Artist have been attracted to intuitive modeling with Simple Primitives as well as the uniquely robust and powerful characteristics of Geometric Booleans.

Unfortunately barriers remained between those systems and the ultimate goal, a High Quality Mesh

The results were unreliable, inelegant systems, limited in scope.

GroBoto has succeeded in building systems that combine Real Time, True Geometry Boolean Editing with the capability of generating High Fidelity, Beautifully Structured Meshes â€” Automatically.

These systems are both Robust & Sophisticated â€” Able to Automatically Mesh any Arbitrary, Complex arrangement of Primitives & Booleans and further, to Smooth & Stylize those Meshes creating sublime forms.

System Requirements:

Intel Mac, OX X.6 or greater
