What's New:

* 360Â° Blending

* It is always complicated to be able to stitch perfectly over the 360Â°
  edges. We had an algorithm that works well in several cases but not all 
  of them. So we decided to change totally on the internal solution to
  360Â° blending.

* Papywizard and Gigapan improvement

* With the availability of XML generation in new head, the papywizard plugin needed some improvement.
