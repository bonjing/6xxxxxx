The champ is back! Leaner, meaner, tougher, and with bigger boobs! Ariel X is a powerhouse, the strongest, most experienced wrestler at Ultimate Surrender. She is also the best trainer we have. Always teaching the wrestlers how to improve between rounds.

 Beretta James has shown great improvement since her first loss. Many think her commanding win against Charisma was an upset. Beretta is determined to be a great wrestler. She has been training off the mat and is a candidate for the rookie of the year. She is not a pushover by any means.

 The Champ is back indeed. It was a total destruction of the talented rookie. Devastating submission holds and deep finger penetration during the rounds. Beretta was out-gunned, out-wrestled, and outclassed in this one-sided Armageddon. If you want a glimpse at terror, watch why Ariel X is the best of the best of the best.
