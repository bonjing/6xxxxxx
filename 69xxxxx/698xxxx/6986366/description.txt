 Set against the background of the Battle of Waterloo,   
 Becky Sharp is the story of Vanity Fair by Thackeray.   
 Becky and Amelia are girls at school together, but      
 Becky is from a "show biz" family, or in other words,   
 very low class. Becky manages to insinuate herself in   
 Amelia's family and gets to know all their friends.     
 From this possibly auspicious- beginning, she manages   
 to ruin her own life, becoming sick, broke, and lonely, 
 and also ruins the lives of many other "loved ones". In 
 the movie we get to see the class distinctions in       
 England at the time, and get a sense of what it was     
 like for the English military at the time of the        
 Napoleonic wars.
