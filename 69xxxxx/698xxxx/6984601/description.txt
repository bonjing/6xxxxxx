The Legend of St. Dwynwen Series, Book 1

 When plain and proper Thea Bainbridge stumbles upon a baby in the manger of her churchâ€™s nativity, she is understandably shocked. Discovering a brooch bearing the insignia of Gabriel, Lord Morecombe, hidden among the childâ€™s clothing, she is certain the dissolute rake is to blame. Incensed, Thea sets out to reproach the arrogant lordâ€”only to find herself utterly swept away.
 

Enjoy!
