My second live album with material taken from my autumn tour En kvÃ¤ll med Peter JÃ¶back which was performed in 2010 all over Scandinavia. We did 42 gigs in Sweden, Finland and Norway. This album was recorded in Norway during the first part of the tour. The album was released in November the same year after the last gig at Oslo Concert Hall. It felt important to eternalize this concert this way as a memory of my great co-operation with my stage companions - Charlotte Centervall, Rickard Nilsson and Ricard Nettermalm who worked extremely hard and showed how multi talented musicians they are. There are actually no words that can explain how much I love to perform with them.
It was the first time I toured with such a stripped down and small band. I wanted to feel what happened to the songs with a smaller band - my hope was that the lyrics would take more space and the stories would emerge more - which I think they did. Nice versions of - Guldet blev till sand, Open and Hollow. My first album release with the record company Razzia, that I signed with this autumn. Looking forward to more exciting collaborations with this familial company. (peterjoback.com)
