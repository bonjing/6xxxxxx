Works perfect on my Win7Home 64-bit!
And to users with problems, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS - I DID AND IT WORKED.

eygen (RIGHT CLICK KEYGEN AND CHOOSE 'RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR) 

3.CHOOSE SONY VEGAS PRO 11 FROM THE DROPDOWN MENU, select ""patch"" and point it to your installation directory. (Default directory is c:program filessonyVegas Pro)

4. When asked for the second time, point it to the same directory -> c:program filessonyshared plugins-(FOR ME THE SHARED PLUGINS FOLDER WAS LOCATED AT -  C:Program Files (x86)/Sony/Shared Plug-Ins)

5. Start Vegas Pro and give in the serial from the keygen.

6. Give in any name and email, accept terms and conditions, click next.

7. Select: ACTIVATE FROM ANOTHER COMPUTER

8. Save the file you get anywhere.

9. Give in the authentication code and you're good to go.


So basically follow the instructions but don't forget when you get to the keygen part, right click it and run keygen as administrator. And once you choose Sony Vegas Pro 11 from the drop down menu patch it to: C:Program Files/Sony/Vegas Pro 11.0 the first time.
And then the second time patch it to: C:Program Files (x86)/Sony/Shared Plug-Ins

After that it should work. :) Hope this helps anyway that's been having problems with it.

Btw if you're getting an error message when you try to patch, try uninstalling and re-installing the program again and then follow the steps exactly as i posted."
