 By my count, there were already nine previous versions of Final Cut Pro X available here, and they were well-seeded. Each duplicate diminishes the ability of a torrent site to provide files quickly to downloaders. When the seeders are spread out over multiple dupes, download time increases for everybody.

Also, this is not the current release; both 10.0.1 and 10.0.2 are already here. 10.0.1, in particular, was a very important update that returned a number of higher-end functions to the app (10.0.0, the one you uploaded, was criticized by professionals for being like a vaguely souped-up iMovie, with some of the pro-level features stripped away). 10.0.1 restored most of that, and 10.0.2 had some other worthwhile  updates, so regardless of the problem with your decision to upload a dupe, you're also cheating downloaders of the latest, significantly improved version.

Uploaders and downloaders -- it takes five seconds to do a search on this site. That will immediately tell  you whether the file already exists, and give you information about the latest version. No one should download this version, and both because it is old, and because it is a dupe, it should never have been uploaded."
