The glistening silver centerpiece of this unique tribute to Germany's racing cars and drivers is the decade of the 1930s, when the Third Reich 
controversially backed motor sports to flaunt its skill and power. With its historic contests and sensational racing cars that decade is still classed 
as motor racing's Golden Age. This is one book that is certain to have motor racing experts and fans thoroughly exhilarated, enticed, and eager for the 
next installment.
