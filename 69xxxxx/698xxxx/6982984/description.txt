I was very surprised by how Human Again opened up. â€œFireâ€ has the lyrical prowess that sheâ€™s known for, however backed by a rather aggressive orchestral beats. That isnâ€™t the only song on here that caught my attention: â€œBlack and Blueâ€ is backed by a rather hip-pop score, while â€œPalm of Your Handâ€ is a driving rock song â€“ each of which contain rather bleak, emotional lyrics. The last half of this album is rather strong; Human Againâ€˜s first single â€œGhostâ€ is a light, relaxing pop song that should have no problem climbing Vh1â€²s music show.

Although the nice, light, poppy songs throughout the album are nice, Michaelson really excels in the slow ballads. â€œIâ€™m Throughâ€ and â€œHow We Loveâ€ are two beautiful, flowing soft songs, each really showcases Ingridâ€™s writing skills and amazing voice. My favorite track on the album is the second to last â€œKeep Warm,â€ which sounds like the perfect song that anyone can put onto a Winter season mixtape for your respective loved one.

There are a couple of tracks that didnâ€™t really grab me (â€œIn the Seaâ€), but that doesnâ€™t take away from how catchy Human Again is. This is an album that could finally put her on the commercial level that Barielles and Perri are on right now, which I feel is well deserved and now a bit overdue. Human Again is a relaxing, emotional, and well delivered album, from front to back.
