Wilfred is an Australian comedy television series directed by Tony Rogers, produced by Jenny Livingston and starring Jason Gann, Adam Zwar and Cindy Waddingham. Created by Zwar, Gann and Rogers, it was based on their award-winning 2002 short film and later adapted to a series. The story follows the lives of the eponymous dog Wilfred, his owner Sarah, and her boyfriend Adam, who sees Wilfred as a man in a dog suit.

Two seasons were broadcast on SBS One â€“ the first in 2007 and the second in 2010. The series won three AFI Awards and was nominated for a Logie.

Independent Film Channel acquired the international broadcast rights to the original two seasons of Wilfred in 2010. A U.S. version premiered on the cable channel FX on 23 June 2011.

Wilfred received generally positive reviews, and surprised critics by winning the 2007 AFI Award for Best Comedy over The Chaser\'s War on Everything, despite achieving only a tenth of The Chaser\'s audience. Adam Zwar also won the award for Best Performance in a TV Comedy for his portrayal of Adam.

The series was widely praised for its original premise. Melinda Houston, writing in The Age, called Wilfred \"a magnificent creation, magnificently realised\", and that \"operating from a deeply non-PC premise, Wilfred manages to be both broad and subtle, hilarious and creepy, utterly obvious and way-way-way left-field\". Phillipa Hawker, also in The Age, called Wilfred \"An entertaining mixture of character-based comedy and quiet absurdity\". Natalie Craig from the Sydney Morning Herald compared the show favourably with another successful suburban comedy, saying \"while Kath and Kim was straightforward suburban satire, Wilfred is a more complex beast that deserves a tasty snack for effort and originality\".

Conversely, Jim Schembri of the Sydney Morning Herald called the concept \"muddled\", criticising the show for everything from its character development and humour to its 16:9 aspect ratio, and wondering \"how a show as lame as this ever got on the air\". Paul Kalina, writing in The Age, dismissed Wilfred as a \"bogan show\", saying of the decision to discontinue it after the second season \"There\'s only so far the conceit can stretch and one senses that Gann and Zwar know this\".

The show was criticised in March 2010 when the Herald Sun reported that up to A$1.5M of government money had been allocated to the production of a series \"peppered with profanity, full-frontal nudity and jokes about rape\". Family First Party Senator Steve Fielding accused the show of displaying \"acts of bestiality\". SBS responded to the criticism by stating that \"The money that has been invested(...) is in no way outlandish. Wilfred would cost far less to make than your average drama.\"
