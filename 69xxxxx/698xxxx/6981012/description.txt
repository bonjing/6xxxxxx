SOME TRIVIA FROM IMDB

Received 22 minutes of applause at the Cannes Film Festival.

Mexico's entry to the Academy Awards, in the category of Best Film in a Foreign Language (2006). 

After the first week, because so many parents brought small children to the film, movie theaters in Mexico placed signs on the posters warning about graphic violence. 

The English subtitles were translated and written by Guillermo del Toro himself. He no longer trusts translators after having encountered problems with his previous subtitled movies. 

Guillermo del Toro repeatedly said "no" to Hollywood producers, in spite of being offered double the budget provided the film was made in English. He didn't want any compromise in the storyline to suit the "market needs". 

Stephen King attended a screening of the film and sat next to Guillermo del Toro. According to Del Toro, King squirmed when the Pale Man chased Ofelia. Del Toro compared the experience of seeing King's reaction to winning an Oscar.
