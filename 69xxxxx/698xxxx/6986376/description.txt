 In 1962, a trash fire ignited a seam of anthracite coal 
 beneath Centralia, Pennsylvania, a once thriving mining 
 town of over 1600 people. By the mid 1980's, giant      
 plumes of smoke and deadly carbon monoxide gases        
 billowed from fissures in the ground, the local highway 
 cracked and collapsed, trees were bleached white and    
 petrified, as the fire continued to rage unchecked. It  
 wasn't until a young boy nearly died after falling into 
 a smoldering mine subsidence that the government was    
 pressed into action. After estimating the cost of       
 extinguishing the fire at over a half a billion         
 dollars, the government opted to raze the town and      
 relocate its residents. Today, 11 die-hards remain.     
 Filmed over a period of five years with interviews      
 ranging from former residents to Congressmen, The Town  
 That Was is an intimate portrait of John Lokitis, the   
 youngest remaining Centralian, and his quixotic fight   
 to keep alive a hometown that has literally             
 disintegrated under his feet. His unbowed determination 
 and steadfast refusal to acknowledge defeat reveal a    
 man, a town, a region, and a way of life abandoned and  
 forgotten.
