on 10.7.2 64 bits. Though a free app., I don't feel useless to publicize the existence of such applications which, otherwise, might well stay ignored from many of us.

Little hint. If one wants the general interface of the app. to be in their own native language, and not in American English by default, one could as myself follow this link : http://www.libreoffice.org/download/ 
and download in parallel of olofolleola4's file the 'LibO_3.4.5_MacOS_x86_langpack---.dmg' file with the language of their own chosen. 

Once the two .dmg files on the desktop, install first the olofolleola4's file in the Applications folder, without opening the app. Then launch the app. contained in the 'LibO_3.4.5_MacOS_x86_langpack---.dmg' file, and when launching the LibreOffice 3.4.5 app. after that, the general interface will be in the language you chose as personal preference."
