In Manhood, experienced urologist and sexologist Mels van Driel offers an unprecedented history of the penisâ€”with answers to everything you wanted to know, and even some questions youâ€™d never thought to ask. Investigating the penis and its functions, van Drielâ€™s work ranges from impotence to the speed of ejaculation, and from inguinal hernia to infertility. Psychological factors that have an impact on sexual experience, as well as contemporary phenomena, such as cyber sex, are examined along the way with good humor and much insight.
