[b]Thx Hive

CM8 Doing it right the first time :D


Sources:
Video: Russian DVD-R
Jelvin.i.burunduki.3.2011.DVD-5
Audio: Bida Release/unknown
thx

Encode:
Yes its still cam audio but cleaned and tweaked now.
Waited for a line, didnt show up so we have to live with the mic.
The Mic itself was very good to work with, loud and no laughing.
Played a lot with it, i am happy with the result, its still not
a line but very audible now. check sample

The Russian DVD was very nice, did the usual cleanup,
added sharpness, brightness, rgb and denoise

Took the Audio from Bida, they already did use the voice songs from
the russian audiotrack to get you more music experience. 
that saved me a lot of time, would have done the same thing.
Still Audio needed cleaning and tweaking to get real nice. 
Fixed some minor sync issues around the cutpoints to get it better lipsync.
Cleaned the russian audiotrack from russian voices and entered the
cleaned audiotrack into the russian track.

All in all very watchable now.
got very nice

PS: the mic didnt contain audio for the bonus scene inside the end credits rolltime
so they are russian now. no biggy. the movie itself is all english

Video: 720x304 @bitrate 1700 2pass
Audio: English AC3 5.1 @384
