Sometime ago, I installed a program with a 30-day trial period - at least the manufacturer said it's for 30 days trial. I discovered that whenever I start the program, the number of trial days will reduce (that is, instead of counting the trial per day, it is per usage.

After 30 usages, I was told my trial period was over. I uninstalled it with Revo Uninstaller and used CCleaner and TuneUp Utilities to clean the registry. I then restarted my system and installed the program again but still got the trial expired error.

My question is: is there a way to completely remove traces of any installed program and stop it from giving the issues highlighted above? That is, to keep reinstalling and using it as trial indefinitely? Please any useful info will be appreciate greatly."
