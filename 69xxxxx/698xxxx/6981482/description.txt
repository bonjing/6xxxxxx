DESCRIPTION:


If your business hires independent contractors, freelancers or consultants, this book is for you -- and essential.
Working with independent contractors can save you a bundle -- but the rules regarding who qualifies are complicated, and misclassifying a worker can result in serious financial penalties from your state or IRS.

If you hire programmers, writers, designers, marketing consultants, nurses, janitors, telemarketers, drivers -- in a word, anyone -- on a contractual basis, you need Working With Independent Contractors. This book shows you how to:

create a valid contract
assess who qualifies as an independent contractor
hire ICs without risking an audit
retain ownership of intellectual property when using ICs
handle an IRS audit
take advantage of the IRS's "Safe Harbor" law

The 7th edition -- completely revised to reflect the latest laws and court rulings -- includes detailed examples of how a business should hire freelancers. Plus, this book comes with all the contracts you'll need.
