Marius, 12, has not seen his father for years and he misses him badly. Marie, his mother, a workaholic firm manager, knows that she will never reconcile with her ex-husband. She must do something to address her son's frustration but what to do? She finally has the preposterous idea to hire Robert Pique, an unemployed man, to play the role of Marius's father. His job will consist in putting the boy off his alleged dad. Of course, the scheme sucks and nothing will go according to plan...
