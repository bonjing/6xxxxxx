 ya.

I ran into the same issue Johnnyfreeze had, it was not showing up in AFX. BUT I noticed in my root folder C: the installer had created three folders. They should be labeled as such in all CAPS:
AECS5COMMONPATH
AECS5PLUGINPATH
AECS5PRESETPATH

Essentially, the installer didnt know where to put the files, so it just created these directories. So you just have to cut and paste these folder's CONTENTS into their corresponding folders.

Soooo

AECS5COMMONPATH contents goes in Programfiles/adobe/common/

AECS5PLUGINPATH contents goes in Programfiles/adobe/afterffectscs5.5/supportfiles/plug-ins/

AECS5PRESETPATH contents goes in Programfiles/adobe/afterffectscs5.5/supportfiles/presets/


Hope this helps!
Don't know why this was happening."
