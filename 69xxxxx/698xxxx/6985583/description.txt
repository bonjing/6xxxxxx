Joseph MacKenzie wrote the haunting lament after the death of his wife, Christine, and in memory of his great-grandfather, Charles Stuart MacKenzie, a sergeant in the Seaforth Highlanders, who along with hundreds of his brothers-in-arms from the Elgin-Rothes area in Moray, Scotland went to fight in the Great War.

The track was then included in his band Clann An Drumma\\\'s album Tried and True. 

The lament was introduced into the film during We Were Soldiers key scenes with MacKenzie singing on his own and on the last track of the film with the orchestra and choir.
