Years ago, the CBC put together a brilliant series of documentaries as part of a six-week, Greatest Canadian contest in which advocates represented candidates, and the public voted by phone and Internet.  The series was hugely successful, and went to DVD only a few months later, but you can't buy it anymore.  You can't even download it legally from their website, and I've not been able to find a copy online anywhere...

So I've dug up my old copy of the discs, ripped them into .mkv files and now share them with you.  Please, if you enjoy this series, let the CBC know and ask them to setup some kind of tip jar so we can support work like this.

This torrent consists of ten candidacy shows for the ten candidates (in alphabetical order):

  The Greatest Canadian - Alexander Graham Bell.mkv
  The Greatest Canadian - David Suzuki.mkv
  The Greatest Canadian - Don Cherry.mkv
  The Greatest Canadian - Frederick Banting.mkv
  The Greatest Canadian - Lester B. Pearson.mkv
  The Greatest Canadian - Pierre Elliot Trudeau.mkv
  The Greatest Canadian - Sir John A. MacDonald.mkv
  The Greatest Canadian - Terry Fox.mkv
  The Greatest Canadian - Tommy Douglas.mkv
  The Greatest Canadian - Wayne Gretzky.mkv

And three additional shows:

  The Greatest Canadian - The Top(A round-up show that ran *before* the others)
  The Greatest Canadian - The Final Showdown.mkv (A last-ditch efforts by advocates)
  The Greatest Canadian - The Final Countdown.mkv (The winners announced)

Please enjoy, and share-alike.  Thanks :-)
