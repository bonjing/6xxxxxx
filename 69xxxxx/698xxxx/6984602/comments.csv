Thanks a lot for providing this valuble service for us. Unfortunately, here in Australia none of the TV networks airs Y&R except for an expensive pay television service. And I understand that they are about a year behind.

We get our downloads from either you or Claudia Z, whoever posts their torrents first. And for this, we're eternally grateful.

Unfortunately CZ has has to stop due to personal reasons. And that's a shame (about her personal issues). So, we're doubly enternally grateful that you continue to serve up our daily dose of Victor.

Regards

Martin
