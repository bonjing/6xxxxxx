"An Embarassment of Bitches"

When a famous dog trainer is killed, the 
investigation keeps coming back to 
charismatic reality TV star Kay Cappuccio 
(guest star Hilarie Burton). Kay, a 
favorite of tabloids and gossip websites 
the world over, has achieved stardom 
without possessing any discernible skill 
or talent. But there seems to be more to 
her story than she is letting on -- does 
that include murder?

18/Slower
Evolve...or die.

Still waiting on a dirfix, group request,
or some form of proof. I guess though it
is hard to prove a supposed 200ms loss
[which would be 2-4 syllables mouthed 
sans dialogue heard] when there are no
misplaced syllables or synch loss to 
begin with.

Enjoy :)
