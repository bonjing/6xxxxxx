Project Heavy Death is a heavy metal act from Kentucky, USA. We strive to change the way people view heavy metal, to make them think.
We also wish to outperform our local and global counterparts, and to share the inspiration this world gives us, for better or worse.

The \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Somewhere Between\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" EP was recorded at expense to the band and released, free of charge, in the summer of 2011. The idea behind it was to select 3 tracks to make you think. This EP offers a glimpse into the mind of someone who can never be quite sure if they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve gone insane, leaving them somewhere between a mental breakdown and masturbation. A peek, if you will, into the minds of the band themselves.
