Arctic.Air.S01E03.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 202MB]

[/b][/color] ARCTIC AIR is a one-hour adventure series set in the booming Arctic, about a maverick airline and the unconventional family who runs it.

On the ground, Bobby, the headstrong business partner, struggles to save the airline from crashing financially while Mel, the cantankerous co-owner, keeps his crew of pilots in the air.
Caught in the crossfire is Mel's hotshot pilot daughter Krista.

Over the season this character-based drama will deliver hard-hitting emotional stories - from the romantic entanglement of Bobby and Krista, to the conflicts that spark between Bobby and his competitors, his business partners and even his extended family.
There's a new gold rush heating up under the permafrost, and there are new fortunes of diamonds and oil to claim.
