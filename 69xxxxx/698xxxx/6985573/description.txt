Plants vs. Zombies v1.2.0
Requirements: Android 1.6+
Overview: Get ready to soil your plants in the hit PopCapÂ® game! A mob of fun-loving zombies is about to invade your home, and your only defense is an arsenal of 49 zombie-zapping plants. Use peashooters, wall-nuts, cherry bombs and more to slow down, confuse, weaken and mulchify 26 types of zombies before they can reach your front door.

Each zombie has its own special skills, so youâ€™ll need to think fast and plant faster to combat them all. But be careful how you use your limited supply of greens and seedsâ€¦ as you battle the fun-dead, obstacles like a setting sun, creeping fog and a swimming pool add to the challenge. The fun never dies!
