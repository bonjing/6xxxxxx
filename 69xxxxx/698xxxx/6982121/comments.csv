Who wants to grab a file 18 Gb in size without knowing anything about it, like framerate (our blu ray players will not play anything at 25 fps in North America), file container (.mkv,.m2ts,.ts,.avi, divx, xvid, mp4, etc), the audio and video bitrates,etc.
What is it about this site and why is it that nobody EVER describes their file ?
It boggles my mind.
Please, someone let me know what the heck is on this file so I can decide whether to grab it or not.
Thanks.
