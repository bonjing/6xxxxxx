MailHub for Lion is a unique smart assistant for Apple Mail in Mac OS X 10.7 Lion. What makes MailHub so effective as a time-saving email management tool is that mail can be filed, deleted or have actions set against it without leaving your in-box. No more manually â€˜drag- filingâ€™ mail into mailboxes or setting up complicated email rules to keep on top of ever expanding in- boxes. Email from a contact or thread can be batch-filed to a mail-box (or deleted) with a series of simple mouse clicks or key strokes, radically reducing time spent on mail administration. 

To keep you highly organized MailHub even allows you to specify filing destinations for an outgoing message during composition. MailHub also allows the creation of mail-boxes â€˜on the goâ€™ allowing you to organize your in-box naturally as new email arrives - no more breaking your work flow to file. Finally, MailHub allows you to set reminders and actions against emails directly from your inbox with a fully mail-integrated remind function so once an email is filed it is â€˜out of sight but not out of mindâ€™ and you wonâ€™t forget a vital task at a later date.
