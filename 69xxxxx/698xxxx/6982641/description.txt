The McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) F-15E Strike Eagle is an all-weather multi-role fighter, derived from the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle. The F-15E was designed in the 1980s for long-range, high speed interdiction without relying on escort or electronic warfare aircraft. United States Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles can be distinguished from other U.S. Eagle variants by darker camouflage and conformal fuel tanksmounted along the engine intakes.

The Strike Eagle has been deployed in Operation Desert Storm, Operation Allied Force and Operation Odyssey Dawn carrying out deep strikes against high-value targets, combat patrols and providing close air support for coalition troops. It has also seen action in later conflicts and has been exported to several countries.

High Performance and Packed with Features!

The F-15E Strike Eagle model depicted in this package is a highly detailed replica of its real-life counterpart. The model was created by using high quality digital photos and many, many countless hours of testing, revising and testing again! This is, bar none, as close as most of us will ever get to the real thing!
