Version 4.7.5
=============
- Added the ability to export & import custom labels (ie: app lists) directly to/from the clipboard.
- Added an option to "follow all symbolic links" during app data backups. This allows TB to work on ROMs that use a tweaked data layout (eg: recent ROMs for the original Samsung Galaxy S).
- Fixed a bug where the ChangeLog could reappear (even if settings are being synced) after wiping data.
- Big translation updates.
