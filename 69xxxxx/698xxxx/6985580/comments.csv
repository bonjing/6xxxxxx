.7 I find the patcher doesn't work beyond a reboot/24 hour period. The next time titanium pro does a license check it seems to pass ok, but then any 'batch' operations are screwed, with some error message about 'guru caught fire'.

Have had to revert to version 4.6.7 until a fully functioning crack patch is developed."
