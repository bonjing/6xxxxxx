        Harley, a thoroughbred with royal bloodlines, is being groomed
        to replace his father's success at Willowbrook Farms. Harley's
        rapid  success  leads  him  to  new  physical  challenges.  An
        accident at a competition spooks  him and fearing a fate  like
        his father,  he runs  away. Days  later, Harley  is found by a
        rancher  and  his daughter.  Unable  to find  the  owner, they
        nurture  him  back  to  health.  Discovering  Harley's amazing
        ability for jumping, the  girl includes Harley as  her partner
        in her  horse club  competitions. Harley's  talent is  noticed
        immediately and is claimed by his true owner. Reluctantly  the
        girl gives him up and he returns to Willowbrook Farms.  Harley
        just wants to return to the ranch in the green hills but  will
        he ever get back there?
