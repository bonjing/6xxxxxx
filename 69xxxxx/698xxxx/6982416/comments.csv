,Fanchig,2012-05-07T13:44Z,"Thank you uploader ; just one question:

Playing the Vobs (or mounting it all and then playing it), I need to crop to 2:35:1 or such format to enjoy a full view. If I don't, I've got black borders all around.
Any idea where does that come from or how I could change that?
I thought of burning the .iso afterwards, but I'm afraid the black borders will remain anyway.
Thx for any tip given."
