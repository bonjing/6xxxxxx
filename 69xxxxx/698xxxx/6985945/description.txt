[/b][/color] Dog: The Bounty Hunter follows the exploits of real-life bounty hunter Duane "Dog" Chapman, who runs Da Kine Bail Bonds in beautiful Honolulu, on the Hawaiian island of Oahu.
Aided by his team of family coworkers - partner/wife, Beth Smith; son, Leland; "brother," Tim - Dog always gets his man.
They first appeared in an episode of A&E's "Take This Job," a 2003 series in which people with unusual occupations were profiled, and now Dog and his team are back in their very own series.
