This Torrent is for online RPG gamers who use tools such as maptool or Fantasy Ground II to play online Pen and Paper RPGs. This legal compilation contains thousands of tokens, stamps, maps and other images that can be used with Virtual TableTop apps to build maps. This file has been posted several times before, I am just seeding it again so that the RPG community can get it again. It's all sorted in categories and ready to use once unzipped.

Since it's a pretty large file and with a limited interest scope, please be nice and keep seeding when you're done downloading it so that other RPG gamers can benefit from it.

Game on...
