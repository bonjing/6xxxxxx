This is a look at the culture along the way in the United States
Navy and the insane blind obedience some think is due as soldiers 
- even when common sense dictates the reverse.

men must be made to see the difference clearly enough to deter incompetents
from making claims they're equal in both regards when they only have formal
rank instead.
