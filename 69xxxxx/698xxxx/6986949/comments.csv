Important: though the desc doesn't say so, this torrent includes not just the SACD ISO's but also PCM-converted [24-bit, 88.2kHz] FLAC versions of the whole thing.  It's not specified how they were converted [i.e. with or without 30kHz lowpass required for standards-compliant SACD playback] but they are playable."
