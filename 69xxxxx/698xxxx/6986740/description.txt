      PLOT SUMMARY     : It is the mid-nineteenth century. Ada is a 
                         mute who has a young daughter, Flora. In an 
                         arranged marriage she leaves her native 
                         Scotland accompanied by her daughter and her 
                         beloved piano. Life in the rugged forests of 
                         New Zealand's South Island is not all she may 
                         have imagined and nor is her relationship with 
                         her new husband Stewart. She suffers torment 
                         and loss when Stewart sells her piano to a 
                         neighbour, George. Ada learns from George that 
                         she may earn back her piano by giving him piano 
                         lessons, but only with certain other conditions 
                         attached. At first Ada despises George but 
                         slowly their relationship is transformed and 
                         this propels them into a dire situation.

                      Leading ladies Hunter and Paquin both earn an
                      Oscar for their performances as well as a

                      A "full" quality mp3 gave an average bitrate of
                      greater than 192kbit, so the ac3 track was used
                      instead.

         SChiZO is one of the longest living MPEG-4 release groups
         in the scene. Since our inception in March of 2001 we have
         been catering to the needs of DivX enthusiasts everywhere
         by releasing high-quality DVDRips of the finest films from
         around the world. Our dedication to quality is shown by the
         lack of any technical nukes in our 200+ release history.
         In recent months we have continued to grow as we established
         our TV division, PHRENiC, dedicated to bringing the SChiZO
         philosophy to the TVRips scene.

         SChiZO does not have any public means of contact, nor do we
         plan to add any. Remember, we do this for fun and don't
         respond to unsolicited offers from unknown people.
