In this show we discussed popular pharmaceuticals that are contaminated with pesticides and flame retardents, the poisons that were in drugs in the 1980s, and the irony of chelation therapy being under attack by the F.D.A.. We explained what chelation therapy is, and why alternative medicine companies are being silenced about its effects. We talked about how pharmaceutical outsourcing destroys the possibility of accountability, and the organic label has become almost meaningless due to lack of enforcement.

We covered how the government (and your tax dollars) fund pharmaceutical companies, and mention the drug that is responsible for thousands of accidental college student deaths. We expose the unethical practices of the Susan G. Komen organization, their partners and their pink ribbon campaigns, and explain why some people only get headaches on the weekends, and how they can be eliminated. We finish up the show by talking about the rapid bee extinction, and how Monsanto will be responsible for the next famine.
