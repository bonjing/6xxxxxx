One of the ultimate masterpieces in Oriental Animation.

The Chinese Boy battles the evil Dragons in order to save his people. He is helped with immortal techniques from the Heavenly God's.

This is dubbed both voice and music is changed so it differs from original version.

Thanks and you guys can comment on quality since I can't describe it!
