[T],dadrkhomr,2012-02-05T06:32Z,I'd like to apologize for starting this.  Upping torrents is personal for me and I over reacted to this situation.  My apoligize to Ichiroyoung.  He does good work.  And he sees fit to use some of my work I should see it as a compliment.  I hope this ends this particular situation.  Thanks for listening/reading.
, regardless of who scanned the shit... Ichiro, if you ARE downloading this guy's stuff to use in your torrents, continue to do so, but give credit where it's due... OR DICKWING WILL RULE YOU!!!"
