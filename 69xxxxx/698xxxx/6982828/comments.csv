,ringdots,2012-05-26T03:51Z,Cool! I am watching season 2 and this is probally my forth favorite series of all time. It is great to see this torrent!
and running setup guide again I am able to upload at about 350kB/s, triple my earlier speeds.

Too bad TPB doesn't have it set up to notify when new comments are made and I don't regularly stop back to see if any new ones.

Anyway, thanks for the comment and the appreciation. Sometimes it is a little frustrating to see the first downloaders gobble up all my bandwidth and quickly drop off. Thanks to those of you who did stick around and help seed. The torrent will have a chance to sustain itself and be available when someone else is looking for it again."
