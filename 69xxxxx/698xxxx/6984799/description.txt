NOTES:

Took the russian cam which was nice,but had issues.....some scenes had bright spots due to the brigthness and contrast levels
also the cam was/is missing around 6-7 secs here and there....like most cams.
Audio was nice,just had some noise too it....but some TLC could clean that.
Work done ....used lum1x's release tweaked the video to my liking,yes a tad darker....but no more bright spots.Also the video 
was a pita to get the colour levels right as it seems to change,unless it was meant too be that way ....anyway when for one i thought
suited best.
Audio we had to sync,clean and remaster then remux to our encode.

Oh also the AR goes in and out due to camera movement ...so never really messed with that...
