Includes some models already available through Thingiverse:
Dremelfuge: A printable centrifuge rotor for #diybio-style micro/molecular biology
Pipette Hanger: A hanger for micropipettes
Kite Parts: A one-print plate of parts needed to make a nice kite
DNA Model: A pretty accurate model of DNA. Probably not printable at home, though.

You can get the DNA model and Bacteriophage on my shapeways shop, if you don't happen to own an SLS 3D printer:
