It's not that I'm bagging Xvid encodes as such, I've downloaded a few good quality HD Xvid encodes when there's been no x264 alternative, but I'd like to understand the reasons for Xvid still being used so often when in terms of quality/file size x264 seems a better alternative.

Well it is for SD encoding anyway as I've compared the two myself, although I've never encoded HD video using anything other than x264.

Is Xvid still used due to encoding speed or hardware compatibility etc?"
