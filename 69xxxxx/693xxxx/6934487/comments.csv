 apostrophe, but I wasn't the one that -1ed your torrent. I never +1 or -1 any torrents actually, except one, which was clearly mislabeled. It said it was dvd-r of the hangover (4+ gigs of my efin' bandwidth) but it was just a cam of the movie in the theaters. Anyway, I +1ed this torrent to counter the -1, if that makes you happy."
