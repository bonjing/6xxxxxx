     Unable to convince the ruling council of Krypton that their world   
     will destroy itself soon, scientist Jor-El takes drastic measures   
      to preserve the Kryptonian race: He sends his infant son Kal-El    
      to Earth. There, gaining great powers under Earth's yellow sun,    
       he will become a champion of truth and justice. Raised by the     
         Kents, an elderly farm couple, Clark Kent learns that his       
        abilities must be used for good. The adult Clark travels to      
       Metropolis, where he becomes a mild-mannered reporter for the     
       Daily Planet...and a caped wonder whose amazing feats stun the    
        city: Superman! Meanwhile, Lex Luthor, the world's greatest      
       criminal mind, is plotting the greatest real estate swindle of    
     all time. Can't even the Man of Steel stop this nefarious scheme?

     After two years of limited distribution, we found it time for our   
     work to be available on a larger scale. Therefore we decided to     
     enable more sites to host our releases by including the             
     'INTERNAL'tag in our directory naming. Our releases aren't          
     internal though; we release them. The good news is we stay who we   
     are and keepbeing non-competitive.
