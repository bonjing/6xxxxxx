The NIN Definitive Collection

this torrent includes the Nine Inch Nails "seeds" 02, 03 & 04.

-The Definitive NIN - The Singles

-The Definitive NIN - Deep Cuts

-The Definitive NIN - Quiet Tracks

All of them include their respective artwork and an html file with some info about the band and the releases.

I decided to put them together and upload them because some of the original torrents from the user seed0 are no longer available, also i've updated the tracklist to include songs from Year Zero, Ghosts & The Slip, just like the "Listen" section of nin.com

All songs @192kbps
