s very fast but once installed, there is no listing for this software in the Programs list.  I tried Revo Uninstaller but nothing there either.  Finally had to track it down at ""C:\Program Files\DesktopAnimated\Fantastic Space Star Animated Wallpaper"" and open the Uninstall.exe file.  I hope this is just an innocent mistake.  :-(

On a slow computer animated wallpaper takes up 30% of the GPU and 15-30% of the CPU at all times (in low priority.)  Not wise to run them unless you have a high-end gaming system.  It also did not stop when I maximized another window the way  Windows Dreamscene does.  However it uses the hardware acceleration of my graphics card well.  Cool idea though."
