     Picking up where "Superman: The Movie" left off, three criminals    
      from the planet Krypton are released from the Phantom Zone by a    
       nuclear explosion in space. They descend upon Earth where they    
       could finally rule. Superman, meanwhile, is in love with Lois     
       Lane, who finds out who he really is. Lex Luthor escapes from     
       prison and is determined to destroy Superman by joining forces    
                         with the three criminals.

     After two years of limited distribution, we found it time for our   
     work to be available on a larger scale. Therefore we decided to     
     enable more sites to host our releases by including the             
     'INTERNAL'tag in our directory naming. Our releases aren't          
     internal though; we release them. The good news is we stay who we   
     are and keepbeing non-competitive.
