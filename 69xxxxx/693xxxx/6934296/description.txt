Fat isnâ€™t the problem. Dieting is the problem. A society that rejects anyone whose body shape or size doesnâ€™t match an impossible ideal is the problem. A medical establishment that equates â€œthinâ€ with â€œhealthyâ€ is the problem.
The solution?
Health at Every Size.
Tune in to your bodyâ€™s expert guidance. Find the joy in movement. Eat what you want, when you want, choosing pleasurable foods that help you to feel good. You too can feel great in your body right nowâ€”and Health at Every Size will show you how.
Health at Every Size has been scientifically proven to boost health and self-esteem. The program was evaluated in a government-funded academic study, its data published in well-respected scientific journals.
Updated with the latest scientific research and even more powerful messages, Health at Every Size is not a diet book, and after reading it, you will be convinced the best way to win the war against fat is to give up the fight.
