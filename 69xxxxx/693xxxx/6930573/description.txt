 Album Info.....: 
 
 Dope is a New York-based quintet led by brothers Edsel Dope (lead vocals, rhythm 
 guitar) and Simon Dope (keyboards). Children of divorced parents, the two grew up 
 separately in Florida. Simon studied chemistry at the University of Florida, then 
 received a scholarship to Polytechnic in Brooklyn. There, he was joined by his 
 brother; the two claim to have financed their demos by selling drugs. This is their 3rd album and it rocks just as much as the others!
