I had some issues with this torrent that I'm not really happy about but figured I would put it up anyway. A couple of the rips (Wintersleep & Untitled) I had to use burst mode due to scuffed discs. Track 12 of Wintersleep 2003 has some issues but none that I could audibly hear. Track 10 of Untitled has some audible skips. These aren't as perfect as I would like them but then again I don't think a FLAC Wintersleep discography will ever be upped so I'll make it available regardless. If anybody has these 2 albums that can be upped error free please do so. Thanks!

From Wiki:


Wintersleep is a Canadian indie rock band from Halifax, Nova Scotia.

Wintersleep formed in 2001[1] and released two albums with Dependent Music, a music label and artists' collective that began in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia in 1994.

In 2006, Wintersleep signed with Labwork Music, a partnership label of Sonic Unyon and EMI Music Canada, and re-released their first two studio albums to the U.S. and Canadian markets. The re-releases include bonus tracks and videos not featured in the originals. Their debut album was remixed and re-mastered by Laurence Currie for the re-release.

On October 2, 2007, Wintersleep released their third full-length album, Welcome to the Night Sky. They won the 2008 Juno Award for New Group of the Year.

A limited edition of Welcome to the Night Sky on vinyl with alternative artwork was released by Hand Drawn Dracula.

The band's members frequently collaborate outside of Wintersleep. Murphy and D'eon played together in the band Kary, now on indefinite hiatus. Drummer Campbell has also performed with Kary, and is a member of a number of other projects, including Contrived, Holy Fuck, Hayden, Chikita Violenta, Land of Talk, The Holy Shroud, and The Remains of Brian Borcherdt. Murphy collaborated with his brother in the project Postdata. Bigelow plays bass in Contrived with Campbell, and also plays in Holy Fuck and The Holy Shroud. D'eon played guitar for Contrived before Samuel joined the group, appearing on Contrived's first record, Pursuit of Plots, and the second album, Dead Air Verbatim. Samuel was a member of Halifax band Slight Return.

Wintersleep was selected as one of the opening acts by Paul McCartney for his concert at Halifax Common on July 11, 2009.[2]

Wintersleep began working on their fourth studio album, New Inheritors, in September 2009.[3] The album was released on May 17 in Europe and May 18 in North America.[4] The bulk of the album was written while touring Welcome to the Night Sky due to the very busy tour schedule the band follows.[5]

Wintersleep performed "Weighty Ghost" on the Late Show with David Letterman on January 14, 2011. The song also appeared on the TV series Being Human on January 17, 2011. In 2010, "Weighty Ghost" was included as one of The Top 100 Canadian Singles by Bob Mersereau.
