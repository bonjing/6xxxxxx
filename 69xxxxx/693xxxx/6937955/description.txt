Lulu is a collaborative album between rock singer-songwriter Lou Reed, and heavy metal band Metallica. The album was recorded in San Rafael, California during April through June 2011, after Reed had played with Metallica at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 25th Anniversary Concert which led to them wanting to collaborate. The lead single from the album, titled "The View", was released on September 27, 2011 to a widely negative reception on the Internet and failed to chart anywhere. The second single was announced to be "Iced Honey" and will receive a music video directed by film maker Darren Aronofsky.

Conceptually, the album is based on Lulu - two plays originally written by the German playwright Frank Wedekind. A majority of the album's composition is centred around spoken word delivered by Reed over instrumentals composed by Metallica, with occasional backing vocals provided by Metallica lead vocalist James Hetfield. Reed wrote a majority of the lyrics. The album was released worldwide on October 31, 2011, and on November 1 in North America.[3] Upon its release, Lulu received generally negative reviews from most music critics and was widely panned. Review website Metacritic lists the album among the worst of 2011 and the 32nd worst album of all time.[4]
