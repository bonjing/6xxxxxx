kruhft -- Nine Inch Nails Remixes - "Me I'm Not"
------------------------------------------------

When NIN released Survivalism, Trent provided the source files for
some of the tracks on the album.  These tracks are the resulting
evolution of the final remix, 3.0.

I am most happy with 3.0, but I thought I would include the versions
for comparison.

Encoded with lame -b 196. Wavs and Flacs available by request.

Enjoy.
