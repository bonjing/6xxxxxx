Switched.at.Birth.S01E11.480p.WEB-DL.x264-mSD [MKV 271MB]

[/b][/color] Switched at Birth, a one-hour scripted drama, tells the story of two teenage girls who discover they were accidentally switched as newborns in the hospital.
Bay Kennish grew up in a wealthy family with two parents and a brother, while Daphne Vasquez, who lost her hearing at an early age due to a case of meningitis, grew up with a single mother in a working-class neighborhood.
Things come to a dramatic head when both families meet and struggle to learn how to live together for the sake of the girls.
