This refreshing book by an international grandmaster is a delightful exercise in critical thinking. Very few chess books are able to make an original contribution about the strategic side of chess, but that is the aim of this remarkable book.Comas revisits a large number of games and their interpretations by top chess authors, uncovering serious flaws and misleading lessons. The dogmas of chess, which have been established for over a century, are rarely questioned despite the clear evolution in the style of top-class chess. Chess grandmaster Lluis Comas Fabrego takes on the challenging task of separating the truth from the lies in traditional advice on how to play better chess. By taking an irreverent look at the supposed absolute truths of chess, Comas Fabrego judges the validity of established rules and strategic concepts. Accompanied by many practical examples and good advice, readers learn how to reduce the complexity of chess towards the essential features of each position, and so improve their play.
