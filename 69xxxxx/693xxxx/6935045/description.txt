Warrior Graveyard: Samurai Massacre
The unearthing of a gruesome grave filled with thousands of skeletons at Kamakura in Japan could hold the answers to the mystery surrounding the true origins of one of the most feared and revered warriors of all time: the Samurai. The chilling burial ground dates back to 1333. Kamakura was a one of the most heavily fortified regions of Japan. When the Emperor became angered by the growing powers of the ruling Hojo family, he sought to retake control of the region, setting the stage for a war that would change the shape of the nation. Among over 4000 sets of remains, six have a unique story to tell: the husband and wife involved in a sword fight to the death; the warrior monk; a peasant boy soldier; and members of the ruling Hojo family, captured and decapitated, with their heads displayed as trophies of victory. These remains reveal the secrets of the Samurai, their ferocious fighting skills and their merciless killing techniques.
