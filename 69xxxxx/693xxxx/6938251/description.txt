Mumbai-based Rahul accompanies his friend, Amar
Singh, to a village called Bhedia in order to  
attend the marriage of Supriya, the latter's   
sister. While on the way there, he sees a young
woman and instantly falls in love with her     
despite of being told that she is destined to  
be a prostitute according to the tradition     
prevailing in this community where local police
actually procure young women for wealthy       
Zamindars/landlords. Unable to get her out of  
his mind, he approaches a pimp, Manghi, and    
through him finds out her name is Bela, who    
lives with her mother, Paro, and father,       
Mangatram. His overtures to get married to her 
will be met with strong opposition from her    
parents who are all set to sell her to the     
highest bidder. Rahul, however, meets Bela on  
the sly and both fall in love. The community   
finds out, they feel threatened as all males
