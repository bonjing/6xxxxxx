

This is from the last disk of the 13 disk Dr. Katz box set.
They did one episode live featuring Kathy Griffin, Maria
Bamford, Andy Kindler and Paul F. Tompkins, in addition to the
three regular cast members voiced by Jonathan Katz, Jon Benjamin
and Laura Silverman.  If I had been in charge, I'd have added a
scene at the bar with Julianne Shapiro and Will Le Bow...

At any rate, this episode is big fun.  I've been a Kathy Griffin
fan for years and everybody did a great job, but Maria Bamford
stole the show.  I had never heard of her before I saw this
episode and now I'm hunting down everything I can find.  She is
an absolute and complete delight.  I think I'm in love.  If you
feel the same way be sure to catch the 20 short episodes of The
Maria Bamford Show which, at this writing, are well seeded on DN
and TPB... huge thanks and high fives to katpurz and retawd and
all of the seeders!  If anyone has any obscure Maria Bamford or
Kathy Griffin material, please share!

IF YOU HAVE COMEDIANS OF COMEDY SEASON 1 PLEASE SEED IT FOR ME!

Thanks, and Cheers, and now let's all enjoy Maria Bamford!
