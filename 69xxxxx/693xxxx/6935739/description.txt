How to win Friends and Influential Persons[Team Nanban][TPB]


AUTHOR: Dale Carnegie

DESCRIPTION:

How to Win Friends and Influence People is one of the first bestselling self-help books ever published. Written by Dale Carnegie and first published in 1936, it has sold 15 million copies world-wide.

Leon Shimkin of the publishing firm Simon & Schuster took one of the 14-week courses given by Carnegie in 1934. 

Shimkin persuaded Carnegie to let a stenographer take notes from the course to be revised for publication. 

In 1981, a new revised edition with updated language and anecdotes was released.

The revised edition reduced the number of sections from 6 to 4, eliminating sections on effective business letters and improving marital satisfaction.
