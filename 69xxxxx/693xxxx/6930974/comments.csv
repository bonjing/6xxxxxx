 it doesn't give any install instructions, nor a program to run, or anything really.
I've so been looking forward to finally being able to play these games, and it took atleast 1 whole day to download this fucker, and now I can't do shit..
I'm not really all that familiar with game cracks, most ones I got working was with instructions and trial and error.. 
So can anyone please give me a tip?"
