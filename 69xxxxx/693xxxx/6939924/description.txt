Homosexuality in Islam: Islamic Reflection on Gay, Lesbian, and Transgender Muslims

The first book-length treatment to offer a detailed analysis of how Islamic scripture, jurisprudence, and Hadith can accommodate a sexually sensitive Islam. Numerous scholars and commentators maintain that the Qur'an and Hadith rule unambiguously against same-sex relations. This pioneering study argues that there is far more nuance to the matter than most believe.

Scott Kugle is the first Muslim to publish widely on the issue of homosexuality and Islam. An independent research scholar in Islamic studies, he has previously held positions at Duke University, the University of Cape Town, and Swarthmore College.
