before you watch this you should have good understanding of Classes and OOP in Obj-C and if you're a total noob I suggest you watch this first:

[TIP]
if you're a proud PC user like me you can actually install mac on it if you have a compatible PC, that's what I am doing, and it works perfectly!
Here's some resources for a start:
+http://www.tonymacx86.com/
+google "hackintosh"
+search for "mc pc" on PB to see some options
+the easiest method is the VMWare versions, I was able to use them, but its damn slow.

Enjoy!
