Notes:
ok, First let me say thanks for all you kind words. Mr Hive being back in full swing with his HQ
XViD Encodes, i been thinking about trying something different for CM8 with H264 in mind.
i really love mSD's 480P Quality/size uploads and Visions insane Quality 720p.
but think i can add a little more on the top end of the 480p in action and horror files.
So that said, this is my first upload in 480P h264 . encoding was  about 4hrs but am very happy 
with it .there'll all be about 1.4gb  If it does well, i'll do a  more.....  ;)
