he use of fibrous materials in civil engineering, both as structural reinforcement and in non-structural applications such as geotextiles, is an important and interesting development. Fibrous and composite materials for civil engineering applications analyzes the types and properties of fibrous textile and structures and their applications in reinforcement and civil engineering. 

Part 1 introduces different types of fibrous textiles and structures. Chapters cover the properties of natural and man-made fibers and of yarns, as well as an overview of textile structures. Part 2 focuses on fibrous material use in concrete reinforcement, with chapters on the properties and applications of steel fiber reinforced concrete, natural fiber reinforced concrete and the role of fiber reinforcement in mitigating shrinkage cracks. In part 3, the applications of fibrous material-based composites in civil engineering are covered. Chapters concentrate on production techniques and applications such as reinforcement of internal structures, structural health monitoring and textile materials in architectural membranes.
