This is an archive of raw, unparsed, illegally copied news webpages.
All pages are as they were when retrieved from their respective sites, named as the time of publication in UNIX time.
I added some more feeds after a while, and there is a several day period in August without any (sorry for that), but usually, if there is a day missing, the articles are in the next archive (you can tell by the size).
Packed as tar/gzip, after being put in a 'feeds' folder.
The categories are world, business/economy and a bit of technology/science news in English. Perfect for attempts to predict the FOREX market using natural language processing.
Have a go at it, and post messages here if you wish!
