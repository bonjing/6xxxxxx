 Album Info..: 
 
 Clutch: Neil Fallon (vocals, guitar, percussion); Tim Sult (guitar); Mick Schauer 
 (Wurlitzer piano, Clavinet, Hammond b-3 organ); Dan Maines (bass guitar); Jean Paul Gaster (drums, percussion). Recording information: Bearsville, Studios, Bearsville, NY; Uncle Punchy, Silverspring, MD. One of the most diverse and unpredictable heavy-rock acts of the 1990s and 2000s, Clutch quickly garnered a loyal following with a sound that flat-out rocked yet refused to be pigeonholed. ROBOT HIVE/EXODUS is no exception. "The Incomparable Mr. Flannery" kicks off the record with a swaggering Zeppelin-meets-Ted Nugent bit of unadulterated stud rock and never lets up. It would be tempting to call this stoner rock, except for the fact that it's so high-energy. In addition, Neil Fallon's macho vocals belie his insightful, often strikingly poetic lyrics. "Mice and Gods" name-checks both Lucifer and OMNI Magazine, while "Pulaski Skyway" paints a vivid portrait of industrial greed. A meaty-sounding dose of gritty guitar rock that wears its 1970s influences on its sleeve, ROBOT HIVE/EXODUS aims to hit the gut and enlighten the mind
