Pierre-Laurent Aimard honors Franz Liszt's 200th birthday (October 22, 1811) with his most ambitious recording for Deutsche Grammophon to date.

In this extensive 2-CD set, Aimard juxtaposes a selection of Liszt's works with compositions by Liszt's contemporaries and successors who were inspired by the Hungarian composer. Works by Olivier Messiaen and Marco Stroppa attest to the vitality of Liszt's imagination to the present day.

Liszt's seminal B minor Sonata is contrasted with other one-movement sonatas by Berg, Wagner and Scriabin (his startling Black Mass). Shorter pieces by Liszt point to their correspondence with works by BartÃ³k and Ravel.

Recorded live in Vienna's Konzerthaus over two evenings, Pierre-Laurent Aimard's Liszt project is a pinnacle of the Liszt Year commemorations.
