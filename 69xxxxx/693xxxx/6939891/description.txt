 Album Info..: 
 
 Flaw is one of the few groups to eschew post-grunge a la Creed and modern-day 
 rap-metal, preferring to instead play straightforward metallic rock that relies less upon gimmickry and more on musical prowess and aggression, making the group peers of latter-day Metallica and Staind.
