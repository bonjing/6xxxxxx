NOTE: This is a very rare TTCVideo that I personally converted. Unfortunatly it's a VHS-rip with a not so good audio quality. Besides, you will notice that almost every lecture is a little out-of-sync. Due to convertion issues, most lectures have also been splitted into two parts. I'm sorry if any of these causes you trouble, but I assure that during the two weeks I've been working on the files, I did my best. ........
