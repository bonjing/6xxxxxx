The publication \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Managing European Diversity in Lifelong Learning\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' is the result of the last European project of the European Centre for Valuation of Prior Learning. The underlying principle of lifelong learning is that initial education is no longer enough for a lifetime social-economic career. It is more important to develop your competencies (skills, knowledge, attitude & ambitions) throughout life by realizing that â€˜your glass is already half fullâ€™, and by understanding that everyone always learns in every possible learning environment: formal (school) and non-formal or informal environments (working place, at home).

More than 200 case studies were analysed in 11 European countries representing the main European learning cultures: Czech Republic, Cyprus, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, The Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
