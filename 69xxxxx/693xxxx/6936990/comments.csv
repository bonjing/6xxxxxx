e been using it for years. And @ rahuldsar; it's a LOT faster than using the built in download functions from within Chrome or Internet Exploder, and the ability to resume downloads is very handy too, especially if you're on the move or leeching WiFi from someone. Another handy feature is the ability to download videos from sites like youtube and redtube, hopefully in this version they've fixed my only complaint with the program.

Sometimes when I'm browsing with multiple tabs, I won't be able to download a video unless I refresh that tab and wait for it to play. So I can't open 4 or 5 tabs and then go to each of them and download the videos, I gotta do them one at a time."
