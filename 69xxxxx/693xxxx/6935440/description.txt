 Album Info..: 
 
 Moving the guitars forward in the mix paid off in spades for Clutch, who continued with their familiar formula of mixing Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath on their sophomore album. Without straying at all from their roots, the band adds a little more funk to their sound a la Primus, which makes for a more consistent set of songs than their debut. Not to mention that the stars shine brighter than they did last time around: "Spacegrass" alone should have become an instant classic, but following minor rotation on hard rock stations, the song -- and the band with it -- were  delegated a cult status, compared to the likes of contemporaries Coal Chamber and Korn.
