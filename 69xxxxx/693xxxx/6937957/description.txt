I randomly caught this obscure 80s gem on HBO India last year. Carrie Hamilton's a disillusioned back-up singer in a U.S. punk band; she moves to Tokyo and joins a Japanese rock group looking for a gaijin gimmick. Ace J-Rock sequences and cross-cultural gags ensue. Features the brilliant Papaya Paranoia and X Japan. Thoroughly recommended for fans of Japanese culture and music.
