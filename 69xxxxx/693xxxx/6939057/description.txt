The American Way is an eight-issue American comic book limited series produced under DC Comics Wildstorm Signature imprint. The series debuted in April 2006, and was created by John Ridley and Georges Jeanty.

The series represented a skewed parallel history of America, where the United States Government created its own super powered "heroes" and "villains". In the early 1940s, the United States government hatched a plan to create the Civil Defense Corps - a group of supposed super-heroes who could fight alien invasions, evil super-powered beings, and communism, all in front of an adoring public, courtesy of television. When an African-American hero named the New American is inserted into 1962s premier superteam, the turmoil begins.
