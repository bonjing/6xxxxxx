The Ascent of Man (BBC)

History Documentary hosted by Jacob Bronowski, published by BBC in 1973 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

This 13 volume series attempts a massive survey of science, from flint tools to the theory of relativity. The series, a co-production of the BBC and Time-Life Films was made as a science counterpart to Kenneth Clark's "Civilisation". It is given superb technical support, with two crews using innovative filming techniques, shooting in 27 countries. Dr. Jacob Bronowski makes for an unorthodox narrator, his non-scripted delivery ranging from hushed awe to trembling passion. He uses the crawling infant, the performing athlete, the development of the hunt and the discovery of fire to illustrate the most distinctive feature of man: imagination. His Scientific-Humanism is often spectacular, always provocative. The DVDs extra is a recent interview with Sir David Attenborough who recalls the making of "The Ascent of Man" series.
