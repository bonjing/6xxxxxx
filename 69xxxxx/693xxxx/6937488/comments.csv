It's become clear to me now that our corporate news media in America presents to us the most censored, biased, scrubbed down presentation of the world. If all a person were to watch is the corporate owned media, he would know absolutely nothing of the true nature of the world he inhabits his entire life.

Thank god for documentaries, alternative news media, and conspiracies. I might not have questioned the true nature of reality otherwise, but I know, we know, there's much more going on in the world than meets the eye.

My thanks to the author of this torrent for making so many of these films available in mass, I probably wouldn't have discovered them any other way.

Good day.
