UP 2009 (GREEK AUDIO)
Metaglotismeno sta Ellinika

By tying thousands of balloon to his home, 78-year-old Carl Fredricksen sets out to fulfill his lifelong dream to see the wilds of South America. Right after lifting off, however, he learns he isn't alone on his journey, since Russell, a wilderness explorer 70 years his junior, has inadvertently become a stowaway on the trip.
Perhaps the best animation to date! It's a regular movie and as such was treated in Cannes, after becoming the first animation in history, officially opened the festival.
Who would have thought starring a virtually cripple aged? The envisioned by Pete Docter, director of "Up", and together with Thomas McCarthy (director of "The Visitor") and Bob Peterson (one of the screenwriters of "Finding Nemo "), wrote this awesome instructive tale to fly to another world, allegories, everlasting relationships, emotion, adventure, beauty humor.
Pixar once again proves that knows and dares to show new things in the field of animation, and not just cute little animals, ready to fly rain comedy cues. 
First in receipts from all 3D animations, but also the second biggest box office success of Pixar since "Finding Nemo". Fifth among all animations ever.
