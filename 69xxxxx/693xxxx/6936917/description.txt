I purchased this CD while on vacation in Europe and was blown away. It made every hotel my wife and I stayed in very enjoyable. It is a great CD to listen to from foreplay to finish. It is also a great CD just to throw on and enjoy while inebriated. It also has some great pictures on the inside booklet. I will be purhasing the other CD's in "the art of loungin'" set as well.
