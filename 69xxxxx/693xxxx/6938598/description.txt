     Gus was jobless. One day, he noticed his talent for computer. He    
      was ordered to do wrong by Ross president of a big company. But    
       his wrong doing was blocked by Superman. So Ross asked Gus to     
     kill him but it failed. The invincible computer was made by Gus's   
      plan. At last the fight between Superman and the computer broke    
                                    out.

     After two years of limited distribution, we found it time for our   
     work to be available on a larger scale. Therefore we decided to     
     enable more sites to host our releases by including the             
     'INTERNAL'tag in our directory naming. Our releases aren't          
     internal though; we release them. The good news is we stay who we   
     are and keepbeing non-competitive.
