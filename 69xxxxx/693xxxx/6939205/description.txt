The Sherpas are proud to present All.I.Can: a two-year feature film project that fuses our passions for riding and exploring the mountains with our potential to help the environment. The film strives to unite global mountain culture and bind us together as the leaders of a green revolution. We must be inspired to do all we can for the environment, and we must learn how to take that first tiny step in the right direction.
