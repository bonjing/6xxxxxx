DESCRIPTION:

A bold refutation of the belief that genes determine intelligence.

Who are smarter, Asians or Westerners? Are there genetic explanations for 
racial differences in test scores? What makes some nationalities excel in engineering and 
others in music? Will math and science remain a largely male preserve. 
From the damning research of The Bell Curve to the more recent controversy surrounding 
geneticist James Watson's statements, one factor has been consistently left out of 
the equation: culture. In the tradition of The Mismeasure of Man by Stephen Jay Gould, 
world-class social psychologist Richard E. Nisbett takes on the idea of intelligence 
as something that is biologically determined and 
impervious to culture--with vast implications for the role of education as 
it relates to social and economic development. 

Intelligence and How to Get It asserts that intellect is not primarily genetic 
but is principally determined by societal influences. Nisbett's commanding argument, 
superb marshaling of evidence, and fearless discussions of the controversial carve 
out new and exciting terrain in this hotly debated field.
