"EXCUSED", a new first-run syndicated strip from CBS Television Distribution (CTD) and Renegade 83, began production this week in Los Angeles. "EXCUSED", a half-hour reality dating show, will be shot at a modern style home in Encino, with the greater Los Angeles area providing a dynamic backdrop for contestants' dates. "We're really excited to bring the dating genre back to life with "EXCUSED"," said Aaron Meyerson, President of Programming and Development at CBS Television Distribution. "We're combining a unique format, a fresh young talent as host and the most successful producers in the genre to make a dating show that is filled with humor, competition and great story twists." "EXCUSED" is hosted by Iliza Shlesinger, best known for winning the sixth season of "Last Comic Standing." It is produced by Renegade 83 Entertainment, the company behind the hit syndicated dating show "Blind Date," and executive produced by David Garfinkle and Jay Renfroe. Scheduled to debut in September 2011, the strip will air mostly in late fringe and access time periods.
