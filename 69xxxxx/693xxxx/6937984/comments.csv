If you're such a good cracker, why download from TPB and whine afterwards? Go make your own cracks and start posting.
Sharing = caring, remember?"

Im curious what is cracked about this anyway ?

Or am i right in assuming what you posted is your installation folder after using ZWT's keygen ?

There seems to be a repacker and repost thing that goes on at TPB and its tiring there will be one legit release and 20 people uploading variations of that exact scene group release
all either ommitting the groups name entirely or minimising the ORIGINAL crackers contribution

Most tpb kiddies won't care what i say and a small minority will know exactly what im saying..

TPB sucks and why should be obvious"
