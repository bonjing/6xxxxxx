 PLOT: Shrek is a big ogre who lives alone in the woods, feared from all  
       the people in the land of Duloc. When Lord Farquaad, the ruler of  
       Duloc, exiles all the fairy-tale beings in the woods, Shrek looses 
       his peaceful life and his home becomes a refugee camp. So, he sets 
       to find Lord Farquaad and convince him to take the fairy-tale      
       beings back where they belong, and leave him alone. Lord Farquaad  
       accepts, under one condition. Shrek must first go and find the     
       beautiful young princess Fiona, who will become Farquaad's bride.  
       So, the big ogre begins his quest, along with his newfound

    DD 5.1 sound is used.                                                     
 more bitrate for the picture, if no
