A superb presentation by an erudite and accomplished expert in his field.

This series is only one of Dr. Spivey's television presentations for the BBC. His ability to utilize the English language properly plus his great depth of knowledge make his work not only of great value, but also interesting to watch and learn while enjoying the process. If only we had more Nigel Spivey's, education would be an adventure that few would deny themselves. His easy manner and friendly focus make the camera and the observer appreciate him and his abilities. 

A handsome and learned man, Spivey is an international treasure for those who would enlarge both their world view and their understanding of man --- his strengths, weaknesses, triumphs and sorrows.

Hats off to Dr. Spivery! How fortunate is the Emmanuel College of Cambridge, England, to have his services; and fortunate indeed are his students who experience the magic of his teachings in person.
