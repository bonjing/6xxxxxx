Another highlight of the first set was a great version of ""Desdemona,"" with Randall Bramblett sitting in on saxophone.  A powerful ""Egypt"" was sandwiched in between two Derek and the Dominos songs, with Devon Allman ripping some blues guitar for ""Key To The Highway"" and Jimmy Vivino joining the fray for a brilliant three-guitar onslaught on ""Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad.""

The second set began with a delicate, ethereal ""Melissa"" before dropping the first ""Maydell"" in years, then Oteil takes the lead vocals for a driving take on Jimi Hendrix's ""Manic Depression,"" only the third time the ABB have ever played it!  The band definitely seems to be focusing on mixing up the setlists on this Beacon run.

Randall Bramblett returned to the stage for a funky, groovy ""The Same Thing,"" with Oteil carrying over the mojo from the Hendrix tune and playing up a storm.  A ferocious ""Black Hearted Woman"" with an extended drum segment in the middle was followed by an epic ""Jessica"" that finished the set in style!

The double encore of ""Preachin' Blues"" and ""One Way Out"" was the exclamation point on this great show!"
