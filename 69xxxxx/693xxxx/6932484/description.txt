1. So what is CiderX?
2. What is the advantage of it compared to Cider?
3. What is possible, that was not possible with Cider?

Here are the answers:
1. CiderX is basically a hybrid Wrapper. A Wrapper combined out of Cider and CXEx.

2. With CXEx as part of Cider you can use CXEx for many things:

    - Installing
    - Launching windowed applications (not combined with cider, but for example a config.exe)
    - using Winetricks (it is now possible to install .net framework in cider)
    - etc

Also CiderX as many addons compared to Cider, e.g. the Engine Changer, the CustomEXEMaker and the Config.app

3. Basically CiderX does not want to make Cider more compatible, it is trying to make Cider easier to use.
The Core of CiderX is still Cider itself, so it has the same compatibility as Cider. The biggest difference is that you can now install
many winetricks in Cider, that were very difficult to install (PhysX) or nearly impossible (.Net Framework) in Cider.
