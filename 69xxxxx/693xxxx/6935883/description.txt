Archaeologist Jeff Rose embarks on a journey to understand how the destructive 
forces of water might have inspired the biblical story of Noahs Ark and the 
great flood. Dr. Rose believes that a massive flood once swallowed a landmass 
as big as Great Britain, created the Persian Gulf and sent tribes of Neolithic 
people into constant retreat from the ever-rising waters.
