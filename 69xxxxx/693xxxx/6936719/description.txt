PEPPERMINT HARRIS AS LONESOME AS I CAN BE 
THE JEWEL RECORDINGS (1965-1972)
Label: Westside (UK)
Released: 9 October 2001
Format: Mp3@320cbr

Texas R&B singer Peppermint Harris is best known for two early-\'50s hits, the classic \"Rainin\' in My Heart\" and \"I Get Loaded,\" a drunken boast that led to a slew of other drinking songs from Harris, typecasting him as the man with a bottle in his hand, a mixed blessing at best. With an easy baritone that came across as a sort of late-night version of Sam Cooke on too many whiskey shots, Harris arguably did his best work with Jewel Records, a Louisiana label owned and run by Stan \"The Record Man\" Lewis. While he didn\'t have any huge hits between 1965 and 1971, the length of his stay at Jewel, Harris nonetheless produced some solid material, as this anthology shows. He reprises his self-penned \"Rainin\' in My Heart\" twice here, and turns in a fine version of Big Bill Broonzy\'s \"Key to the Highway,\" as well, and working with a large band, he shows a real talent for songwriting, vocal phrasing, and arrangement. There aren\'t a lot of Peppermint Harris CDs on the market, and while the 1950s Aladdin sides are more famous, this one, given its consistent tone and excellent sound, makes for probably a better introduction to Harris\' unique version of Texas R&B.[/color]
