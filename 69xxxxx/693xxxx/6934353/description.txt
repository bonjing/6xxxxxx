Dave has an odd reaction when his shrink starts dating Penny. Meanwhile, Jane and Max fight over ownership of a sweater and end up in another one of their strange competitions; whoever is "less vain" gets to keep the sweater, and the challenge is to see who can wear a horribly unflattering outfit the longest. And Jane urges Brad and Alex to try and "bond," but it's awkward -- until they discover their mutual love of romantic comedies.
