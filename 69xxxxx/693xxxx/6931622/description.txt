Chill Pill v1.4 MacOSX Cracked-CORE

Chill Pill allows you to enjoy Fever's rich RSS experience while taking advantage of Cocoa and all of the other modern technologies in Mac OS X.



FEATURE LIST:
â€¢ System-wide Integration: Filling the void where web applications fail, Chill Pill allows you to set Fever as your default RSS reader, change hot keys via System Preferences, get notified when new items are available, and much more!

â€¢ Custom Styles: Let's face it, Fever is beautiful.. but everyone has their own style. Using Styles, you can tweak the interface to your heart's desire. All styles are simply CSS files, a modern web standard. Share your styles with other community members on the Conceited Forums.

â€¢ Built-in Article Viewer: One of the most requested features, now you can easily browse links in your feeds without having to leave Chill Pill. Reading your feeds just got a whole lot faster.

â€¢ Multi-touch Gestures: Two or three finger swipe right over an article to open it in your preferred browser. Two or three finger swipe left to switch lists. Three finger swipe up or down to navigate the list. It's all there, working just like you'd expect.

â€¢ Automatic Updating: Don't rely on cron to automatically update your feeds. Choose between various updating frequencies to make sure you always have the latest articles at your finger tips.

â€¢ Everything you already have: Since Chill Pill's job is to make Fever better, you have all of the genius of Fever coupled with an even more integrated experience. Yeah, we didn't think it could be this awesome either.

To the \"United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users\",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intentionally 
posting fake comments & files. Their meaning is just trying to spread 
confusion and to frustrate TPB and it\'s users. 
Less downloaders = less seeders = less download speed etc = not good! 

It\'s in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intentionally keep posting fake comments & files. It\'s an easy answer against 
those who intentionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That\'s for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let\'s just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what\'s said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the \"United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users\"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
