eBook of "Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why It Matters" by D. R. Prothero (c2007). Small PDF file (17 MB), rough bookmarking but accurate page-numbering so table of contents and index can be used. Scanned from print in B&W (downsampling has made difficult shades of grey somewhat fuzzy but text OK).
