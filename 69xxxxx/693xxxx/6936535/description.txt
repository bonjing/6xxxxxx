The UK version of the magazine, published by Haymarket Consumer Publications Ltd, is focused mainly on consumer electronics, gadgetry and lifestyle products, such as iPods and fast cars, to computers and men's clothing. Like its U.S. equivalent, Stuff UK contains a scantily clad woman on the front page (with a small number of further photos inside the magazine), but as the model is clothed this is not considered pornography in Britain.
