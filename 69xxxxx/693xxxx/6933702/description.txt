It is not the typical Teenage Comedy U might thought reading the title.


I had Fun watching the movie enjoyed some good Lines and an really nice Story.

So if U Up to an good Romantic Comedy I recommend to give this movie a shot it s worth it! For both Genders
This Movie was easy to watch. It brought you into the Story easily gave you some Clues straight away so you were eable to follow the characters and the Plot line with no Probs .

We see this to guys working and living together . One of them is an "Player" , the other one is more "normal".

The Normal One meats an Girl Follow her to an Meeting Of Sex Addicts. To spend some time with her he pretend to be one of them / Like his best Friend , the "Player".

As you already now can Imagine this isn t that good of an Idea.

We get to see some nice Conversations , the Yokes are all well placed and kind of realistic.

All in All i Would say a nice movie , with an good dialoge Script , good filming Job, Charming Actors / Characters. 

Fun to watch. Not as good as Seth Rogen manages to bring an Message into his Kind of "Comedy" A little more trimmed to be MainStream , but really nice done. As I would say worth the
