In Search of Churchill: A Historian's Journey
by Martin Gilbert

Read by David Case
Ripped from Cassette
Unabridged

Martin Gilbert, Winston Churchill's official biographer, has devoted nearly 30 years to his subject. It's taken that long to track down every scrap of information about this twentieth century titan. Gilbert received his appointment after Randolph Churchill's death, more than 20 years ago.

Randolph had started his father's biography, Gilbert assisted him and was there to take charge after Randolph's untimely death. From this new book emerges an intimate portrait of Churchill's character, untrammeled by formality and the fruit of Gilbert's work.
