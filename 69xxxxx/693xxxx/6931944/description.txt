WARNING: This bootleg release of the textbook is not fully compliant with the PDF Version 1.7 standard. As a result, its contents won't display correctly in numerous places when using standard-abiding products like Adobe Reader or Acrobat (A warning will usually be displayed). I recommend using PDF X-Change Viewer (freeware) by Tracker Software at  http://www.tracker-software.com/product/pdf-xchange-viewer for (almost) trouble-free reading.


Once your download has finished, _please_ seed this torrent as often and for as long as you possibly can.
