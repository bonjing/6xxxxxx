Best-selling author Jackson Spielvogel helped over one million students learn about the present by exploring the past. Spielvogel\\\'s engaging, chronological narrative weaves the political, economic, social, religious, intellectual, cultural, and military aspects of history into a gripping story that is as memorable as it is instructive. WESTERN CIVILIZATION includes three to ten maps in each chapter and numerous excerpts from primary sources that enliven the past while introducing students to the source material of historical scholarship. Additionally, the text is lushly illustrated with photographs that add visual context. A variety of pedagogical tools, including features on relevant films and new end-of-chapter study aids, make this edition accessible to any learning style.
