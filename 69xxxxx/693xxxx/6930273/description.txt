Dynamic Auto Painter 2.5.5 (Keygen-MESMERiZE) [ChingLiu]







This is not your ordinary photo-to-painting effect!Instead of changing the pixels of the photo itself, DAP uses the input image only as a guide to paint the scene with many different brushes and guided by real-world artists inspired techniques.

Looks like painting from a distance 
One thing that puts DAP above others is that the output images will look like a painting even in small size (for example resized on web or looking from a distance when printed). This is normally a common deal-breaker with all automatic filters which when resized down will look simply like a processed photo.
Looks like painting up-close
Looking at details you may think we are showing you a real canvas. An in some sense it is actually true. There is an option in the software called Real Canvas that simulates the way a real canvas or artistic paper interact with the paint. There is enough details even for a largest print. 
Never paints the same image twice
Not only you have different painter styles, you can choose different impressions and palettes. However even with the same settings the brush strokes will differ from one image to another as would do with a real painter.

Features In a Nutshell:

â€¢Automatic, it does the painting for you
â€¢Real-world artists inspired techniques
â€¢It doesn't depend on the input image resolution 
â€¢Add Non-traditional look to your photos or 3D renderings

Full of Surprising results. The arbitrary nature of the painting process is ready to uncover many surprises in your images. 

Great Feedback tool for creative minds Dynamic Auto-Painter can work as a great feedback tool to improve your photography skills. A painting will simplify the image to its core visual values allowing you to evaluate the overall impact of the image such as proper framing technique or good separation of subject from its surrounding. 

Looks Good when Printed Unlike many off-the shelf painting effects the printed results from DA-Painter look stunningly painting-like. The Real Canvas option will add Canvas or watercolor Paper feel to the whole image even when printed on a normal non-textured paper.

It is in the details The 64 bit version adds material and light properties where you can determine how the dried paint reflects light and then add various lights. The result will give third dimension to the brush strokes where you can see scratches and bumps in paint.

Add a new dimension to your creative tool-box Both designer professionals and home users can appreciate the new creative dimension of a painting style as a counter point to the abundance of digital photography. 

Versatile tool If you feel like to create your completely new preset from scratch, you can. The interesting thing is that the set of brush strokes can be anything from colors to pictures of vegetables or coffee beans so you can really go wild.
