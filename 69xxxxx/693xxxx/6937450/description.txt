Editorial Reviews

Adolf Hitler spent the last ten days of his life in a bunker underneath the Chancellery of the Reich. Unwilling to face the consequences of defeat, the dictator ended his own life on April 30, 1945 in this fortified underground complex. Featuring exclusive interviews with the last survivorâ€™s of Hitlerâ€™s inner circle and extensive archival footage, Death in the Bunker is an illuminating look at the FÃ¼hrerâ€™s final decisions in preparation for his suicide.

Includes Exclusive Interviews with:

â€¢ Bernd Freytag von Loringhoven (tank commander and adjutant to two of Hitlerâ€™s generals; author of In Hitlerâ€™s Bunker)

â€¢ Armin D. Lehmann (Hitlerâ€™s courier responsible for carrying orders from the FÃ¼hrerbunker; author of Hitlerâ€™s Last Courier)

â€¢ Traudl Junge (Hitlerâ€™s secretary to whom he dictated his will prior to his suicide)

â€¢ Rochus Misch (bodyguard and courier to Hitler)
