Columbia Roots and Blues - Retrospective 1925-1950
A 4 CD box set released in the early 1990s as part of Columbia Legacy's reissue program. Contains classics and curios (many previously unreleased) from the Columbia vaults - over 4 and a half hours of music. I've played this set for years without growing tired of it, even if there's a fair amount of mediocre material included.  

MP3 (320k CBR) - title and artist information is encoded in the music files.

In a couple of cases I combined tracks into one MP3 file (Empty Bed Blues parts 1 and 2 on Disc 1, the first 3 tracks on Disc 3 which simulate a country and western radio broadcast with intro and outro theme). Unless I've overlooked something else, nothing is absent from this set!

Enjoy and share without reservation!
