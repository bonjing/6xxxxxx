Recapture the mellow vibe of your favourite easy listening shows from the 60s and 70s
with this festive feast of classics old and new. All-time great Carole King plays songs
from her recent seasonal album, including Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, and
Sheffield crooner Richard Hawley mixes self-penned songs with his own take on Silent Night.

An imaginative bill is completed by the perky vocal harmonies of the Puppini Sisters
doing Let It Snow, the dreamy widescreen sound of Brighton outfit the Mummers performing
White Christmas and the velvet tones of latter day Nat King Cole, Brooklyn-based jazz
vocalist Gregory Porter, crooning the Christmas Song.

Choose between your best cardigan or Rat Pack tuxedo, pour yourself an eggnog, get the
chestnuts roasting, put your feet up and join the party!
