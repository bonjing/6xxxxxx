Hi I am Kalam!                                  
                                                
I come from a small village in Rajasthan,       
I live there with my mother and little brother. 
Life here is very difficult. Getting proper     
meal is a rarity so going to school is just out 
of question. But I like reading, learning new   
things and making new friends. When I grow up,  
I want to be a big man, wear good clothes and   
a tie and become successful.Mother says that myr
brain works â€œRail se bhi tezâ€. To help my mothes
support the family I work with Bhati Mamu at hi 
dhaba. He has a camel, Laxmi. I am her best     
friend. Tourists from various countries stop at 
our dhaba. I like talking to them and learning  
their languages.
