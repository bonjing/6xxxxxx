Zoom Player is a robust and very easy to use Media and DVD Front-End Player. Zoom Player was designed to be simple at first glance while being remarkably dynamic and flexible when used to its full potential. Zoom Player works in two modes.

A Media mode which can play any file supported by DirectShow (any file which plays in MediaPlayer) and a DVD mode which uses pre-installed DirectShow DVD filters to play DVD content. It supersedes media player in all it`s functions and provides several important functions that media player lacks.

Zoom Player provides special zooming functions to improve TV-Output quality by eliminating overscan.
