FaceTab Pro for Facebook is an incredibly slick and gorgeous app for quickly accessing your Facebook account directly from your Mac's menu bar. It is one of the most popular and actively used apps on the entire Mac App Store.

Features:

* Instant access to Facebook via your Mac's menu bar: 

  Quickly take a peak at your Facebook account at the click of a button
  and also via its customizable hot key (ctrl + F).

* Awesome color-coded notifications with audio alerts:

We've made it really simple to distinguish between new notifications via our menu bar icon. A gold icon means you have a new friend request; red is a new wall post/like/poke; and green is a new inbox message. Finally, a flashing blue icon indicates a new chat message from a friend!

* Choose between desktop & mobile modes:

Want a no-nonsense clean cut view of your Facebook account? Then the mobile mode is your best bet. For those that want the full Facebook experience, just toggle over to the desktop mode and enjoy.

* Growl notifications support:

Our customers asked for it and we delivered. Each of the notification types explained above now have their own corresponding Growl notification popup, and what's best is that you can configure Growl for each notification type, to customize your FaceTab Pro experience to your liking.

* Facebook Chat support:

Facebook chat with all the trimmings, just like it is in your web browser, but with the added benefit of notifications

* Ninja stealth mode:

Use the nifty opacity control slider to determine the transparency of your FaceTab Pro app window. Stealth mode lets you sneakily check on your Facebook news feed etc without it catching the eyes of others

* Resizable window:

Just as it states, resize the tab/window to your liking!

* Slick touch gestures support:

One of our most loved features, feel right at home with touch gestures support for back/forward and scrolling.

* Awesome spellchecking:

Bad at spelling or constantly making typos? Well we've got your back with support for spellchecking - never misspell a word in a status update or chat conversation again!

* Fullscreen support for OS X Lion users:

The full Facebook experience with no distractions!

* Accessibility options:

Customize the font size, use the right click menu options such as text to speech and make life easier with standard hot-keys like cmd + R to refresh. Ah, it's the small things that make us happy

* Regular free updates:

FaceTab Pro is one of the most actively maintained and updated apps on the store and we aim to keep it that way! Please spread the word and keep sending us your feedback!
