 by the financial meltdown. But Nick Mathur     
 and Jerry Patel don't feel a thing in their    
 comfortable pad in London.                     
 Nick feels smug with his successful investment 
 banking job, the new bonus in his pocket and   
 his beautiful fiancÃ©, Radhika, by his side,    
 while Jerry is so used to scraping the bottom  
 of the barrel and living off his best buddy    
 Nick, that recession feels like home. But life 
 has a way of pulling the rug from under our    
 feet.Nick and Jerry stop smiling the day Nick's
 company decides to downsize and unceremoniously
 fires him.And Jerry is informed by the Social  
 Services that his nephew Veer, whose local     
 guardian Jerry is will be placed in a foster
