[excerpted from John Stossel's blog:]

Was 2011 good or bad for freedom?

To answer that question, I've booked an all-star libertarian panel:

David Boaz from the Cato Institute, Harvard economics professor Jeffrey Miron, Reason Magazine managing editor Katherine Mangu-Ward and Kmele Foster, chairman of the America's Future Foundation, will take on the economy, wars, and protests that happened overseas and here.

When I went to visit the OWS protest in NYC, I quickly learned that the "occupiers" didn't like me. What did the protest mean, or achieve? The panel will analyze.

Also, former MTV stars Kennedy and Kurt Loder, the author of a new book on 21st-century movie reviews, dissect the year's culture. We finally got a new take on Ayn Rand's novel in the long-awaited release of the Atlas Shrugged movie. We also got a new "food insecure" Sesame Street muppet.
