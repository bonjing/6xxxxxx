Ableton Suite is a complete software studio. Suite 8 gives you all of the features in Live 8 plus sound, with a radically new Library packed with beautiful new sounds and a wealth of useful resources. Suite 8 contains 11 Ableton instruments and effects including synths, a sampler, electric and acoustic drums, mallets, numerous sampled instruments, the new, reworked Operator and amp modeling effects. Two completely new instruments, Collision and Latin Percussion, round off the set. Ableton Suite 8 is a complete package: the tools and the sounds.

8.2.7 Release Notes

Improvements and feature changes:
â€¢There is a new entry in the Options menu: \"Reduced Latency When Monitoring\", which toggles latency compensation on and off for tracks which have input monitoring on. When enabled, input-monitored tracks will have the lowest possible latency but may be out of sync with some other tracks in your Set. When disabled, all tracks will be in sync, but input-monitored tracks may have higher latency. Before, the option was only available via the \'StrictDelayCompensation\' options.txt, and was ON per default. It now defaults to OFF.
â€¢When restarting after a crash, Live will now display a warning in the Help View if the crash was caused by an issue with a VST plug-in. Note: this is currently for Mac OS X only.

Bugfixes:
â€¢Authorizing a full version of Live would sometimes activate a feature-limited version (Live Lite or Live Intro).
â€¢Fixed a bug that prevented setting the start marker of an audio clip before the sample start.
â€¢On Mac OS X, saving a Live Set could lead to an unresponsive Save dialog box, if the destination folder contained an alias file which points to an unavailable volume.
â€¢Fixed a crash which occurred when importing a Drum Rack with a routing to a return track.
â€¢3 additional crashes were also fixed.
