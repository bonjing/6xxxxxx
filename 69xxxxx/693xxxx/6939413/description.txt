This comprehensive book on the durability of FRP composites makes it easier for the practicing civil engineer and designer to use these materials on a routine basis. It addresses the current lack, or inaccessibility, of data related to the durability of these materials, a major obstacle to their widespread acceptance and implementation in civil infrastructure. The book will further the acceptance of composites for civil structural applications, by providing this source for practicing engineers, decision makers, and students involved in architectural engineering, construction and materials, disaster reduction, environmental engineering, maritime structural technology, transportation engineering and urban planning.
