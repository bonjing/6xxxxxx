Desire is the second album released by Toyah Willcox as a solo artist.

It is more typical of her band's earlier albums rather than its more commercial predecessor Minx, although it didn\'t entirely escape the imposition of cover versions, including "Echo Beach", originally recorded by Martha and the Muffins, and, somewhat incongruously, "Love's Unkind", originally by Donna Summer. However, most of the songs are once again co-written by Willcox, and while the original release of the album does not feature any musician credits, it does however benefit from a consistent band line-up [as detailed on Toyah Willcox's official website], rather than the large number of session musicians involved in Minx.

Two singles were released from the album, "Echo Beach", which became a minor hit in the UK and "Moonlight Dancing". 

In her autobiography, Willcox stated that she was forced to record "Love's Unkind" by her record label, but she was fiercely opposed to it. E.G. Records threatened to cancel the album's release if she did not.

To date, the album has yet to be reissued - so cd copies are rare and tend to be very expensive. However, Toyah has stated in her webletters that a reissue is on the cards for the future.

For the first time on the Internet in FLAC.

Enjoy!
