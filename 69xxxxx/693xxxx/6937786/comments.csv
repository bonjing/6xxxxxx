[V],smbdownload,2012-01-06T22:48Z,"Weekday shows at the Beacon can often be hidden gems, and this Monday night spectacular is the perfect example!  Full of talented guests and deep jams, the second set in particular is out-of-control good, as the ABB continue to raise the bar at the Beacon with every show.

The first set started off with the second â€œSailinâ€™ 'Cross The Devilâ€™s Seaâ€ of the run, pleasing fans of the bandâ€™s 90s output.  The dreamy instrumental â€œEgyptâ€ reached new heights here, better than any version in years.  Keyboardist John Ginty and guitarist/Yankee legend Bernie Williams joined in for a sultry â€œWhoâ€™s Been Talkingâ€ that will surely rank up there in â€œBest Version Everâ€ conversations about that tune.

The second set is where the band reached another level, another gear, making this show one for the ages.  Ginty returned for Miles Davisâ€™ â€œSpanish Keyâ€ along with sax master Bill Evans, and the ABB pushed the envelope of jazz-rock fusion on this one.  Evans stayed on for â€œSoulshineâ€ and â€œDreams,â€ adding a lot to excellent versions of both and instantly earning a place in the Special Guest Hall Of Fame.

And that was just the first half of the second set!  Energized by Evansâ€™ appearance, the band tore through epic versions of â€œBlack Hearted Womanâ€ and â€œRockinâ€™ Horseâ€ before an all-consuming â€œLes Brersâ€ finished the set in style.

Just when you thought they couldnâ€™t top that, a super-sweet â€œMelissaâ€ and a ripping â€œOne Way Outâ€ with Devon Allman on Duane Allman's goldtop guitar made for a great double-decker encore.  What a show!"
