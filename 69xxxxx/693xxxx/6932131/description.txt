SOME QUOTES ON THIS TORRENT:


  "If you know what you want to be, you are more likely to be it.
   Therefore, we start with a chapter on values, morals, life goals,
   aspirations, dreams, wanna-bes, etc.
   Moral philosophy is hard thought about right action."
                                               -Socrates
   "Goodness without knowledge is weak; knowledge without goodness is
   dangerous."
   "We have to build a better man before we can build a better society."
   "All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good people do
   nothing."
   "Our purpose is not to make a living but a life--a worthy, well-rounded,
   useful life."
   "Morality is not a subject; it is a life put to the test in dozens of
   moments."
                                               -Paul Tillich
