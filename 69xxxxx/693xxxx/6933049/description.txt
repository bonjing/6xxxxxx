What does the mysterious disappearance of record-breaking aviator Steve Fossett have in common with Area 51? In September 2007, Fosset went missing somewhere over the Sierra Nevada mountain range, sparking the biggest peacetime search and rescue operation in the history of the United States.


Over the ensuing days and weeks, reports would surface of dozens of other missing airplanes in a huge triangular area of California and Nevada. Could this mysterious region be another Bermuda Triangle?
