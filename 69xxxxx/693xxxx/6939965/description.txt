The game is an uncomplicated brainteaser consisting of small labyrinths which are filled with various obstacles. The most dangerous ones are wolves and pits: Coming across them will cause the player to lose sheep. The player's objective is to safely lead the sheep under his care through the labyrinths. To do this, he has to lay out arrows on the field which the sheep will step on to go in the right direction. Guide the sheep along safe pathways to their homes, where they will be saved! The number of arrows is limited, so to make them last for the entire trip, you have to erase the used arrows and lay them out again.

Running Sheep: Tiny Worlds is an engrossing brainteaser with simple controls, vivid graphics, and 250 levels. It's wonderful entertainment for the whole family!
