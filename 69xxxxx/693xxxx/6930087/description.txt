FOR TESTING

Description
Adonis Linux is aimed at any user. The first build is not targeted at any specific audience, It's merely a base to branch off several other genre specific builds, for programmers, game enthusiast, artist, etc. From here, the long term goal is compatibility. To run anything, on anything, regardless of what OS and hardware the item was made for. 

Features
    * A simple distro with a very complicated goal
    * Currently built on xfce 4.8, on a Debian "stable" repo.
