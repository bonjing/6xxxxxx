I\'ve included the patch, crack, serial and MagicDisc. Please read my instructions to have a successful game play.
This ISO file should have no errors because I bought The Sims 3 a month ago and I take care of my games like a baby.

Laptop versions of these chipsets may work, but may run comparatively slower. Standalone cards that are installed in vanilla PCI slots (not PCIe or PCIx or AGP), such as some GeForce FX variants, will perform poorly.
Integrated chipsets such as the ATI Xpress and the NVIDIA TurboCache variants may default to settings that are higher than what would be optimal for them. Graphics settings can be lowered to improve performance.
The NVIDIA GeForce FX series is unsupported under Vista.
