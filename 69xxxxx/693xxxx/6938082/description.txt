Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On this Friday, January 6 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with Charlotte Iserbyt, who served as Senior Policy Advisor in the Office of Educational Research and improvement at the Department of Education during the Reagan years. During her stint there, she blew the whistle on a major technology initiative which would control curriculum in America's classrooms. She subsequently wrote and compiled The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America, a chronological history of the past one hundred plus years of education reform. A new version of Iserbyt's book is now available at the Infowars store. 

Alex also confronts the latest news, including new developments on the Iran front as the United States, the EU and Britain prepare for an attack and Iran announces a new military exercise designed to show its ability to shut down the geostrategic Strait of Hormuz.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
