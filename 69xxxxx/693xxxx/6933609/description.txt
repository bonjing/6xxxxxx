James Strong's debut album. Although, considered by James, himself, to be just an experiment, it has already been heard 

around the world. He has been approached by several talent scouts, and record companies, including Roadrunner Records 

(Nickleback). His voice has been described as resembling Scott Stapp (Creed) and Eddie Vedder (Pearl Jam), but with his own 

unique style, and tone, with 'spot-on' delivery. 
This first album, displays his influences from many different genres. His next album, he says, will center more around Rock 

and Pop/Rock, with influences from 80's rock n roll.
