Ami wants to throw a party to celebrate the continued success at Wooster Street Social Club, but when Megan invites ousted artist Chris, Ami becomes upset; Jessica takes a gamble in hopes to reaching her dreams more quickly.
 
 
Fixed audio synchronization issues after the first segment which were occurring in some media players with the initial release. Sorry about that, folks. I'm trying new things; learning new tricks; and seeing what really works and doesn't. There are no sync issues with the 720p release due to the way it was encoded (original recorded .ts files joined prior to conversion versus the 480p being converted in segments during broadcast then merged afterwards). Hopefully this PROPER 480p will make EVERYBODY happy.
