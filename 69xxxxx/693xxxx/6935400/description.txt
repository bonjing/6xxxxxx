NOTES:

First off thanks to 26k for sources files .....the source files were 2 x avi files and were cammed at an angle and did 
move from time time throughout the film.Also there was a top of a chair in the centre and a fair bit missing off the bottom and
left handside.Audio was ok,nothing special ....lots of noise,lots of echo....just typical cam audio.
First job was to join the avi files together and strip the audio.From there i dropped the audio in Adobe and ran hiss removal and
light noise removal and then changed all the EQ band settings and cleaned it the best i could and saved as a mp3....was AC3 256,but
thats pretty pointless on audio like this.
Now the video ...well took 16hrs to do :lol: ...first made a script via megui and used the heavy noise filter,then dropped that into
vdub and then used another HQ smoother .Also used the quad filter to rotate the video,so it was level and then cropped and resize it to 
correct AR.Also changed the brightness and contrast along with the rgb colours and chroma and finally added some sharpness back into it.

Now readnfo ....even after the above work,it will not look like a R5 nor sound like a DD5.1 track ...but it is improved alot compared to
source.Also the AR will dift in and out aswell as how level the video is because like i said there is camera movement so unless you cut it into
loads of pieces there is no way of keeping it dead level with correct AR....
