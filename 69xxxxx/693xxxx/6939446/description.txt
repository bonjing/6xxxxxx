A long-time market leader in this discipline, Slack has set the standards in Operations Management which other textbooks seek to emulate.

Operations Management provides a strategic perspective, whilst also examining the practical issues which organisations face on a day to day basis. It uses over 120 examples from all over the world, reflecting the balance of economic activity between service (c.75%) and manufacturing (c.25%) operations.
