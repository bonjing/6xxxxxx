[/b][/color] The longest-running crime series in U.S.
television history has made its way across the pond for a UK reworking.
Series creator Dick Wolf has given Law & Order a makeover-for fans in the UK.
Law & Order: UK sets??? More out to retain the grittiness of the original series, but be uniquely British.

The show commenced broadcast in 2009 and is not to be confused with the 1978 crime drama Law and Order.
