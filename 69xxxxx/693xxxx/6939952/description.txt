****************************************************************************With this concise book, youâ€™ll learn the art of building hypermedia APIs that donâ€™t simply run on the Web, but that actually exist in the Web. Youâ€™ll start with the general principles and technologies behind this architectural approach, and then dive hands-on into three fully-functional API examples.

Too many APIs rely on concepts rooted in desktop and local area network patterns that donâ€™t scale wellâ€”costly solutions that are difficult to maintain over time. This book shows system architects and web developers how to design and implement human- and machine-readable web services that remain stable and flexible as they scale.

    * Learn the H-Factors for representing application metadata across all media types and formats
    * Understand the four basic design elements for authoring hypermedia types
    * Convert a simple read-only XML-based media type into a successful API design
    * Examine the challenges and advantages of designing a hypermedia type with JSON
    * Use HTML5â€™s rich set of hypermedia controls in the API design process
    * Learn the details of documenting, publishing, and registering media type designs and link-relation types
