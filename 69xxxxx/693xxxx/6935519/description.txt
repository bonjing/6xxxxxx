ITV1 The Unforgettable Ernie Wise
26th December 2011

A tribute to one half of one of Britain's
greatest double acts. A successful child
star by the time he was 12, Ernie Wise went
on to become a consummate comedian and foil
to Eric Morecambe in Morecambe and Wise.

Ernie was a passionate traveller and would
film many of his trips to Europe in the 1950s
with his wife Doreen, as well as visits to
the US and Australia with Eric.

The programme features much of this previously
unseen personal footage as well as private
photographs and contributions from family,
friends and co-stars.
