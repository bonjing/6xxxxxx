       Lex Luther steals a hair of Superman's head from a museum and     
      uses it to create Nuclear Man, an android that gets energy from    
     the Sun. His purpose of course is to use him as a weapon to kill    
       Superman, so that Louther will be free to realize his criminal    
                                   plans.

     After two years of limited distribution, we found it time for our   
     work to be available on a larger scale. Therefore we decided to     
     enable more sites to host our releases by including the             
     'INTERNAL'tag in our directory naming. Our releases aren't          
     internal though; we release them. The good news is we stay who we   
     are and keepbeing non-competitive.
