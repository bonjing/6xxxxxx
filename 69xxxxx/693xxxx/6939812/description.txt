kruhft -- Programmed Piano EP (2005)
------------------------------------

A collection of piano tracks that were generated using a code written
in Common Lisp to simulate the actions of a piano player.  These
tracks were 'written' by a computer program with no editing and
rendered using Common Lisp Music.

Enjoy.

Feel free to distribute this collection of songs as long as this
README file remains intact and included with the distribution.
Non-commercial distribution only, contact me otherwise.
