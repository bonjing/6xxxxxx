Why iNTERNAL? It's not because we "lost". We like the show and wanted a crisper release.
See below!
 
From time to time ASAP has had an issue where their rips pulsate between sharp and blurry.
We've mentioned it before, nukers (unconnected to us) have nuked for it. We've done some
testing and come to the following conclusion.

There's a bug with Xvid 1.32 when if you leave default quantizer (drf) limits 1-31 for I/P/B it 
has a tendency to choose very high quantizers. If you change the maximums the issue goes away. 
We have tested limiting to 6 and 8 I/P/B and the highest drf with both limits was 3 I, 5 P, 7 B. 

We hope that by bringing attention to this all groups can use this information and this 
problem can go away once and for all.

See /SAMPLE/ for video samples and more information!.
