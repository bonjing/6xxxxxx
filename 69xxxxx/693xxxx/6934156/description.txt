When the cast of Jersey Shore goes to Italy, they take a little of Jersey with them. And the birthplace of the Renaissance might never be the same. While embracing all that Florence has to offer -- great art, food and wine; cobblestone streets and gelato -- they've managed to remain true to who they are. There's plenty of GTL, fist pumping and hair gel -- it's just a little funnier when it's in a foreign country.
