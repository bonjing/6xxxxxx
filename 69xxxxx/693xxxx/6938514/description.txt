this is NOT my upload, I take no credit, this was posted on another site
recently but deserves to be spread around and appreciated so I post here,
plays great in VLC with choice of three optional subs Danish, English and
Greenlandic, very nice video quality with vibrant colours and landscapes.




the original poster described his upload thusly . . . 

A fresh new film from my home and native land. It is very good. Though perhaps
less new than I suggested previously. Wikipedia had this to say:

"Qivitoq is a 1956 Danish film directed by Erik Balling and starring Poul
Reichhardt and Astrid Villaume. An intense romantic drama, the movie was
filmed entirely on location in Greenland. It was nominated both for the
Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and for the Palme D'Or at the
1957 Cannes Film Festival."

Video is h264, 676x576 at 25 fps. Subtitles are [1] Danish for dialogue spoken
in Greenlandic, [2] Greenlandic (you know you want it) and [3] English.
