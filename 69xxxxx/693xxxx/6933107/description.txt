As I have said in previous packs, this is not, by far, all of the comics Marvel released.  I don't grab anything I am not interested in, so if its not here, you can ind it elseplace. If you have any questions please feel free to message me or leave a post here.  

Coming up on my packs, I am focusing on the martial arts books rom the past so look for that.
