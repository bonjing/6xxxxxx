For years following the bombing, countless victimsÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³ family members, survivors, rescuers, and ordinary Americans, have questioned the official accounts about that fateful day.

Hoping to shed light on answers long ignored and censored, both by prominent media outlets and the U.S. government, A Noble Lie peels back what we thought we knew about the bombing and itÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s perpetrators.
