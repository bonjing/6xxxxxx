 Album Info..: 
 
 This record is subtitled Rare and Unreleased because much of this record was leaked a few years back (before the release of Pure Rock Fury). The mp3s circulated as demos and created quite a stir amongst C! fans, and ultimately caused much disappointment with PRF. Why disappointment? Simply put, these songs are superior (and I liked PRF a whole bunch!). 
 
 I think part of the appeal of many of these tracks is the re-emergence of pop-culture landmarks referenced throughout, harkening back to their benchmark self-titled release. You've got reference to TV's classic mini-series V in Oregon for crying out loud, and the Cover Girl jingle in Easy Breeze! This absurdity is part of the fascination I have with Clutch. They always had a way of tying familiar topics into heavy, catchy jams. Who kicks a jam that talks about harpsichords? Clutch does.
