Vayanadhan Thamban is a Malayalam language film starring Kamal Haasan and Latha in the lead roles. Kamal Haasan plays the role of a 100-year old warlock.

It is a story about evil worship.A man (Thampan)who retains his youth by giving the blood of virgins to evil.For virgins he pretends love to ladies and kidnapping them. It have strong influences of Hollywood vampire films.But it was a new theme in Malayalam. Kamalhasan performed his role as excellent.

The print is not all that great. Its the best I could do from a really print which I managed to get..

The audio is very clear. I would give it a 9 on 10.

The video, I personally would give about 6.5 on 10 considering the fact that this movie is over 30 years old...:-)

A lot of Malayalam movie lovers remember this film as a bold one during its time and Kamal Haasan has given a splendid performance in this above average movie directed by A Vincent.

Unfortunately very less data is available about this movie on the internet. 

A trivia..this movie was dubbed into Hindi with some added scenes and released in 1984 as "Pyasa Shaitan" which to be truthful actually screwed up the original very badly...

Enjoy and seed plzzzzz...
