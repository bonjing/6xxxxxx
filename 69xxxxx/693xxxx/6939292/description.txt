by the financial meltdown. But Nick Mathur     
and Jerry Patel don't feel a thing in their    
comfortable pad in London.                     
Nick feels smug with his successful investment 
banking job, the new bonus in his pocket and   
his beautiful fiancÃ©, Radhika, by his side,    
while Jerry is so used to scraping the bottom  
of the barrel and living off his best buddy    
Nick, that recession feels like home. But life 
has a way of pulling the rug from under our    
feet.Nick and Jerry stop smiling the day Nick's
company decides to downsize and unceremoniously
fires him.And Jerry is informed by the Social  
Services that his nephew Veer, whose local     
guardian Jerry is will be placed in a foster
