Welcome 2 Detroit is the 2001 debut solo album from Slum Village producer J Dilla (aka Jay Dee). The album followed the group's critically acclaimed Fantastic, Vol. 2, and kicked off BBE's "Beat Generation" series (producer-driven albums). Welcome 2 Detroit was preceded by the 12" single "Fuck the Police", a cut which didn't make the final album although it is considered to be among his best material. The album cemented J Dilla's reputation amongst those in the know as a virtuoso beatmaker.

'Fuck the Police' Will be in a separate torrent :)
