In way over his head, Sam brings Dean in to help with this seriously weird village and an Emma who is just not herself. By day this is a rugged yet undeniably beautiful community. At night, its horrors are almost beyond description. As an ancient celtic folk tale proves real, our two Americans are the first and last line of defense.
