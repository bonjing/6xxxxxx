"Lifetime Supply"

After having a doctor's visit but then 
missing the call with the test results, Phil 
automatically jumps to conclusions and starts 
saying his goodbyes. Meanwhile Javier pops up 
unannounced again and takes Manny to the 
horse races for a belated birthday 
celebration, and a subtle competition ensues 
when Mitchell brings home an environmental 
law award and it becomes a game of who has 
the bigger trophy.

18/Slower
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
