I bought an Epson Readyprint T20, my disc drive was busted and couldn't read the disc. I thought "surely there's an iso of it out there somewhere". I checked the Epson POS site, they had a driver, utility but no all in one thing. So I thought, maybe I should just ISO it and put it out there on the interwebs for those who have the printer but have lost their disc.
