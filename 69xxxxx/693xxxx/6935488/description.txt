 Album Info..: 
 
 Blast Tyrant is an excellent follow up to "Slow Hole". The songs are still heavy (#3, #5) but there is also the addition of a few instruments - even acoustic guitars. The lyrics are, as always, amazing and the melodies catchy as hell. You can't say that about many hard-rock bands, but Clutch is about as unique as they come. This album encompasses all the things they are famous for - groovy rock, driving rhythms, humorous, pointed, and well-informed writing. Neil's literary flair is ever present on this release.
