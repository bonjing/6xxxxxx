this is a current and working ap2.5/topology data file for the xgd2 game need for speed hot pursuit as of 1-2-2012. (ntsc,asia) i have tested it myself and confirm it does work. all you do is use xbox backup creator and inject it the same as any other topology data... if you dont know how, google it, there are TONS of tuts about it. enjoy!
