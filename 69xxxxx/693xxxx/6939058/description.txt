The Cadets (Kursanty) Mini-Series

In "The Cadets", we get an in-depth story about how the Soviets trained their troops for the Great Patriotic War around the time of the Battle of Stalingrad. These cadets are learning artillery, but they are also learning about life in a small town-about women, about power, and about war.
