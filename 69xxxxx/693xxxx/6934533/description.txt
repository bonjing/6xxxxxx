           Mike and his girlfriend Sheryl travel from Virginia to         
           Lake Kimbrabow State Park in West Virginia to spend the        
           weekend hiking and camping in the woods. They ask for          
           directions to the local guard that advises them to follow      
           the Donner Trail or the Willow Creek Bridge; however,          
           Mike meets the local Ida Forester in the crossroad that        
           tells them that Timber Falls has magnificent landscapes        
           and a wonderful waterfall and the couple decide to go to       
           the place. They stumble with the troublemakers Brody,          
           Darryl and Lonnie and Sheryl convinces Mike to get rid         
           off the bullets of his revolver. They camp and in the          
           morning Sheryl is abducted while bathing in a nearby           
           lake. The desperate Mike seeks her, and finds a deranged       
           fanatic religious family that needs them to procreate an       
           offspring.
