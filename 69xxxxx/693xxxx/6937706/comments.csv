[V],smbdownload,2012-01-06T21:34Z,"The Allman Brothers kicked off the 2011 Beacon Run in fine style with a show that featured the revival of several deep cuts, plus the first ever ABB version of ""Spanish Key"" by Miles Davis!

When the band hit the stage, a brief drum interlude set up the groove, and as the rest of the band joined in, the jam was hauntingly familiar, but hard to place.  When they hit the main riff to ""Spanish Key"" the jazz fans in the audience nodded in approval.  Derek absolutely rips on this classic from Bitches Brew!

The surprises didn't end there, with the band busting out ""Sailin' 'Cross The Devil's Sea"" for the first time in years next.  This underrated tune from the Where It All Begins album sounded great, and you'd never know the band hadn't played it in almost a decade.  Another first set highlight was ""Worried Down With The Blues,"" one of Warren's finest songs, and one the band hadn't played since 2005.  The ABB also played a great version of ""Kind Of Bird"" in the first set, with Gregg taking a notable organ solo and the whole band hittin' the note!

The second set began with a heartfelt speech from Jaimoe where he dedicated the rest of the Beacon Run to legendary ABB roadie Joseph ""Red Dog"" Campbell, who recently passed away from cancer.  A nice combo of ""Blind Willie McTell"" and ""Midnight Rider"" kicked things off, before another rare tune appeared.  ""High Cost Of Low Living"" wasn't played at all in 2010, and it's great to have it back in the mix!  Derek's new instrumental ""Bag End"" followed, painting a beautiful musical landscape.

A rousing ""Revival"" was appropriate for opening night at the Beacon, and the ""Southbound"" encore threatened to blow the roof off the venerable old theater!"
