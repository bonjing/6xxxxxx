Mark Radcliffe digs deep into the Top of the Pops archives to deliver 90 minutes of some
familiar and unfamiliar festive footage treats of yore and unseen Christmas delights from
the BBC library.

Straight from the BBC vaults, classic Christmas hits from the likes of Roy Woods Wizzard
and 70s glam heroes Slade to the smooth 80s vibe of Wham!s Last Christmas, the melancholic
duet of Fairy Tale of New York by Shane MacGowan and Kirsty MacColl plus from the Welsh Elvis
Shakin' Stevens, his enduring number one Christmas hit Merry Christmas Everyone.

Three Beatles are also represented with Pauls catchy Wonderful Christmas Time from 1979,
some rare footage of Ringo romping in the snow performing his 1971 solo hit It Don't Come
Easy and John and Yoko's abiding anti war protest song Happy Xmas (War Is Over)

Plus a rare treat with previously lost footage of David Bowie performing The Jean Genie from
Top of the Pops in 1973.

From more recent times, Coldplay make an appearance with their Christmas hit from last year
and Adele delivers a very sparkly performance from Christmas 2008. Plus the Pet Shop Boys,
Frankie Goes to Hollywood, The Pretenders, Curtis Mayfield, Kurtis Blow, Abba, Justin Bieber
and Mariah Carey, and a fitting tribute to the late Amy Winehouse.
