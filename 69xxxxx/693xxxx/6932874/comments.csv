Uploading a duplicate diminishes the effectiveness of the original file and causes everyone's download speeds to be slower (in addition to the aforementioned clutter). So it's a GOOD thing that nobody else bothered to seed your upload -- you made a mistake in trying to provide it. Please take five seconds to search before you upload anything else. If it's here and well-seeded -- do NOT duplicate it."
