Part II ? Gurdjieff\\\'s Mission: Introducing the Fourth Way to the West, 1912?1924

Winner of the WorldFest 2002 Gold Special Jury Award for Outstanding Excellence. 
Shot on site in St. Petersburg, Moscow, Constantinople, London, Fontainebleau-en-Avon, New York and Lascaux, this documentary video - narrated by William Patrick Patterson and based on his book \\\'Struggle of the Magicians\\\' - retraces Gurdjieff\\\'s mission to introduce the teaching to the West. P.D. Ouspensky\\\'s and J.G. Bennett\\\'s enigmatic relationships with Gurdjieff are explored. Particularly stressed are the \\\"St. Petersburg Conditions\\\" and Gurdjieff\\\'s technique of \\\"divine acting.\\\" The video vividly demonstrates Gurdjieff\\\'s warning to America of the rise and challenge of the East with footage recalling the 9/11 attack and its aftermath.
