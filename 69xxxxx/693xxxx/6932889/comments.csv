And we already have 245 different seeded torrents of it:

BTW, 7.8 GB is an enormous size for an AVI file.
The entire DVD disc image would not be that large.
This indicates that you are quite clueless when it comes to creating AVI files of a predetermined size.
Get yourself a copy of AutoGK --> http://www.free-codecs.com/download/autogk.htm
Then you can start creating proper AVI rips.
