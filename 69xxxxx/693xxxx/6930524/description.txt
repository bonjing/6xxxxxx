NCIS.S09E12.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 153MB]

[/b][/color] From Donald P.
Bellisario, an acclaimed producer, comes  NCIS,  a hit spin-off of  JAG,  that brings us the inner workings of the government agency that investigates all crimes involving Navy and Marine Corps personnel, regardless of rank or position.
 Leading this team that operates outside of the military chain of command is NCIS Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs  Mark Harmon , a skilled investigator and interrogator who is smart, tough and willing to bend the rules to get the job done.
Working under Gibbs is Agent Anthony Dinozzo  Michael Weatherly , a former homicide detective who joined NCIS just a few years ago, but who has instincts that can come only from working on the streets.
Joining them is Agent Abby Sciuto  Pauley Perrette , a gifted forensic scientist whose dark wit matches her goth-style hair and clothes, and Dr.
Donald  Ducky  Mallard  David McCallum , a medical examiner.
From murder and espionage to terrorism and stolen submarines, these special agents traverse the globe to investigate all crimes with Navy or Marine Corps ties.
