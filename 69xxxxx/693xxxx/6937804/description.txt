Duration: 88 Minutes
Dir.: Alexander Kluge


Yesterday Girl (German: Abschied von Gestern, "Farewell to Yesterday") is a 1966 New German Cinema film directed and written by Alexander Kluge. The Film is based on the short story Anita G. (1962), which is also by Alexander Kluge. The film tells the story of Anita G., a young East German migrant to West Germany and her struggle to adjust to her new life. The film won a Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival, whereas Kluge\'s next film, Artists Under the Big Top: Perplexed even went on to win the Golden Lion, a political scandal due to its progressive leanings which resulted in no Golden Lions being awarded up to 1979.
