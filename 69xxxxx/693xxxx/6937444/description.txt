Shakuntala Devi is a mathematical wizard from India, a calculating prodigy. 
She was born on November 4, 1939 in Bangalore, also known as Human Computer as she could do calculations faster than a computer which she proved in the 80's!
She has written books on puzzles, numbers and maths. I Have had 5 of her books for a long time now.
