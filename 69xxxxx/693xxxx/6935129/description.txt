This was originally ripped by johnsmith25 


It is a half side-by-side rip and encode from a Bluray 3D source of The Deathly Hollows Part 1


I changed from mkv to mp4 and the Audio from DTS to AC3 To work on my Lg Cinema 3D TV and it worked


Source - Bluray 3D disk

Video - H264 Encoding

Audio - English AC3 5.1 Audio

Subtitles - English



N.B

I re-uploaded this movie cause Utorrent crashed while uploading the previous torrent 

So this is a fresh new working version
