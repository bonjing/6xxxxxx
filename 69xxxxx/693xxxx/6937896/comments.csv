mentum going with another great show on this Tuesday night!  This one had a distinct bluesy feel, and some help from special guests Steve Earle and Robert Randolph.

The first set featured two songs the band had dusted off on Opening Night, ""High Cost Of Low Living"" and ""Worried Down With The Blues.""  Derek soared on the first, while Warren belted out the blues on the second, and you'd never know these songs were out of the rotation for years.  ""End Of The Line"" made its first 2011 appearance next, thrilling fans of this 90s hit.  Singer-songwriter Steve Earle, the heir to Townes Van Zandt's legacy and a leading figure in Americana music, joined the band for his tune ""The Devil's Right Hand"" as well as a stirring rendition of Bob Dylan's ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door"" that saw Steve and Gregg trading verses!  A powerful Jessica closed out the first set.

The second set continued in the same bluesy, rocking vein with scorching versions of ""Leave My Blues At Home"" and ""Maydell"" to kick things off.  The Jimi Hendrix classic ""Manic Depression"" has turned into quite the showcase for Oteil, giving him a chance to display his vocal chops, and Warren and Derek show why they are worthy contenders for Jimi's throne here.  ""Gambler's Roll"" makes its 2011 debut, and as he was all night long, Gregg is singing from his soul on this one.  What a treat!

After a smokin' ""Stand Back"" the band digs in to an exploratory, unusual version of ""In Memory of Elizabeth Reed"" that sounded totally different than the one they played just three days ago.  For the encore, pedal steel guitar maestro Robert Randolph joined the band for a funky, groovy ""That's What Love Will Make You Do"" before burning the house down with an explosive ""One Way Out.""

Another great show from the best live band in the land!"
