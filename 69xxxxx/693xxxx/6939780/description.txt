Posterino offers enhanced customization and flexibility including a variety of new stylish templates featuring grids of identical or odd sized image boxes. You can customize the size and shape of these boxes at any time. And with a single click, the application will automatically fill those boxes with random images drawn from the photos you uploaded. If you prefer to manually select images, you can simply drag and drop images into the template.

Sharing your photos is quick and simple as well. You can directly upload your completed collages to your Flickr account from inside the app and export photos to iPhoto and your email. Posterino 2 also lets you create and send custom e-cards with your very own stamps and postmarks.
