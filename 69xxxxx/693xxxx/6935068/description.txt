The FASTEST way to design and print business documents.

SOHO Print Essentials is the easiest way to design and print labels, envelopes, letterhead, fax cover sheets, invoices, address books, etc. It integrates seamlessly with SOHO Organizer.

SOHO Print Essentials 5 is included as part of the SOHO Organizer 9 suite of applications and is NOT sold separately. SOHO Print Essentials is very similar to SOHO Labels but has a few unique features:

1) SOHO Print Essentials also produces fax cover sheets, invoices, contact reports & activity reports (SOHO Labels does not support these).
2) SOHO Print Essentials integrates with your contact & calendar data in SOHO Organizer (SOHO Labels only supports the Mac OS X Address Book).

The current shipping version of SOHO Labels is version 5. SOHO Print Essentials 5 is very similar to SOHO Labels 5 so you can check out its web page to learn more about the features the two have in common. Of course, the best way to learn more about SOHO Print Essentials 5 is to download SOHO Organizer 9 and try it out.
