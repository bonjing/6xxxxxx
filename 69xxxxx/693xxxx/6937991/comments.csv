If I knew the missing byte and its location, I could just add it and get this torrent started again. Replacing the file and doing a force re-check only placed a null character at the end of the file, and the torrent client didn't see it as being complete.

I recommend deleting this broken torrent. If you need the file, go to uloz.to and search."
