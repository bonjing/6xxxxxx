Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the little know "Bells" album by Sonny Moore. Although never officially released, I saw a youtube video that said Sonny gave copies of Bells away when he first started to tour (the youtube dude's copy just so happened to be in an envelope with a hand-drawn design, along with 2 Sonny pins) I also read another post somewhere that said Unknown I and Unknown II are actually title-less on the Bells CD. Enjoy! :]
