Dash 8 Q 300 product line

The Dash 8 Q 300 product line is our flagship line, serving the general public, as well as the airlines, operating this airplane with an outstanding procedural simulation of the Dash 8 Q 300 aircraft since November 2001.

The product line consists of several editions, differentiating in both cost and functionality.

Every edition includes these standard features

    Every edition includes a close to 100% correct airplane system simulation
    Every aircraft panel, used for the normal operation with almost every possible switch simulated.
    Advanced FMC with the waypoint and terminal database, holding function, Direct To and PVOR  maneuvers .
    Data converter for the Navigraph nav data provider to update the FMC databases with the actual nav data cycles.
    Virtual cockpit with animated handles and wipers.
    Animated prop blades angle in both standing and running modes
    6 liveries - Tyrolean Airways, Air Nostrum, Austrian Airlines, Liat, Lufthansa, British Airways
    Pax loader application which allows loading the plane in every possible way, and provides the feature to move  the Center of Gravity as desired by the user.
     (first time in MSFS) Remote Control Station (REMCL),  provides the monitoring of every aircraft system and allows the selected failures (the number of allowed failures are edition dependant).
    (first time in MSFS) Simulated in a custom way, DirectX based sound engine, which does the close to real sound simulation for the propellers, engines and the environment.
    (first time in MSFS) Simulated in a custom way Powerplant logic, that utilizes our custom made prop blades pitch control algorithm, and gives the close to the real - engine indications, powerplant (engines and propellers) behavior and performance
    Close to real air dynamics and airplane performance, tested thoughtfully by a team, consisting mostly of the airline pilots and Dash 8 technicians.
    The real weather radar, utilizing the fs2004 NWI (New Weather Interface) and creating an accurate representation of the weather within the desired range,  from both World Real Weather,  fs2004/FSX own weather or any weather controlling addons.
    Fully integrated with SquawkBox 3.0 including the Transponder modes, COMs and Audio panel.
     Entertainment and announcements module with built in MP3 player and recorded cabin announcements.
    The through documentation consisting of 70 pages describing the function of every airplane system as well as the practical notes on usage. The quick start guide is also included to simplify the initial training.
    Discussion board and email support by our support team.


is our entry edition, for the general public, wishing to be introduced to the world of the turboprop airplanes, and not requiring the advanced product features, such as the most  system failures, flight data recording playback or the network instructor station.  This edition includes all the standard features, described above plus the electrical failure function of the remote control station.
