Blood Syndicate complete. Published under DC's Milestone imprint, this story follows the surviving gang members as they merge into a new gang, the Blood Syndicate, after the Big Bang (which created Static as well as most of the heroes and villains of the Milestone universe) and as they transitions into local heroes but remain different from the other heroes.  
Former member Holocaust has appeared in the DC multiverse facing off against Static (and possibly the teen titans around issues 80, 81. Anyone have confirmation?) and is rumored to be showing up in the new reboot. Pretty cool series check it out.
