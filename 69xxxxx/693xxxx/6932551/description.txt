It took a bit to find information about this band. The Black Velvet Band is an Irish quartet led by singer/songwriter/guitarist Kieran Kennedy, also featuring singer Maria Doyle, bassist Shay Fitzgerald, and drummer/vocalist Dave Horner. 

The music is well mastered and has a light Indie music sound you will find available today but this album was released in 1992. I tried to find another band to compare this music to but found it hard to bring to mind something to offer in this review.
