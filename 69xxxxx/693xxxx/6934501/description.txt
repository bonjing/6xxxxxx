This torrent contains the database on information present in all contact reports upto the 501st contact with Plejaren..Also includes information from FIGU Bulletins and Special Bulletins...

Note: The order of headings in index and their corresponding information does not follow..so please use search function.

I have used some shortcuts in 'Contact Reports'..
S - Semjase
P - Ptaah
Q - Quetzal
B - Billy
M - Menara

Also i made some mistakes where the sentence changes abruptly from 1st person into third person framework...When i was making this database, i didnt intend to share, that's why many mistakes...please do not mind it..
