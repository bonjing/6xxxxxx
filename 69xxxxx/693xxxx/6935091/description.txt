 PLOT: A transport ship containing 40 passengers heading to other worlds  
       for, among other reasons, settling, New Mecca, and for one         
       passenger, Riddick, another cell.                                  
       The ship encounters a tiny meteor storm and crash lands on a       
       barren planet with only 1/4 of its complement surviving.           
       Survival is tough with Riddick on the loose and no water in sight. 
       However, come nightfall, they have even more to fear...
