As an addendum: Once I've seeded enough, I usually revert to seeding IPv6 only.

You probably have noticed, that the media industry is a decade or so behind in terms of technological developement. They have barely left DC++ yet.

It's probably rather safe to assume that it will take at least five years before they can handle IPv6, so anyone seeding IPv6-only will be safe for years ahead.

With uTorrent all you have to do, to use only IPv6, is creating a file 'ipfilter.dat' with this one line:

000.000.000.000 - 255.255.255.255 , 000 , IPv4

... and then save it in (for Windows users)  

\Documents and Settings\(your name)\Application Data\uTorrent\"
