The remastered reissue of the blueprint of Peachtree Industrial, Severed. Expanded with tracks from the 2002-2005 era and mastered by Randy Garcia.

Originally a six-track EP released digitally in 2004, Severed represents an important chapter in the musical echelon of TRICIL. The genesis of the â€œPeachtree Industrialâ€ sound, Severed was where I found my musical voice in dirty, funky beats and nostalgic melodies. Newly remastered by the venerable Randy Garcia, this collection represents the pre-Esoteric Drift chapter of TRICIL.
