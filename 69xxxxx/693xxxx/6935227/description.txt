Perspectives: Looking for Lowry
Perspectives: A brand new documentary series comes to ITV1, bringing together powerful stories and a unique insight into various subjects from a range of individual voices.
Ian McKellen joins Noel Gallagher and a host of acquaintances, friends and admirers of acclaimed painter LS Lowry to uncover the man behind the myth. Just who was Lowry? He's now the much-loved son of the Industrial North, but he wasn't discovered until he was 52. Looking deeper into his past we find a man who had been under his mother's thumb for decades - she didn't like him to paint. McKellen takes us on a journey to the places that formed Lowry's life and vision, the places rendered so vividly in his raw and individual style. The cinematography of Looking for Lowry reflects this unique and emotional vision of the world.
