I had a helluva time finding this game. Seems to be somewhat of a rare gem for the Xbox 360. So now that I\\\'ve found it, I want to make it available to other strategy/war/rpg fans like me.

It\\\'s a very good (but tough) Turn Based strategy game. It\\\'s graphics are not up to par with newer games, but it\\\'s got a great story and fantastic strategy elements!

If you enjoy games like Final Fantasy Tactics, Vandal Hearts series, Fire Emblems, X-com, Advance wars, or just a tactical WWII Rpg, you will love this game.

I will be seeding for about 8 hours a day, and a bit longer on weekends.
