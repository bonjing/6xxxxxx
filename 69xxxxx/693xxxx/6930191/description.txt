    Plot Summary  - -  -
                 

    Dr.  Samantha  Goodman,  an  attractive psychiatrist in her thirties, 
    joins  her  husband and sister for a weekend at a winter cottage when 
    an  unexpected guest arrives. Harlan Pyne, a violent sexual offender, 
    is  convinced  that  Samantha  conducted unethical experiments on him 
    while  she  was  his  doctor. With the assistance of his troubled yet 
    eager  protege,  Harlan forces Samantha and her family to participate 
    in  a series of nightmarish games. On this night of terror, escape is 
    not  an  option,  truth  guarantees  nothing,  and  revenge  will not 
    necessarily be sweet.
