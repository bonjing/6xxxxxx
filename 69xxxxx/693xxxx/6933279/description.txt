"The Shrink, The Dare, Her Date and 
                                 Her Brother"

Dave has an odd reaction when his shrink 
starts dating Penny. Meanwhile, Jane and Max 
fight over ownership of a sweater and end up 
in another one of their strange competitions; 
whoever is "less vain" gets to keep the 
sweater, and the challenge is to see who can 
wear a horribly unflattering outfit the 
longest. And Jane urges Brad and Alex to try 
and "bond," but it's awkward -- until they 
discover their mutual love of romantic 
comedies.

Evolve...or die.

Enjoy :)
