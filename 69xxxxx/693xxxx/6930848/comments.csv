TOP uploading music torrents to the wrong category.

Music torrents ought to be uploaded to Audio > Music

Unless:

1. They contain TXT or URL files, in which case you should upload them to Audio > Other

2. They contain FLAC format audio files, in which case you should upload them to Audio > FLAC"
