Verily, all praise is due to Allah, we praise Him and we seek His Aid and we ask His Forgiveness and we seek refuge with Allah from the wickedness of ourselves and the evil of our deeds. Whomsoever Allah guides, there is none can misguide him and whomsoever Allah sends astray, there is none can guide him. And I testify that none is worthy of worship except Allah, Alone, without partners and I testify that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger.
