 Album Info..: 
 
 Foo Fighters: Dave Grohl (vocals, guitar, drums); Taylor Hawkins (vocals, drums); 
 Chris Shiflett (guitar); Nate Mendel (bass instrument). Additional personnel: Norah Jones (vocals, piano); Josh Homme, Joe Beebe (guitar); John Paul Jones (mandolin, piano); Petra Haden (violin); Danny Clinch (harmonica); Rami Jaffe (keyboards); Nick Raskulinecz (double bass, bass guitar). Foo Fighters continue to redefine the parameters of the post-grunge rock world with their fifth album, IN YOUR HONOR. Dave Grohl and company flesh out their impressive canon with a two-CD set--the first disc plugged-in and packed with screaming guitars and vocals, while the second disc showcases the band's more acoustic and ethereal side. The loud-soft-loud dynamic approach of Grohl's former band for resonates quite a bit through Disc One. "Free Me" turns the distortion down briefly before pile-driver rhythms and Grohl's relentless guitar riffs dovetail smoothly into quirky-yet-effective time changes. Reflecting the personal tumult of recent years are the anthemic "Resolve" and the indignant kiss-off "The Last Song," with its AC/DC-flavored attitude and stomping cadence. Disc Two's mellower offerings are no less intriguing, showing the band's stylistic range.  "Another Round," with its mix of harmonium, harp, and mandolin could easily be mistaken for a Counting Crows outtake, and the dueling acoustic guitars on "Razor" are more Leo Kottke than Kyuss. IN YOUR HONOR shows that a hard-edged musical attack and deft songwriting need not be mutually exclusive
