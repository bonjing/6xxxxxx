This is a high-impact free-form progressive jazz extravaganza brought to us by
three hard-hitting heavyweights of the genre. No doubt, this trio comes at you
from all angles, to include avant world-music tinged passages to asymmetrical
swing vamps, often accelerated by drummer Nasheet Waitâ€™s pulsating ride cymbal
strokes. Tenor/soprano saxophonist Tony Malaby pronounces moments of angst and
terror while bass great William Parker punches out the sinewy discourses via
fluid lines and gruff, arco passages.

Itâ€™s a mighty force of three that lays it all out within various rhythmic
matrixes. With jangling drums, pounding accents and a great deal of
counterpoint, the band also delves into nip and tuck style motifs. They instill
a sense of perpetual movement throughout. And itâ€™s the largely, budding
frameworks that often serve as the foundation for Malabyâ€™s spiraling sax lines.
For example, on â€œFloating Head,â€ the rhythm section executes a cascading Latin
vamp, while subsequently slamming matters into overdrive. In effect, sparks are
flying everywhere.

The band tones it down and alternates the flow in numerous segments, but the
preponderance of this set is designed with fortitude and power. To that end,
the musicians integrate numerous emotive aspects that shine glisteningly through
the art of intuitively generated improvisation. Theyâ€™re at the top of their
game here.
