Yes, U can, U have to download & install  3DSubtitler ( here: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Video/Other-VIDEO-Tools/3D-Subtitler.shtml ), then just download subs in any language U want ( note, that they MUST have a .srt extension ), convert them with it and that's it ;)
Works perfect, tested on PC & LG 3D TV
Cheers"
