Release Description

In this gritty and realistic drama, four queer hipster friends in East London find their lives changed one fateful drug and alcohol-fueled night. Liza and girlfriend Sally play in an indie rock band and have an intense and dysfunctional relationship. Their guy pals are also floundering: Vin works as a hustler, while Jamie looks to find stability in a boyfriend. Writer/director Kanchi Wichmann takes an unflinching and artistic look at the complex and often not so pretty terrain of human relationships.
