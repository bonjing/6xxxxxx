Description:
The Tone Rebellion is a real-time strategy game (RTS) with light RPG and puzzle-solving elements. The player must first choose the Floater tribe he/she desires to control - Tarks, Zygons, Cepheans, or Dyla. Each tribe starts on a different island, and has different affinities to the realm types encountered in the game: Physical, Supernatural, Ethereal, and Natural. The player begins with a very small unit of Floaters around a tribal center. By harvesting Tone, the player can build new structures, unique to each race, increasing the number of units. The goal is to build a bridge to another island, eventually uniting all of them in the struggle against the Leviathan.
