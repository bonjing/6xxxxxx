Fearne Cotton and Reggie Yates make merry and celebrate Christmas day with a special
festive edition of Top of the Pops with the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me of UK talent, but who
will win the coveted crown of 2011 Christmas Number 1 ?

With two Number 1 hits in his back pocket Elliot Gleave better known as Example gets
the party started. Hackney rapper Professor Green and the lady with the voice Emeli
Sande perform one of the songs of the year Read All About It and man of the year,
20-year-old Ed Sheeran performs his thoughtful hit The A Team. Platinum-selling Brit
winner Will Young offers up a track from his recent number 1 album - Echoes. Essex boy
and cheeky chappy Olly Murs is joined by Brighton boys Rizzle Kicks to perform his
summer smash hit and Rizzle Kicks also entertain us with their own catchy radio anthem
Down with the Trumpets.

Glamorous number 1 artist Pixie Lott also joins in the party and indie folk idols Noah
and the Whale perform a song from their top ten album Last Night on Earth.

Festival indie heroes The Vaccines bring their retro flavoured rock in roll to the Top
of the Pops Christmas party and British/Irish boy band The Wanted keep the celebration
of British music swinging along. Also, hot off the back of the final is this years X
Factor champion.

Plus a special performance from the lady of the year Adele from her recent
Royal Albert Hall concert and MOBO award-winner Jessie J.

All in all, Top of the Pops Christmas promises the finest and most festive celebration
of the very best of British pop talent.
