Hatsu Basho -Day 01- 2012 January
Fukuoka - Day 01 2012

Languages : English and Japanese
Day 01 of the Hatsu Sumo Basho from the RyÅgoku Kokugikan in Tokyo, Japan.  Of course NHK has interrupted the opening of the broadcast with political blah blah (edited out â€“ but still has ruined the opening!)  Here is, what it is!
 The *.AVI recording was made from digital cable through S-cable, then reprocessed to 720x480 Xvid *.AVI from its original *.MPG format.  The *.AVI has both English and Japanese.  It is not HD.
