This torrent includes the official podcast mp3s released on the www.glennbeck.com website for the radio show. It includes the "4th Hour" with Pat & Stu which is available only to subscribers (ie. it is not part of the regular radio broadcast).

Glenn apparently threw his back out on set Monday, so today is actually 4 hours of Pat & Stu filling in.
