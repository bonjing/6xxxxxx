I couldn't be bothered to download the whole torrent to check since it's just a copy of a copy of a copy so I'd be wasting my time.
Would the uploader please post these necessary details so we don't get mislead? Things like the pixel ratio, if the subs are soft/hard-coded, if it's the same version as something that's already been uploaded or if and/or how you've changed it.
