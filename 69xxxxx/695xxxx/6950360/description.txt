Description
This is the official XDA-Developers Premium Android App!
By popular request, we present to you the Premium version of the official XDA-Developers Android app! This app lets you access the world-famous XDA forums, plus reply to threads, add new ones, manage your PMs, and more!
What's makes the Premium app different than the original XDA app?
+ No annoying ads!
+ Ability to collapse top bar to maximize screen real estate
+ Access to Legacy forums
+ Ability to add forum shortcuts to your Android homescreen for super quick access to your favorites
+ Custom XDA color scheme (changeable to default through Settings)
+ Choose whether to land on first post, last post, or first unread post within a given thread
+ Bug fixes
Please note: XDA Premium works best over WiFi or high speed cellular data. It will be very slow over EDGE. The first load might take the longest even if you're on WiFi.
