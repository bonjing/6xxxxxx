Can a healthy diet prevent Osteoporosis or make a difference in the health of patients whom already have developed the disease?
In a word, yes.
An estimation of 44 million Americans are at risk for Osteoporosis today. The disease eventually affects 1 out of every 2 women and 1 out of every 5 men, which is expected to double in the next 25 years.

Most physicians encourage not only an active lifestyle, but also a balanced diet to help strengthen bones and reduce the risk of osteoporosis. Indeed, people with Osteoporosis often report considerable improvement in their well-being after changing their eating habits.

Cooking Well: Osteoporosis features over 100 recipes designed to improve daily functioning and aid in the treatment of this disease.

The book also features:
An overview on how to live with osteoporosis
A list of foods to avoid
A meal diary and checklist to track your progress

All recipes and meals in the "Cooking Well" series have been specially created by renowned health and diet expert, Chef Marie-Annick Courtier, and Cooking Well: Osteoporosis is an invaluable resource for your nutritional healing.
