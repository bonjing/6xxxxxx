ReleaseNotes:

REO Speedwagon was one of the classic arena rock/pop bands from the late 1970's to 1980's. Along with Styx, Journey, and Loverboy, REO Speedwagon formed the backbone of this period of music where huge album sales and concert gross defined one of the wildest expansions of music in history.
