I bet it's because you're clicking on the magnet link instead of the normal 'get torrentfile' link.  It's been happening to me all day.  I think thePirateBay swapped the places of the magnet link and torrent link.  I automatically and instinctively go to click that first link on the left (which is now the magnet link).  If you click on the magnet link, if you're using uTorrent, you will probably not see any file show up in the open with/download window.  If you click download or o.k....or whatever it is, the file should still show up in your active torrents list.  So, you can just ignore the blank download box and hit continue, or get used to clicking on the ""get torrentfile"" link on the right side.  (unless of course, this has nothing to do with your problem at all :)"
