~~~~BIOGRAPHY~~~~
-----------------

Founded in 2009, EarlyRise set out on a unique journey, mixing the poetic side of music with the edgier side of rock.

EarlyRise was founded by Orly Lari (vocals, piano) and Raz Klinghoffer (guitar player and producer), who combined their different styles and started writing music together. They were later joined by Itamar Goldwasser (Drums) and Dima Grossman (Bass) and finally emerged with their debut album \\\\\\\"What if\\\\\\\" which was self released in May 2011.

The album explores many levels of experience and emotion, making each song unique, with its own style and point of view.

Like different facets of a complex personality, What If gives us a first glimpse of EarlyRise, unfolding before us with each song.

First Torrent released by me, so please leave a comment and let me know how I did.

All songs above broadcast quality (above 128kbs). This is the complete \\\\\\\"What If\\\\\\\" album released by this small band last year. I have not found another torrent for it, so here it is in superb quality. Hopefully people will enjoy there music. They are a small band that deserve to be enjoyed.
