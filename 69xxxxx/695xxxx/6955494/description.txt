Waking up is not an easy thing for you? You have never found the alarm clock you needed?

- Why not try WakeVoice!

* WakeVoice can overcome the negative aspect associated to regular alarm clocks, making your morning funnier and less difficult.

* The idea is simple: when the alarm rings, you just have to talk to WakeVoice to stop the alarm or activate the reminder.


- But that's not all!

* Once the ringing stopped, it's your phone's turn to talk to you.

* Customizable messages, weather of the day, news of your choice (RSS)... choose what you want to hear.

* Add to that all the settings imaginable on a clock (programming various alarms over several days, setting names, volume, times...) and you get WakeVoice, the most innovative alarm clock that you can find on the Android market.

* So now, with WakeVoice, you won't be angry anymore when you'll be waking up :)


Warning: don't force app2sd with WakeVoice. It's not recommended by Google for an alarm clock app. Furthermore, you'll have issues with Android Market updates.


Enjoy and Please Seed :)
