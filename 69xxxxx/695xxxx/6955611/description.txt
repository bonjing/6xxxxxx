=============================

The X-Men anime is written by famed English comic book writer/creator Warren Ellis, and borrows story elements from famed Scottish comic book writer Grant Morrisonâ€™s early 2000s story arch for New X-Men, as well as Joss Whedonâ€™s mid-2000s run on Astonishing X-Men.

01 "The Return - Joining Forces"
"The Return - ShÅ«ketsu" (The Return - é›†çµ)  April 1, 2011 October 21, 2011 

When Jean "Phoenix" Grey's mind is taken control of by Mastermind and the Inner Circle, she sacrifices herself to protect the world. A year has passed since Jean's death, and the X-Men have since disbanded and the Xavier Institute closed. When Professor X receives word that a mutant named Hisako Ichiki has been kidnapped, he sends out a call to Storm, Wolverine and Beast. After being informed they are to fly to the TÅhoku region of Japan, where Xavier's psychic abilities cannot seem to reach, Wolverine and Storm go to talk to Cyclops, who has been brooding since Jean's death, in order to convince him to join them.
  
02 "U-Men - Mutant Hunting"
"U-Men - MyÅ«tanto Gari" (U-Men - ãƒŸãƒ¥ãƒ¼ã‚¿ãƒ³ãƒˆæŽ¢ã‚Š)  April 8, 2011 October 28, 2011 

The X-Men arrive in TÅhoku and talk with Hisako's parents concerning her disappearance, learning that several other mutants have gone missing over the past few years. As the X-Men suspect this to be the work of the U-Men, a group of humans that harvest mutant organs in order to produce counter measures against mutants, they soon learn yet another mutant boy has gone missing. As they split up to investigate, Beast realises the call was bait to lure them into a trap, and they are soon attacked by the U-Men's robots. After defeating the robots, the X-Men regroup and head to an abandoned hospital which is thought to be the U-Men's base. There, they find the missing boy being pumped with chemicals and transform into a huge monster. Despite learning his body is beyond biological repair, Cyclops is reluctant to fight against him, but is eventually forced to kill him in order to save his allies. Before passing away, the boy asks the X-Men to save the others. As they move on, they discover a laboratory where Hisako is being kept, along with Emma Frost who Cyclops remembers being the woman he saw behind Jean during his battle with Phoenix.  

03 "Armor - Awakening"
"Armor - Kakusei" (Armor - è¦šé†’)  April 15, 2011 November 4, 2011 

With Wolverine and Cyclops holding back their urges to kill Emma, the X-Men release Hisako and Emma, the latter of which denies having any part in that battle a year ago, since she had apparently already left the Inner Circle by then. As Hisako awakens, it is revealed that Emma was hired to be her tutor, since the Xavier Institute had ceased activity, and was captured when she went to Japan to search for Hisako. After defeating a group of cyborgs, the X-Men arrive at an operating room, where they are confronted by U-Men member Kick (who uses the data collected on the X-Men to gain an advantage). As he targets Emma, Hisako's mutant powers awaken, using her mind's energy to create a powerful armor which defeats Kick. However, her powers soon go out of control, but Emma manages to calm her down. As the other U-Men escape, the X-Men manage to free the other children. After making contact with Professor X, Kick returns and launches an attack at Hisako, forcing Emma to rush to protect her.
  
04 "Transformation - Secondary Mutation"
"Transformation - Niji Henshitsu" (Transformation - äºŒæ¬¡å¤‰è³ª)  April 22, 2011 November 11, 2011 

Emma's desire to protect Hisako causes her to develop a secondary mutation protecting them from the attack, while the other X-Men kill Kick. After Hisako is reunited with her parents, she and Emma agree to go to the Xavier Institute to receive a vaccine to prevent 'Damon-Hall Syndrome' in secondary mutations. Beast announces that he wants to take Emma back to New York to study her secondary mutation. After much debate, Cyclops gives into the groups wishes. En route back to New York, the Blackbird is attacked by a mutant suffering from DHS which Wolverine defeats. Emma recognises him as a student from the Inner Circle's preparatory school. Upon returning to the Institute, Beast tries to investigate the boy's condition, but he shrivels up and dies. Beast concludes that the cause of his secondary mutation was not due to experimentation but some other stimulus. As Beast performs checks on Emma, Xavier reveals Cerebro is still being blocked from TÅhoku. With Emma's secondary mutation on the same level as the boy, though hers is deemed harmless, Xavier suspects something is still going on in TÅhoku which is causing these mutations. 
 
05 "Power - Unity"
"Power - Kessoku" (Power - çµæŸ)  May 6, 2011 November 18, 2011
 
As Hisako starts training to use her powers, she finds herself at odds with Cyclops who still does not trust Emma and shows a dislike to Xavier recruiting her as part of the X-Men. As the other X-Men discuss the possibility of Mastermind having a hand in Jean's death, Cyclops pits Hisako in a real battle against him, pushing her to go berserk with her powers so she can take control of it. Noticing Hisako lacking self-confidence, Emma agrees to have Xavier read her mind, revealing her childhood and her affiliation with the Inner Circle and her reason for leaving, also proving she was not involved with the battle with Jean. As a result, Cyclops apologises to Emma while Hisako strives to learn from her mistakes. As the X-Men prepare to leave for Tohoku with the vaccines, Emma questions Xavier about a woman named Yui Sasaki which she saw when their minds were linked.  

06 "Conflict - Contested"
"Conflict - Gekisen" (Conflict-æ¿€æˆ¦)  May 13, 2011 November 25, 2011 

As the X-Men arrive back in Tohoku, Hisako's parents inform them of strange things that happened while they were away. As Beast administers the vaccine to various mutants, some of which have already started going through secondary mutation, the other X-Men investigate the abnormalities, including a strange volcanic area by the river and a twisted metal bridge. As the X-Men fly towards the centre of the area in which mutants have been affected by secondary mutation, Emma starts hearing a painful noise and the Blackbird is shot down. Upon landing, the X-Men witness the Blackbird being attacked by living snow before they are attacked by Sublime who uses a robotic armor that uses their powers against them. However, Beast manages to find its weakpoint, allowing the others to defeat him. They spot he has a mutant detection device before Sublime self-destructs himself. As a snowstorm kicks in, the X-Men finds shelter in a lodge owned by Yui Sasaki, the woman Xavier mentioned, who was the headmaster of a mutant institute Hisako went to when she was little.  

07 "Betrayal - Shock"
"Betrayal - ShÅgeki" (Betrayal-è¡æ’ƒ)  May 20, 2011 December 2, 2011 

As the X-Men talk to Yui, Emma suspects she may be lying about her relation to Xavier. The X-Men also meet Yui's research assistants Riko Nirasaki, KÅichi Kaga, and Jun Sanada. Yui later contacts Xavier, revealing he has a son named Takeo that had died. As Wolverine, Storm and Beast investigate the phenomenon which ensnared their Blackbird, they are confronted by Inner Circle agents Rat and Marsh. After a brief battle, they escape upon setting off an avalanche. As Hisako goes to find Yui concerning some irritation on her right hand, Emma asks to dive into Cyclops' mind in order to quell his hesitation. Meanwhile, Yui is mysteriously attacked.  

08 "Lost - Signs"
"Lost - YochÅ" (Lost-äºˆå…†)  May 27, 2011 December 9, 2011 

The X-Men rush to Yui's aid, as she is attacked by a giant spider-like monster. Upon defeating the monster, they are shocked to discover that it reverts back to Riko Nirasaki who was afflicted by Damon-Hall Syndrome. KÅichi Kaga flees in terror. Beast vaccinates Riko while continuing to interrogate Yui, continuing to build suspicions that she is withholding information. Meanwhile, Kaga transforms into a monster due to Damon Hall Syndrome and attacks the X-Men, but is defeated. As she reverts from diamond form, Emma catches a glace of Jun Sanada and sees his image flicker to that of Mastermind, and he vanishes. After Kaga is vaccinated, Cyclops and Wolverine confront her about their discovery of a secret medication she had supplied Riko and Kaga with demanding an explanation. Meanwhile, Xavier flies the Blackbird to Tohoku, reflecting on his and Yui's long history of work for mutant children and their intense and abruptly ended romance, but suddenly finds himself and the ship trapped in a dimensional rift over Tohoku. 
 
09 "Revelations - From Behind the Scenes"
"Revelations - An'yakusha" (Revelations-æš—èºè€…)  June 3, 2011 December 16, 2011 

Yui reveals that the medication is experimental and designed to suppress mutant powers from awakening. However, it is becoming less and less effective, esulting in both Riko and Kaga's transformations. Separately, Emma follows Jun to the depths of the laboratory and confronts him as his true persona: Mastermind, leader of the Inner Circle. He reveals that the heart of the laboratory contains a power he wishes to use to rule humanity and that he was the one who projected the image of Emma to Cyclops one year ago, an attempt to keep the X-Men from accepting her into their ranks after she defected from the Inner Circle. The two fight, with Emma's diamond form protecting her from Mastermind's psychic attacks. The X-Men arrive, but must deal with Marsh and Rat as Mastermind continues toward the power source. Meanwhile, Xavier realizes the dimensional rift is caused by an unknown psychic assailant and prepares to fight it to escape. 
 
10 "Countdown - Truth"
"Countdown - Shinjitsu" (Countdown-çœŸå®Ÿ)  June 10, 2011 December 23, 2011 

The X-Men menage to defeat Rat, but Mastermind and Marsh escape. As they head inward, they discover a machine for tracking mutants, similar to Cerebro. When Riko and KÅichi recover and catch up, Yui is forced to admit that she built the mutant tracker for the U-Men because her medication is made from mutant organs and necessary to protect this mysterious power source, and the U-Men could supply them for her. The X-Men are horrified and Beast surmises that the medicine is weakening and this power source is leaking from the lab, causing the accelerated Damon-Hall Syndrome in mutants living near Tohoku. Entering the center, they discover Mastermind next to a near-comatose young man who Yui reveals to be Takeo (the still-living son of her and Charles). Mastermind reveals that Yui allied with the U-Men to save her son, an Omega-class telepath with the uncontrollable power to warp reality, which Mastermind wishes to use to change reality to one with mutants in power. He also reveals that he initiated the U-Men into the Inner Circle to get closer to Takeo, supporting the U-Men this entire time. In disguise as Jun, he purposefully withheld power suppressants from Takeo for the past three months and gradually destroyed his mind with telepathy, leaving him ripe for use. The Inner Circle's White Bishop Neuron appears and kills Riko and KÅichi by overloading their sensory input. He then subdues Logan and Beast while Mastermind causes Takeo to unleash his powers. Meanwhile in the dimensional rift, Charles is able to break free after hearing Jean Grey's voice encouraging him not to give up.  

11 "Revenge - End"
"Revenge - ShÅ«matsu" (Revenge-çµ‚æœ«)  June 17, 2011 December 30, 2011 

Charles breaks free from the dimensional rift and heads toward Yui's lab, as Jean's voice encourages him to help his students and all of mankind from the impending danger. Meanwhile, Beast and Logan are at Neuron's mercy, while Marsh restrains Emma, Yui, and Hisako. Hisako remembers that Takeo was her childhood friend at the mutant school, but she was accidentally injured when his powers manifested (resulting in the pain in her hand). Takeo's guilt caused him to erase himself from everyone's memories. Yui shut down the school to care for him and seek a means to subdue his powers. Meanwhile, Logan devises a plan to have Beast overload his sensory input until he goes into a berserker rage where he feels no pain, neutralizing Nueron's powers. Wolverine kills Neuron and regains his senses. Hisako and Cyclops are able to defeat Marsh, but Mastermind entraps Cyclops in a nightmarish illusion about his inability to kill Dark Phoenix. However, he manages to break free of the illusion due to the intervention of Jean Grey, who helps him realize that his true regret was his inability to free her of her suffering as Dark Phoenix by killing her when she begged him to. The X-Men face Mastermind, but he is killed by Takeo as his powers run out of control and Takeo transforms into a colossal energy being capable of destroying the world and shattering reality. Professor X arrives from the Blackbird in time to confront his son alongside the X-Men.  

12 "Destiny - Bond"
"Destiny - Kizuna" (Destiny-çµ†)  June 24, 2011 January 6, 2012 

On the brink of world destruction, Charles reaches out to all the X-Men (consisting of Archangel, Colossus, Nightcrawler, and Rogue) other mutants (consisting of Captain Britain and Deadpool) and Iron Man around the world asking them to support one another and protect humanity. Learning that Takeo hates him for being born into a world where his powers cause him so much suffering, Charles blames himself for causing Takeo pain. The X-Men try to attack Takeo, but are easily defeated. Charles then prepares to destroy Takeo's mind and kill him, fully intending to die along with his son. Jean's presence manages to revive the X-Men and give them courage to fight on as she states that mutants and humans are working together in this crisis. Hisako recalls her friendly past with Takeo and insists that Takeo is a good person who can be saved. Her feelings cause her armor to generate a brilliant light, reaching Takeo and bringing him back to his senses. He and Charles are able to reconcile, and Takeo's body is destroyed, but not before he is able to reassure Yui and Charles that he is alright. The X-Men stand committed to standing together against future threats to human and mutant peace. Cyclops gives Jean's necklace to Hisako as a symbol that he has accepted her as a full-fledged teammate he can trust, as he and Emma begin a friendly relationship. In a post-credit scene, it is revealed that Magneto's plastic prison has been destroyed and he has escaped with the teaser line saying "The Battle of the X-Men continues..."
