"Dance Like Nobody's Watching"

As everyone returns from holiday break,
 NBC's new talent competition, 
"America's Kidz Got Singing", is a hit, 
but Jenna's role as the judge everyone 
loves to hate causes Jack to question 
the show's family value. Much to his 
chagrin, Tracy's usual antics fail to 
aggravate Liz, while Kenneth takes the 
day off to do his dream chores as he 
awaits the Rapture.

18/Slower
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
