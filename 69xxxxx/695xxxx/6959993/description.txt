 Poverty forces little Lilkee, originally     
 from Nainital, to become a domestic help     
 for architect Bela in Mumbai. She has        
 difficulty in adjusting to city life. To     
 add insult to injury she is humiliated       
 by a gang of four girls from a rich family.  
 Later, when the girls come to know of her    
 plight, they not only befriend Lilkee but    
 try to raise money to help her go back to    
 Nainital. But full of self respect, Lilkee   
 politely refuses. One day, the girls ask     
 her to accompany them to the sea during      
 school hours. Lilkee informs her employer    
 but the other girls donâ€™t tell their parents.
 When the children donâ€™t return for a long    
 time, the parents get worried. After being   
 found, they scold their girls but Lilkeeâ€™s   
 sense of responsibility wins over Bela who   
 admits her to a school.
