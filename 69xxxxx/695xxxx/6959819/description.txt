Providing structured yet adaptable models of project success within an organization, A Standard for Enterprise Project Management explains each of the basic elements needed for project success and integrates them into a balanced life-cycle continuum. It also supplies an inventory of practical policies, procedures, techniques, and templates for consistent management of projects.

The book first discusses project authorization and initiation, followed by analysis and planning. It then covers execution, control, and closure. Each phase contains an explanation and an illustration of how to optimize success. Throughout the text, the author refers to numerous appendices that constitute both blank and completed templates. He provides details on how to use these tools, with an emphasis on balancing the benefits of standardization and the need for flexibility.

   3. Project management competency development grid that outlines a program for developing key skills among project managers within an organization
   4. Traceability matrix that illustrates how various levels of requirements and final solutions are interrelated 

This book offers a painless guide to quickly getting business initiatives out of the clouds and onto the ground. Blending the rigor and discipline of project management with the thoroughness of business analysis, it shows how to successfully build, complement, and enhance project management and business analysis in any organization.
