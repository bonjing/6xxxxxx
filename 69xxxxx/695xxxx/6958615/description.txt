Welcome  to the Wrecking Ball  was Grace Slick"s second solo album 
after she quit Jefferson Starship , although she would shortly 
return to the band to record one more album.

After the mostly disappointing "Dreams" in 1980, this album is pretty good 
overall if you like music from the period. Grace had the opportunity to again 
sing the hard-rock that she is best known for from when she was lead singer of Jefferson Airplane in the 1960s and early 1970s.

I think this is better than the Jefferson Airplane reunion album that 
Grace chose to end her music career with in the late 1980s
