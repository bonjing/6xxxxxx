"Politically Inept, With Homer Simpson"

Homer lands his own political talk show after a video
featuring his impassioned rant on poor treatment at the airport goes viral.

As his talk show quickly gains popularity nationwide,
Homer becomes the spokesperson for the Gravy Movement
and the voice of Americas newest political party.
But when ill-informed Homer is asked to select the next
Republican nominee for President and officially endorses
right-wing rock star Ted Nugent (guest voicing as himself),
Marge and Lisa worry that Homers opinion and influence
might be more powerful than he realizes

18/Slower
Evolve...or die.

Enjoy :)
