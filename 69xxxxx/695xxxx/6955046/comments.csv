Havn't downloaded this one yet... but seems you didn;t like the audio.  You will note that in the title, as well as the term DVDRip, is also the term ""R5"".
If the DVD does not contain an English-language audio track, the R5 video is synced to a previously released English audio track. Then a LiNE tag is added.  This means that the sound often is not as good as DVD-Rips.
No point moaning about audio if the official DVD has not been released in the first place, and you notice R5 in the title.  Avoid R5's if you're converned about audio."
ggest u wait even further.

sorry to say since u used MKV, u thought people might think ""oh its good"", but its all goin down to how u rip it before u contain it"
