Legend of the Holy Spear
When Christ was crucified 2,000 years ago a Roman guard thrust a spear in his side to see if he was still alive. In that moment a central tenet of Christian faith was realised: Jesus was dead, he was thus able to be resurrected. In that moment the spear that pierced him became a powerful holy relic. What happened to the Spear thereafter is a heady mix of myth, half truth and fact. To confuse matters further, today there are three Spears claiming to be the Holy Spear. Legend of the Holy Spear follows two investigators attempting to discover if any of them could have been present at the crucifixion. Scrutinizing each spear and closely analysing the stories and legends behind them, the film reveals astonishing clues as to their provenance.
The 45 minute film investigates into the three spears thought to have been pierced into Christ. Of the three spears, one is in Armenia. The other two are in the Vatican, Austria. The documentary traces the Armenian spear to Holy Etchmiadzin, while detailing how it got there and the adoption of Christianity in Armenia.
