          In the vein of such '80s camp classics as Motel Hell and Blood Diner, 
          Edward X. Young (Mr. Hush) and Colleen Cohan (Sea Of Dust) star as the 
          sadistic cannibalistic voodoo practicing husband and wife owners of a 
          downtrodden convenience store. When local teens begin disappearing from 
          the area it's up to a group of high school kids to play Scooby Doo and 
          find out whodunit. But when all signs point to Gerald's Hungry Shack, 
          our junior detectives realize that they're going to need a strong mind, 
          a stronger stomach and plenty of sharp weapons to combat the deadly duo 
          behind the counter - and their large green dumpster out back, overflowing 
          with dead teenagers!
