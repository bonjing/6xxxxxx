System-Locked Pre-installation (SLP) is the mechanism used by big royalty OEM computer manufacturers to factory activate pre-installed Windows operating system on branded desktop PC, laptop, notebook, netbook and nettop computer so that activation process of Windows is done transparently and automatically once end-user first starts the computer. The offline OEM-style pre-activation that bypass Windows Product Activation (WPA) is implemented to reduce the chance of annoying mass PC buyers from having to deal with activation after buying the computer. SLIC 2.1 is needed for offline activations of Windows 7 OEM SLP and Server 2008 R2 OEM SLP."
