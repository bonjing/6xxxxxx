PLEASE NOTE:
In Scenario 3, the game will lock up at the chapter 1 end screen. Save the game before defeating Goriate in the last battle of the chapter, then use the original disc to get past the crash. You can download the original Japanese image from several rom sites, including CoolRom [www.coolrom.com] -- Once you have passed this part, you will be able to remount the English translation and continue playing.
