Lost Gardens - Gatton (16 Sep 2010)

Originally produced in 1999 by Flashback Television for Channel Four.



Monty Don introduces a team of gardening experts, 
historians, landscape gardeners and designers who 
literally dig up and reconstruct the gardens and 
return them to their former glory.

Their first project in a neglected corner of a 
Capability Brown landscape, is the Japanese garden 
at Gatton Park, Surrey. It was created in 1910 by 
orchid grower Sir Jeremiah Colman, of the mustard family.

Gatton Park is a 250-acre estate near Reigate, Surrey.
The park was landscaped by Lancelot 'Capability' Brown
in the 1760s and comprises woodlands, grasslands, ponds
and a large lake. The beautiful formal gardens were
added by Sir Jeremiah Colman of mustard fame during the
time he lived there. Following the Edwardian trend in
all things Japanese, Sir Jeremiah employed Edward White
to create a Japanese garden beside the Engine Pond in
1910. Channel 4 Television in 1999 restored the
Japanese Garden for the first programme in its â€˜Lost
Gardensâ€™ series.

Lost Gardens - Shelley Hall Suffolk (23 Sep 2010)

Originally produced in 1999 by Flashback Television for Channel Four.


This week they unearth the oldest garden in the series, 
at Shelley Hall, Suffolk. It is a moated Tudor garden 
created in 1519 by Sir Philip Tilney. He was a member 
of an ancient knightly family and he became by marriage,
a first cousin of Elizabeth I.

Shelley Hall, was a large brick house built in the 
1520s by Sir Philip Tilney (d. 1533). 
He was a member of an ancient knightly family 
who gained additional status by the marriage of first 
his cousin, and then his sister, to Thomas Howard, 
Duke of Norfolk. By the first marriage he became a 
cousin of the future Elizabeth I. Only a part of Tilneyâ€™s 
house has survived, but the layout suggests a court-yard
plan house that had an axial relationship to a 
square moated site to the east. This moated site had 
been postulated as the site of an earlier house, but the 
fortunate existence of a manorial survey dated 1519-33 
clarified the set-up by describing a â€˜gardeynâ€™ on the 
east side of the manor buildings that was â€˜motyd on 
every sydeâ€™. Analysis of the survey and the present 
topography suggest that the moated site adjoined an 
area of marshland and that the approach to the house 
was contrived to present views of the garden to visitors,
but that actual access to it was limited to a favoured few.

Lost Gardens - Ambleside (07 Oct 2010)

Originally produced in 1999 by Flashback Television for Channel Four.


This week: Ambleside - Lake District

When Frances and Jim Philbrook moved into their Victorian 
country house in the heart of the Lake District, they never 
suspected the plot they'd inherited was once a much admired 
and extraordinary garden.

Why would they? Apart from some neatly trimmed lawns, most 
of their grounds were hidden beneath decades' worth of 
bramble and rhododendrons, which had knitted together so 
densely that they allowed little light to penetrate the space.

Soon after arriving, the team discovered the outline of
stone and concrete structures. After several days of
digging, steps were revealed that led down to a network
of underground tunnels and chambers held up by stone
pillars.

A deed map of 1889 and old Ordnance Survey maps of the
area showed that a glass structure had once covered
part of the hollow and the team believed this shady
spot would have been used as a fernery, a popular
feature in Victorian times.

'I was amazed at this discovery and have felt a
tremendous responsibility for it ever since - there's
only a couple of similar ferneries left in the
country,' says Jim proudly. Eller How dates from 1841
and among the early owners was Anne Jemima Clough,
sister of poet Arthur Hugh Clough. A key figure in the
suffragette movement, she opened the house as a school
for young ladies in 1852 and ran this for ten years
before becoming the first principal of Newnham College,
Cambridge. In 1862 it was bought by keen horticulturist
Henry Boyle, whose work in the garden can still be seen
today.

Lost Gardens - Perthshire (14 Oct 2010)

Originally produced in 1999 by Flashback Television for Channel Four.


This week:
The lost garden on the estate of Dunira, Near Comrie, Perthshire was owned by 
a wealthy laird, and the decayed estate now holds a tragic family secret. 
The team makes a start on restoring this 1920s Thomas Mawson-designed garden.

The Dunira Estate, about 3 miles from Comrie and 3 miles from lovely Loch
Earn in Perthshire, is a place of great beauty and tranquillity. It also 
has a most interesting history. The father of William Macbeth bought it 
in 1919 as a wedding present for his son.
Macbeth's father had made his fortune as a ship building magnate on the 
Clyde during the First World War, and in the period of high unemployment 
during the 1920s he arranged for a train load of unemployed shipyard 
workers to be decanted at the local station every day to transform the 
Estate. The 9-hole golf course, putting green and a cricket pitch which 
they created have all gone now, but the Lost Gardens and the magnificent 
Arboretum remain, just a couple of minutes walk from East Turret.

Amongst numerous other staff, 22 full-time gardeners were employed by the 
estate. 

Macbeth became morosely depressed and neglected the gardens after his only 
son and heir was still-born. 

The main house was all but totally destroyed by fire in 1947 when it burned
for 1 week. 

The eastern annex / wing of the house remained occupied but in very poor 
and decaying state until early 21st century when it was finally demolished 
as neglect made recovery unfeasible. 

NB: The estate is now in separate ownership. The gardens are overgrown but 
can be rejuvenated. The site has detailed planning consent for a large 
detached dwelling plus coach-house / garage block.

Lost Gardens - Sutton Stop (21 Oct 2010)

Originally produced in 2001 by Flashback Television for Channel Four.


This week: Sutton Stop, Coventry

A lock-keeper's garden blooms as Monty Don and his channel 4 team 
recreate a scene from the forgotten past of Coventry's waterways.

Excavation of a garden near Coventry draws a frustrating blank, but 
a lucky find in a record office plunges the team right into the heart 
of the life, and garden, of lock keeper Richard Sutton's residence in 
1807-1876.

Sutton became famous in the area for selling his produce to passing 
barges and the road leading to the lock was named Sutton Stop in his 
honour. Richard's garden was well-known to 19th-century travellers, 
but over the years became neglected and overgrown.

Lost Gardens - Penjerrick (4th Nov 2010)

Sadly the final episode.

Lost Gardens - Presenter Monty Don, garden historian Dr Toby Musgrave and landscaper 
Ann-Marie Powell discover a tropical paradise near Falmouth in Cornwall.

The lower garden at Penjerrick was created at a time when intrepid botanists were 
bringing home exotic flora from around the world. 

Besides the explosions of rhododendrons, there are minor forests of bamboo and 
rhubarb overgrown to resemble a series of Seventies parasols.

Somewhere amid the kitsch chaos is an impressive line of tree ferns, long since 
threatened by asphyxiation.

The tangled mass must be hacked aside, sensitively, in a bid to recreate the odd 
splendour of the original Penjerrick.
