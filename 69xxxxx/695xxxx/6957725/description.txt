Description 
The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby is an eight-hour stage play, presented over two performances, adapted from the Charles Dickens novel of the same name by David Edgar. Directed by John Caird and Trevor Nunn, it opened on 5 June 1980 at the Aldwych Theatre in London. The music and lyrics were from Stephen Oliver and the set design was by John Napier and Dermot Hayes. It transferred to the Plymouth Theatre on Broadway, initially opening 4 October 1981 and running until 3 January 1982. Revivals of the original production were produced in 1986 and a truncated version from 2006-2008. 

The original eight and a half hour Broadway production of "The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickelby" by Charles Dickens and adapted by David Edgar opened at the Plymouth Theater (after two successful runs in London) on October 4, 1981, and ran for 49 performances. It was performed in its entirety at 1pm on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays, with a tight one-hour meal break from 4-5pm between Parts One and Two. For those with day jobs, Thursday nights were just Part One, Friday nights were just Part Two. To cover the huge production cost of importing the show and cast, the tickets were a then unheard-of $100 for every seat (and worth every penny). It made theatrical history and won the 1982 Tony Award for the Best Play.
