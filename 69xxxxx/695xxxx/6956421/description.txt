Description:

WordPress is a free and open source piece of software that is commonly used for developing blogs. This very blog is developed on WordPress. But what many people donâ€™t realise is that you can do so much more with WordPress too and one of the simplest ways in which it can be used is to create old-style static websites.

Why would you want to? Because one of the most common ways to make money on the Internet today is to pick a popular topic and put together a small website consisting of articles related to that topic and monetize the site with ads. The traffic comes from search engines and once the site is setup, it just runs on auto-pilot.

Using WordPress to develop such as a site is very easy and as I show you in the book there are free addons to WordPress that make the whole process (especially the monetization!) super-easy.

What I have done to write the book is created my own little niche site from scratch and documented the whole process live, step-by-step with images. The resulting site is live and can be viewed as you work your way through the book.
