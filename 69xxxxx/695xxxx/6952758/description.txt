[b][color=blue]::Plot::[/color][/b]
  [b][i]Beginning immediately after the events of Halo: Reach, the game opens as the Pillar of Autumn exits 

slipspace near a mysterious ring-shaped space station, called "Halo" by the enemy of the game, the Covenant. A 

Covenant fleet attacks and heavily damages the Pillar of Autumn. Captain Keyes initiates "The Cole Protocol", a 

procedure designed to prevent the Covenant from learning the location of Earth. While Keyes prepares to land the 

ship on Halo, the Master Chief and Cortana escape via an escape pod, which crash lands on the ring. Cortana and the 

Chief are the only ones who survive the impact of the escape pod crash.
Keyes survives the Autumn's crash landing, but is captured by the Covenant. In the second and third levels of the 

game, the Master Chief and Cortana gather human survivors and rescue Captain Keyes, who is imprisoned aboard the 

Covenant ship Truth and Reconciliation. Once rescued, Keyes orders the Master Chief to beat the Covenant to Halo's 

control center and to discover its purpose. The Master Chief and Cortana travel to a map room called the Silent 

Cartographer, which leads them to the control room. There, Cortana enters the systems and, discovering something 

urgent, suddenly sends the Master Chief to find Captain Keyes while she stays behind. While searching for his 

commander, the Master Chief learns that the Covenant have accidentally released the Flood, a parasitic alien race 

capable of spreading itself by overwhelming and infesting other sentient life-forms. Keyes falls victim to them 

while looking for a cache of weapons. The release of the Flood prompts Halo's AI monitor, 343 Guilty Spark, to 

recruit the Master Chief in retrieving the Index, a device that will activate Halo and prevent the Flood from 

spreading beyond the facility.
After the Master Chief retrieves and prepares to use the Index, Cortana re-appears and warns him against the 

activation. She has discovered that Halo's defense system is a weapon designed to kill all sentient life in the 

galaxy, which the Flood requires to spread,a revelation which Guilty Spark confirms.
Faced with this information, the Master Chief and Cortana decide to destroy Halo to prevent its activation. While 

fighting the Flood, the Covenant, and Guilty Spark's Sentinels, Cortana discovers that the best way to accomplish 

this is to cause the crashed Pillar of Autumn to self-destruct.However, Captain Keyes' authorization is required to 

destroy the Autumn,forcing the Chief and Cortana to return to the now-Flood-infested Truth and Reconciliation to 

search for him. By the time that they reach Keyes, however, he has been infected beyond the point of no return by 

the Flood. The Master Chief retrieves Keyes' neural implants directly from his brain and retreats to the Autumn, 

where Cortana activates the ship's self-destruct sequence. However, 343 Guilty Spark reappears and deactivates the 

countdown, discovering the record of human history in the process. The Master Chief manually destabilizes the 

Pillar of Autumn's fusion reactors, and he and Cortana narrowly escape the destruction of the ring via a fighter.
