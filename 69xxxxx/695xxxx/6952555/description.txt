This is another of my old Mir books that I had bought 25 years back!
All chemical compounds that constitute living and inorganic matter are diverse combinations of eighty-odd elements. The remaining known elements are practically not found in nature. Scientists created them artificially by means of nuclear reactions. More new elements can be obtained in this manner and we do not know how many of them. But it is quite clear that the chemical alphabet is not complete yet.
This book describes how the alphabet of chemistry has been designed and how the inquisitive mind of the researchers discovered new chemical elements, one after another.
