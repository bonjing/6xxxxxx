Makoto identifies a familiar smell on Radu and attacks him. Makoto then attacks and slays every vampire in Club Feed while the humans escape. Makoto's father enters to assist her as Radu assumes his werewolf-like appearance. Just then, Blade appears and slays some of the vampires. Makoto and her partner arrives as Blade fights Radu while trying to get the info on where Radu's boss is. Blade manages to use his Residual Move to destroy Radu. Makoto and her father end up encountering the Existence's leader who ends up biting Makoto's father. Blade arrives and confronts the vampire who shows him the scar on his left hand that he got from Blade's mother. The vampire beats Blade as two of his henchmen take blood samples of Blade before they escape. Makoto's father ends up turning into a vampire and attacks Makoto only to be killed by Blade.
