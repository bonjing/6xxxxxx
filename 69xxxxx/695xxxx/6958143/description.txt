Milton Jones\'s House Of Rooms sees Milton and his mother living in a big house in which they rent out their spare rooms to a variety of tenants.

 Those staying in the house include Alice, a shy tongue tied girl who can\'t quite communicate with Milton who\'s equally awkward around her; and Tony, a middle-aged office worker who has split up from his wife.

 When new tenant Paul arrives, he seems to just hit it off with Alice... forcing Milton to up his game and try to compete for her attention.

Our Review: Fantastic. Inventive and stylish direction, coupled with a script sprinkled with some of the star\'s trademark silly wordplay gags, makes for a winning show. Plus, just when you think you\'ve got the hang of what\'s the show is all about, there\'s a brilliant twist.

 If this is turned into a series - as it surely is destined to be - it could become a huge hit for Channel 4, which frankly has been in need of a new lovable silly comedy show ever since the end of Father Ted.
