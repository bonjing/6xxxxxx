STAR TREK: BRIDGE COMMANDER - MAXIMUM WARP EDITION
-----------------------------------------------------

The Very Special Edition DVD contains the following:

Star Trek: Bridge Commander, The Original Game (Patched and Cracked to v1.1)
Star Trek: Bridge Commander with BC Single Player Super Mod v3.2
Star Trek: Bridge Commander with Kobayashi Maru Multiplayer Mod v1.0


-----------------------------------------------------

Star Trek: Bridge Commander is a space combat simulation game for the PC, published by Activision and Totally Games based in the Star Trek universe. The plot revolves around a newly promoted captain who is assigned to investigate an explosion of a star in the Maelstrom. Throughout the mystery, the player will often encounter characters from the Star Trek universe, including Captain Picard and Commander Data. The captain and his crew take command of the USS Dauntless (NCC-71879) as well as the USS Sovereign (NCC-73811) to combat a new threat to the Federation.
The game allows two different styles of gameplay: storyline mode and quick battle mode. Quick battle mode allows for customized scenarios within a "simulated" environment, allowing the player to pick their allies/enemies, system, etc. With the advent of modding for Star Trek: Bridge Commander, custom missions and even campaigns have been made possible through this engine.

Bridge Commander Super Modification V3.1 README
Author: CaptainRussell

Information:
This is the latest version of the BC Super Mod; its quality is far superior to that of either V1.0 or V2.0, as you'll plainly see as soon as you start playing it if you've played either of the other two versions. The CR Nebula, NanoFX sound effects, and my all-new 9 of 9 Cardassian Hybrid (only available with this modification) are just a few of the new upgrades over the V2.0. You'll need an extremely-powerful computer system in order to play this mod as it looks in the included screenshots; nothing less powerful than my old X700PRO will even let you play with antialiasing or anisotropic filtering enabled, especially during the large-scale battles of E6M5 and E7M4. To run speculars, antialiasing, anisotropic filtering, and high resolutions, you'll need at least 512MB of graphical memory - no less will do.

Notes:
The single-player campaign has been further tweaked for you enjoyment, and all missions are 100% reloadable (I've played through them several times on my BC install and have found them to be 100% reliable - if you play the game for too long however it may crash to the desktop due to its inherent instability - the game is like this modded or not - I recommend exiting and re-entering the game at least every four hours to prevent this).
