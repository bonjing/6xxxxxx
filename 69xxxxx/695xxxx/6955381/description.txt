Ichicuts is a Brooklyn, NY soul-pop two piece formed in 2011 by Gordon Millsaps and Erik Pendleton. Their dynamic live performances are informed by years spent experimenting in the studio. By seamlessly blending electronic and old school instrumentation, broad vocal range, and a love for gritty pop, Filthy First Year is a fine introduction to a band on the rise.
