Known Issues:
* CM7 - All CM7 issues have been resolved, make sure you are running CM 7.0.2 or later. Early versions may still give you issues.
* Buglessbeast - This firmware mod does not seem to have proper support for the new Equalizer APIs at this time
* Sony Xperia Arc Media Player - Sony's Media Player force closes. This is a bug in Sony's app, we tried to workaround it but cannot. We contacted the developers about the issue. Until it is resolved we recommend you use a different media player.
* Amazon MP3 - Amazon's MP3 player force closes when you play a song. Amazon has updated their cloud player in order to fix this issue, please update to latest version in the Market.
* HTC Desire HD / HTC EVO - People have reported intermittent issues with the stock gingerbread firmware on this device. Users who have replaced their firmware with the CyanogenMod ROM no longer have issues. We have worked around the issues to make it more robust. Force closes should be gone, background service still gets killed every now and then though, but it should start back up cleanly now.
