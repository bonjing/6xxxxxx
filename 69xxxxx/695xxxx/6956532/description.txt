I need an honest opinion on this video clip.

I need to know what you think of the quality: how does it look in fullscreen on your monitors, and how is the audio.

It's an MP4, so you'll need VLC Media Player installed on your machine.

Please leave your comments on the torrent page. Plz be honest. 
Thank you very much.
