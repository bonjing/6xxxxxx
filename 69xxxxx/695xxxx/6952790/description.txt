Battleground or (Skeleton Lake) about a grizzled, angry, well-armed Vietnam War vet who encounters six ruthless bank robbers in the forest. The trailer, via the official website, is pretty self explanatory and features some impressive cinematography, good teases of fun action, and so on. Its best described as an indie Heat meets Predator. Give it a chance, dont tear it to shreds just because you dont like the trailer. Anyway, watch the first teaser trailer for Skeleton Lake below.
