Snuff-Movie is a 2005 gothic horror film by British director Bernard Rose. It stars Jeroen KrabbÃ© as a horror film maker named Boris Arkadin, whose pregnant wife was brutally murdered by a Manson-like gang of hippy psychopaths during the 1960s. Because of this he has become a recluse, until, several years later, he makes a come-back and invites some actors to a large mansion in the English countryside to \'audition\' for his new film. But unknown to them they are being filmed by hidden cameras linked to a \'snuff\' website.
