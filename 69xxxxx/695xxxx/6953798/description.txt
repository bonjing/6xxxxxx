Introduction
â€œWe cannot live for ourselves alone. Our lives are connected by a thousand
invisible threads, and along these sympathetic fibers, our actions run as causes
and return to us as results.â€
- Herman Melville
Herman Melville lived in 19th century and the word internet, and RSS would not
have come into his mind even in his wildest dreams. Still, a lot of writers have
come and gone after him â€“ I havenâ€™t found a better statement to present our
context before you. Money has stirred an honest nest around us and although
money canâ€™t be said to be everything in our life, itâ€™s a fact that none of us canâ€™t
live without dollars. We all crave for dollars and run after that using different
means. Itâ€™s these â€œmeansâ€ that we select to run our business that matters. Putting
it in simple words, modern day business is all about connecting people.
Needless to say, those who connect to people in a better way, often succeeds.
Paradoxically, those who are armed with the latest technologies are capable of
connecting to people more successfully. Before the advent of RSS and blogs,
these technologies used to burn out a hole in your pocket. All those days are
gone. Now, if you have a website you only need some knowledge to make things
happen for you. Itâ€™s this vital knowledge that I am going to pass on you through
this book.
