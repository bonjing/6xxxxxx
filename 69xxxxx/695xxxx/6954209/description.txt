FOR TESTING

Description
Adonis Linux is aimed at any user. The first build is not targeted at any specific audience, It's merely a base to branch off several other genre specific builds, for programmers, game enthusiast, artist, etc. From here, the long term goal is compatibility. To run anything, on anything, regardless of what OS and hardware the item was made for.

Adonis Linux Alpha 0.2.0 #Current release is installable, preferred to be installed within a VM.# #Use at your own risk, not responsible or liable for data loss# Added from 0.1.1: Wifi and wire connections should now work and be managed easily/automatically. Install via the icon on the desktop. Simply delete it when Installation is done. At this point, it's a fully setup and stable OS, though it's minimal in design. As such after the next major release(s) the project will begin to branch into multiple paths. Known bugs: trackpad movement is buggy
