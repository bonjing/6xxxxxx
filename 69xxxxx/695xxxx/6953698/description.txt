Jimmy Witherspoon (August 8, 1920 â€“ September 18, 1997) was an American jump blues singer


Early life and career

James Witherspoon was born in Gurdon, Arkansas. He first attracted attention singing with 
Teddy Weatherfords band in Calcutta, India, which made regular radio broadcasts over the 
U. S. Armed Forces Radio Service during World War II. Witherspoon made his first records 
with Jay McShanns band in 1945. In 1949, recording under his own name with the McShann band, 
he had his first hit, Ain't Nobodys Business, a song which came to be regarded as his signature 
tune. In 1950 he had hits with two more songs closely identified with him: No Rollin' Blues 
Big Fine Girl as well as "Failing By Degrees" and "New Orleans Woman" recorded with the Gene 
Gilbeaux Orchestra which included Herman Washington and Don Hill on the Modern Records label. 
These were recorded from a live performance on May 10, 1949 at a "Just Jazz" concert Pasadena, 
CA sponsored by Gene Norman. Another classic Witherspoon composition is "Times Gettin' Tougher 
Than Tough".

Witherspoons style of blues - that of the "blues shouter" - became unfashionable in the mid-1950s, 
but he returned to popularity with his 1959 album, Jimmy Witherspoon at the Monterey Jazz Festival, 
which featured Roy Eldridge, Woody Herman, Ben Webster, Coleman Hawkins, Earl Hines and Mel Lewis, 
among others. He later recorded with Gerry Mulligan, Leroy Vinnegar, Richard "Groove" Holmes and 
T-Bone Walker.
