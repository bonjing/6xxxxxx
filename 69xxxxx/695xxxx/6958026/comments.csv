kpea: The reason for ths ""mkv shit"" is very simple: Not only it has higher quality, it also comes without the annoying VH1 logo and the irritating commercial breaks that usually screw up the whole show. This is the episode in its full version. Sure, .avi format is a smaller file but you won't get the same quality and it is also very likely that you get an edited version, such as the UK episode, which cqme out in avi format mising almost a whole minute in the beginning and with a poor screensize resolution. Now if you want crap, you'll get crap, that's for sure.

And there are a lot of software applications able to play .mkv shit. I use K-Lite Mega Codec Pack, which comes with Media Player Classic, a very compact and 'user friendly'version which, I'm sure, your single neuron should be able to process how the software works. Cheers!"
