Counterbomb: Protecting Yourself against Car, Mail, and Area-Emplaced Bombs

From 1983 to 1988, the use of IEDs (improvised 
explosive devices) as murder weapons in the United States 
increased more than 430 percent. Regardless of your 
profession or position in life, it is a real possibility that you 
could become the target of a bomb placed by terrorist or 
criminal elements currently operating with impunity 
within our borders and abroad. 
Author Lawrence W. Myers has assembled a realistic, 
highly effective approach to addressing the three most 
common methods of assassination by explosives---vehicle, 
mail, and area-emplaced bombs. Drawing on his 
experiences as a counterterrorism specialist and bombing 
case files of the FBI Bomb Data Center, U.S. Secret 
Service, and U.S. Defense Department, Myers proposes a 
merciless, controversial tactic to use against those who 
attempt to utilize explosives for murder and terror: 
specially rigged (but easy-to-obtain) security devices that 
detonate the IED in the hands of the bomber, killing him. 
Myers stresses other deterrents that, while not as 
extreme, are also highly effective. By implementing the 
canny countersurveillance techniques described herein, 
the lines become blurred between killer and victim, stalker 
and stalked. The object is to plant a seed of doubt in the 
minds of terrorists and criminals as to whether they have 
become the target in this deadly dance. Then, if they're 
foolish enough to try to emplace an lED against you or 
your property, they will die.
