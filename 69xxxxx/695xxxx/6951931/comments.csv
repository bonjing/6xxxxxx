with similar name.. its a new series.
check out my new S01 compilation of alaska experiment as its all explained there.. some many cappers called S02 of that series S01 even..
hence why it confused me until I sort out my collection and shares

==
tvrage guide was wrong again it seems..

There was no E04. Season 1 was only 3 episodes.
There is no word on a Season 2, either.
