Description

They move like shadows in the night. Protecting the innocent, thwarting injustice and stuffing themselves with Scooby snacks! That's right - the most legendary names in crime-fighting history join forces as Scooby-Doo and the Mystery, Inc. gang team up with Batman and Robin. The action begins as The Joker and The Penguin try to cash in on a crooked counterfeiting scheme only to be foiled by the Dynamic Trio of Batman, Robin and Scooby-Doo! But, The Joker and The Penguin return to try and steal a flying suit until Scooby-Doo and the gang prove that with a little Bat-help, they have what it takes to bring the sky-high scoundrels back to earth!
