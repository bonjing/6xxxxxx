Sensing Murder (New Zeeland version 16:9)

Season 1 Episode 6

On Sunday, October 6th, 1974, Lorraine Wilson, 20 and Wendy Evans, 18, set out from Brisbane to hitchhike to Goondiwindi where Lorraine's car was under repair after breaking down. The girls had four days left of their Queensland holiday before they had to return to work at St George Hospital, Sydney. They were both trainee nurses and were due back at work on October 10th. They never made it back. On 25th June 1976, their remains were found in the bush at Murphy's creek, near the foothills of the Toowoomba Ranges. Two elderly bush walkers stumbled across the girl's skeletal remains, with their clothing and belongings scattered around them. Both girls had been raped, bound and gagged and bludgeoned to death with a heavy object. The site was untouched and no attempt had been made to cover or hide the bodies. The case remains unsolved.
