 Unemployed and branded a trouble-maker,      
 Jaikishan lives a poor lifestyle in a        
 slum-area called Asha Colony, very near      
 Andher's Lokhandwala Complex along with      
 his sister, Seema; mom and dad. He comes     
 to the rescue of a homeless orphan, Mili,    
 who suffers from a deep inferiority complex  
 and permits her to live with his family.     
 Brutally outspoken, he believes that India   
 should be awarded unlimited gold medals for  
 corruption at all levels, fully aware that   
 these beliefs portray him as a 'revolutionary
 and prevent him from securing any gainful    
 employment. His life will be turned upside   
 down when he refuses to go along with the    
 plans of the Khan family - consisting of     
 builder, Majid; his goon brother, Farid, and 
 their seemingly benevolent father, Jahangir.
