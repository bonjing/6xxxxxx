Additions:

In project windows, "New Text Document" and "New Folder" now prompt you (using a standard save panel) for the location of the item you wish to create. After creating the item, BBEdit will figure out whether the item needs to be added to a collection (if one was selected when using the commands) or to the top level of the project, or adjacent to another item already in the project.

There's a new script attachment point for documents: 

documentShouldFinalizeAuthenticatedSave. This gets called in cases where an authenticated save is necessary (for text documents only). An attachment script for this purpose might look like this (the comments are important, so read them!)

System Requirements:

Intel Mac, OX X.6 or greater
