Notes:
Since this is the season premiere I included two bonus videos.
This is a smaller, lower quality version.
Made specifically for people who have slow internet or have to watch their bandwidth use.
Tested using the free VLC media player.
If you are looking for a high quality version look for one of the scene's HD releases.
