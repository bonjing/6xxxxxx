here say 1 seed, but my client says 0 available and i'm not getting any data.  All the peers says 0.0% finished.  These are pretty rare - the other torrents with complete seasons have all the seasons mixed up, incorrect episodes or duplicate episodes.. Please seed.  You have the only correct S08 Eps from 01-05. ;)"
