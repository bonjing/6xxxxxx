           When his cattle drivers abandon him for the   
              gold fields, rancher Wil Andersen is forced    
                 to take on a collection of young boys as his   
          drivers in order to get his herd to market in  
                time to avoid financial disaster. The boys     
                  learn to do a man's job under Andersen's       
                tutelage, however, neither Andersen nor the    
                     boys know that a gang of cattle thieves is
                      stalking them.
