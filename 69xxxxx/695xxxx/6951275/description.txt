If you like puzzle or word games, you'll love word worm!

The goal is simple: form words by touching adjacent (connecting) letters.

That is, you can move up/down and left/right as long as you are forming a word. When you have formed a word, press submit to score your word and watch the letters disappear.

This game was designed natively for android as oppose to our previous version. It features full screen professionally designed graphics and â€œiPhone smoothâ€ animations. This version includes an expanded dictionary and plural word support! Inspired by popcapâ€™s classic game bookworm!
