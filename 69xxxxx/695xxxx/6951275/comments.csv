We are both staunchly opposed to SOPA and PIPA, but we worked really hard developing Word Worm and can only afford to make new games when people make purchases.

This comment will not prevent you from downloading Word Worm nor will we try to stop you. We only ask you consider purchasing it, or another one of our apps if you enjoyed the game and would like more.
