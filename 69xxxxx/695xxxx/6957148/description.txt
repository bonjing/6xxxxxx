Schmoozing With Terrorists: From Hollywood to the Holy Land, Jihadists Reveal Their Global Plans--to a Jew!

In Schmoozing with Terrorists, Aaron Klein obtains unprecedented access to bring readers into the viper's den of some of the most dangerous terrorist organizations in the world, traveling into hazardous terrorist zones and talking directly to the militants themselves about some of the most pressing issues today.

Klein, WND's Jerusalem bureau chief, confronts terrorists whose stated goal is the annihilation of the United States and Israel, and narrates his interviews from the unique perspective of a Jew meeting with his enemy.

Klein schmoozes with the terrorists on a number of topics--asking them who they want to see in the White House, their thoughts on big name American celebrities, what day-to-day life would be like if the global jihad took over the U.S., and why terrorists kill and maim.

This book affords readers the unique opportunity to understand how the terrorists think and why they believe they are in a war to the finish--ours.
