Plot: Loosely based on historical accounts from over 2,000 years ago, Chinese period war epic The Warring States presents a panoramic view of the period when seven kingdom-states fought for supremacy in ancient China. The film centers on eccentric military genius Sun Bin, the descendant of Sun Tzu (author of The Art of War) played by acclaimed actor Sun Honglei (If You are the One 2). The big-budget production rounded up an all-star pan-Asian cast including Korean star Kim Hee Sun (her first film in six years), Japanese actor Nakai Kiichi, Hong Kong actor Francis Ng, Mainland thespian Jiang Wu and starlet Jing Tian, plus famed actors like Guo Degang and Xu Jiao in cameo roles. Thanks to its winning cast, sweeping cinematography, and stunningly recreated battle scenes, the film has won the confidence of international exhibitors to stage a simultaneous theatrical release in China and North America in April 2011.
