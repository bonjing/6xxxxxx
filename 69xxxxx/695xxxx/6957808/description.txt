DATE: 01/13/12
NOTES:
We greatly appreciate the support 2HD.  Thanks for helping us keep IMMERSE
in line.
Sorry Immerse, but a nuke for 2px crop has to actually be bad crop, not fade.
Please re-read your rules or write them more clearly, and inspect us better
next time.
?   - When cropping, remove everything that is not actual picture, including  ?
?     black or other colored borders, duplicate lines, and full-time tickers. ?
?     Removing or retaining fading edges is at capper's discretion and shall  ?
?     not be considered undercropped or overcropped.
