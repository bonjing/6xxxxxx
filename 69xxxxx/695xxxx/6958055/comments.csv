Uploading freeware here just clutters things up without serving any usefulness. Not providing a description is ridiculous. Uploading six year old software that was badly received and that plays havoc with connectivity is either borderline malicious or incredibly ignorant, especially without the description.

Oh, and I see you're not seeding it, either. What is that, about Strike Five? Please stop this stuff."
