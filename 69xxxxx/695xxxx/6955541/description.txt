Combinatory logic is one of the most versatile areas within logic that is tied to parts of philosophical, mathematical, and computational logic. Functioning as a comprehensive source for current developments of combinatory logic, this book is the only one of its kind to cover results of the last four decades. Using a reader-friendly style, the author presents the most up-to-date research studies. She includes an introduction to combinatory logic before progressing to its central theorems and proofs. The text makes intelligent and well-researched connections between combinatory logic and lambda calculi and presents models and applications to illustrate these connections.
