SOME TRIVIA FROM IMDB

Christian Bale and Brad Pitt were considered for the role of Will. 

Erik Van Looy was originally set to direct

Director Jim Sheridan fought with Morgan Creek's head Jim Robinson continuously on the set over the shape of the script and the production of the movie. After Sheridan re-shot some scenes because they did not go down well with test audiences, Morgan Creek took away the film from Sheridan's hands to re-cut it themselves. As a result, they created the trailer which many felt gave away too many of the movie's secrets. As a result, Sheridan, Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz refused to promote the film to the press.

During the shooting of this film, actors Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz fell in love and started a relationship, which was publicly announced months later. The actress later married Craig in a discreet ceremony. When asked about the movie, Craig said "The movie didn't turn out great. But I met my wife. Fair trade". 

Not screened in advance for critics.
