                 PLOT OUTLINE :                               
                                                       
           12-year-old Preston Waters is tired of his    
              pain-in-the-butt brothers and stingy parents.  
                 One day, a rich but convicted money launderer  
          by the name of Quigley nearly kills him in a   
                parking lot and gives him (by mistake) a       
                  blank check. So Preston boots up his computer  
                , makes out the check for one million dollars  
                     cash money, comes up with the pseudonym of
                      "Macintosh" and starts to spendin'. But
                      Quigley wants his money back -- it was
                     supposed to be cashed by another man with a
                        blank check and handed back to Quigley. Can
                          Preston keep up the facade? Will Quigley and
                          his goons get their money back? And will
                          Preston learn how valuable money really is?
