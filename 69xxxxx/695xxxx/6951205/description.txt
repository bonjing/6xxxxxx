Iâ€™m a cargo pilot. In the industry, Iâ€™m known as a â€œFreight Dog.â€ I fly canceled checks and other types of high-value cargo around the country, mostly at night, in airplanes that are older than I am. Flying freightâ€”or â€œworkâ€ as we call itâ€”in small, twin-engine aircraft is a lesser known side of the aviation world. Our day starts when bankerâ€™s hours end. Thousands of flights move millions of pounds of work from city to city every night while the rest of the country is asleep.
Weâ€™re out there in the freezing rain getting de-iced when youâ€™re laying down for bed. Weâ€™re sweeping the snow off our wings with a broom at three in the morning. That horrible thunderstorm you heard last night while you were sleeping, we were flying through it. The fog you woke up to in the early morning hours, we were landing in it.

Hauling Checks is a comedy about the darker side of aviation. A cast of degenerate pilots, who work for a shady night time air cargo operation, take you on a flight through the unfriendly skies. The pilots abuse every Reg in the book in their quest to make deadlines for their high value cargo. As the company falls on hard times, management resorts to questionable measures to save the failing airline.
