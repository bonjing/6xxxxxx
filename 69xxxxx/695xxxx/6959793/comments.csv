. One version was published in Thomas D'Urfey's Wit and Mirth, or Pills to Purge Melancholy; a very different one appeared in George Farquhar's 1706 play The Recruiting Officer. A version also appears in John Gay's The Beggar's Opera of 1728.

The words have changed over the years, as can be seen in the versions below. The only consistent element in early versions is the title line and the tune. D'Urfey's and Gay's versions both refer to lovers, while Farquhar's version refers to fleeing oveseas to join the army. The tune was provided with another set of lyrics for the Sharpe movies, based on Farquhar's version. This version was also recorded by John Tams who played Dan Hagman in the series.

The nursery rhyme ""Tom, Tom, the Piper's Son"" mentions a piper who knows only one tune, this one. Early versions of this, known as ""The distracted Jockey's Lamentations"", may have been written (but not included) in Thomas D'Urfey's play The Campaigners (1698):

    Jockey was a Piper's Son,
    And fell in love when he was young;
    But all the Tunes that he could play,
    Was, o'er the Hills, and far away. "
