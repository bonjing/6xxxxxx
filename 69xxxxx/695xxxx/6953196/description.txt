IMPORTANT:
This is a repack (new video encode) of an earlier torrent (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6885610). I'm a Mac user on OS 10.7 Lion and that older encode plays fine, as it does on Windows Vista & 7 systems.

However, I discovered that for Mac users on OS 10.5 Leopard or OS 10.6 Snow Leopard the earlier file has artifacts (white frames & pixelation). This new encode correctly plays on those systems. My apologies to Mac users who downloaded the earlier torrent and had issues. 

Also, I shrunk the Dolby 5.1 track to 384kbps (as 640Kbps seemed a little luxurious in hindsight).

SOURCE: Blu-ray Disc

NOTE ABOUT FRAME SIZE:
The Blu-ray is open-matte 1.33:1. That means that, despite being 4:3, the film was animated (the action was composed on screen) so that it could be cropped for a widescreen 16:9 presentation. When this film was released for a second time on DVD (as the "Original, Uncut Version" in 2002) it was presented in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio. This encode preserves that widescreen presentation with a 1280x720 frame size.

I'm a film snob and I would never simply crop a film if that wasn't the creators' intent. (You can search the web for info about the intended aspect ratio of this film).

SCREENSHOTS:

I'm an Apple fanboy and this was encoded and tagged for import into [b]iTunes.[/b] It will also play on any iDevice - including both versions of the AppleTV - that can do HD.
