Mark Waid's Irredeemable published by BOOM! Studios

Throwing in the, World's Greatest Comics, to get people's attention! Seriously this book is a must read! One of my top favorite comic book series out there. Included is BOOM!'s Irredeemable #01 - #32, Irredeemable Special #01, & Incorruptible #25. I purposely did not include (but do have) Irredeemable / Incorruptible FBCD 2010 because it just reprinting Irredeemable #01 and offers no new material.

Depending on the reception of this, I plan on making more packs on only the best of the best comic titles.

And I haven't created a torrent in awhile so let me know of any problems and I'll try and fix them. Any suggestions and comments is appreciated!

"What if you go from, you know, Captain America to Doctor Doom? What if you go from Superman to Lex Luthor? How do you go from being the greatest hero in the world â€” someone that everybody knows, and everybody loves, and everyone recognizes â€” to the greatest villain in the world? What is that path? It's not a light switch, it's not an on-off switch, it's not something that you wake up one day and just become evil."
