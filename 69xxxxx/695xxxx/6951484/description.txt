Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

In the Thursday, January 12 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with Mike Adams about Monsanto. Mike is the founder of NaturalNews.com, an online news source covering all areas of personal and planetary wellness from nutrition to renewable energy. Alex also covers the latest news, including Ron Paul's move into second place among Republicans and Independents and the fallout over the assassination of an Iranian nuclear scientist as the U.S. announces more warships will patrol the Persian Gulf after Iran threatened to close down the Strait of Hormuz in response to a proposed embargo of its oil exports.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
