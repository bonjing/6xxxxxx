InterfaceLIFT HD Wallpapers: Ultimate Collection
------------------------------------------------

Consider this to be the best collection of HD InterfaceLIFT wallpapers you'll find on the web. This collection has been compiled for use with 1080p displays. I hope you enjoy!


1. CONTENTS

The collection contains:

1543x 1920x1080p
1x    2560x1440p
899x  1920x1200p
14x   2560x1600p wallpapers.


2. RESOLUTIONS

The choice of the resolutions was determined by two rules:

1. The aspect ratio should either be 16:9 or 16:10, else the image will be cropped too much.
2. The resolution should be equal to, or higher than 1080p.

This left me with 4 resolutions.


3. PRIORITIES

I gave each resolution a different priority (from high to low):

1. 16:9  & norm res: 1080p
2. 16:9  & high res: 1440p
3. 16:10 & norm res: 1200p
4. 16:10 & high res: 1600p

So in this case: 1543x 1080p wallpapers were available. I then added 1x 1440p wallpapers that were unavailable in 1080p, 899x 1200p wallpapers that were unavailable in 1080p and 1440p, and 14x 1600p wallpapers that were unavailable in 1080p, 1440p and 1200p. In short, there are no doubles, i.e. each wallpaper uses a different image!


4. COMPLETENESS

This collection has been double-checked with the InterfaceLIFT website to make sure no wallpapers were skipped. There will be no missing wallpapers that are on the website (in one of the 4 resolutions). 

In fact, it is even more complete than the website. This is because some of the wallpapers were removed at a later point due to copyright issues. I used some old torrents that still have some of the removed ones on there and added those to the collection.

Unfortunately there are still some wallpapers 'missing'. This is because of two reasons:

1. 276x: The wallpapers are unavailable for all 4 resolutions.
2. 72x:  The wallpapers have been removed and are (more or less) impossible to download anywhere else. 

Finally, the collection has been updated as of the upload date!


5. EDITING

I didn't do any editing (image or metadata) for all of the wallpapers. I noticed that a few wallpapers had been tagged with the wrong resolution, but this is a fault of the website. I didn't find it necessary to change this.


6. WALLPAPER MOVER TOOL

I included a simple tool so you can easily move wallpapers around. It has two options:

1. Group:   Wallpapers are grouped in folders, based on their resolution.
2. Combine: Wallpapers of all resolutions are combined in one folder.

More information:

1. The resolution is found by looking for the pattern "[#]x[#]" in the filename, where "[#]" is any number and "x" is in upper- or lower case. Only files with this pattern will be moved.
2. The file searching is non-recursive. Before grouping or combining, all the files must respectively be 1 level or 1 or 2 levels below the folder level of the tool.
3. No files are removed or overwritten. Files are not moved when a file of the same name already exists on a particular location.
4. Only empty folders are removed. All empty folders within the tool folder are automatically removed as a clean-up procedure.


7. LAST NOTES

If there is some interest in this torrent, I might decide to post an update in a few months.
