KNOWN PROBLEMS:

* Early versions of 3GW Pro reported as not working on ZTE Blade/Orange San Francisco (black screen).

* [Nov 2011] Doesn't count properly mobile usage on Samsung Galaxy R / Z (i9103) and possibly Galaxy Y (for this one try UNchecking "Use pre-Froyo ..." option in Settings &gt; Advanced).

* [June 2011] Inaccuracy reported on Samsung phones with Gingerbread. Modifications done in 3G Watchdog should have fixed (or at least reduced) the problem, your feed back on versions 1.5.0+ is welcome.

* [May 5, 2011] Large inaccuracy reported on Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1v and 10.1 with Honeycomb - this problem seems to affect other data counting applications as well (so it's probably caused by the tablet itself).
