We noticed that you used the following pirate license key to unlock Ace Translator into full version:
00DB0-33102-39FFF-VJI57-DFFFG

We have logged down the IP addresses and other solid proof.

Software theft is a serious crime. If you are caught with illegal software, you may be fined and prosecuted to the full extent of the law. In fact, you may be liable under both civil and criminal law. Software copyright violators in Cyprus are fined up to â‚¬100 000, or sentenced to jail for up to two years.

We hope you will take this matter seriously. You can acquire valid licenses now from the webpage below:

If you don't acquire a license within 7 days, we will turn over all evidence and documentation to a law enforcement agency for investigation.

Thank you for your immediate attention.

This had already violated the copyright law. You must buy a legitimate license to correct the copyright violation.
