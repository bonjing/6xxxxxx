Release Notes....: The crimson tards are at it again. How many times are you going to get 
                   propered for the same shit? Their release is improperly ivtc'd to 
                   23.976fps causing missing frames and leaving blended frames (more than 
                   from the standard framerape). This show is 25fps. Also, their release 
                   is overcropped on the left, top, AND right (impressive, no?). 
                   Screenshots are included in the sample dir.
