 Little Mahek spends all her time fantasizing  
 about achieving great things. In reality      
 she does little else. One day she meets an    
 old lady who claims to be a fairy. She        
 advices Mahek to find out what she can do     
 best. When a class essay competition is       
 announced, Mehek decides to participate, but  
 not happy with what she has written, throws   
 away the essay. Strangely when the results    
 are announced, her writing is adjudged the    
 best. How did the essay get there? Whoâ€™s      
 the gentle fairy? What is Mahekâ€™s true calling
 in life? This gentle film has a simple message
 for the young and old alike â€“ that dreams are 
 good only if one wakes up to work hard and    
 realize them.
