                Overall:
                --------
                
     The book contain 818 pages including the 
     intro, about the Author, and the Index Book, 
     in addition of the code source that is 
     available with the package.
                
                P.S:
                ----
                
     To get the most knowledge and experience 
     and skills, i recomend that you work hard
     before viewing the source code,
     at least; This is my opinion thanks.                
==================================================
                Chapter Outline:
                ----------------
     There are dozens of ways to organize this 
     material, but I settled on a scheme that 
     divides the book into six main parts. 
     In addition, Iâ€™ve included a few appendixes 
     that provide supplemental information that 
     you may find helpful.
                
     Part I: Basic Information:
     --------------------------
        This part is introductory in nature; 
        it consists of Chapters 1 through 3. 
        Chapter 1 sets the stage with a quick and 
        dirty overview of Excel. This chapter is 
        designed for readers who are new to Excel 
        but who have used other spreadsheet 
        products. In Chapter 2, I cover the 
        basics of formulas.
        This chapter is absolutely essential 
        reading in order to get the most out 
        of this book. Chapter 3 deals with names. 
        If you thought names were just for cells 
        and ranges, youâ€™ll see that youâ€™re 
        missing out on quite a bit.               
   --------------------------------------------        
     Part II: Using Functions in Your Formulas:
     ------------------------------------------
       This part consists of Chapters 4 
       through 10. Chapter 4 covers the basics 
       of using worksheet functions in your 
       formulas. I get more specific in 
       subsequent chapters. Chapter 5 deals 
       with manipulating text, Chapter 6 
       covers dates and times, and Chapter 7 
       explores various counting techniques. 
       In Chapter 8, I discuss various types 
       of lookup formulas. Chapter 9 deals 
       with tables and worksheet databases, 
       and Chapter 10 covers a variety of 
       miscellaneous calculations such as unit 
       conversions and rounding.
   --------------------------------------------
     Part III: Financial Formulas:
     -----------------------------
        Part III consists of three chapters 
        (Chapters 11 through 13) that deal 
        with creating financial formulas.
        Youâ€™ll find lots of useful formulas 
        that you can adapt to your needs.
   --------------------------------------------   
     Part IV: Array Formulas:
     ------------------------
        This part consists of Chapters 14 and 
        15. The majority of Excel users know 
        little or nothing about array formulas 
        â€” a topic that happens to be dear to me. 
        Therefore I devote an entire part to this
        little-used yet extremely powerful 
        feature.
   --------------------------------------------   
     Part V: Miscellaneous Formula Techniques:
     -----------------------------------------
        This part consists of Chapters 16 
        through 21. They cover a variety of 
        topics â€” some of which, on the surface, 
        may appear to have nothing to do with 
        formulas. Chapter 16 demonstrates that a 
        circular reference can be a good thing. 
        In Chapter 17, youâ€™ll see why formulas 
        can be important when you work with 
        charts, and Chapter 18 covers formulas 
        as they relate to pivot tables. Chapter 
        19 contains some very interesting 
        (and useful) formulas that you can use 
        in conjunction with Excelâ€™s conditional 
        formatting and data validation features. 
        Chapter 20 covers a topic that I call 
        â€œmegaformulas.â€ A megaformula is a huge 
        formula that takes the place of several 
        intermediary formulas. And what do you 
        do when your formulas donâ€™t work 
        correctly? Consult Chapter 21 for some 
        debugging techniques.
   --------------------------------------------   
     Part VI: Developing Custom Worksheet 
              Functions:
     ------------------------------------
        This part consists of Chapters 22 
        through 25. This is the part that 
        explores Visual Basic for Applications 
        (VBA), the key to creating custom 
        worksheet functions. Chapter 22 
        introduces VBA and the VB Editor, and 
        Chapter 23 provides some necessary 
        background on custom worksheet functions. 
        Chapter 24 covers programming concepts, 
        and Chapter 25 provides a slew of worksheet
        function examples that you can use as-is,
        or customize for your own needs.
   --------------------------------------------             
     Part VII: Appendixes:
     ---------------------
        Whatâ€™s a computer book without 
        appendixes? This book has four appendixes. 
        In the appendixes, youâ€™ll find a quick 
        reference guide to Excelâ€™s worksheet 
        functions, tips on using custom number 
        formats, and a handy guide to Excel 
        resources on the Internet. The final 
        appendix describes all the files on the CD-ROM.
