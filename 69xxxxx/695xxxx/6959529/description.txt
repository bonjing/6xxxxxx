One of the worldâ€™s biggest and best live bands release an incredible document of their 
return to Madison Square Garden, New York Cityâ€™s most iconic venue. 
19 years to the day after the band first performed there, they returned to the same stage
for the last date of their historic Lost Highway tour, officially the biggest tour on 
the planet in 2008. Created by award winning Director, Anthony M. Bongiovi and shot 
with 23 High Definition cameras, Live From Madison Square Garden features a career 
spanning set list including "Have A Nice Day", "Always", "Wanted Dead Or Alive", 
"Livinâ€™ On A Prayer" and even a cover of Leonard Cohenâ€™s "Hallelujah" that Cohen himself 
rates as his favourite version. This is a snapshot of a band 25 years into a record 
breaking career and still hitting their peak in the live arena.
