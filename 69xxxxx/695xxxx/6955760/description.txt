Features
* Core Technologies
- Antivirus and anti-spyware engine Improved
Innovative scanning engine protects against viruses, spyware, and other malicious agents.
- Real-time anti-rootkit protection
Prevents stealth malware (â€˜rootkitsâ€™) that, when loaded by the computerâ€™s OS, are invisible to ordinary scanners.
- Silent Firewall Improved
Stops hackers, using heuristic and behavioral analysis and a white list of safe applications.
- Antispam Improved
Comprehensive spam and phishing filter, which works as a plug-in to MS Outlook and a generic POP3/IMAP4 proxy for other email clients.
- avast! WebRep New
Provides website reliability and reputation ratings according to community-provided feedback.
- avast! CommunityIQ
Our technology uses a global network of sensors to provide us with data taken (anonymously) from the actual web-browsing experiences of an opt-in group of avast! users. This info is then used to protect all avast! users with the most up-to-date information on viruses and infected websites.
Because of avast! CommunityIQ, avast! has discovered 252,426 infected websites and protected 148,511,344 people from visiting them in the last 30 days.

Scans your computer for infections before the OS can start to activate any viruses beneath it (now applies to Windows 7 and Windows Vista).

Provides an extra layer of security for you to run your PC and its applications in a virtual environment â€“ where any attacks are thus targeted (instead of your real PC).

Automatically detects full-screen applications and disables pop-ups and other notifications without compromising security.

Real-time scanning of opened/executed files.

Incremental updating minimizes the size of regular update files.
- Fast application of updates
New format for the virus definition file means faster updates and reduces demand on CPU/memory, for uninterrupted computing.
