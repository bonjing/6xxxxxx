Hello Everyone, 
Enjoy some music that I wrote years ago, but never went back to. At the moment, I\'m currently working on a full length album, it\'s a small budget album, eventually I\'ll upload a torrent for everyone to grab when it\'s completed. I hope I can grab some kind of small attention with these older tracks, they\'re more on the ambient side of sounds, as opposed to what I\'m currently working on, it\'s very different. Either way, enjoy these discarded songs and share them, thank you.
