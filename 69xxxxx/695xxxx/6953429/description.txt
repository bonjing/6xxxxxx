Two hopelessly out of their class con-men attempt to pull off the largest bank heist of the l9th century. They gain the enmity of the most famous bank Robber in the world and the affection of a crusading newspaperwoman.

Strange and strangely forgotten star-studded comedy from 1976, starring James Caan, Michael Caine, Dianne Keaton & Elliot Gould.


The only avi file presently available of this is overdubbed in Russian, so I thought a new rip might not be untoward.
