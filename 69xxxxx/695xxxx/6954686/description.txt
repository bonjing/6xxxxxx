Expert Oracle Application Express Plugins is your â€œgo toâ€ book on the groundbreaking plugin architecture introduced in Oracle Application Express 4.0. Using the new APEX functionality, you can create well-packaged, documented, reusable components and reliably leverage your coding investments across many applications. Components you create can define new item and region types, specify validation processes, and present dynamic actions to client applications. You can design innovative and colorful ways to display information, such as displaying the temperature using an image of a thermometer, or displaying sales velocity in the form of an automotive speedometer. The new plugin architecture is sure to create a tidal wave of creativity.

Author Martin D'Souza shows everything you need to know to get started in building and deploying plugins of your own design. Youâ€™ll learn the underlying architecture, including the APIs used to tie your plugins seamlessly into an Application Express environment. Youâ€™ll learn about the different types of plugins, and youâ€™ll walk through examples of each to ensure that you can create the right type of plugin when you need it. Finally, Expert Oracle Application Express Plugins shows how to work as part of the larger Application Express community by leveraging that communityâ€™s efforts and by giving back as you deploy your own plugins to the broad audience of Application Express developers.
