"An Orphan Walks into a Bar"

After recovering one of John Fogerty's 
(guest-starring as himself) beloved 
guitars, Iraq veteran Walter Sherman helps 
a teenage boy (guest star Brett Davern) 
locate his missing father, a military 
pilot and war hero whose plane vanished 
after embarking on an undisclosed mission. 
Walter turns to Deputy U.S. Marshal Isabel 
Zambada for insider information about the 
missing colonel. Meanwhile at the Ends of 
the Earth Bar, owner Leo and Walter keep a 
watchful eye on Willa, a teenager on 
parole from juvenile detention and 
employed at the bar as part of her 
probation.
