We have established the form of communication and how it should take place. 

Now I am introducing a sound file (mp3) to discuss the signs that make a person different from the rest. It is textual, as well as rational proof. 

The files are not my own work but from another site which is labeled each file.

Enjoy.

Once again thanks for your support which at best has been civilized.
