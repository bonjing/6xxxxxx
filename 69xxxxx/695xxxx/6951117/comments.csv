Do you agree that the only flaw with NLUPPER is the fact that they do not list video bit rate? I find it rather frustrating that I have to have to download part of the file in order to test the video bit rate.
If you are like me and would like NLUPPER to start listing video bit rate in their description, please reply in this comment section in order to let them know!"
