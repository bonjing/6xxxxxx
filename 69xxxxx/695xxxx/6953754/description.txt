The object was an elaboration on the classic match-three puzzler. Control the frog that resides in the middle of the screen as a train of multi-colored orbs chugs along around you. If the orbs reach their destination, you lose, so be carefull from that happening. You do so by shooting orbs out of your mouth and making matches in the chain. Keep making matches until theyâ€™re all gone and you beat the level.
