Chapter Three

Now associated with the Kinross & Clark
law firm, Mitch is forced to defend a
partners' son on a murder charge.
Unhappy with his new case assignment,
Mitch puts Ray to work by having him
investigate what really happened. All
the while, Mitch starts working on the
Sarah Holt (guest star Alex Paxton
Beesley) case and Kinross & Grant's
reason to bring Mitch into the fold is
slowly starting to surface.
