Movie a solid 9, some FINE looking actresses.
the only bad thing about the movie is the premise. The Homer text they quote clearly states Atlantis was past the pillars of Hercules, not in the middle of the Mediterranean. still a great movie and an awesome way to learn some history and geology!    "
