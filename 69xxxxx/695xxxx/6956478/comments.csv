However, the audio is slightly out of sync. I don't know, I guess it could just be my own problem in playback, but I've never had an audio sync problem in VLC unless that file itself has a problem. 

I can fix it myself in Final Cut Pro, but I know not everybody has that option so I guess download with caution. "
