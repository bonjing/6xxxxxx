Storyline:


For teenager Les Anderson (Corey Haim), the two most important things in life are getting his driver's license and getting together with the hottest girl in high school (Heather Graham in one of her first film roles). But when Les fails the exam, he 'borrows' the family's prized '73 Cadillac for his big date. An innocent girl. A harmless drive. What could possibly go wrong? Try a fearless best friend (Corey Feldman) with an insane plan, a high school hottie with too much to drink, angry drag racers, crazed militants, a police roadblock, a crash course in car theft, a very angry father (Richard Masur), a very, very pregnant mother (Carol Kane) and much more!
