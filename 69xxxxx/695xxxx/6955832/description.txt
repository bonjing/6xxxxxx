This torrent includes a PDF version of the textbooks used in every undergraduate mathematics course at University of California (Berkeley) from 2009 to 2011. Course list is here:

The file names in this torrent include the course number as well as the book edition and author.

If you want to teach yourself mathematics, these books will probably be more helpful than the books in other math megatorrents for three reasons:

1) With this torrent, there's a clear path of progression from basic calculus (course 1A) through basic proofs (74) and proof-based courses (110,113). The prerequisites for any course can easily be found on the UC Berkeley website.

2) You can download exams ( http://math.berkeley.edu/courses/archives/exams ) and syllabi ( http://math.berkeley.edu/~reb/courses/ ) to pace yourself and verify that you really know the material.

3) These books have been carefully chosen by great teachers. If you want to learn abstract algebra, you can be confident that mastering any one of the textbooks for course 113 will get you there. The megatorrents have a lot of crappy free stuff, a lot of 70-year-old books with obscure notation and odd language, and a lot of very specific advanced stuff that you will not care about (Under an "Abstract Algebra folder": 150 random doctoral theses).
