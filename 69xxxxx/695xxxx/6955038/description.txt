EmbarcaderoÂ® RAD Studio XE2 is the ultimate application development suite and the fastest way to build data-rich, visually engaging applications for Windows, Mac, mobile, .NET, PHP and the Web. RAD Studio includes DelphiÂ®, C++BuilderÂ®, 

Embarcadero Prismâ„¢ and RadPHPâ„¢, enabling developers to deliver applications up to 5x faster across multiple desktop, mobile, Web, and database platforms including Delphi applications for 64-bit Windows.

What's new:
Delphi and C++Builder have traditionally been used by Windows developers to create applications for Microsoftâ€™s platform, but now they target Mac OS X as well. The IDEs do no run on Mac, but they have compilers generating binaries that 

can be installed and run over the network on a Mac computer, resulting in two application binaries from a single set of source files. Delphi includes support for Windows 64-bit machines, including a debugger and deployment manager.

Delphi and C++Builder also include FireMonkey, a new platform for creating HD and 3D animations for Windows, Mac OS X and iOS. These native applications make use of the CPU and GPU to draw the animations and can be connected to any data 

type through LiveBindings.

Delphi and C++ applications can be deployed to Amazon EC2 and Windows Azure, with support for Amazon Simple Storage Service API, Queue Service, and SimpleDB.
