Review

by Steve Huey

From 1986 to 1990, the Cramps eschewed studio work in favor of extensive touring; this album documents a live show from August 1986. The sound quality is crude at best, but the Cramps\' music and attitude are just as crude, so the already wild performances are actually somewhat enhanced. The repertoire relies heavily on A Date With Elvis and also features covers of Heartbreak Hotel and Do the Clam.
