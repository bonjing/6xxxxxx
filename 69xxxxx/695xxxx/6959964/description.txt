Below is a list of changes for FlashFXP v4.1

Major performance improvements throughout by reducing unnecessary overhead 
through code refactoring and performance profiling.
Added native support for 32-bit alpha masks in the tool-bar buttons. With a fall 
back to the old blend mode when 32-bit is unavailable.
We now use the Tango button style as default in FlashFXP, the original classic 
style is still available for customers.
Improved compatibility with older versions of Windows. Specifically user 
interface related glitches when themes were unavailable or disabled.
Improved error messages for SFTP, FTP, FTP-SSL, Socks4/5, HTTP Proxy, etc.
Improved use of windows TaskDialog with a automatic fall back on failures.
Improved WINE compatibility, This is the first release of FlashFXP that is 100% 
compatible with WINE.
Improved FTP and SFTP protocol error handling, with additional fail safes to 
handle unexpected server responses.
Improved SFTP transfer speeds. Uploads and downloads are much faster.
Improved input controls and added control + Backspace support.
Improved tool-bars buttons by enabling or disabling them based on the current 
state.
Improved remote SFTP and FTP directory refreshing, the item selection is preserved 
in-between refreshes.
Improved the performance speed of the local file browser.

Improved performance speed of MODE Z file transfers (FTP protocol).
Improved file handling when uploading or downloading to a slow device or network 
share.

available via the queue window right-click menu.
Added status message when the loaded translation is incomplete and a link to the 
translation editor.
Added Remote edit history, when editing remote files the details for each edit is 
stored and then restored on connect, the temporary file is not kept locally, the 
file is re-downloaded for any edit.
