"The D'oh-cial Network"

As the mastermind and creator of the online 
social networking phenomenon SpringFace, 
Lisa is called to trial when Springfield's 
obsession with the site becomes chaotic and 
dysfunctional. Lisa recounts her story and 
explains that she created the site after 
realizing she had no real friends. But as 
SpringFace expands and Springfield's 
fixation with the site causes mass hysteria, 
Lisa begins to realize that adding thousands 
of friends online did not compare to having 
real friendships. Later, Patty and Selma 
compete against the Winklevoss Twins (guest 
star Armie Hammer) in the rowing event at 
the 2012 Olympic Games.
