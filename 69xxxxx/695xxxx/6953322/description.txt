Hi.

WHAT to listen while watching this:

Country Joe & The Fish, The Great Society, Afterglow, The Love Machine.



I hope you find this collection interesting and entertaining. I made it a few years ago, when I was a psychedelic mad.

Btw... check out Nick Drake's albums. Five Leaves Left and Pink Moon. They will blow your mind, maybe not at first, but after a few listens. 

Bye =)
