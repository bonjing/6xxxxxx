dunno why the net is flooded with the chitty 19mb 15min version of this, it's a damn good mixtape, great riddims and some of the cleanest and smoothest vocal mixdowns/fx i've ever heard anywhere. these riddims are so lively and organic, shid'z plenty esoteric on a level far beyond 99% of modern dh/ragga garbage. vlad picked summa the best of the best for the dancehall murda series of mixtapes. ragga/dancehall's a strange mix of ideas n emotions;this tape showcases some of bobo shanti and garrison youth's morally dichotemous thought patterns. prolly just the p.cyans talking... vol 4 is roots, but i've never been able to track down vol 3, good luck finding that. 
anyway, one a my 100 favorite albums that needed to be reinjected to the net, can't even get it from vlad anymore...
torrent is a single 95mb 70min mp3, orig from tpb ~'03.
