Plot: Diane Blaine has the face of a movie star. Unfortunately, fallen star/tabloid queen Jamie Stephens already made it famous. Hollywoods constant rejection due to what Diane refers to as â€œTJSâ€ (â€Too Jamie Stephensâ€) has made her bitter, frustratedâ€¦.and, yes, whiny. Co-worker/boyfriend Jack Sanders doesnâ€™t help matters. His idea of ambition is letting it ride. Now heâ€™s in major debt to a trigger-happy mobster who, interestingly enough, has a thing for Jamie Stephens. Jackâ€™s only way out? Convince Diane to be Jamie and wipe out the debt having one meal with a made man. Itâ€™s literally the performance of her life. With Jackâ€™s on the line.
