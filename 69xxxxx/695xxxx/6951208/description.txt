Hans Theessink, Bridges
Hans has been around since the 70s and has developed his love of the blues to the highest standard. "Bridges" was recorded at an old church in Tuscany with the band using the natural timbers of the building to bring warmth and authenticity to the recording. One thing Hans knows for sure, a good groove. Get the groove right and you really have no problems and there aren't any here. No matter how strong your feelings may be about the blues being a music that belongs in its natural black setting, you would have to be a hard man or woman not to be seduced by this.
