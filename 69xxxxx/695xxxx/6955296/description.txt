Description:
The basis of Sinistar Unleashed is simple: you are transported through a wormhole into the alternate universe of the Sinistar, where your ship is transformed into a strange organic living spaceship. In the center of each level there is a huge jumpgate that evil worker drones (dwellers) are busy powering up by attaching sinisite crystals. Once the gate is fully powered, an enormous, very aggressive boss monster comes out of it, the Sinistar. Your primary mission is to destroy the gate before the Sinistar can get through it or delay the arrival of the Sinistar as long as possible, and when it does come, destroy the Sinistar. Enemy fighters patrol the area. The Sinistar and the gate can only be harmed using a special weapon, called the sini-bomb.
