
Diskeeper 2011 Pro Premier 15.0.966 Final

The most effective way to stop your computer from fragmentation is to use this handy app. Please note that included patch only for 32 bit users.

Description:
DiskeeperÂ® 2011 Pro Premier performance software includes powerful fragmentation prevention technology that can enormously boost workstations with heavy performance demands to levels of speed and efficiency far beyond previous limits. For pre-existing fragmentation and for the small percentage of fragmentation that is not prevented, Pro Premier takes on large hard drives and volume sizes effortlessly with powerful defrag engines designed specifically for big defrag jobs. Diskeeper 2010 Pro Premier will extend the life and increase the efficiency of your systems while greatly increasing workplace productivity.

Changes in 15.0.966.0:
Made Diskeeper Administrator reports consistent with Diskeeper reports when the efficient defragmentation option is selected.
Improved SSD detection.
Implemented automatic configuration to support backup functionality.

New! IntelliWriteâ„¢ fragmentation prevention technology. IntelliWrite prevents up to 85% of the fragmentation every system suffers from. It intelligently writes contiguous files to the disk so system resources are not wasted creating fragmentation. The results? A whole new level of system speed and efficiency.
IntelliWrite
* InvisiTaskingÂ® technology â€”Available in DiskeeperÂ® 2010 performance software, InvisiTasking provides up-to-the-moment defragmentation without tapping into active system resources. The result: completely invisible yet robust automatic defragmentation that acts in real time to keep your computer running at maximum performance.
* Real-time defragmentation â€”Handle fragmentation as it occurs, providing maximum speed and performance at all times!
* Uncompromising file and free space defragmentation â€”Defragment in the most extreme hard drive environments. Diskeeper 2010 eliminates fragmentation even on disks with as little as 1% free space or files split in millions of fragments.
* "Defragmentation Intelligence" enhancements â€”Diskeeper monitors and analyzes each drive, then chooses a defragmentation strategy specific to the needs of that drive. Every drive is defragmented using the best method possible.
* I-FAASTÂ® 2.0 (Intelligent File Access Acceleration Sequencing Technology) automatically boosts access speeds for the most commonly used files.
* Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) Compatibility mode â€”Diskeeper works intimately with the automatic backup system already on your PC. VSS compatibility mode means, Diskeeper does not damage your ability to recover lost files and does not take up valuable free space with unnecessary file information.
* Native 64 bit operating systems support.
* Boot-Time Mode safely performs MicrosoftÂ® recommended defragmentation of critical system files.
* Network Management Support â€”control Diskeeper settings and functionality via Diskeeper Administrator edition or Group Policy.

DiskeeperÂ® 2011 performance software is essential software for every Windows system. Without it, maximum system speed and efficiency would be unattainable and fragmentation related slows, crashes and freezes would be unavoidable.

To the \\\"United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users\\\",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intentionally 
posting fake comments & files. Their meaning is just trying to spread 
confusion and to frustrate TPB and it\\\'s users. 
Less downloaders = less seeders = less download speed etc = not good! 

It\\\'s in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intentionally keep posting fake comments & files. It\\\'s an easy answer against 
those who intentionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That\\\'s for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let\\\'s just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what\\\'s said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the \\\"United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users\\\"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
