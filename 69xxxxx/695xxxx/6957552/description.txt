Synthematik presents the anticipated debut album "No More Manifests" from the up and coming Russian industrial / electro dance floor invaders Freaky Mind!

The Moscow-based project created by Ilya RemÃ¦rd and Roman Ericson stormed the Russian dark scene in the beginning of 2011 with a couple of self-released singles. The singles received overwhelmingly positive feedback propelling Freaky Mind to the top of the most anticipated Russian newcomers.

The debut album â€œNo More Manifestsâ€ has all the right ingredients to live up to the expectations: explosive aggrotech floor fillers and melodic dark electro hymns with harsh vocals and explicit lyrics will satisfy hungry industrial fans all over the world.

"No More Manifests" is a loaded gun with nine unstoppable bullets that are sure to blow your mind off!

The paid version of the release contains a remix of the track 'Kill'.

Must listen for fans of Combichrist, Hocico and the like.
