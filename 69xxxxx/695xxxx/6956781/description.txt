ReleaseNotes:

Just another example of why the Dregs are such a superior instrumental band! This disc features music from prior Dregs studio albums, along with certain "cover" tunes. Steve Morse's guitar on "Kashmir" would make Jimmy Page weep of inadequacy, and I consider Mr. Page a good guitarist. If you enjoy incredible instrumental music in a live setting, this is your disc. Any other Dregs disc will give you the same in a studio setting. Enjoy!

We rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.
HHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)
