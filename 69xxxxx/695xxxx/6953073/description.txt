    Tamayo, a lovable girl, is taken care of by a prominet family.           
    However, she is the love child of business tycoon and his lover but      
    lives with him and his arranged wife's family and granddaughter,         
    Tsukiyo who hates Tamayo. Her crimelord father has arranged 3 android    
    bodyguards to protect her. The first android is handsome & has great     
    skills. The second has beastlike strength, and the third is less         
    skillful. One day the father gets hospitalized and his will is found.    
    The will says that he is leaving his fortune solely to Tamayo. When      
    Tsukiyo knows this she plots to regain her inheritance.
