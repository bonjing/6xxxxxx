The final Friday of the 2011 Beacon Run was packed with hot jams and fiery performances from the whole band!  12 shows into the run, The Allman Brothers Band once again produced a unique show with a diverse setlist, with no two shows alike. 

The first set featured yet another great jam out of "Rockin' Horse" and great versions of two MVPs of the 2011 run, "Egypt" and "Sailin' 'Cross The Devil's Sea." Jamband legend Col. Bruce Hampton, along with Derek's brother Duane Trucks, joined the ABB for "Turn On Your Lovelight," and "Leave My Blues At Home" brought the first set to a rousing conclusion.

The second set began with an epic "Dreams" that has to be heard to be believed!  Gregg sings with heart and soul, and Derek takes the main slide solo, delivering an anthemic masterpiece of slide playing while the whole band grooves mightily.  Warren gets to take the spotlight on "Worried Down With The Blues," and Susan Tedeschi sits in for a powerful version of Derek and the Dominos' "Anyday," with a distinct "Blue Sky" jam.

This "In Memory of Elizabeth Reed," featuring guitarist Oz Noy, is outstanding.  An extra-long intro section really sets the mood, and the whole band is locked in.  The momentum of the jam continues into an exceptional "JaMaBuBu" drum jam, then carries over to a hot "Liz Reed" reprise jam.  Good stuff! 

For the first time ever, the ABB encored with Van Morrison's "Into The Mystic," and this extended version was something special, with an interesting call and response section where Derek and Warren traded licks.  A great show, start to finish!
