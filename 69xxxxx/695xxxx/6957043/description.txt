Recorded in Spartanburg & Jonesville, South Carolina in 1970 & 1972. Originally released on Trix (3302)..

Kickin' It! is a reissue of the long out-of-print Medicine Show Man. These 1972 recordings find Peg Leg Sam full of his customary feisty and inviting enthusiasm. The sessions document key material in the repertoire the 61-year old blues singer and harmonica player performed in the 1930s, as part of a traveling medicine show.

He's joined by a guitarist (either Baby Tate or Rufus Johnson) on six of the songs; on all the rest, he's in the spotlight all by his riveting self. The longer numbers like "Greasy Greens," "Ain't But One Thing Give a Man The Blues," and "Born in Hard Luck," find Sam fully engaging the listener with style and grace, seamlessly mixing storytelling and songs. He's a master at varying the pace, building momentum, and altering the dynamics for maximum dramatic effect. Kickin' It! is an essential blues title.
