open on the same day, as if by magic! But Moriarty's plans don't stop there...

Sherlock and John lock horns with their old enemy in one final problem that tests loyalty and 
courage to their very limits. Sherlock must fight for his reputation, his sanity and his life. 
But is he all he claims to be ?
