On Disc 1: The Other One > New Potato Caboose; Dupree > Doin' That Rag > Cosmic Charlie; Alligator through to We Bid You Goodnight . . . Disc 2: The Other One > Clementine > Death Don't Have No Mercy; then Dark Star through Lovelight. FLAC preserves the flow from track to track, apart from superior sound quality to MP3s which suck for ""hi fi"" music even of this kind."
