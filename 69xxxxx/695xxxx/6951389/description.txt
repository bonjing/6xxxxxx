John Lee Hooker (August 22, 1917 â€“ June 21, 2001) was a highly influential American blues 
singer-songwriter and guitarist.

Hooker began his life as the son of a sharecropper, William Hooker, and rose to prominence 
performing his own unique style of what was originally a unique brand of country blues. He 
developed a 'talking blues' style that was his trademark. Though similar to the early Delta 
blues, his music was metrically free. John Lee Hooker could be said to embody his own unique 
genre of the blues, often incorporating the boogie-woogie piano style and a driving rhythm 
into his blues guitar playing and singing. His best known songs include "Boogie Chillen'" 
(1948) Im in the Mood" (1951) and "Boom Boom" (1962) the first two reaching R-B #1 in the 
Billboard charts.
