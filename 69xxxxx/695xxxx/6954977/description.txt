Course Description

These are history lectures the way you always dreamed they would be done, the events of political and military history are are recounted with flair, but alongside them and undiminished in stature are the developments in philosophy, the visual, and literary arts and what they tell us about the interior lives of the Romans and the developments of the mind and sensibility of the west.

The lectures show us the developments of Rome the Republic as it becomes Rome the Empire -- the grand and glorious inheritor of Greek Hellenistic culture and the progenitor of Mediterraneans culture throughout Europe, North Africa, and the Near East. Roman genius in war, politics, law , literature, sculpture, and the range of cultural endeavors is fully is discussed. Roman religious diversity brought paganism to new patterns of spirituality until, immersed in a new faith, the immortal empires became springboard for Christianity's growth and the doorway into the eternal kingdom of medieval conception.

Professor Ori Soltes of Georgetown University, Director of the B'nai B'rith Klutznick Museum in Washington, is a lecturer excelled by none. Professor Soltes, something of a Washington institution, is known for his extraordinary breadth of scholarship and his nearly hypnotic quality as a lecturer.
