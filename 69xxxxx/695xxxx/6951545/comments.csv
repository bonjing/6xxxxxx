se steam or retail, put @ark2 into your main arma 2 directory, create a shorcut to your ArmA 2 Launcher Rename it to ArmA2 Ark, Go to Find Target put in ""C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\arma 2\arma2.exe"" -mod=@ARK2 or if you do not use steam then ""C:\Program Files\ArmA2\arma2.exe"" -mod=@ARK2 

now the other way to do it is in steam go to set launch option -mod=@ARK2
