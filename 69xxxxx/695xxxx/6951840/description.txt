Plot: An off-screen narrator, Mort Golden, takes us back to winter around 1980, the year he 
was 21. He and his two buddies, Tim and Danny, have a fateful trip over the bridge from Detroit 
into Canada. The three of them are going nowhere in life, although Mort has thoughts of being 
a writer, while his mom wants him to go to college. He and his pals contemplate making a quick 
fortune transporting drugs over the border in their beat-up Buick, "the war wagon." Mort's 
also hopelessly in love with a girl he dated briefly a couple years before. With border
