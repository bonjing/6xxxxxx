The Secret World of Benjamin Bear was an animated television series produced from 2003 to 2009 by PorchLight Entertainment and Amberwood Entertainment. It is still being aired in Canada on both Family and Disney Junior specialty TV channels and in the USA on KidMango and Christian Television Network.

The title character is a stuffed toy bear that, together with other stuffed bears, is "alive" and have adventures of their own. They are very careful to try to appear inanimate when in sight of humans (referred to as 'Going Teddy'). The teddy bears of brother Max (Benjamin Bear) and sister Eliza (Howie Bear) are often seen together, even though Max is sometimes mean to his sister.

Benjamin Bear was voiced by Jonathan Crombie, who is also known for playing Gilbert Blythe on "Anne of Green Gables" during the 1980s and 1990s. Leslie Nielsen was the consultant of the TV series.

The bears' main duty is to their child (the bears refer to them as 'their kids', or 'kiddies'). They keep them happy, act as a friend to talk to when in need, and secretly keep them out of harm's way and on the right path to success.
