Common Speaks on Drake Diss -
â€œIâ€™m doing this for hip hop music.â€


For the first time since he first turned heads earlier this week with a pointed diss track about Drake, Common is speaking out about his budding feud with the Young Money star.
As we've previously reported, tension between Common and Drake first began when the Chicago veteran released his song "Sweet," which angrily dismisses "soft" rappers who sing. In an interview today with Sirius XM's Hip Hop Nation, Common said he decided to take things to the next level after Drake respondedâ€” first at a concert in Las Vegas, and then on Rick Ross's recent single "Stay Schemin.'"
"Once he said something back, that's when I was like 'Aight, I guess you wanna get in a battle with me, and if that's what you want, then I'll battle,"- Common said.
