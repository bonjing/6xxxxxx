Which I have done with all but 1 update to install from windows update, (KB2533552) Can't get that one to install, before first boot into windows, also for some reason the newer marvel raid driver will not work with my system, always blue screens after first reboot, unless I use the default one in windows. So the driver pack you use, won't work or my system keeps installing the wrong raid driver, with this new release. By the way this is fastestone , had to remake my profile for some reason.  Thanks for all your hard work."
