The documentary, shows her living with her animals on her farm during this era, including their care,
her affection for them, and her sexual life, entirely to the tune of Beethoven\\\'s Sixth Symphony (Pastoral)â€”an
involuntary artistic choice that became necessary when the original soundtrack recordings became unavailable
through a gaffe. At the time, she lived with \\\"two rabbits, seven dogs, a dozen pigs, some cats, a guinea pig,
a mare and a beautiful black stallion named Dreamlight.\\\"Her Danish biographer commented laterthat she seemed
a very open, warm-hearted person, \\\"very at home with nature,\\\" and that \\\"when she plays her erotic game with
the dog or horse, it is not only a sexual curiosity, it is an erotic play with animals she loves and who are
devoted to her.\\\" It was the surprising winner of the Grand Prize of the Wet Dream Film Festival in Amsterdam,
November 26â€“29, 1970, where it premiered. Joensen immediately was an underground celebrity and drew attention
from other documentary makers as well as tourists towards her expanding farm.
