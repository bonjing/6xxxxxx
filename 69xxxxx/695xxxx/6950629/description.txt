****************************************************************
Baghdad 1987, Latif Yahia (Dominic Cooper) is taken to see his former schoolmate Uday (also played by Cooper), eldest son to Saddam Hussein. Latif is told that a great honour has been bestowed upon him: because of the great likeness between them, he has been chosen to be Uday's body double. Trapped, tortured and fearful for the safety of his family, Latif has no choice but to comply.

He is forced to become part of Uday's hedonistic world of gangstas and pimps where sex, money and power are not enough - an experience which he almost pays with his life on more than one occasion.
