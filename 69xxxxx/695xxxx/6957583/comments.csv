,SectorVector,2012-01-16T13:28Z,Nice to know BBS. Thanks for the clarification too. I thought the change would scare away uploaders. (mea culpa).
nload files from TPB so the change will make little difference to me,Some members are against it but i guess it's all in the best interest of TPB.

Not to worry,i am staying here on TPB for as long as it's online.I won't be moving :)"
