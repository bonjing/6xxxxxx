Starcrash! An amazing film from 1978 starring the luscious Caroline
Munro and her minimalist wardrobe of leather space bikinis. David
Hasselhoff's got eye makeup and a lightsaber, and Christopher 
Plummer IS the confused, golden-caped Emperor of the Entire 
Universe. An Italian Star Wars ripoff of the most blatant and inept 
kind, filmed in English, from a French DVD. 

Thanks to Cosmobells.

I have provided my own [optional] MST3K-style commentary for
this film. Frankly I think the movie is funny enough without
commentary, but I hope I provide a few chuckles along the way.

Even by MST3K standards this film beggars belief. This was released on
VHS in the US by Roger Corman, but he actually cut out some of the more
wonderfully awkward moments. This is the French version, "Le Choc Des
Etoiles," which is uncut, and available in a 2-DVD set featuring a making
of documentary and "Starcrash 2," an even worse movie featuring none
of this movie's cast and all of this movie's effects.

I understand a proper American DVD is coming October 17, 2009. I hope
it's uncut.

Directed by Luigi Cozzi. With Marjoe Gortner, Caroline Munro,
Christopher Plummer, David Hasselhoff.
Commentary by Garrett Gilchrist.

- keep in mind ladies and gents, that this was created by Garret Gilchrist.  I am reposting this as a muxed MKV being that apparently the original torrent is no longer being seeded at the moment.
