The Thirteenth edition of Grant's Dissector restores this renowned anatomy lab manual to its original purpose, which is to serve as a step-by-step manual for dissection procedures. This new edition features a more streamlined approach to cadaver dissection, focusing on more accurate, specific, and clear steps. The overall number of pages and figures has been reduced, reflecting a general trend toward fewer contact hours in the gross anatomy lab.

This edition of this classic dissection approach (it has been used for more than 60 years by many medical schools) has been shortened without sacrificing clarity or content. A major advantage of this edition is that the dissection steps have been numbered, thereby allowing instructors to more accurately detail steps that they may want omitted or modified. The dissector contains a number of new illustrations specifically designed to aid the process of step-by-step dissection. The dissector chapter order starts with the back and spine. One of the advantages is each regional chapter is self-contained, so that courses which dissect in a different order than that followed by the book will still find the dissector useful. Each regional chapter starts with surface anatomy, then covers osteology, contains a "Before you dissect...," section containing dissection objectives, numbered step-by step procedures, and ends with "After you dissect...," section intended to improve student retention of knowledge. Most key anatomical structures are bolded which often end up serving as a de facto checklist for pre-exam review. Minor steps in the dissection approach have been modified, especially those that are often very destructive of more superficial structures. This edition has retained the cross references to the four most popular atlases to aid the dissection process.
