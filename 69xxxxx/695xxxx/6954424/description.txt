From Hollywoodâ€™s acclaimed director Tim Burton comes the offbeat, true-life
story of Hollywoodâ€™s worst director, ED WOOD. Johnny Depp portrays the
eccentric filmmaker who refuses to let botched scenes and horrible reviews
dash his hopes of making it in showbiz. Along with a bizarre band of misfit
actors - a TV horror queen, a Swedish wrestling hulk and down-and-out screen
legend Bela Lugosi - Ed takes the art of bad moviemaking to an all-time low.
Engrossing and often hilarious, ED WOOD delivers nonstop entertainment scene
by scene.
