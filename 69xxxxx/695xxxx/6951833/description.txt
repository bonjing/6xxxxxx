           Hercules, son of the Greek God, Zeus, is      
              turned into a half-god, half-mortal by evil    
                 Hades, God of the Underworld, who plans to     
          overthrow Zeus. Hercules is raised on Earth    
                and retains his god-like strength, but when    
                  he discovers his immortal heritage Zeus tells  
                him that to return to Mount Olympus he must    
                     become a True Hero. Hercules becomes a famous
                      hero with the help of his friend Pegasus and
                      his personal trainer, Phil the satyr.
                     Hercules battles monsters, Hades and the
                        Titans, but it is his self-sacrifice to
                          rescue his love Meg which makes him a True
                          Hero.
