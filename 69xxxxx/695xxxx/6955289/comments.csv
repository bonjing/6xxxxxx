Of course when you steal another peoples' land and then brutalize them when they resist it will lead to conflict. And unlike the jews in WWII who left Europe to go live on land stolen from the Native Palestinians, the brave Palestinians will not be leaving like cowardly dogs, but will stay and resist until they will eventually get THEIR land back."
