The audio does'nt come out in anything other than stereo, and I had to play it with a laptop to be able to hear it. Again this is not a complaint. Im just giving you my experience. If these were available in my country in a timely manner I would do them myself. As they are not, and sometimes they dont come out here at all, I will continue to d/l them from you guys. The one thing I would ask is; can you please check that they work on equipment other than a pc? I use Bauhn 3D TV (passive Polarised) a Yamaha 5.1 sound system and LG Smart Upgrader to access video files on my server."
