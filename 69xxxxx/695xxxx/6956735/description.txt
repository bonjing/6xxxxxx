Brilliantly funny Irish comedian Brendan O'Carroll stars as out-spoken Irish mammy Agnes Brown in this brand new comedy series that aired on BBC ONE.

Join Agnes Brown as she indulges in her favourite pastime - meddling in the lives of her six children!

Whether she's tackling love, life, death or dealing with the in-laws - Mrs Brown is one mammy that you don't mess with.

Prepare for a riot of bad behaviour - It's a little bit rude, a little bit crude and hysterical fun for everyone.
