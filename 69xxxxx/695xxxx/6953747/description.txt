I'm a little out of my league but I found this for myself to read and decided to upload it as well.  It was on a different site.i think.  It's the latest book in the Star Wars saga and i am a little excited about it.  Good luck and all that. Much love to George Lucas and all the creative members he's been surrounded by in the production and creation of the Star Wars Universe. If you like this book buy it.
