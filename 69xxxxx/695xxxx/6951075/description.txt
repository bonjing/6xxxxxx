Bill Wyman has written seven books, which have sold almost two million copies and been translated in eleven different languages. He's an acclaimed photographer having staged exhibitions around the world. He's acknowledged as Britain's most celebrated metal detectorist, who has also designed and created a detector for children and newcomers to the hobby. He's done countless gigs for charities and taken a hat trick at the Oval in a cricket match. He's been awarded an honorary doctorate, he's an archivist and collector, opened his own restaurant, Sticky Fingers, in London and found time to raise a young family.

Bill has written and produced for film and television and appeared in several movies. Heâ€™s released over a dozen albums as a solo artist and with his own bands, the Rhythm Kings and Willie & The Poor Boys, as well as scoring music for films.
