NOTES:

Ok first off for the 8 gig SD CAM files ....source files were mpeg2 in 4 2gig files.
The source files were nice considering its SD,but like any cams had issues.The main one was the film was cammed at different
angles due to the camera movement throughout.....also it had bad ivtc and looked rather pinky/purple looking.
The audio was pretty decent for cam ,just had some hiss and echo to it.
Work done ....shit loads.
First thing was to note all camera movements and then cut the files up into pieces ...10 major movements there was throughout.
Once done i had to use a quad filter to pull the video level then crop the remaining black borders ...
From there is was a case of tweaking the brightness and contrast and the rgb colours and adding a touch of sharpness to it.
Also will admit once cropped the video was around 520x so had to upscale the video a touch as the res was too low for my liking...oh and
all the other releases would have been upscaled aswell ;-)
From there it was a case of encoding each piece and then appending them altogether.
Audio we stripped and cleaned up and changed all the EQ setting and remuxed to our encode .....had to resync it a touch in several places due
to the cuts we had to make.

Readnfo ....too warn there is a slight flicker in parts,and some parts more than others.So we've cut the sample to show you the best and worse
of the flicker.
