This movie is so obscure it wasn't even listed on the IMDb so I had to add it myself. It's about the apostle John who, as an old man, is exiled to the island of Patmos, where he's forced into slave labor and he and the other Christians are persecuted for their beliefs. He also gets divine inspiration to write the Book of Revelation, and the movie then enacts the apocalypse, horsemen and all. 

This was produced by something called "Evangelical Outreach" and Christian filmmaker Ken Anderson and filmed in a quarry in Northern Ireland. I ripped it just for you. Comments are welcome.


Written and directed by Jimmy Murphy. Starring Louis Rolston, Mark Mulholland, Joe McPartland, John Hewit, Bob Quinn, Liam O'Callaghan
