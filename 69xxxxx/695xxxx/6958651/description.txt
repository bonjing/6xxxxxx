Why is it that the mixture has to be dissolved for the reaction to take place?
The answer is, Corpora non agunt soluta, which is the Latin for "Bodies (substances) do not react unless dissolved". Alchemists discovered this rule many centuries ago. We take it for granted that chemical reactions take place in solutions, but hold this fact at the back of our minds or even completely forget about it. As chemists well know, 199 reactions out of 200 can only take place in solution.
The title of this book promises to take up some extraordinary properties of solutions. Some readers may disagree with the choice of the word. They may argue, for example, that there is nothing extraordinary in the fact that salt solutions can conduct electricity or that a solution would freeze at a lower temperature than a pure solvent. Science has explanations for everything, they may add. One sagacious man has once said that science begins by seeing unusual in the usual. That is why every book on science is always an invitation to see unusual in the usual.
