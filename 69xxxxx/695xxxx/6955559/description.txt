In this torrent, I am sharing with you 10 of my interesting books downloaded from various sources. Some of them I have converted from EPUB to PDF. As a matter of principle, I don't upload small books of less than 10mb in single torrent. I collect such books & upload  them in a group of 10s every month. Instead of giving description of each book, I have added Amazon links which you can use to get more info about the respective book :
