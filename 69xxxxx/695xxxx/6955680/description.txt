Master Repack For Hitman Blood Money to 500MB
-----------------------------------------------



The story follows the life of professional hitman, Agent 47, as narrated in cutscenes by a former director of the FBI to a journalist who is interviewing him. The wheelchair-using ex-director recounts how his agency tracked 47 over a two-year period. The game also marks 47's arrival to the United States, and differs from the original three in that several contracts are carried out in civilian areas, as opposed to the "covert ops" settings of Codename 47, Silent Assassin, and Contracts. The game was a commercial success, selling more than 2.1 million units,[1] and a sequel has been confirmed to be in the works by IO Interactive.
