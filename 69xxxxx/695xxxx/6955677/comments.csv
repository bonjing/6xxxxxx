,annspain,2012-05-20T16:10Z,"WOW, This program is fantastic. My computer was starting to slow down considerably and I had a feeling that this was due to too many things running in the background. The program listed what was running at start up and to be honest I didn't have as many as I thought, but I was able to disable the programs I didn't need, also the file information was very useful when deciding what to run or not. I am a bit of a newbie on certain things but this program has given me more control of my computer.
The program downloaded very quickly and was up and running in no time at all.
Thank you so so much for this and it will go straight to the top of my seed list"
