  Raju is a poor rag picker. One day a      
  magical stranger gifts him a red coat.    
  Raju discovers that whenever he puts      
  his hand in the coats pocket, a rupee     
  appears. He and his friends have a good   
  time with this endless supply of one      
  rupee coins. A gang of three and his      
  own brother-in-law discover the secret    
  of the coat and try to steal it. Raju     
  tries hard to protect both himself and

  important lesson that easy money comes
