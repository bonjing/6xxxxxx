Information
------------------------------

Mark Evans and Joy Reidenberg travel to South Africa to dissect the first primate in the series: a huge alpha male baboon that led a band of baboons on a rampage through a Cape Town suburb until the authorities were forced to euthanise him as he grew increasingly violent. Intricate dissection of muscles and tendons reveals how remarkably similar human and baboon hands are. Meanwhile Simon Watt discovers how these primates have adapted to survive in the suburbs of their fellow primates.
