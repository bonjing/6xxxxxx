Wyclef Jean - The Preacher's Son: Vibe Session DVD-Audio (2003)


This rare live studio DVD contains some of my favorite Wyclef recordings, bringing a raw, intimate, and unpolished feel not found on other albums. Clef and company lay it down live at Platinum Sound Recording Studios in New York City, working out songs that would eventually become "The Preacher's Son" album.
