It has now been expanded by an additional 6 songs, making this the most complete look ever at their crucial 70s recordings for Capricorn Records. Contains the hits Can t You See, Heard It In A Love Song, Fire On The Mountain and Take The Highway. Includes five rare 45 rpm single versions! Newly remastered, with an 8-page booklet containing detailed notes and rare photos.

We rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.
HHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)
