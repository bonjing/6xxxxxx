The whole vid is a little underwhelming, but it was supposed to be the first in a series, and I believe there is actually another DVD coming out this summer.

Also good to keep in mind this is what it says it is -- fundamentals only, and it was geared towards a pretty beginner audience.  Some good tips for anyone in there though.

Thanks for the credit though."
