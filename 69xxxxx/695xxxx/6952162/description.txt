ONE NIGHT ONLY concert was one of the most celebrated of recent years, a one-night event witnessed by just over a hundred fans of Barbra, chosen by lottery to attend this show unique. Among the guests of the show were also Bill and Hillary Clinton, Nicole Kidman and Sarah Jessica Parker, among others.

ONE NIGHT ONLY covers the full experience of the first performance in a club of the legendary Barbra Streisand to act after 48 years without one. The extraordinary event coincided with the release of his album "Love Is The Answer" in September 2009, which Barbra won the gold record number 51 of his career.

ONE NIGHT ONLY takes the viewer into a small nightclub in the West Village of New York, with the best picture and best sound imaginable, to share a unique and intimate evening.
It was an exceptional event in which the singer-actress had her album "Love Is The Answer" which reached No. 1 on U.S. charts and was the 51 ├é┬║ Disco de Oro for Barbra Streisand, to add to his 30 Platinums.
Only a privileged few were able to fill the limited capacity of the Village Vanguard, but now the impressive and intimate concert is available to all on this DVD.

Recorded in high definition with the best sound you can imagine, the disc turns the living room of every house in a small New York club, sharing a special concert that amazed the New York Times: "There are frequent concerts of Ms. Streisand but the Village Vanguard was unique in a room for 123 people standing, a strange thing for an artist who has sold 71 million albums in the U.S. alone. There were Oscar winners rubbing elbows with the Secretary of State, a former President ...".
