An exploration of the relationship between female writer George Sand and composer Frederic Chopin. Sand (Judy Davis) who dresses up as a man, becomes enraptured by Chopin (Hugh Grant). Life becomes rather amusing when Sand shows up as an unexpected party guest at the royal mansion of the Baron and Baroness d'Antan. Here she encounters not only Chopin and friends Liszt and Delacroix, but lover Felicien Mallefille and the man of her dreams, Alfred de Musset.
