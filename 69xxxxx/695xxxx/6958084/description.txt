Saracen is NWOBHM band formed in 1976 in Matlock, Derbyshire under the moniker Lammergier. As Lammegier they toured extensively cross the English â€˜Midlandsâ€™ during the ensuing years. In 1981 they re-emerged as Saracen, releasing their debut album Heroes, Saint & Fools. The album received critical acclaim and is still regarded as one of nwobhm classics. Later they signed record deal with Neat Records and released their follow-up album Change of Heart. Soon after this Saracen was split, but reformed in 2003 when Now And Then Records tracked down three founding members, signing three album record deal. They have since moved towards more progressive style of music.
