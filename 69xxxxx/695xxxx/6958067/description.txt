 READNFO - Has a flicker/pulse that differs in certain scenes, still    
 watchable though. We used INSPiRAL as the source as they did a great   
 job on sorting out the camera movement issues. We took it and put it   
 in for filtering, we added a light denoise filter, before then adding  
 a little more colour and then adjusting the brightness/contrast. Came  
 out very sweet. Up to you if you take it, screenshots basically tell   
 the story, audio is just average for a CAM.
