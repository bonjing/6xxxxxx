The Alex Jones Show
Sunday, 15 January 2012


[sebaygo1]


The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events.

The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.

On today's live Sunday broadcast, Alex looks at the accelerating disintegration of the Republic, and the rise of humanity to defeat those undermining the Constitution and all it stands for. Meanwhile, the global economic disaster continues to unfold, with nine EU nations recently downgraded by S&P still reverberating markets and likely to trigger further collapse. Alex also brings you the latest on the escalating tensions towards war with Iran-- with the United States and Israel openly discussing a strike in the wake of preparations for sanctions. Today is a moment of reflection for the system the New World Order has built.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
