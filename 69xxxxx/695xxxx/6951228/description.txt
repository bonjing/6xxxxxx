Overview: DB42 is a 2D platformer game that uses mechanics similar to Portal and Portal 2.



Make your way through the Cynobotic Army's Advanced Robotic Training grounds. These will test your wits and resourcefulness to the UTMOST! Jump, run, swing, GRAPPLE and TELEPORT your way to the top!! Learn the ropes as you explore the introductory levels that slowly introduce you to the components of the game. From there, you BLAST OFF into many more levels of fun and brain-teasing craziness!!!

Along the way you will pick up UPGRADES that enhance your capabilities. Find things like:
- The JUNK BUDDY. This is a short range tractor beam for pulling objects towards you. Very useful for obtaining things that are just... out.. of... REACH!
- The REPUGNICATOR. This is a repulsor ray that allows you to push remote switches and do things like... SHOOT HOOPS. Yes. Seriously!!
- The Infinite Reality Interstitial Surface (IRIS). Use your IRIS enhancements to TELEPORT around a level. Folding space has NEVER been so EASY!

As you travel through the environments, you'll encounter things like water HAZARDS, ANTI-GRAVITY fields, and object field SUPPRESSORS.
