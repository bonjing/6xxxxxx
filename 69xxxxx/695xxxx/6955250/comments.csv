I propose that the 100th anniversary of the end of the war become known as Jewish Acceptance Day, the day when the jews finally move on from the war as all of the jewish people who suffered and survived the war will by then be dead.

Then they can no longer expect the rest of the world to treat them as special or to be able to use the excuse of the war to justify themselves.

This would be a great day.  A day when they accept responsibility for themselves when they are wrong.  The day when the massive chip on a lot of their shoulders is finally removed."
