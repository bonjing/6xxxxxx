                                    PLOT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two years have passed since Cloud Strife defeated Sephiroth, who attempted to
 damage the planet by summoning a meteor. Cloud has been living with Tifa 
Lockhart in a city called Edge, and both have been taking care of Marlene,
 their friend Barret Wallace\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s daughter, and the orphan Denzel.
	Cloud and many other citizens are infected by a strange new disease 
known as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Geostigma\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Cloud is on his way to meet the Turks, a group that 
performs operations with the megacorporation Shinra. He is attacked by three
 menâ€”Kadaj, Loz, and Yazooâ€”who believe that he has hidden their \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"mother\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".
 Kadaj ends the battle when he discovers that Cloud does not have her.
	When he arrives at the meeting place, Cloud discovers that Shinra\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s
 president, Rufus Shinra, survived the events of the original title. Rufus
 attempts to enlist Cloud\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s help to stop the trio, but Cloud refuses. Kadaj
 arrives and demands that Rufus tell him where to find his mother. It is
 revealed that his mother is the remains of Jenova, an extraterrestrial 
lifeform whose cells were injected in Sephiroth\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s body and helped him in
 Final Fantasy VII, and is connected to the cause of the Geostigma.
 The trio are planning a reunion with Sephiroth that will culminate
 in an assault on the Planet.
