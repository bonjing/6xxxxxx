WhatSize is tool that allows the user to quickly measure the size in bytes of a given folder and all subfolders and files within it. You would be surprised at how many useless files might be laying around on your hard disks. The files and folders are automatically sorted by size, with the biggest sizes first.

While the app is measuring a folder the user can browse the files within that folder and immediately see the size in bytes. Hidden files, cache files, directories will all show up with their corresponding size.

* Once the measuring of a folder has ended the user can also view the
  information by filtering for particular file sizes or types. The user can
  also move unwanted files and folders in the corresponding Trash bin
  similar to the Finderâ€™s Delete button.

* With DeLocalizer you can remove those unwanted locales for languages
  you never knew existed.

* With Nibâ€™o Suction you can clean up all those unnecessary, forgotten
  nib files. Most likely these files were left over from the development
  process. Considering there are hundreds of these, they add up.

* With Lipo Suction you can trim up binary files by removing the unused
  architecture bytes.

* With Find Duplicates you can quickly and easily find duplicate files.

* For those of us, using Solid State Drives, being able to thin the boot volume by a few extra gigabytes will be a good thing.

Whats New:

* Added preference pane to better handle CSV exports.

* Added measuring of TimeMachine volumes. This feature will help
  identify local TimeMachine snapshots.

* Addressed rare crash related to missing local host name.

* Addressed rare crash related to the file system having changed from
  under the application.
