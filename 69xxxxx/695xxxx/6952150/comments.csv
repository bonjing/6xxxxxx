,Bubba99,2012-03-23T17:12Z,"The first few minutes of the first VOB file in the movie (VTS_01_1.VOB) is corrupted.  The video is all wrong, but the audio is the correct track.  I've D/L'd it twice and the second time was worse than the first.  Looks like parts of the correct file have been lost and another file's parts interspersed.  

Lindoffs, any chance of getting just this file uploaded again?  Thanks"
