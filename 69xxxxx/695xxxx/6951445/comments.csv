I was about to watch this show OnDemand on cable, but they disable the fast forward button which forces me to watch commercials and what not.
But by the time I finish typing this comment this same exact episode is already downloaded and ready to watch. 
Thank you PirateBay and Thank you EZTV!!!!!!
Gosh, I love the internet! 


STOP SOPA & PIPA!!!!!!"
