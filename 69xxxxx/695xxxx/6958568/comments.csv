d the exe that I'm seeding by extracting it and opening the index.html and it worked properly... chances are it's an incomplete or corrupted download. If all else fails, programs like calibre can convert the MOBO to HTMLZ which is simply a ZIP file with the HTML files/images inside (can open it it in WinZip/7zip/IZArc/etc.)"
