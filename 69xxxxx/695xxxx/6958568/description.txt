Psychology for Dummies by Adam Cash
Publication Date: 2002

What do psychologists do? Why do they do it? Does it take some sort of special aptitude to become a psychologist? How do you think psychologists feel about us asking all these questions about them? A psychologist friend of yours tells you that he is unhappy all the time and thinks it might have something to do with how he makes a livingâ€”how would you help? Now substitute the word â€œpeopleâ€ for psychologist and you have some idea of the kinds of questions the science of psychology tries to answerâ€”questions about behavior, motive, aptitude, feeling, perception, and therapy. And while psychology may not provide definitive answers, it does offer powerful insights that can help you better understand who you are and why you feel and act the way you do.
