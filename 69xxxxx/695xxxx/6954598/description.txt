In September 2011 R.E.M., the rock band from Athens, Georgia, decided to call it a day after 31 years. 
This collection from the BBC archives includes performances of Pretty Persuasion from the Old Grey 
Whistle Test in 1984, Orange Crush on Top of the Pops in 1989 and special acoustic versions of Losing 
My Religion and Half a World Away on The Late Show in 1991, along with performances on Later with Jools 
Holland and Parkinson. Also, vocalist Michael Stipe and bassist Mike Mills reflect on the band ending.
