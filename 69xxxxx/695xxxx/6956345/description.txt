[#] INFOS (READ THIS).
------------------------------------------------------------------

(o) General Infos:

* This is the original Microsoft Windows XP Professional SP3 32-bit (Volume License) ISO. 
* Unattended Installation with Prompt repair option.
* This Windows XP is updatable out of the box and Valid WGA CD-Key is already inserted and no Windows XP Activation needed and a WGA crack will be also installed.
* Includes all official and some unofficial Windows XP Service Pack 3 Updates till 10.1.2012.
* Over 200 MB integrated drivers for SATA/ACHI, LAN, WLAN and Monitors.
* A lot of Windows XP settings have been already set and will be also set for new created Windows XP accounts.
* Booting and Running a little bit faster because some worthless Windows XP files and Programs are removed and all Windows XP Updates are slipstreamed.
* After Windows XP is installation you can choose if you want the Preconfigured Windows XP Settings and the Extra Programs to be implemented, if nothing was chosen in 60 seconds then the option Yes will be automatically selected.

(o) Important Infos:

* This Windows XP is not for Upgrading you must make a clean installation on a formatted Hard disk drive or Partition.
* It is possible to add Extra Programs and Custom Settings by editing the files in the directory "(source)\OEM\RunOnce" and the file "WINNT.SIF" in the directory "(source)\I386". To do this you need to use a ISO Editor and all files should be opened with a text editor such as Notepad.
* If you are installation this Windows XP on multiple Computers and want the installation process to run full automatically. Then you need use an ISO Editor program and replace the file "WINNT.SIF" in the "(source)\OEM" folder with the one that is in the "(source)\I386" folder. If you now Boot from the Disc then your main Hard disk drive will be formatted and a new partition will be create and then Windows XP will be automatically installed on this partition. Note that if you are replacing the "WINNT.SIF" file then the Recovery Console and Repair Option will be disable that noramly you could be run from the Windows XP Disc.
* If the Windows XP installation hangs or you get a Blue Screen error during the Windows XP installation then this is probably because due to a SATA driver problem. To fix this problem you should do the steps under "Infos on how to Remove the included Drivers and include your own Drivers". If you are getting a Blue Screen error you could use also a workaround for this by going into your BIOS and turn off the option SATA/ACHI or change the SATA mode to IDE. This should normally fix the Blue Screen error, But with this workaround you will loss +/- 15% of your Hard disk speed.

(o) Infos for Newbies:

* Minimum Computer Requirements ia a "600 MHz Processor" with a "256 MB RAM" and "4 GB Hard disk drive" and a "Super VGA (800x600) Video Adapter".
* If you miss some standard Windows XP programs then open the Windows XP Favorites folder and then you will find alternative links to better programs. Some standard Windows XP programs are removed because they outdated or are replaced by Microsoft with a better version, for example the free Microsoft Outlook Express that has been replaced years ago with the free Windows Live Mail program by Microsoft.
* If you want to change the Windows XP CD-Key after Windows XP has been installed then use the Tool "Keyfinder (Key Changer) v1.51.exe" that you can find on the Burned Optical Disc and in the ISO file. You can also change the Windows XP Owner and Company with this Tool.
* If you get a malware warning about the files "Keyfinder (Key Changer) v1.51.exe" and "Windows Genuine Advantage Crack for v1.9.0042.0.exe", that's normal because almost all Anti-Virus Programs are detecting Key Changers and Cracks as malware.
* If you have a question or a problem then visit the Website "www.zone54.com", but first make sure that you can't find the solution for your problem in 10 minutes over a Web Search Engine or over the forum search engine at "www.msfn.org".

[#] HELP GUIDES.
------------------------------------------------------------------

(o) Infos on how to Remove the included Drivers and include you own Drivers:

1. Download the Driver for your SATA Controller that is in your computer and then make a new folder and extract all the files with a Zip Program like 7-Zip into the new folder (If there is no file "txtsetup.oem" in the Zip file that you downloaded then use google to find the SATA Driver that has this file included because this will not work without this file).
2. Make a new folder on your Hard disk drive and name it "WINXPCD".
3. Open the ISO file "Windows XP Professional 32-bit en-US - Black Edition v201X.XX.XX.iso" with a Zip Program like 7-Zip and extract all the files into the folder "WINXPCD".
4. If you see a folder "[BOOT]" in the "WINXPCD" folder then delete it.
5. Now go to the directory "WINXPCD\OEM" and run the file "DriverPacks BASE - Remover vX.X.cmd".
6. Download and install the program nLite from "http://www.nliteos.com/download.html".
7. Start the program and click Next and Browse to the folder "WINXPCD" and after the loading is done click two time on Next and then select the option "Drivers" and the option "Bootable ISO only" and then click Next.

10. At the Option "Label" write "WinXP_32-bit_BE" or whatever you want (Maximum 16 characters) and then click "Make ISO" and then Browse to the location where you want to save the new Windows XP ISO file and you done.
* To test if the ISO file with the new integrated SATA/AHCI driver are also working on your Computer you need to install the program VirtualBox from "www.virtualbox.org". It is important that you set in VirtualBox the Virtual Hard disk to SATA not IDE or the test will be useless.
* If you have a problem to include your SATA into your Windows XP then visite the MSFN forum at "www.msfn.org/board/index.php" and post the topic about the problem you have.

(o) Infos on how to install Windows XP new:

1. BACKUP YOUR FILES FIRST ON A CD/DVD OR TO AN HARDDISK DRIVE and download all the Up-to-Date Drivers that you need for your Computer from the "Chip Cards" manufacturer Websites.
2. Go to your Mainboard or Computer manufacturer Website and look if there's no a new BIOS update for your Mainboard (You can skip this but it is always better to have an bug free BIOS).
3. Select in your Burn program the option for Burning an Image file and then select the file "Windows XP Professional 32-bit en-US - Black Edition v201X.XX.XX.iso" and then Burn the Disc at a low speed like 4x to avoid missing file errors if you install the Windows XP. If you need a good Burn Program i recommend the free ImgBurn program at "www.imgburn.com".
4. Insert your burned Windows XP Disc in your Optical Disc Drive and then restart your Computer. If your Computer starts you should see the message "Press any Key to boot from the CD." if you see this then press a random key on your keyboard. If you don't see this message then you need go into your "BIOS Settings Menu" and set the Boot Priority for the Optical Disc drive above the Hard disk drive.
6. If Windows XP has loaded the drivers then press on your Keyboard the key "ENTER" and then press the key "F8" and then press the key "ESC".

8. Now select the same Hard disk drive again (Default is "C:") and press on your Keyboard the Key "ENTER" and then you should select the option "Format the partition using the NTFS file system (Quick)" and then press the key "ENTER".
9. After the Windows XP installation is finished you need to install all the Up-to-Date Drivers for your Computer and then your DONE. :-)
