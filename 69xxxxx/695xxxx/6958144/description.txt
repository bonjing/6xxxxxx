                Chapter Outline:
                ----------------
                
     Part I: Moving from Spreadsheets to Dashboards:
     -----------------------------------------------
        Part I is all about helping you think 
        about your data in terms of creating 
        effective dashboards and reports. 
        Chapter 1 introduces you to the topics 
        of dashboards and reports, defining some 
        of the basic concepts and outlining key 
        steps to take to prepare for a successful 
        project. Chapter 2 shows you how to build 
        an effective data model that provides 
        the foundation upon which your dashboard 
        or report is built. In this chapter, 
        you will learn the impact of poorly 
        organized data, and will discover how to 
        set up the source data for the most 
        positive outcome.               
   --------------------------------------------        
     Part II: Excel Chart Basics:
     ----------------------------
        In Part III, we offer an in depth look 
        at some of Excelâ€™s other key dashboard 
        and report components that you can 
        leverage to create a cutting edge 
        dashboard presentation. In Chapter 7 we 
        introduce you to pivot tables, and 
        explore how this Excel feature can play 
        an integral role in Excel-based 
        presentations. Chapter 8 provides a 
        primer on building pivot charts, giving 
        you a solid understanding of how Excel 
        pivot charts work with pivot tables. 
        Chapter 9 introduces the new sparkline 
        functionality found in Excel 2010. 
        Finally, Chapter 10 rounds out this section 
        with a look at the various techniques 
        that you can use to visualize data 
        without the use of charts or graphs.
   --------------------------------------------
     Part IV: Creating Advanced Dashboard Components:
     ------------------------------------------------
        Part IV takes you beyond basic chart-building 
        with a look at some advanced business techniques
        that can help make your dashboards more meaningful. 
        Starting with Chapter 11, we demonstrate how 
        to represent trending across multiple series 
        and distinct time periods. In Chapter 12, we 
        explore how best to use charts to group data 
        into meaningful views. And Chapter 13 demonstrates 
        some of charting techniques that can help 
        you display and measure performance against
        a target.

        you automate your reporting processes, 
        and give your users an interactive UI. 
        Chapter 14 provides a clear understanding 
        of how macros can be leveraged to automate 
        your reporting systems. Chapter 15 illustrates 
        how interactive controls can provide your 
        clients with a simple interface, allowing 
        them to easily navigate through and interact 
        with your dashboard or report.
   --------------------------------------------   
     Part VI: Working with the Outside World:
     ----------------------------------------
        The theme in Part VI is importing and 
        exporting information to and from Excel. 
        Chapter 16 explores some of the ways to 
        incorporate data that does not originate 
        in Excel. In this chapter, you will learn 
        how to import data from external sources, 
        such as Microsoft Access, as well as
        create systems that allow for dynamic 
        refreshing of external data sources. 
        Chapter 17 wraps up this look at Excel 
        dashboards and reports by showing you
