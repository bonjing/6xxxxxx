A very RARE film not currently on DVD. This is a genuine copy of the film, all other 'Death Race 1973' torrents I have found to date have turned out to be Death Race 2000 or 2008!

In the North African desert in World War II, a damaged American fighter plane that is unable to take off tries to evade and destroy a pursuing Nazi tank.

Director: David Lowell Rich
Writer: Charles Kuenstle
Stars: Lloyd Bridges, Roy Thinnes and Eric Braeden

Owned VHS copy converted to m4v video file - plays well on VLC player. It's watchable but not outstanding in recording quality.

Video: 7/10
Audio (English): 8/10


Not sure if this TV film will ever make it to DVD, so please take this very rare opportunity to download this short film! I will be seeding for only the next 60 days or so.

So please seed this as much as possible!

Enjoy!
