   Squabbling Sharma family has a dubious    
   reputation of not having any cook last    
   there for more than a few months. Word    
   spreads out about this family to such     
   an extent that no person wants to be      
   employed as a cook in this household,     
   ironically named Shanti Nivas. Then one   
   day a young man named Raghu offers to     
   work as a cook, and he is hired. Raghu    
   quickly gets a grip on his job and on     
   each of the family members, and soon the  
   squabbles and arguments come to an end.   
   And then the Sharmas find the family      
   jewels and Raghu missing.
