720 X 388 standard DivX video at 1350k bitrate plus great 224k audio
converted using DivX converter 1.5 to play on non HD or HD players
as the case may be for you - although Referred to as the "extended edition" 
on the original download, this movie file is 1hr 57minutes in length - same
as others we checked

This is originally a convert from an excellent quality mp4 720p which currently
has hundreds of torrent seeds (but wouldn't work on our bluray player as it 
doesn't support the ipod format) so we made a XviD HD 720p of similar quality
which instead does play on our Sony bluray/HD player - even when loaded on 
a plugged-in usb memory key, as does this standard DivX version we also made -
both are instead being made available to you here.

We first learned of this movie using the facility of our bluray player 
to connect directly to the internet to fetch the most recently available 
movie trailers

This movie tells of what a beautiful American woman finds are only insanely 
sounding geeks and the like when she is instead looking for real romance at
the core!

All is not lost I submit! My brother in law from chile is an example of what are
clearly among the most able and strong and indeed clearly observably the most
romantic men on the planet - only you don't see enough of his genre in his 
quality up here as yet - not enough to drag them away from their communities 
I gather. The perfect men - and Wow! this movie might just do it though, the
beauty of America as is the star of this show is "to die for"! A more 
suited couple I suggest!

Please check the net for subtitles as the Swedish ones we looked at were machine
translated (using google translate) and we cannot validate them for you as
well as you that speak the various languages concerned. thank you

we did find perfectly matching subs quite quickly though for Dutch Polish
and Romanian and so they are included here in tiny srt files optionally
for those that need them of course.
