system because it plays on all the players you mentioned (tested on my pc). try installing combined community codec pack.
fyi, i switch to x264 codec to maintain 700mb size, ac3 audio & 720 width resolution without compromising the quality of the film. sorry if your player cannot handle this codec but you're the only one that complains. the x264 is written in the filename & description to see before downloading."
