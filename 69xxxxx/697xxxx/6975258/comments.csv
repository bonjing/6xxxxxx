Not entirely sure where best to ask for this, but since you've helped so many others: 

Would you be able to get any of the following books:
 - My Mother She Killed Me, My Father He Ate Me by Kate Bernheimer
 - Tender Morsels by Margo Lanagan
 - The Darkangel Trilogy by Meredith Ann Pierce
 - Noah Barleywater Runs Away by John Boyne
 - The Curse Workers series by Holly Black
 - The Skinjacker Trilogy by Neal Shusterman
 - The Manual of Detection by Jedediah Berry
 - Blackbringer (Dreamdark) by Laini Taylor
 - The Replacement by Brenna Yovanoff
 - Forgotten by Cat Patrick
 - Forbidden by Tabitha Suzuma
 - Graveminder by Melissa Marr

Any of the short story collections by Michel Faber

I know that's a mouthfull, but if you could get even one of them, I would be very grateful!

Thanks!
