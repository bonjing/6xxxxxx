Review by Scott Yanow:
There have been so many releases of live concert performances by Duke Ellington\'s orchestra that it is easy to become blase about them. It is true that one does not really need all of these CDs but, on the other hand, virtually all of the releases contain quite a bit of excellent music. When one considers the consistent high quality of Ellington\'s material and the many distinctive soloists that he employed, the result is that practically everything released of his orchestra is quite worthwhile. Hot Summer Dance features the 1960 Duke Ellington Orchestra performing their usual repertoire from that era including excerpts from \"The Nutcracker Suite\" and \"Such Sweet Thunder,\" a three-song medley of jungle pieces from the \'20s, several Johnny Hodges features and a new version of \"Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue.\" It may not be essential, but Ellington collectors will enjoy this CD.
