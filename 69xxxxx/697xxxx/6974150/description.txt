SOME TRIVIA FROM IMDB

Producers pitched the movie idea to studios as: "Six words: Will Ferrell as a NASCAR driver." 

Will Ferrell offered a role to Steve Carell, but Carell couldn't accept due to scheduling conflicts.

Gary Cole and Jane Lynch portray Will Ferrell's parents, despite being only 11 and 7 years older, respectively. 

Some of the big car crash stunts were done for real, using explosive jacks that were later erased using computer graphics. The pipe and plate footing for the gag are shown falling away from the car(s) in un-processed scenes. 

The character Ricky Bobby inspired a hip-hop song and national dance craze 'Do the Ricky-Bobby' started from a rapper named B-hamp from Texas. The dance has inspired tons of amateur videos showing their best Ricky Bobby dance including Cincinnati football player Ochocinco showcasing his best moves.
