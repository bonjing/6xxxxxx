FontGenius is a font search and identification utility for Macintosh. FontGenius examines pictures and identifies typefaces of any text within a picture. Using advanced recognition technology, FontGenius will produce a list of likely fonts that match selected characters within an image, and will generate character previews of the matched fonts.

FontGenius can match both installed fonts and uninstalled fonts using a built in font profile database. An internet search can also be performed on the list of results to locate, purchase, and/or download matched fonts.

FontGenius supports most image file formats, and can even grab an image right from your desktop.

System Requirements:

PPC or Intel Mac, OS X.4 or greater
