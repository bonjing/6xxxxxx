      Two teenage boys from New York are travelling down south when a    
       series of coincidences lands them in jail charged with first      
     degree murder. They can't afford the $50K for an attorney so they   
           call the lawyer cousin of one of the boys. Vinny is a         
       stereotypical New Yorker who is initially a complete disaster,    
                     but can he get them off the hook ?

     This internal technically could be a "PROPER" but I couldn't find   
     the sample from the FOCUS release from 2 years ago. Here is a rip   
     with the correct AR, I'm not sure how 640x420 works for a movie     
     that is 1.85 : 1, but enough ranting. Here it is done right, with   
     AC3 and of course the AppeaL touch. Enjoy the show!                 
                                                                         
     After two years of limited distribution, we found it time for our   
     work to be available on a larger scale. Therefore we decided to     
     enable more sites to host our releases by including the             
     'INTERNAL'tag in our directory naming. Our releases aren't          
     internal though; we release them. The good news is we stay who we   
     are and keep being non-competitive.
