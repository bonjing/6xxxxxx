 READNFO - Audio is CAM, don't be put off by it though, it's actually   
 very sweet and better than most CAM audio you see going around. Anyway 
 Nice and simple encode here, just added some more colour to the video  
 as it looked a bit dull, as well as a few others to tweak the video.   
 Not going to bore you by saying anymore. Just Enjoy! ☻
