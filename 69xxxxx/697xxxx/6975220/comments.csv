Reboot your computer afterwards and use Task Manager (either ctrl-alt-delete or right-click the Taskbar) to kill anything related to Daemon Tools by right-clicking any DT processes and selecting ""End Process Tree"". Once that is done, run the installer again and hit the ""Patch"" button. Run the little patcher app, pointing it to your DT installation if needed, and that's it you're done. Fire up your DT and you'll see that it is no longer in trial mode and is fully activated."
