1)  Part 1 
In a munitions test an F-18 Hornet drops a bomb on and A-4 Skyhawk. A wind turbine spins wildly, a helicopter's tail rotor doesn't spin at all and both are destroyed. A mud slide chases residents down the street, a C-130 doesn't fair well with rocket assistance and tornadoes do their worst.

2)  Part 2 
Trapped between a tornado and downed power lines, storm chasers are pummeled with wind and huge hail stones. A suspension bridge collapses, a draw bridge smashes a boat and a speedboat takes to the air. A B-1 bombs a house, a billion dollar B-2 bites the dust and passengers flee a fiery Chinese 737. Terrorists treat residents of a town in Turkey to a massive munitions factory explosion and fire.

3)  Part 3 
The earth shakes from massive explosions and fireballs at a gas station and rocket fuel plant. A Thunderbird's F-16 and an F-117 stealth bomber crash at air shows. Confusing traffic lights doom a semi trailer to obliteration in a train crash. Houses are washed away by a swollen river.

4)  Part 4 
Tornadoes strike a pig farm and airplane hanger. A burning tanker truck filled with 25 tons of styrene explodes in a tremendous explosion and fireball. Other fires and explosions include a Delta II rocket, a helicopter, a ship being scuttled and a bunch of balloons apparently filled with hydrogen instead of helium. A tri-motor airplane slides out of the sky.

5)  Part 5 
Fires turn tank cars and a warehouse full of acetylene cylinders into flaming projectiles. A helicopter crash brings more helicopters to the rescue. Other crashes include a racing bike, dump truck, tank truck, freight train and a furniture bike.

6)  Part 6 
Fires, explosions and burns result from an oil tank, an apartment gas leak, a plane crash, a fireworks factory and even a fire fighter training exercise. Nuclear waste containers are crashed tested in increasingly violent impacts. A police dash-cam captures a car chase ending in a head-on collision.

7)  Part 7 
Air collisions include a Mig 29 sliced in half by its wingman, a Boeing 720 test crash and fireball, a hot air balloon snared but a transmission tower and, incredibly, a speedboat colliding with electrical lines. Explosions include the rotting carcass of a beached whale, the IRA's all-time largest bomb, nuclear blast misinformation and a BLEVE fireball on a four lane highway. Finally, on a more personal level, a maintain biker takes a tumble down a mountain.

8)  Part 8 
A disgruntled resident goes on a rampage in a bulldozer with makeshift armor. An ammunition depot and a ship load of fertilizer erupt into enormous explosions. A sink hole devours a mansion and a Mig 29 crashes at the Paris Air Show. Car crashes include a car stopped by police and a race car.

9)  Part 9 
Devastation results when an unknown reaction causes a hydrogen bomb test to produce four times the expected yield. A Swedish pilot is involved in not one but two fighter plane crashes when the planes' software fails. Lava destroys a town in Hawaii. Other crashes include a hijacked airliner, a helicopter doing aerobatics and car stopped for a traffic citation.

10)  Part 10 
Ride along as people are terrified by a tornado and hurricane. A fire at fireworks factory lights up the night as it destroys a town. Jet car, wing suit and hot air balloon stunts go awry. A speed boat gets airborn and a crane topples.

11)  Part 11 
Crashes galore feature a Patton tank on a rampage, a drag racer collision, a helicopter performing an poorly planned stunt, a stunt plane that experiences a power loss, a blimp prototype and an ATV jumping sand dunes. A batch of ammunition being destroyed in Albania ; detonation is a a bit too large and ironically leads to the devastation it was intended to prevent.

12)  Part 12 
Several plane crashes have mundane causes including a Soviet YAK-41 VTOL landing on an aircraft carrier, a YAK-38 demonstrating its VTOL capability, and a highly maneuverable NASA X-31 demonstrating thrust vectoring. Boat crashes include a drag boat racing at high nearly 150 mph that sends its driver skimming across the water. Mother nature gobbles up buildings with a sink hole and a chemical plant explosion produces a massive fireball.
