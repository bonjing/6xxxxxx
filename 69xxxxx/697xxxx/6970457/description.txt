Another classic.

Taglined 'A journey to the end of comprehension', this here version is the in 1985 re-released uncut 6-episode TV mini series, digitally re-mastered in 2004.

Part of this DVD rip, we've added the 6-minute Director's cut extra which is available in English language only.

Plot? Not here, you might want to be surprised, and it's all available in abundance, starting with IMDB or Wiki - take it from there...


Enjoy
