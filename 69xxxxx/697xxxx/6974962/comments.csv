all these new pastel win 7 schemes are bad for eyes

cant beat bold font colours.. espc black

but I find if the old site hangs adding i just click
stop on browser and click submit again it
even hangs sometimes on the preforms
where enter tv and formats and desc

failing that.. if times out.. I try the beta site
instead and that may work better
one may work over other.. i think they disable
one site sometimes whike they develop it..

but often you get caught by the silly doing maintenance thing.. and often when comes back its very slow for the first 20min or so.. and you might
got caught in that period"
