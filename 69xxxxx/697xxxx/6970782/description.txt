SilhouetteFX applies a fully-configurable artistic silhouette effect to your images. Open one of your images and the app instantly turns it into a silhouette. Then use the SilhouetteFX inspector panel to adjust the look exactly to your needs, using the color mix sliders to alter the color of the silhouette. Use the threshold slider to adjust the texture of the silhouette. SilhouettesFX comes with built-in presets for various color mixes, and you can easily add and save your own.

SilhouettesFX can process most standard RGB-based pixel format images in any of the normal image file types supported on the Mac, and the app saves your images at the same resolution as the original source image.

Whats New:

* Corrected the window closure handling so that if changes have been
  made to an image the user has the chance to save them before the
  window closes.

System Requirements:
