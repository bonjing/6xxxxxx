Hello ladies and gents. I've been collecting wallpapers for a while now because they take up less room than stamps and don't get dusty so I now have just over 44,000 wallpapers in this torrent. I've lowered my estimate because I know there are at least a few duplicates but you wouldn't expect me to collect 44,000 wallpapers sober right? For some reason making a torrent with the directory of files made the .torrent "file too large" so I RAR'd each folder up separately.

The following is a list of all the folders that are in this collection. Please note that in my process of collection I never usually collect any particular wallpaper so there are random amounts in each folder ranging from as little as 30 to almost 9,000.

I do hope you enjoy and leave feedback.
