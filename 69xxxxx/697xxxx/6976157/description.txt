The Third Edition of Data Abstraction and Problem Solving with Java: Walls and Mirrors employs the analogies of Walls (data abstraction) and Mirrors (recursion) to teach Java programming design solutions, in a way that beginning students find accessible. The book has a student-friendly pedagogical approach that carefully accounts for the strengths and weaknesses of the Java language. With this book, students will gain a solid foundation in data abstraction, object-oriented programming, and other problem-solving techniques.
