Notes: Sixteen versions of FaurÃ©'s Requiem compiled from my own rips, file-hosting sites, Russian tracker and old Demonoid downloads. All credit to original rippers & uploaders. Where the requiem appears on a CD or CDs in addition to other works, I've also included the other works. Where the requiem spans several tracks (typically 7 tracks on a CD), I've merged the tracks together into one flac file. Cover scans are included. I've used the Ã© in FaurÃ© in my file-naming rather than the Anglicised Faure.

Bonus: Some more of FaurÃ©'s piano/chamber music recordings that have won the Penguin Guide Rosette Award and have been previously unavailable on Demonoid. Also a BBC Composer of the Week program and a BBC Discovering Music program on the Requiem.

Request: If anyone has any other versions of the requiem, please post.


Enjoy and Seed!!
