VinylStudio is software that helps you transfer your vinyl albums (or cassette tapes) to your computer. VinylStudio is the best way to convert records and tapes to digital format. Taking your old LP albums and transferring them to your computer could not be easier. Now everyone can rip their vinyl records in a few easy steps. VinylStudio makes the job a pleasure, rather than a chore, and the powerful sound cleaning filters can help rescue precious, damaged recordings. Download a copy and see why using Audacity for this task is doing it the hard way. VinylStudio is not just another audio editor, and although it records to standard MP3 and WAV file formats, it doesnâ€™t edit audio files directly. VinylStudioâ€™s audio cleanup tools are extremely effective at removing clicks and scratches from your recordings. VinylStudio does not expect you to keep track of your recordings manually. Instead, it stores them as a collection, organised by artist and album title.
