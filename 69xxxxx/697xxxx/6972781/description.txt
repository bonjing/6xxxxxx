SOME TRIVIA FROM IMDB

The first major full-length motion picture to be shot with the Arri ALEXA high-definition digital-video camera.

Vanessa Redgrave and Joely Richardson play the older and younger versions of Queen Elizabeth respectively. In real-life they are mother and daughter. 

John Orloff wrote the script back in 1998, but the project never took off at that time because of the release of the other Shakespeare-related film, Shakespeare in Love. The project was then restarted back in 2005, when Roland Emmerich saw the script and it only got the go ahead in early 2010 after additional research and revision. 

Roland Emmerich self-financed the entire movie. The past financial earnings of his previous movies allowed him the money and total control of the film without studio interference.
