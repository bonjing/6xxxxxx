SOME TRIVIA FROM IMDB

Tom Cruise began filming only days after completing work on Vanilla Sky. 

Both Matt Damon and Dutch actor Yorick van Wageningen were considered for the role of Danny Witwer. Van Wageningen had to drop out because he had been unable to secure a working permit when filming began. 

The "PreCogs" were all named after famous mystery writers. Dashiell Hammett, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Agatha Christie. 

Meryl Streep was originally cast as Iris Hineman, but had to back out. 

The film was almost shot a few years earlier, before Steven Spielberg decided to do A.I. Artificial Intelligence instead and have the "Minority Report" script reworked. According to reports, Tom Cruise's co-stars in that version would have been Cate Blanchett as Agatha, Matt Damon as Witwer, Ian McKellen as Burgess and Jenna Elfman as Lara Anderton. After the delay, Javier Bardem has stated in interviews that he was offered the part of Witwer, but turned it down because he "didn't want to just run around chasing Tom Cruise". This led to the casting of Colin Farrell.

PLOT:In the year 2054 A.D. crime is virtually eliminated from Washington D.C. thanks to an elite law enforcing squad "Precrime". They use three gifted humans (called "Pre-Cogs") with special powers to see into the future and predict crimes beforehand. John Anderton heads Precrime and believes the system's flawlessness steadfastly. However one day the Pre-Cogs predict that Anderton will commit a murder himself in the next 36 hours. Worse, Anderton doesn't even know the victim. He decides to get to the mystery's core by finding out the 'minority report' which means the prediction of the female Pre-Cog Agatha that "might" tell a different story and prove Anderton innocent.
