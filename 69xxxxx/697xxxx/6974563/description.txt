 Chirag comes from a wealthy background and     
 assists his father, Siddharth Mehra, to        
 maintain their farmland. His parents have      
 been divorced due to incompatibility arising   
 mainly due to his businesswoman mother,        
 Shalini's hatred of tennis, and he lives with  
 them every alternate month. Both would like    
 him to get married, and accordingly Shalini    
 picks London-based Kamiah, while Siddharth     
 picks Bhatinda-based Manjeet Ahluwalia. Chirag,
 who sneaks off to practice tennis at night, is 
 asked to make a choice but informs them that he
 is in love with a model named Anishka. Watch   
 what happens when the displeased couple decide 
 to confront and put pressure on a struggling   
 and unknowing klutz-like Anishka to leave their
 son alone.
