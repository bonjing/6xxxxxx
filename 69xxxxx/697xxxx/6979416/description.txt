The Internet is full of tutorials and all kinds of videos in which the uploader records some activity on his desktop, so how on Earth can we do something like that?

The most powerful software solution that can do such a thing is called Camtasia Studio and works on any Windows version out there.

The application will take a while to download, since the setup kit has almost 200 MB, and to install, because there are a lot of files to be copied on your computer.

Plus, during installation you will be prompted to configure several aspect of the tool, so read carefully every single message that pops out on the screen.

The interface is wow! You will definitely find it extremely difficult since it assaults the user with all kinds of tools, but this is just the way things should be organized in such a powerful application.

The main window lets you work with the caption youâ€™ve just made and apply a lot of effects, add voice or music, place title clips, zoom in and out and many, many other goodies.

The recording process goes incredibly smooth and although youâ€™d expect such an application to be a bit heavy on computer resources, Camtasia Studio works pretty fine. In fact, this is a mandatory thing because Camtasia is thus possible to leave resources to other applications whose activity on the screen must be recorded.

The settings menu is incredibly rich and confirms that everything about Camtasia Studio is overwhelming.  Of course, itâ€™s just a matter of time until you get used to all features, but keep in mind that experts use it on a daily basis without any hassle.

As a conclusion, the 300 dollars price tag Camtasia wears is not at all exaggerate. Just give it a try and see how it works, you will definitely be amazed. And in case you need such a tool, chances are that you will pay the money.
