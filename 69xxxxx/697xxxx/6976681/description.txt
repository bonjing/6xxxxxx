    After one of their store houses burnt down, museum director Grove and    
    his assistant Pimm find everything destroyed - only one statue           
    withstood the fire mysteriously undamaged. Suddenly Grove is lying       
    dead on the ground - killed by the statue? Pimm finds out that the       
    cursed statue has been created by Rabbi Loew in 16th century and will    
    withstand every human attempt to destroy it. Pimm decides to use it      
    to his own advantage...
