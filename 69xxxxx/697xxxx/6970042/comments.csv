I'm not too sure with opening the album with Don Shimdoa - What Is This Place is a stronger song. Onion is great and the distorted guitar has that warm tubey valve sound that makes an enjoyable listening experience. Everything Fades is a nice acoustic ballad (I think thats an acoustic guitar). On the last word of Everything Fades it would have been nice to hear a Pink Floyd tempo synced echo on the word ""away"" - sort of floating and fading away. If anyone comes across this and likes indie guitar music then download this and give it a listen. May I suggest that you resequence this album with ""This Old Town"" as the opening song followed by ""Onion"". BTW - I'm complete stranger so this is not a ""friend"" review. Nice one."
