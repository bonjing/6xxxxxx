Our March issue is packed full of fitness tips and money-saving ideas. In our comprehensive home workout for the cash-strapped we'll show you how to use a broomstick to improve your mobility, strengthen your core with a flufy pillow and build a mighty back with a tea towel. And after youâ€™ve done the routines, you can use our cheap meal plans to provide the muscle-building nutrition needed to optimise your training.

If your problem is that youâ€™re time-poor, weâ€™ve put together some clever five-minute fixes that will give you the edge in the gym and at the office. Got a bit more than five minutes? Weâ€™ve also examined the intensive P90X exercise programme â€“ made famous by one of the most popular commercials in history â€“ to see if itâ€™s as effective as it claims to be. 

Elsewhere we uncover ten big peaks any man can trek, speak to MMA star Gina Carano about her turn in the action film Haywire and reveal the training required to excel in international rugby sevens. Rugby legend Jonny Wilkinson writes about restoring pride to English rugby, while MF writers attack an adventure race in the Alps and get hands-on with Bulgarian bags and firemanâ€™s lifts to tap into the fitness philosophy of MovNat.
