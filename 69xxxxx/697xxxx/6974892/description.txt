Deathwish, a miniseries spun off from Milestone's Hardware, features the villain in his own series.
From Wikipedia (with minor edits):
Deathwish is a psychotic vigilante obsessed with sex related crimes. A victim of a brutal family raping of which only he survived. Deathwish was first introduced in issue 5 going up against Hardware; Deathwish appeared in Hardware six times and got his own 4 issue spinoff mini-series in December, 1994. It was notable for its use of a pre-operative transsexual protagonist and the exclamation to close the third issue: "Fuck art! Let's dance!" (The comic was penned by Maddie Blaustein)
