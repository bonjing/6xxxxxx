,Smokin69Cheese,2012-02-05T22:13Z,Uploaded the same torrent twice now by mistake. the 2nd torrent has many leechers and a few seeds. this one is no longer on my list. However both address the same files and I dont know if I remove this one will it affect the other? or how many leechers there are or if they can swap to the other torrent with the same data theyve already downloaded... its a puzzle.
