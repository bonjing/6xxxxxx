In the two-hour series premiere, Oprah visits idyllic Sunapee, New Hampshire, for an intimate conversation with rock 'n' roll icon Steven Tyler of Aerosmith. Interviewed just days after the death of his beloved father, he speaks of his parents' influence on him and his own role as an often-absent father of four. Steven reflects on ex-wives and ex-girlfriends, the feuds with bandmates that almost destroyed Aerosmith, his decades-long struggles with addiction, and what he really thinks of the man he replaced on American Idol, Simon Cowell.
