           (SIRIUS 6B, Year 2078) On a distant mining    
              planet ravaged by a decade of war, scientists  
                 have created the perfect weapon: a blade-      
          wielding, self-replicating race of killing     
                devices known as Screamers designed for one    
                  purpose only -- to hunt down and destroy all   
                enemy life forms But man's greatest weapon     
                     has continued to evolve without any human
                      guidance, and now it has devised a new
                      mission: to obliterate all life. Col.
                     Hendricksson (Peter Weller) is commander of a
                        handful of Alliance soldiers still alive on
                          Sirius 6B. Betrayed by his own political
                          leaders and disgusted by the atrocities of
                          this never-ending war, Hendricksson decides
                          he must negotiate a separate peace with the
                          New Economic Bloc's decimated forces. But to
                          do so, he will have to cross a treacherous
                          wasteland where the deadliest threat comes
                          from the very weapons he helped to create.
