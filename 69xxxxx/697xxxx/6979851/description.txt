Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Monday, January 23 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks about the TSA detaining Kentucky Senator Rand Paul at the Nashville airport this morning. 

He also talks with the Deputy Leader of the UK Independence Party and Member of the European Parliament, Paul Nuttall, about the current state of the European Union and other related issues. 

Alex also talks with Bernard von NotHaus, founder of the Liberty Dollar, who will explain his current legal challenges and ongoing fight for financial freedom. North Carolina has characterized the Liberty Dollar as "a unique form of domestic terrorism." 

Alex also covers the latest developments in the Middle East as the EU decides to impose an oil embargo on Iran and Iran has again declared it will close the Straight of Hormuz.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
