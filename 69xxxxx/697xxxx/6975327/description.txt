No Angel - Penny Vincenzi

Product Description
Can wrong ever become right? Does the end justify the means? For Celia Lytton, there are no easy answers to these questions. Strong-willed, tough, and courageous, she moves through life making difficult and often dangerous decisions both for herself and for others, with the most far reaching consequences for everyone . . . For her husband, Oliver, head of the great family publishing house of Lyttons; for Sylvia Miller, whose life of relentless poverty is transformed by Celia's intrusion; for Oliver's daunting elder sister, who is not all she appears to be; and for author Sebastian Brooke, for whom Celia makes the most dangerous decision of all.
