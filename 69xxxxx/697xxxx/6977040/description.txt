Punctured Sky
you are watching me I know
(woooa)
(woooa)

REPEAT THAT

So what do you see?
People wrapped around their TV\'s
whatever that is
I\'m just a kid
spending all of my money at the bar

Punctured sky
you are watching me I know
Woooa
woooa

So do the birds
nest within in the stars
are the fireflies
merely passing cars

So what do I mean to you?
don\'t understand my time here
Wuuuooaaa
What\'s looking through the light
and cover me in fear
covers me in fear...
