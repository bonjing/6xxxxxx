In June 2011, Paul Simon ended his So Beautiful or So What tour of small clubs and 
theatres in the United States by playing Webster Hall, a historic 1,400-person club 
in New York.

The set list was drawn from his legendary career and includes several songs that have 
not been performed live in many years. Kodachrome, Mother and Child Reunion, Gone at 
Last and The Obvious Child are just some of the highlights, along with songs from 
Simons latest album So Beautiful or So What including Dazzling Blue, Rewrite, The 
Afterlife and the album's propulsive title track.

Joining Simon on stage are Vincent Nguini (guitar) Jim Oblon (guitar, drums) 
Mick Rossi (piano) Andrew Snitzer (saxophone, keyboard) Bakithi Kumalo (bass) 
Mark Stewart (guitar) Jamey Hadad (percussion) and Tony Cedras (multi-instrumentalist)
