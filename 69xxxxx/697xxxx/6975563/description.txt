SOME TRIVIA FROM IMDB

With this film, Shane Black became the first writer to sell a script for $1 million. According to Time Magazine, he was originally offered $2.25 million by Carolco Pictures, but decided to go with Warner Bros. for the lower bid of $1.75 million so that he could work with Joel Silver, who had also produced his script for Lethal Weapon. 

The word "fuck" is used 102 times. 

Joe (Bruce Willis) mentions "reindeer goat cheese pizza", which Willis also mentioned in Hudson Hawk. 

Composer Michael Kamen hated the film when he first saw it. The only reason he provided the score was out of his personal friendships with Bruce Willis and producer Joel Silver.
