Rosamunde Pilcher's Four Seasons (Uncut 2008 Miniseries), 360 minutes: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1272883/



Per IMDb: "Endellion, the magnificent country seat of the aristocratic Combe family, sets the scene for a sweeping saga playing out within one eventful year. At the center are three women of three different generations: Julia, banished from Endellion, whose return triggers the turbulent events; Abby, her granddaughter, who wants to know the secret of her past so that she can face the future; Charlotte, Julia's daughter and Abby's mother, who allegedly killed herself but who is still very much alive in the hearts of the Combe family---and perhaps somewhere near Endellion as well."
