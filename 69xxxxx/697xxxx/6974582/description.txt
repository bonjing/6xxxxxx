Hey :)

So i got extremely glad when i discovered some maps scattered all over the web. I have now collected 197 maps for the game Trophy Hunter 2003.

It is indeed a old game but in my opinion it is to this day the best hunting game released.

How to play them:

0. I suggest installing the 1.1 update to Trophy Hunter 2003 before using any of these maps. They might work but some probably wont. Anyway the 1.1 update gives u plenty liked features! Just google trophy hunter 2003 patch and you will probably find some link or maby i will upload a patch torrent :)

1. Download :)

2. a) Extract the files
   b) put them in you "Game" folder. It is a folder inside the install folder. About this location:  C:\Program Files (x86)\Infogrames\Trophy Hunter 2003\Game

3. Enjoy it, restart your game and play the maps! As simple as that!



In case there is no seeder you can contact me at: vidarebefodrat@gmail.com
It will forward your mail to my actual mail so i will probably read your mail within 24hours!

So then hopefully these maps will be availble in 2020 :)
