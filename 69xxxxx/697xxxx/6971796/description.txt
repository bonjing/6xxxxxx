[excerpted from John Stossel's blog:]

Government does too much, but defense is what government is supposed to do: keep us safe from our enemies.

But Ron Paul says our current government goes too far. This week, we debate that.

David Henderson, an economist at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School says Ron Paul is right, but Colonel David Hunt with 29 years in counter-terrorism operations, says Rep. Paul's foreign policy ideas are naive.

We'll continue the debate with former Navy officer Chris Preble from the Cato Institute. He says we could cut $250 billion out of the defense budget without harming national security.

The Army's former head psychiatrist, Brigadier General Loree Sutton and Iraq veteran Mark Dust, the author of a blog about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, will talk about the "hidden" costs of war: mental trauma that veterans suffer. Today's vets are more stressed, says the general, because compared to Vietnam, Korea, and World War II vets, today's soldiers spend more days in situations where someone is trying to kill them.

General Sutton consulted with Garry Trudeau, creator of the popular cartoon Doonesbury, to create military characters that deal with PTSD and brain injuries.

Geraldo Rivera will discuss the perils of journalism in war.

And finally, Judge Napolitano gives the constitutional argument for why terrorists should be tried in court and why the government has no right to kill some of the people it kills.

Tune in tonight for our show on the war over war.
