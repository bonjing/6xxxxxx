And you're the parasite building on the work of others, because all you can do is to reupload something, which is already uploaded by truly valuable users.

It's not my word against yours, it's an obvious logic. Check your latest Fringe uploaded - seeded by only 9 persons, lol. And now see a real deal, @eztv upload - 4726 users! Obvious. He is true original. You're fake and shitty copycat. But no one cares. You better stop wasting your time and you better try to upload something unique. Looser..."
