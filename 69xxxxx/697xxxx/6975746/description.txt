ipfilter updater for utorrent/vuze/bittorrent

to block anti p2p organizations and fake peers

An ipfilter blocks traffic from and to bad IPs and bad ranges of IPs. 
The IPs which get blocked will not be able to upload files to you or to download files from you. 
These hosts are usually fake, created to collect private information about which files you download and will only upload fake parts of the real thing you're trying to download. 
All this will make your privacy on the web even more fragile and results in unnecessary use of your precious bandwidth. 
So, an ipfilter could make your p2p downloads safer, faster and more reliable, even if it's just a little bit.
