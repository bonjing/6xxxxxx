This is a fully searchable lab manual for the ARC General Microbiology courses (440). As far as I am aware, they all use this same $60 disposable manual.

I did not scan in the blank pages; so when you get to the section you will need to turn in, don\'t panic if some page numbers are missing.

Good luck!
