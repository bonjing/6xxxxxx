
British band Chumbawumba will make their musical theatre debuts, performing alongside comedian Phill Jupitus in the new â€œmusic hall comedyâ€ Big Society!, written by their lead guitarist Boff Whalley. Big Society! A Music Hall Comedy is the third in a series of musicals written and composed by Whalley for Red Ladder Theater Company â€“ though the first that band members Jude Abbott, Phill Moody, Neil Ferguson and Whalley have also performed in. It follows Riot, Rebellion and Bloody Insurrection in 2009 and Sex & Docks & Rock â€˜nâ€™ Roll, which toured the UK last year. Big Society! follows the exploits, eccentricities and expletive-related-troubles of an Edwardian Music Hall variety show cast. The musical â€“ featuring 12 brand new songs by Whalley â€“ is set in Leeds in 1912 amongâ€¦â€¦the hustle and bustle of a backstage dressing room. Under threat of closure from the man from the Ministry of Taste, the cast begin to question their loyalties and wonder if theyâ€™re really â€˜all in this togetherâ€™. 
Phill Jupitus, who stars as George Lightfeather, is well known to TV audiences as the longest-serving member of the Never Mind the Buzzcocks team and a regular panellist onQI. His stage credits include Lifecoach and Hairspray (in the cross-dressing role of Edna Everage) in the West End and, most recently, King Arthur in the tour of Monty Pythonâ€™sSpamalot. Jupitus launched the BBCâ€™s digital radio channel 6Music in 2002, was the host of 6Musicâ€™s breakfast show until 2007 and also regularly appears On Iâ€™m Sorry I Havenâ€™t a Clue.
