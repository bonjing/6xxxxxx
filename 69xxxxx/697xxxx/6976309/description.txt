
Nine soul-jazz cuts from the Blue Note vaults from between 1967 and 1970, all previously unreleased, alternate takes, or (in one case) only released on a single, by major figures such as Grant Green, Lou Donaldson, John Patton, Lonnie Smith, and John Patton. 
This doesn't really rate with the cream of the genre -- all of the aforementioned artists have better work in the style available on their own full-length albums, and some of the cuts are fairly unremarkable adaptations of late-'60s soul and pop hits. 
It's a good deal for the collector, though, offering over 70 minutes of material unavailable elsewhere. (AMG)
