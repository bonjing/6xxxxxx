I recorded this from laserdisc to a DVD a few years ago. 
I have never found it on websites or on an actual DVD. 
This is a rare movie, and if you like strange, slightly erotic, 
off-the-wall dark comedies, this is a good one!

Technical specs: This is an .avi video, and there's some 
audio flaws (you'll hear some clicks when you get near the 
middle of the film and near the ending credits) because my 
laser disc had those flaws in them to begin with. I'm sure 
it's the start of what's called 'laser rot' which is why I made 
a DVD of it before it got worse. The video is perfectly watchable, 
though, so please forgive the audio flaws.
