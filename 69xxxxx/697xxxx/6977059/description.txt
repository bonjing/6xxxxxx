Another Perfect Day is the sixth album by the British band MotÃ¶rhead. The album was released in 1983

After guitarist "Fast" Eddie Clarke left MotÃ¶rhead on their second US tour, Brian "Robbo" Robertson (ex-Thin Lizzy, Wild Horses) was drafted to complete the tour. On their return to the UK the band recorded their unique and controversial album - Another Perfect Day.

After this album Robertson and Phil "Philthy Animal" Taylor left to form the band Operator and Lemmy went on with MotÃ¶rhead, forming the new line-up of Lemmy, Phil Campbell, WÃ¼rzel, Pete Gill. None of the songs from the album were performed live after Robertson's departure in 1983 until 2004. Since then, "Shine", "Dancing on Your Grave", "I Got Mine" and "Another Perfect Day" have been featured in the band's live set.
