From Wiki:


The Vines are an Australian alternative rock band originally formed as Rishikesh in 1994 in Sydney. They play a musical hybrid of 1960s garage rock and 1990s alternative music. Until 2011, their line-up consisted of vocalist and lead guitarist Craig Nicholls, rhythm guitarist Ryan Griffiths, bass guitarist Brad Heald, and drummer Hamish Rosser. In December 2011, Channel [V] presenter Jane Gazzo confirmed via Twitter that Griffiths and Rosser had been "sacked" from the band.[1]

The Vines' success in the Australian recording industry resulted in winning an ARIA Award in 2002 for 'Breakthrough Artist â€“ Single' for "Get Free", and receiving five other nominations for their debut album Highly Evolved, plus two further nominations in subsequent years. In 2003, the album went double platinum in Australia,[citation needed] and since then the band has released four albums and a best-of compilation from their time at Capitol Records. Their fifth album and newest release titled Future Primitive was released on 3 June 2011 in Australia with worldwide release dates to be announced.
