Which Side Are You On?, alt-folk legend Ani DiFranco's 16th studio album, and first in over three years, takes its title from the classic 1930s protest tune of the same name, a song made popular by another folk legend, Pete Seeger. It's a fitting sentiment, as DiFranco's been championing the spiritually, financially, and socially disenfranchised since her electrifying (acoustically speaking) 1994 debut, and standout tracks like "Life Boat," "Splinter," and the rousing title cut, the latter of which features Seeger himself on banjo and backing vocals, do little to tarnish her well-earned reputation as a D.I.Y. force of nature.
