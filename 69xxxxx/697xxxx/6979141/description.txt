Set Fire to Flames is a post-rock band of thirteen musicians from Montreal, Canada, who have released two albums on Alien8 Recordings and FatCat Records.

Both of their albums were recorded in states of little or no sleep, in varying levels of intoxication, and in physical confinement, with the result being brooding, eerie music. Their second album was recorded in a barn in rural Ontario; the sounds of the creaking doors and other background noise are heard in the songs. A third album was recorded in collaboration with the band Jackie-O Motherfucker but never released.

Many of their tracks are very minimalist in nature, filled with ambient noise and various other non-musical sound effects, juxtaposed or combined with instrumental music.

The band is often considered a side project of Godspeed You! Black Emperor, and the two musical ensembles share several members.
