Use Looks to add warmth to a wedding video shot on a cloudy day or design a palette for the next Sundance original. Bake in some Magic Bullet love and let color bring out your story.

New tools & presets that inspire you

Looks 2 lets you define the style of your video or film, and its new tools and presets open up a realm of creative possibilities. We've added helpful tools from the Magic Bullet family like cosmetic skin cleanup from Cosmo and the 3 Way color wheels from Colorista II. A professionally redesigned library of presets includes over 30 new looks to add artificial lighting, talent cleanup, a documentary feel, or the grit of a crime drama. Looks 2 has more ways to make people and projects look stunning

Technology & design in perfect harmony

What about satisfying that inner geek? Looks 2 makes your life easier by adding the #1 requested feature, Video Out capability, for an interactive preview on your external device that updates as you work. We enhanced the CPU/GPU handling so it's easier to juggle and render large images. And the complicated Advanced I/O processing of Looks 1 has been replaced with a simpler Gamma processing that runs quickly and more efficiently. With Looks 2, you get more power and speed behind the scenes.
