The Long Good friday is perhaps the best mobster flick ever - certainly for those
with Irish roots. Bob Hoskins is in top form and Helen Mirren quite sexy indeed!

What makes this movie special isn't just the interesting plot and the great
combination of these two best actors on screen - its also the reminder that we get 
the best of men - as Bob Hoskins is - from those places where his spirit reigns
- such as in Italy and Spain and where more of him are to be found to be won over
to the Irish style of great esprit de corps amongst those that accept his greatest
leadership (in real life that is - equally!)

There's none as sexy a gal as a British gal - in the intelligent style of 
Ms. Helen Mirren especially!
