In which Hank and John perform a streamlined show that does not include Hank forgetting the words to ANY OF HIS SONGS...we hope.

This is the full recording of the sixth stop in the The Fault in Our Stars Tour; in Austin, Texas.

It is about an hour and a half long and John and Hank Green are on stage for the vast majority of it. The recording was switched off shortly after the end of the show, so no appearances or shout outs by the Nerdfighters waiting in line, unfortunately.
