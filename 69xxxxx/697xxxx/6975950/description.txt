Adron is an emerging young musician from Atlanta Georgia, and her musical style is amazingly unique.
Exotic Brazilian TropicÃ lia rhythms and tones, mixed with her tongue and
cheek vocals and an amazing voice to match.

When it comes to honest-to-goodness talent as a singer (she sings in three languages on this album),
as a songwriter, and as a captivating performer itâ€™s difficult to top what she does.
