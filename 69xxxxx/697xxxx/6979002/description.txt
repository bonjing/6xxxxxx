Mtaa Mentality (2008)
This, the first album by the critically acclaimed Gospel hip-hop artist - Juliani - offers a a fresh perspective on gospel music, as well as on hip hop, with fascinatingly profound lyrics. If you like Common or The Roots, you're going to love Juliani.  Juliani, a former member of Ukoo Fulani, juxtaposes socio-political conscience and humor that has made him the most popular hip hop artist in Kenya. Enjoy.
