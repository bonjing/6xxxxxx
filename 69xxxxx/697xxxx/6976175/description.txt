Season finale for real this time.
I think. I don't know.
This episode popped up unexpectedly.
Brad and team investigate an area between Anchorage, Juneau and Barrow, Alaska, dubbed "Alaska's Bermuda Triangle," which has a disappearance rate sixteen times the national average. The team interviews local villagers, rescue workers and victim's families and listens to their theories as to why so many ships, planes and people have vanished without a trace.
