Sunday, 22 January 2012


[sebaygo1]


The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events.

The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.

On the Sunday edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks about numerous threats facing humanity -- from the threat of out of control nuclear Fukushima radiation to recent revelations about airborne bio super-weapons. He also talks about his recent article covering SOPA and PIPA and the ominous reality of an internet surveillance panopticon as the elite put their control grid into gear.

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
