          A gay lawyer stricken with AIDS seeks assistance from a        
           homophobic personal injury attorney when a prestigious        
         Philadelphia law firm fires him for incompetence. Not the       
     standard 'issue' movie or even the standard courtroom drama but a   
       sensitive and heartfelt look at the affect of AIDS on family,     
          friends and the people who interact with an AIDS victim.

     After two years of limited distribution, we found it time for our   
     work to be available on a larger scale. Therefore we decided to     
     enable more sites to host our releases by including the             
     'INTERNAL' tag in our directory naming. Our releases aren't         
     internal though; we release them. The good news is we stay who we   
     are and keep being non-competitive.
