These are all live recordings taken by fans who attended this concert.  Each song varies in quality, but all attempts were made to include the best copy available.  I personally attended this concert.  These guys were great live and the lead singer interacted with the audience wonderfully.  What a magnetic personality he had!  Enjoy!
