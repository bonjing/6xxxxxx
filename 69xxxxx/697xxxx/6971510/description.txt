The "Original Unaired Archer Pilot" is actually the first episode of the series ("Mole Hunt")...except Archer is a velociraptor. I finally found this in the Season One torrent provided by MeesterDaveed, so kudos to him for the rip. I decided to seed it as a separate torrent for those who have all the rest but want more Archer. Still, I recommend checking out the extras in Daveed's torrent.
