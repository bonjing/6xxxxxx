DESCRIPTION:

Censorship has been an ongoing issue from the early days of filmmaking. 

One hundred years of film censorship, encompassing the entire 20th century, are chronicled in this work. 

The freewheeling nature of films in the early decades was profoundly affected by Prohibition, the Depression and the formation of the Legion of Decency--culminating in a new age of restrictiveness in the movies.
