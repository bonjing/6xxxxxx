TuneUp Utilities 2012 12.0.2160.13 | 31.0 MB

TuneUp Utilities is a software solution that helps you carry out a regular maintenance of your computer, just to be sure everything is in the right place and you wonâ€™t be assaulted by errors as soon as you press the power button.

First of all, the installation procedure. Deploying TuneUp Utilities on your computer could take a while especially if you go for the Custom mode which will walk you through the whole process in order to select the elements you want for your app.

It took only a few minutes in our case though, but in the end we got a perfectly configured software solution ready to keep our computer in shape.

The interface is the best you can get in this case. TuneUp Utilities is an incredibly complex application with tons of features and numerous tools for optimizing the computer, so an user friendly interface is a must have.

And developers have managed to deliver it, presenting every single function in a very pleasant way. However, if youâ€™re a beginner extra care is always recommended, not only because you could do something wrong, but also because TuneUp must be configured in the right way to get the best results.

All major tools are grouped into tabs, while the settings menu can be easily accessed from the top of the interface. Along with the optimization features, developers have also included a Windows Customization option so, besides cleaning the registry, removing broken shortcuts or accelerating the system shutdown, the user can also change the logon screen, the visual style or modify animations and effects. All of these from a single yet powerful interface.

TuneUp Utilities is, without any doubt, one of the best apps in this category, so paying a reasonable fee for keeping your computer in shape and run it at maximum speed isnâ€™t so much of a bad deal.
