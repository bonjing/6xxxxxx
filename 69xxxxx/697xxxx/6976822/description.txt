Classic bits, all bits no talking stuff, most clips are NOT in my other uploads or the classic complete collections, cuz this is in the CHARACTERS section of phils site...really great torrent esp  if ur getting other people into phil 

LAST TORRENT NOTE:
yea the day is here, i was actually thinking if this day would ever come, the very last phil hendrie torrent released on piratebay 

took me a lil while to realize i ripped his entire site onto piratebay 
his classic collections yrs , his CHARACTERS section, his recent section
(which i never liked i jus upload recent for some people who want to see how bad he is now)

since he doesn't produce any quality shows anymore i feel the phil saga is over and the classic collections will go on till the end of time, 

its like the Simpsons, the classics are always the best, the new stuff , watered down, no soul no personality no family talk no nothing, jus the same boring lines over and over no funny indepth characters anymore ,

 i was reading on the forums oline and it seems phil hendrie was never a ONE man act in reality he had many producers , writers, engineers, sound people, that helped him , from the lines to the funny bits to the topics to the flow, without them the show is just him talking to himself , and with the primere talk networks out the picture for him after he came back from retirement,  he doesnt have the back ground sounds, and no more mass funny callers ,

 the recent ones i heard was so bad ,stick to the classics, so here it is ,
THE LAST TORRENT EVER OF PHIL HENDRIE
ENTIRE PHIL LEGACY IS ON PIRATEBAY 
NOW every section of his site has been categorized and uploaded and seeded , thx everyone!

with his site now up to  10 bucks/month , im canceling subscription and getting lost in the classics, i even wrote a few times to them saying these things, he jus needs money now, his artform is gone 

NOTE : my collection 10 gigs of phil 1999-2005 are ALWAYS seeded jus gotta wait till u catch a seed 

FAST DOWNLOAD as always
