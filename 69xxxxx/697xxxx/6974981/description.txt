the local fan club of Kishore Kumar, the       
fiery Gayatri Garg, "GG", her aunt, friend,    
and confidant, who runs a ...restaurant and    
is a mother figure to Aranya, chubby Gangaram, 
the local shopkeeper who harbors feelings for  
Aranya and Ashok's music band, the ever present
Kishore Bhakts.Aranya's mother left to pursue  
bigger dreams in the city when Aranya was a    
little girl and both father and daughter hope
