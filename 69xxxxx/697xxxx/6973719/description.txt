Hardware was one of the original and most iconic comics launched by Milestone Comics, an imprint of DC comics.  Hardware is one of the few heroes along with Static to make the jump to DC's main universe and appear multiple times including in JLA, Blue Beetle the aftermath of Final Crisis and even in the new reboot of the universe as a mentor to Static.
Hardware is a superhero that wears a suit of armor of his own making to battle the crimes of his own boss Alva. Pretty good stuff
