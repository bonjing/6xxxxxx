    \"Have You Ever Seen the Rain?\" is a song written by John Fogerty and released in 1970 on the album \"Pendulum\" by Creedence Clearwater Revival. The song charted highest in Canada, reaching number one on the RPM 100 national album chart in March 1971. In the U.S., it peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in the same year. On Cash Box pop chart, it peaked at number three.  In the UK, it reached number 36. It was the group\'s eighth gold-selling single
    Some have speculated that the song\'s lyrics are referencing the Vietnam War, with the \'rain\' being a metaphor for bombs falling from the sky. However, Fogerty himself has said in interviews and prior to playing the song in concert that the song is about rising tension within CCR and the imminent departure of his brother Tom from the band.
