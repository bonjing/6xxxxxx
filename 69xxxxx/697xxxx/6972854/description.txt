NOTES:
 
Ok first off i know there is millions of releases already of this film,but not many have full crop of the chairs so
 opted to go down that rd
 Video as been tweaked,changing the brightness,contrast,rgb eq,intes,quad,resize and sharpness
 Audio i have clean in AA and changed all the EQ bands aswell as light hiss removal and then finally saved as a mp3
 
Now for the the read nfo part ....well instead of just using a normal crop and cutting loses off,i went and used a quad crop
 so i can cut at angles and not just up/down/left/right
 Now for this i had to recall the filter in vdub twice ...once for each chair
 Now the downside is it makes the film slightly unlevel has the right side had to be cut more.....and it pulls the video down
 Heres some screenies so you can see how much is lost and what i mean about being unlevel:

Storyline: This English-language adaptation of the Swedish novel by Stieg Larsson follows a disgraced journalist, Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), as he investigates the disappearance of a wealthy patriarch's niece from 40 years ago. He is aided by the pierced, tattooed, punk computer hacker named Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara). As they work together in the investigation, Blomkvist and Salander uncover immense corruption beyond anything they have ever imagined.â€¦


Enjoy!!!!!!!
