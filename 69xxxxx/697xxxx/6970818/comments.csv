Im on a Iphone 3GS on 5.0.1 i have app sync installed, the app syncs but then wont open, it starts to open and then closes.

I had the v1.8 before and it worked ok but then it stopped working....did the same as this new version starts to load and then crashes.

Any ideas? I have already uninstalled app sync and re installed on cydia but still dont work"
