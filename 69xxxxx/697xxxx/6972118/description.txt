No Doubt is an American rock band from Anaheim, California that formed in 1986. The ska sound of their first album No Doubt (1992), failed to make an impact. The band's diamond-certified album Tragic Kingdom helped launch the ska revival of the 1990s, and "Don't Speak", the third single from the album, set a record when it spent 16 weeks at the number one spot on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay chart.
The group released its next album, Return of Saturn, four years later. Despite the Top 40 hit single "Simple Kind of Life" the album was a minor success commercially and did not match the success of their previous but received critical praise and was nominated for Best Rock Album at the 43rd Grammy Awards. 15 months later, the band reappeared with Rock Steady, which incorporated reggae and dancehall music into their work. The album was primarily recorded in Jamaica and featured collaborations with Jamaican artists Bounty Killer, Sly and Robbie and Lady Saw. The album produced two Grammy-winning singles, "Hey Baby" and "Underneath It All". On 22 November 2002, No Doubt received the Key to the City of Anaheim, given by the Mayor of Anaheim, Tom Daly in Disneyland during the band's appearance on 'Breakfast with Kevin and Bean' (KROQ-FM) where they performed 5 songs.
No Doubt released the compilation The Singles 1992â€“2003 and box set Boom Box in 2003, both of which contained a cover version of the Talk Talk synthpop song "It's My Life". Frontwoman Gwen Stefani launched her solo career the next year with several collaborations, including bandmate Tony Kanal as well as Pharrell Williams of The Neptunes, while guitarist Tom Dumont began his side project, Invincible Overlord. During their career, the band has won two Grammy Awards and sold more than 35 million records worldwide to date. The band embarked on a US national tour throughout the summer of 2009. No Doubt was ranked 89th best artist of the decade by Billboard.
