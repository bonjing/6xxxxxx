If this doesn't transport you to an altogether more desirable time and place, then you need to take a look at yourself and unwind a little. (Not that the words in many of these songs support what I'm saying). This is hauntingly beautiful stuff that is somehow more natural sounding than many English folk albums at the moment and compares very favouably with that classic of the genre, No Roses by Shirley Collins with The Albion Band. 

It may not become a classic but this lady is capable of producing one in the future so I'm saving my 5 star review for that. 

If you love English folk music created by artists who so obviously love music making for the sake of the music, download and listen to this with confidence.
