Up the Academy [1980] VHS Rip

This puber-comedy is a kind of mixture between Animal House and Police Academy. Four boys are sent, for different reasons, to a the Sheldon R. Wienberg military academy. The life of dicipline asks a lot of the four geeks. Of course these boys know how to make a party out of the hard times. Will they be real men after one year? Say it again!
