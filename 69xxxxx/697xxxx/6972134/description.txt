Black Ice (album)

Black Ice is the 15th Australian and 14th international studio album by the Australian hard rock band AC/DC. It was produced by Brendan O\'Brien and released internationally on 17 October 2008. Guitarists Angus Young and Malcolm Young got together in London in 2003 to start composing tracks. Delays to its development occurred due to an injury to bass guitarist Cliff Williams and a change of labels from Atlantic Records to Sony Music. Recording occurred on March and April 2008 at The Warehouse Studio in Canada, the same studio as the band\'s previous album Stiff Upper Lip, the eight-year gap between them is their longest between successive studio albums. O\'Brien tried to recapture the rock sound of the band\'s early work, as opposed to the blues orientation of predecessors Ballbreaker and Stiff Upper Lip, and made suggestions such as adding\"soul crooning\" to Brian Johnson\'s singing. Black Ice has the longest running time of any AC/DC studio effort.

Black Ice was launched exclusively in physical formats, as the group does not sell its music digitally. Walmart got exclusive rights for the North American distribution, and was released along with an extensive marketing campaign which included displays focusing on AC/DC memorabilia. Three singles were issued,\"Rock \'n\' Roll Train\", \"Big Jack\" and \"Anything Goes\". Black Ice went to #1 in 29 countries, including Australia, Canada, the UK, and the US. It was the second best-selling record of 2008, behind Coldplay\'s Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends, and had shipped 6 million copies worldwide by December. Critical reviews were generally positive, praising the music and resemblance to the classic AC/DC sound, although some critics found the work overly long and inconsistent. Black Ice was nominated for many awards, including the Grammy, Brit, Juno and ARIA Music Awards; and was supported by a world tour between 2008 and 2010.
