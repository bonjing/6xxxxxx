What's in this version:

- Added a send image option to the menu in the viewer. It works by exporting the image to the phone's gallery, populating a message with it, then deleting the temp image 2 minutes later. If you open your stock gallery and see the image it's likely because you didn't wait 2 minutes :)
- Ported a new advanced image processor that will improve the responsiveness and speed of the Gallery and the Import page

Enjoy and Please Seed :)
