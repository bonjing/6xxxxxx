Around 1,200 BC, an ancient Armageddon destroyed nearly every known civilization. What could have caused it? The theories are many, but most now include one mysterious and massively destructive factor--a force only the Egyptians survived to name: The Sea People.


Who were these warriors and how could they take down the world's greatest powers in a span of just 50 years? Scale the dizzying heights of Crete's mountain fortress with archaeologist Krzysztof Nowicki as he searches for clues.
