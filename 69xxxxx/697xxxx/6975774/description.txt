Hardcore sci-fi action comes to the Wii, with an exclusive prequel that shows just how the necromorph outbreak began. Playing as a new female character you must try to halt the terrifying alien menace and save as many people as you can.
Rather than a slower paced survival horror, this is an on-the-rails lightgun style adventure. That means your character moves automatically as you aim and shoot at the screen with the Wii remote. There\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s much more to the gameplay than other similar games though, with the ability to choose multiple different paths and solve challenging in-game puzzles.

The action and atmosphere is still as intense as ever too, as you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re forced to dismember the necromorph in order to ensure they stay (un)dead. It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s not the sort of game you usually see on the Wii, but that could all change once gamers get their hands on this all-action thriller.

About the Developer: Visceral Games
EA Redwood Shores used to be just another Electronic Arts studio, making games like The Godfather and The Simpsons. Then they were given free rein to work on original projects such as Dead Space and Dante\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Inferno. EA were so impressed they even let them change their name...
