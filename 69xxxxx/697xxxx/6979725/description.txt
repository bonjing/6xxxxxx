SINS OF THE FATHER delves back into the murky and brutal world of organised crime and one of its most notorious families. Picking up from the moment Dominic Noonan is released from prison, Donal MacIntyre captures first-hand the events surrounding Noonan as he tries to regain control of his criminal empire and family after years away inside. However, trouble is never very far away from the Noonan clan and he is soon back in the headlinesâ€¦â€¦and behind bars. This tough and brutal documentary holds nothing back and gives an unprecedented and uncompromising look at what it is really like to be a part of one of Britains most dangerous families.
