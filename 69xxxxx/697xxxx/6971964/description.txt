Unsupervised, featuring the voices of Justin Long and Kristen Bell, is being shown on FX on Thursday nights at 10:30, Eastern and Pacific times; 9:30, Central time.
The timing of the animated series â€œUnsupervisedâ€ is unfortunate. A kind of reversed â€œBeavis and Butt-Headâ€ â€” in which the teenage heroes, while losers in just about every way, are also social strivers yearning for suburban domesticity and dispensing Oprah Winfrey-style affirmations â€” it has the bad luck of coming along three months after the original was revived by MTV. The new show looks awfully pale by comparison.
â€œUnsupervised,â€ which begins on Thursday night on FX, is written and produced by the team responsible for that networkâ€™s raunchy live-action sitcom â€œItâ€™s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.â€ The shows pursue a similar comedic strategy, valuing jolts over jokes. In the first few episodes of â€œUnsupervisedâ€ the laughs are supposed to come from the boundary-pushing (for basic cable) references to erections, sex positions, breasts, sex with angels, maternal drug use and womenâ€™s attitudes toward the male sexual anatomy.
In â€œItâ€™s Always Sunny in Philadelphiaâ€ the raunch is often funny, though, while in â€œUnsupervisedâ€ itâ€™s mostly off-putting; the showâ€™s concept and its tone seem to be at odds with each other. Taking the comic aggressiveness of â€œAlways Sunnyâ€ and applying it to what plays like a sendup of an after-school special must have sounded better at the pitch meeting. The animation, with sharply outlined figures against static backgrounds in a style reminiscent of the FX spy cartoon â€œArcher,â€ has more character than the writing.
Justin Long of â€œNew Girlâ€ and David Hornsby of â€œItâ€™s Always Sunnyâ€ (and this seasonâ€™s short-lived â€œHow to Be a Gentlemanâ€) provide the voices of Gary and Joel, the latchkey children who live in a world bereft of parents save for Joelâ€™s drug-addled stepmother. Adult companionship, if not supervision, is provided by a pair of neighbors, an avuncular Panamanian (Fred Armisen) and a barbie-tending Australian (Russ Rosell), who contribute to a general atmosphere of 1970s and â€™80s nostalgia. Making the connection even stronger are the references to â€œchicksâ€ and a black schoolmate, voiced by Romany Malco, who could be Fat Albertâ€™s slimmer cousin.
The cast also includes Kristen Bell, taking time out from â€œGossip Girl,â€ â€œHouse of Liesâ€ and her movie career. Sheâ€™s amusing as the one girl in school who is uncool enough to hang out with Gary and Joel. But you canâ€™t help thinking that â€œUnsupervisedâ€ would have been less expensive, and maybe funnier, if it had brought Mike Judge over from â€œBeavis and Butt-Headâ€ and had him do all the voices.
