Date: 2012.01

Director: David Gordon Green

Genres: Adventure | Comedy | Fantasy

Plot:
Throughout history, tales of chivalry have burnished the legends of brave, handsome knights who
rescue fair damsels, slay dragons and conquer evil. But behind many a hero is a good-for-nothing
younger brother trying just to stay out of the way of those dragons, evil and trouble in general.
As two princes on a daring mission to save their land, they must rescue the heir apparent's
fiance before their kingdom is destroyed. Thadeous (McBride) has spent his life watching his
perfect older brother Fabious (Franco) embark upon valiant journeys and win the hearts of his
people. Tired of being passed over for adventure, adoration and the throne, he's settled for a
life of wizard's weed, hard booze and easy maidens. But when Fabious' bride-to-be, Belladonna
(Zooey Deschanel), gets kidnapped by the evil wizard Leezar (Justin Theroux), the king gives his
deadbeat son an ultimatum: Man up and help rescue her or get cut off...
