What's New:

Grocery List Improvements

* The grocery list now consolidates similar ingredients (so '1 egg' and '2
  eggs' will be added together and displayed as '3 eggs').

* The grocery list now displays items sorted by grocery store aisle instead
  of by the recipe name (so milk shows up under Dairy and carrots show
  up under Produce).

* When adding recipes to the grocery list, you can now select/deselect
  individual ingredients to add (instead of always adding the entire recipe).

* You can also now add the same recipe to the grocery list more than
  once.

Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue with selecting certain dates in the meal planner.

* Fixed an issue when adding new categories with blank names.

* Fixed a potential corruption problem when emailing recipe attachments.

Other Improvements

* Added significant performance enhancements for users with databases
  containing over 20,000 recipes.

* Improved the performance of the app while running Paprika Cloud
  Sync.

* Improved the print and email formatting of recipes, grocery lists, and
  meal plans.

* You can now update recipe photos via drag and drop onto the image
  well when editing a recipe.
