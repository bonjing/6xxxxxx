Directed by Cesar Monteiro.

Portugal 1981, 35mm, color, 118 min. Portuguese with English subtitles


A bewitching combinatory adaptation of the Bluebeard tale and a 15th century Portuguese fable of a damsel who disguises herself as a knight errant, Silvestre is both radically feminist and fascinated with the dark, primal logic of the paternal order. Monteiroâ€™s earliest collaboration with producer Paulo Branco was among his first to receive international acclaim, with special attention given to Silvestreâ€™s daring use of deliberate artifice â€“ front-projected backgrounds, extended freeze frames, theatrical performances â€“ to capture the fatalistic rhythm and dream logic of myth.


Cesar Monteiro, Poet-Provocateur...

Joao Cesar Monteiro (1939-2003) remains among the most indelible and unusual figures in the history of Portuguese cinema, a visionary and profoundly eccentric filmmaker whose unique contribution to postwar European film is only gradually being recognized today. A cosmopolite imagination tethered by a provincial attachment to Lisbon, a libertine with an obscurely puritanical streak, an unrelenting aesthete guided by an archaic spirit â€“ Monteiro was a deliberately contradictory and difficult artist who obdurately resisted affiliation with any declared â€œschoolâ€ of filmmaking. Monteiro dedicated himself instead to a mode of sublimely, and often perversely, high modernism fascinated by a rich undercurrent between the cinema and the other arts â€“ especially poetry, painting, theater, literature and music. Like the films of his compatriot Manoel de Oliveira (b. 1908), Monteiroâ€™s cinema was also animated by an alternately cryptic and trenchant political agenda that took frequent target at the holy trinity of Church, State and Family still firmly entrenched after the fall of the Salazar dictatorship. In such seminal early works as Paths and Silvestre, Monteiro treated obscure Portuguese myths and legends as Rosetta stones for understanding the darkest shadows of the national unconscious and suggesting the ways in which the countryâ€™s imperialist and patriarchal legacies continue to shape its citizens. In opulent late works like Godâ€™s Comedy and Come and Go, Monteiro channeled his lasting preoccupation with corporality and perverse sexuality into a sustained interrogation of individual agency and collective desire.  

Raised in a devoutly Catholic family yet an avowed atheist as an adult, in many of his late films Monteiro cast himself in the recurrent leading role of â€œJoao do Deusâ€- named for the Portuguese-born patron saint of prostitutes, the infirm and fishermen but a wholly secular figure, a perverse Buster Keaton-like dreamer drawn to young women and possessed of a patient defiance of the established social order. A curious religious logic also guided the development of Monteiroâ€™s extraordinary visual style, which moved from the radical mise-en-scene of the early work towards an increasing austerity shaped, above all, by Monteiroâ€™s proclaimed distrust of artificial light â€“ which reached its apotheosis in Snow White â€“ and his desire to capture the effulgent mystery of sunlight and its shadows.
