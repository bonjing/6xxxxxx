About the \\\"Directors Cut\\\"
The Grandmix 83 \\\"Directors Cut\\\" now ends with \\\"Living on Video\\\" by Trans-X
Tracks 69 to 77 were in the original mix, but not broadcasted due to the maximum time available in 1983.
As the mix now runs on for 4 more tracks, it will be more complete than the one broadcasted in 1983.
Among the tracks removed from the very end are \\\"Zarah - Nina Hagen\\\", \\\"Beat it - Michael Jackson\\\"
\\\"Maniac - Michael Sembello\\\"and some obscure tracks I don\\\'t even remember.
Believe me nothing worth keeping is lost here, as these extra tracks were only in the mix to make sure it
was at least one full hour. Consider this to be the final \\\"Directors Cut\\\"of the Grandmix 83
