    Bernard meets Jane in a Night Club, in London, and he likes her. Her     
    father was killed in a car accident, but Jane thinks he has been         
    killed because he was blackmailed for a picture of his second wife,      
    Jane's mother in law. In the same Night Club Bernard finds the           
    blackmailer corpse and Jane near him, but he believes she is             
    innocent. So Bernard and Jane run away followed by a dwarf, the          
    blackmailer's men, who believe Bernard killed their boss and of          
    course, the Police. They believe that Jerome, Jane's brother, can        
    help them to solve the case. But Jane doesn't know where he is, or so    
    she says. Corpse after corpse, Bernard will find out the truth. But      
    will the truth help him?
