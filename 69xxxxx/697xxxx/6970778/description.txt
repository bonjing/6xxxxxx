In this torrent you'll find a collection of some of the most acclaimed sci-fi, fantasy & horror novels ever written -- all in the EPUB format (which is what most E-readers use). You'll also find (a bit of) non-fiction and historical fiction in the mix, but this torrent consists primarily, in descending order, of sci-fi, fantasy and horror. 

It's a good mix; I doubt many of you will be disappointed. However, if there's anything you don't want when the torrent is finished downloading, scrap whatever you're not interested in.

Quite a few of the books you'll find here are, as of now, impossible to find on torrent sites. So I think quite a few of you will be pleased to find well-formatted copies of books you've been seeking out for a long time here (note: 99% of the books in this collection are well-formatted).

Enjoy.
