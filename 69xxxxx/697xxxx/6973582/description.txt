DVDxDV Pro is designed to restore the audio and video from DVDs to any other Quicktime supported format. If you've ever wanted to re-edit the video, send a clip of it over the internet, or play it back on your iPad, iPhone, iPod, iPod Touch DVDxDV makes this process easy.

DVDxDV Pro allows users of high end editing systems, such as, Final Cut Pro, Final Cut Express, iMovie, Premiere Pro or Avid Media Composer to extract high quality multi-channel audio from DVDs. Each individual channel in a sound track can be exported to a separate 24 bit AIFF sound file. In addition, DVDxDV Pro allows users to reverse the original interlaced field ordering of a DVD. DVDxDV Pro allows you to grab any frame from a DVD and save it to a file. Click the Preview window and drag the frame to the desktop or copy the frame to the Clipboard and use it in Photoshop, Preview or any image editing software.
