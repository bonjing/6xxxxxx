Fallen

Thereâ€™s no police training stronger than a copâ€™s instinct. Faith Mitchellâ€™s mother isnâ€™t answering her phone. Her front door is open. Thereâ€™s a bloodstain above the knob. Her infant daughter is hidden in a shed behind the house. All that the Georgia Bureau of Investigations taught Faith Mitchell goes out the window when she charges into her motherâ€™s house, gun drawn. She sees a man dead in the laundry room. She sees a hostage situation in the bedroom. What she doesnâ€™t see is her mother. . . . â€œYou know what weâ€™re here for. Hand it over, and weâ€™ll let her go.â€ When the hostage situation turns deadly, Faith is left with too many questions, not enough answers. To find her mother, sheâ€™ll need the help of her partner, Will Trent, and theyâ€™ll both need the help of trauma doctor Sara Linton. But Faith isnâ€™t just a cop anymoreâ€”sheâ€™s a witness. Sheâ€™s also a suspect. The thin blue line hides police corruption, bribery, even murder. Faith will have to go up against the people she respects the most in order to find her mother and bring the truth to lightâ€”or bury it forever. Karin Slaughterâ€™s most exhilarating novel yet is a thrilling journey through the heart and soul, where the personal and the criminal collide, and conflicted loyalties threaten to destroy reputations and ruin lives. It is the work of a master of the thriller at the top of her game, and a whirlwind of unrelenting suspense.
