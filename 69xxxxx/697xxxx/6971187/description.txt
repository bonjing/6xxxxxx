In the last years of Duke Ellington's life, the jazz maestro explored the spiritual side of his extraordinary musical gifts. Between 1965 and 1973, Ellington wrote three massive works that combined elements of jazz, classical music, choral music, spirituals, gospel, blues and dance.
He called them his "sacred concerts," and they were performed in churches and cathedrals around the world. He said it was the most important music he'd ever written.
Because of the scale of the music and the sheer number of artists needed to execute each work, Ellington's sacred concerts have rarely been performed in the 30 years since his death in 1974.
