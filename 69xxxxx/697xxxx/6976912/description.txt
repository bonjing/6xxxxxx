[b]Thx Hive

CM8 Doing it right the first time :D


Source: DVDSCR DVD-R NYKOLA06 - thx kk

Encode:
Here comes another DVDScr with watermarks all over, an annoying property mark at
the top of the screen every 15 mins, and some screentext with english and french.
There are already a lot of versions out, but it looks like all are cropped to death
and afterwards either the aspect was fixed or not or nearly, only because of some
NOT disturbing french subs that appear very rarely. if you crop those subs away you
lose around 1/3 of the video on height. that is way too much, and not worth it.

Firstly that property watermarks had to leave, i used transition spots again to
remove them at these spots, the rest of the movie is as it was. Yes 4:3 btw as
it was meant to be with music and nearly no voice. also tweaked the video since
it was too dark, added sharpness and denoise. It does look like a dvdrip now.
if you take a look at my pics and the one from any avi you already got you will
see how much was really cropped.
got very nice
enjoy
