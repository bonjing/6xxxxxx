Kourtney And Kim Take New York S04E09

just out today - stayed till 4 am (CENTRAL TIME) tryin to rip this for u guys 
January 23th Episode

forget the description get it fast

its a m4v rip itunes - i didnt feel like degrading the quality by converting to avi and uploading twice, i already cant play black ops bc my line is being tied up wit this tonite, so if u need avi get  a converter here ur self, as always its a itunes drm rip so playback gets better as the video goes, nothing i can do jus the drm ripped comes like dat 


SEASON NOTE:
PLEASE dont anger me by saying its season 2 , lol 
i dont care what tvrage or rlslog, or the scene says, maybe the tv network is considering the other specials like miami and such to the season because itunes and there own tv network E! network says its season 4 so please dont remind me im going by what they say  

enjoy!

		
THX USER:

"It shows it as season 4 because E! is counting these shows as the same:
Kourtney & Khloe Take Miami as S01 & S02
Kourtney & Kim Take New York S03 & S04

The Scene is recognizing them as 2 different shows, which means new season will start when a new show starts. It's not a big deal, E! just made shit confusing for everyone. 

But uploader is following the right format for HIM. He is not scene. I see nothing wrong with his labels, and on top of that he takes the time to explain it to every single person that questions it...EVERY TIME HE UPLOADS AN EPISODE.

TY atndigcrk for having these episodes up the fastest! I appreciate very much!""
