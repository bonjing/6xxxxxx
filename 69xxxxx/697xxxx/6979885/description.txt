 Source wasn't the best, hoping to see the DVD-R pop up soon so we can  
 do a proper better quality rip. Just ran a few filters over this,      
 ran a bit of a denoise filter, tweaked the brightness/contrast, added  
 a little more colour and ran a slight HQ sharpen over it. Came out     
 pretty sweet.
