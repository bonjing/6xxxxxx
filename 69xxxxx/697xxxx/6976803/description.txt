This episode is worth noting as being the end of a few things.
It was the last appearances of Dan Blocker (who died after this aired 
in May 1972) and Ray Teal (Sheriff Coffee) who had one more role a couple
of years later in a TV-movie.

It was the last show of this season and also the last BONANZA comedy.
"One Ace Too Many" is also the sequel to the previous years
"A Deck of Aces" with Ben's double Bradley Meredith returning.


Guest Stars -- Kate Jackson, Greg Mullavey, and Richard X. Slattery.
