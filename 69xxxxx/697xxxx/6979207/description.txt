[/b][/color] Carly hosts her own home-grown web show, iCarly.
She lives with her twenty-something brother/guardian Spencer and produces her Web casts from a makeshift third-floor loft studio.
Grappling with adolescence, she never aimed to gain fame as a rising star/underground celebrity to kids.
As events unfold in the pilot, it all happens by accident when a teacher puts her in charge of the school talent show.
She and her sassy best bud Sam turn the audition process into a show, which Carly's tech savvy smitten friend Freddy tapes -- including their hilarious banter and great chemistry -- and posts on the Web without telling the girls.
The on-line audience clamors for more, and a pop phenomenon blooms, with Carly and sidekick Sam's regular Web casts ultimately featuring everything from comedy sketches and talent contests to interviews, recipes, and problem-solving.
