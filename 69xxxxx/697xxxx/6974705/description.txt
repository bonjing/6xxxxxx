Casey Jones is the story of a quirky young man with
an irresistible propensity for violence. A lifelong
outcast, Casey learned at a young age to channel
his brutal urges into sports, but after being kicked
off the local hockey team for excessive force during
practice, Casey moves back in with his worrisome mother
to seek solace at his boyhood home. His retreat is soon
interrupted though when a vicious gang of street punks,
the Purple Dragons, savagely beat him with pipes for
attempting to remove their graffiti. After narrowly
escaping the encounter with his life, Casey vows to
single-handedly rid his neighborhood of crime. Armed
with a golf bag loaded with clubs and sporting a fearful
hockey mask, Casey stalks the alleyways by night, mercilessly
trouncing any delinquents unlucky enough to cross his path.
The misguided crusader soon goes off the deep end, and an
unlikely ally from the sewers is forced to intervene
before the vigilante annihilates every criminal in
the city. Written by Polaris Banks
