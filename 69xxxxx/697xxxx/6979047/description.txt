NOTES
============
Another superb MKV from the mysterious and talented ZR, discovered via Google.  Thanks again for your hard work, bro.

Also, I'm now attempting to use web seeds in my torrents.  So far I only have space for about 4 of these MKVs on my server.  Here's hoping I can find more space somewhere...

Screenshots of this and other ~450MB MKVs can be viewed here:


**MKV files are compatible with media players such as MPlayer, VLC, ALLPlayer, foobar2000 and PowerDVD.  For other compatibility, try installing The Combined Community Codec Pack, or consult the website of your preferred media player.

PLEASE SEED LIKE CRAZY (That is, um, if you don't mind...)  Expect moar torrents from yours truly of single episodes, and another for the full season as the episodes come out; until then, I will continue to seed this and other single-video torrents that need it.

Enjoy your ponies, and don't forget to support the show and its community!  :D
