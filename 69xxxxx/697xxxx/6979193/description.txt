[/b][/color] Everyone deserves a second chance -- even a thief, a street racer and a cop who got in a little too deep.
After all, the three women who solve cases for their elusive boss, Charlie Townsend, are no saints.
They're angels... Charlie's Angels.


There's Abby, a Park Avenue princess who became a world-class thief.
Then there's Kate, a Miami cop who fell from grace, losing both her career and her fiance.
Finally there's Gloria, a disgraced army lieutenant who has a way with explosives.
When one of the angels' missions ends in Gloria's tragic death, Charlie persuades them to partner with Gloria's childhood friend, Eve, a street racer with a mysterious past.
