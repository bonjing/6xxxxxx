These creatures are more than ordinary decorations, they are optical illusions!
A picture says more than a thousand words, but in this case we need videos to
demonstrate. When you move your body it seems like the creature follows your
movement and turns its head, looking at you.

Now you can build one yourself! Print it on paper with your printer, cut it out,
fold and stick. That is all!

To make the illusion work: Close one eye, look from a short distance into the
eyes of the creature and rock back and forth. It might take a minute or so
before you see the effect.


Enjoy!
