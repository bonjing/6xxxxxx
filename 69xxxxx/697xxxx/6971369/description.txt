---ABOUT-THE-BAND---

  Karmin is an United States pop music duo consisting of Amy Heidemann
  and Nick Noonan. They are best known for their covers of Chris
  Brown s  Look At Me Now , Nicki Minaj s  Super Bass  and LMFAO s
   Party Rock Anthem .

  The name of the band derives from the Latin word carmen, which means
   song , with a slightly altered spelling to  hint at  karma  .
  Karmin is Boston s premier acoustic pop sound; Armed with two
  voices, a guitar, and a wooden box, Nick and Amy put on a dynamic
  show - full of catchy pop tunes, feel-good ballads, and rock/hip-hop
  inspired concoctions!

   The fresh-faced perky pop stylings of Karmin are infectiously cute
  and catchy and their harmonies are tight and colorful. The
  foundation of the duo is Amy Heidemann - sweet, powerful, jazzy and
  enticing - while the rhythm work of Nick Noonan s cajon and
  harmonies tie everything together into one crisp and splendid
  sound .

---THIS-RELEASE---

  This is for the fans out there that don t have a good internet
  connection to watch all those videos; or for people (like me) that
  also want the songs that are on their YouTube Channel on their
  portable players, besides the 27 songs that were already released on
  the  Covers Volume 1  album. For me, personally,  All of the Lights 
  is a big one missing in the album, unfortunately.

  All 9 songs here were extracted with non-destructive methods
  (without reencoding) from the HD versions of the videos. Only the
  very last part (cutting/editing the start and ending of the songs,
  plus normalizing/parametric equalizing) was done by reencoding under
  the best possible quality environment. The result is obviously not
  perfect (far from it), but sounds good enough for me, specially for
  listening in a portable device.

  Bear in mind that this collection of songs is absolutely NOT
  OFFICIAL and only intended to expand even further the incredible
  fan-base that this amazing band already has.

P.S.: Song 03 (No Scrubs) was also given for free on their facebook,
      but the quality of the mp3 file (160Kbps) wasn t better than the
      one inside the HD video.

P.S.2: There is also a single for song 04 (Super Bass ft. DJ Questlove
       on the drums), but I regret that it doesn t have the very funny
        old keyboard intro  followed by the  Nick, can we try something
       more modern? ... I bought that also, and on my portable I can t
       really differentiate the quality between both versions (and I like
       the one with the  joke  intro better).

P.S.3: If you d rather embed the full 600px. 168Kb jpeg (custom) cover
       image in those audio files, it is provided as well (front.jpg).
       You can just use any program of your preference for that; I do
       recommend Softpointer Tag&Rename; though.
