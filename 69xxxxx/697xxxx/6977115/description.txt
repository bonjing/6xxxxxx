This is Muv Luv Alternative by Ã¢ge. This game is 18+ and in English. It\'s a title known for it\'s high production values and well-written story, with mecha combat and political intrigue. 

This is direct sequel to Muv Luv, so I highly recommend playing the original game first. The torrent for it can be found here:

Muv-Luv Alternative takes place after the events of the original Muv-Luv. Alternative focuses on the life of Shirogane Takeru three years after Muv-Luv; Takeru wakes up believing that everything that had happened was just a dream. However, he notices something wrong: he has been sent back in time to the beginning of the events in Muv-Luv: Unlimited. But instead of letting a disaster strike again, he decides to help stop it before it even begins. The solution: helping to complete Alternative IV.
