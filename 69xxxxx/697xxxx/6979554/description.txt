These files were not ripped by me but (ostensibly) by the folks at holyfuckingshit40000 dot bl0gsp0t dot comic-minus-the-ic who distributed them through M3gaUpl0ad. They claim to have been ripped using EAC, and were originally encoded with FLAC 1.1.4, though I've recompressed them (without any loss of quality, of course) with the slightly more efficient FLAC 1.2.1. While I can't 100% vouch for the accuracy of the rip, the files sound excellent and the scarcity of the material in question compels me to upload it regardless. With the death of M3gaUpl0ad, most of these rips will likely disappear without the help of the torrent community.

Please seed for as long as you can. Let's keep these hard-to-find rips alive and available to anyone interested.
