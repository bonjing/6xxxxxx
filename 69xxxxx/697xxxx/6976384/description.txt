The Minds Eye [1990] VHS Rip

The Minds Eye is a compilation of experimental computer animations from when such technology was in its early infancy. The animations are from various studios, having been arranged in a sort of 2001 evolution-timeline theme, and set to synthesized music. These pioneering CGI projects later gave rise to films such as Toy Story, A Bug's Life, Antz, and Shrek.
