NOTES:

Right sources ....arbic release was bad,loads cropped hardcoded subs + custom hardcoded subs in yellow,url hardcode
top left corner ...bascially very poor.....Audio was ok for cam though.
Lum1x...much better video,but still not great by far.Got some issues though and the big one was the camera movement,also
capped at a angle,rainbow effect,washedout and no english audio.
Audio used on this release is off the arbic release as its the only audio out to date....used the lum1x release as he synced it
and saves us a job :)

Workdone ...
first took the lum1x source files and encoded it ...had to use heavy noise filter aswell as a HQ smoother too clear the noise,also
needed to increase the contrast as it was washedout.Lower the chroma alot as the color was overpowering....also due to the angle it
was capped at had to use a quad filter to pull the top and bottom borders level before i cropped it.
There was lots of camera movement but after i levelled the top and bottom is was only now moving up and down so found the worse parts
and cropped from there ....no way cutting this up into 30-40 pieces to crop it 100% right,thats how bad the movement was.
Also the intro,well first 3mins 24 secs had most of the cam covered up so this is where i used the arbic video to fill in the parts you couldn't
see aswell as adding the missing 1min 30 secs missing from the russian cam at the start.....so now this is a complete release.

Audio i have filtered but using a heavy noise filter and light hiss filter aswell as changing the EQ bands....sounds good for cam now :)

Readnfo ....
Well to clear things up the talk of missing 16mins is untrue ( found out later,buth thought the same myself at first ) what it was is the russian source
files repeated the final scene again and gave a runtime of 1hr 32 mins......only thing missing off the russian video was 1min 30 secs at the start,which 
i have now replaced.
Also just too warn these underworld flicks have never been great as cams and never will ....so if your really fussy,then wait a few mths for the R5,if not
grab and enjoy this top flick :)
