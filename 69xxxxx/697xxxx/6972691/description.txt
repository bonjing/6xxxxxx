A romantically unattached woman, Annie, (Lexi Swallow), fears she is losing her BFF, Lillian, (Sarah Vandella) when Lillian announces her engagement. To make matters worse, Lillian has become very close to her bossâ€™s wife, the rich and sophisticated Helen (Katie St. Ives), who takes over control of all of the wedding plans after Annieâ€™s attempts fail miserably. The bridal group includes the promiscuous tomboy Megan, (Sasha Knox) who propositions every man she meets, the new bride Beca (April Oâ€™Neil), who experiences her first lesbian experience with Lillianâ€™ cousin Rita (Kagney Linn Karter). After Annie discovers Helen is also fucking her pseudo boyfriend, she seeks comfort from the cock of a friendly Irish cop who pulled her over thinking she was drunk.
