THE HOLY TABLETS

 

This Holy Tablets is Divinely Inspired.  This Tablet is a Holy As Your Holy Bible and Koran and It is to be Treated in the Same Way.  This is a Revelation for you from the Most High to set Straight the Records to Remove the Falsehoods.  The Koran Has not Changed the World, Nor Has the Torah or the New Testament.  They have Done Nothing for us the Nubians but were Used to Enslave Us, So the Most High and His Heavenly Hosts Have Decided that It Was Time to Renew the Nubian History.  It is Time for the Nubians to Have their Own Scripture for their Spiritual Upliftment and Guidance.
