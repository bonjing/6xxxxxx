This is indeed only for classic game boy games. There is another torrent for gameboy color roms. I also have the collection of GBA games as well (about 6 GB), but I haven't shared it yet because of my poor upload bandwidth. I'm looking for some sort of seedbox to help me with the initial seed, and if I find a solution I will share it soon :)."
