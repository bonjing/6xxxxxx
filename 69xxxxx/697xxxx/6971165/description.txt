Turn your phone into the ultimate motion triggered SpyCam!

Turn your Android phone camera or remote camera into a visual motion triggered SpyCam. Your phone or remote camera will auto-capture (still photo or video) any motion within its field of vision, and then save or email the photo/video. Can be used as a serious surveillance solution, as this application has already caught several criminals in the act of stealing cars and breaking into houses. Can also be used to take candid snaps of your friends when they donâ€™t know they are on camera â€“ now that is some good fun!

What will you spy on?
