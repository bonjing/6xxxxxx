"Control" is the sixth album of Dept's musical career, is the album that opens a new decade of trajectory of the catalan band from Manresa (Catalonia) that step by step has accomplished the goal of become in one of the best rock bands of Catalonia (and in my humble opinion of Spain :-) and with their musical bagage they are lately more and more demanded outside Catolonia fronteers to perform live around the world.
"Control" includes 11 songs with an exquisite production that embraces rock with pop gently. 
The album "Control" also includes Dept's first performance (X Tour) broadcasted live in Barcelona (Sala Bikini) in DVD that summarize their musical trajectory.
I have also uploaded this in another torrent.

Dept keep incombustible as always and surprise us always, improving themselves in every new album they release.
