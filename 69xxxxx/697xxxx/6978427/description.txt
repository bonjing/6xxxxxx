For her second major-label release, Laura Love is benefited greatly by her backing musicians. Rod Cook displays some nimble-fingered guitar playing and Barbara Lamb provides fiddle work, and co-wrote several tracks, that is intregal to the sonic tapestry of Shum Ticky. Love employs an engaging vocal delivery that resembles an edgier, more versatile Natalie Merchant. Lyrically, the songs are often quirky and borderline nursery rhymes like "Mahbooty" and the highly-rhythmic "Aha Me A Riddle I Day." Other lyrics tend to bead in on a more personal nature as on the fractured self-view of "Punctured And Hissing," the mantra-like "Less Is More," with its stutter-step melody and bracing fiddle, and "Sorry," a gentle ballad recognizing the futility of a failing relationship. All of that and a guest appearance by rapper Sir Mix-A-Lot on the perculating "The Clapping Song" makes Shum Ticky a record that shows why Love has acquired a loyal following and critical kudos
