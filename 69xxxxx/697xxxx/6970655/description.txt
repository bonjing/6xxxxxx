As consumer demands increase and global competition intensifies, the industry must find ways of engineering certain performance requirements into textiles and apparel. Written by two highly distinguished authors, this book reviews how fabrics and garments can be engineered to meet technical performance and other characteristics required for the specific end-use. The authors cover fabric and garment handling and making-up performance, and wear appearance issues such as wrinkling, pilling, and bagging. They also discuss fabric and garment drape, durability related issues, physiological and psychological comfort, fire retardancy, waterproofing, breathability, and ultraviolet protection.
