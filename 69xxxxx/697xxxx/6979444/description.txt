NOTES:

Ok considering we don't have the vobs ( unless someone kindly offers us them,cough,cough ) we had to use
the avi rip thats been posted on public sites early this morning.
First off thanks riskee for taking the risk and sharing with all :) ....the file itself was a poor encode ..2pixels left
at the bottom,the for your consideration was half cropped off aswell...it looked washed out and due too really low bitrate,it
also starts to break up .
Audio was fine AC3 5.1 untouched so all good there.
Workdone:
Well can only do so much considering the source we have ...however we cropped the border that was left and it was only another 8 pixels
to clear all the watermarks so decided to use that and then resize to 720 x 288 to keep the AR bang on.
Also increased the brightness,contrast,chroma and added some sharpness....
