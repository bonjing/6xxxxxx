---------------------- iPhone 4S + iPad 2 Jailbreak is here! ------------------------
This is the jailbreak released by the "DreamTeam" and is available now to the public. 
LOOK-LOOK-LOOK---&gt; This jailbreak *ONLY* works for the following devices/iOS:
           iPhone 4S v.:5.0.0, 5.0.1              iPad 2 v.:5.0.1
THIS WONT WORK FOR AN IPAD WITH 5.0.0!!! Update your iPad to 5.0.1 if you've not yet.

The program is called Absinthe, and works great. It is tethered... requires your computer and iDevice to be connected to each other. Once you plug in your device, open absinthe and it will provide you with the details of your device -
                         example) iPhone 4S 5.0.1 found

Simply click jailbreak, do not touch or unplug your device until the message appears in the loader: Unlock your lock screen if needed and tap the jailbreak icon. 

The absinthe program will be on your home screen and it boots up to Cydia permanently once you open it. It should open, but if you get an error like many do (due to an extreme overload in server access) just retry but doing the following:
Exit out of the app - Open up your open processes by double tapping home button - 
Hold down 'Absinthe' and close the app with the minus tab - Reopen absinthe.
Redo these steps until your device is given access to the server and it will load up Cydia and your device is free! It took some time, but it is amazing that it is finally here.
