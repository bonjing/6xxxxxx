DEATH RALLY ainâ€™t messinâ€™ you aroundâ€¦ A one-time purchase for your multiple devices! Universally designed for iPHONEâ„¢, iPADâ„¢, also with gorgeous OPTIMIZED FEATURES for IPAD2â„¢. Brought to you from REMEDY, renowned developer of MAX PAYNE and ALAN WAKE! LOAD YOUR GUNS, START YOUR ENGINES... IT WILL BLOW YOU AWAY, LITERALLY! This is no Sunday Drive. This is DEATH RALLY. The classic top down racer is back, stronger and more vicious than ever. Make a run for the finish line with a trail of broken glass and spent brass behind you... along with the flaming wreckage of any fool dumb enough to get in your way. 

* IGN: "Death Rally hits the target."
* Toucharcade: "The highlight of Death Rally is the fantastic visuals, with support for Retina Display devices and full screen anti-aliasing on the iPad 2" 
* Modojo 4/5: "Death Rally made one hell of a debut, and the promise of free content will transform this already impressive shooter into one of the iPhone and iPad's premier Apps" 

Arguably, the best looking racing game for the iPhone and iPad. Race against incredible boss drivers like DUKE NUKEM. The gameplay is addictive, intense, explosive fun, with racing + weapons = awesome! Lock and load and enter the Death Rally, humiliate and destroy your opponents or sabotage the race. You choose how you win, NO TRICK IS TOO DIRTY!
