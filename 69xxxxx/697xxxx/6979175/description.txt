    Tony Robinson and the team visit a tiny windswept          
    island off the coast of Wales. The only way to get to     
    it is by rigging a 500-metre zip wire way above the      
    wave-lashed rocks.                                        
                                                               
    Incredibly, it seems that Gateholm Island in              
    Pembrokeshire was once inhabited, but whether by Romans  
    Vikings, Celts or druids nobody knows.                    
                                                               
    A handful of mysterious objects were found on the         
    island years ago, including a rare Roman stone phallus   
    and a beautiful bronze stag, suggesting that it may       
    have been some sort of religious centre.                   
                                                              
    Of course, the team have to dig for answers, but the     
    weather's throwing everything it has at them. To make     
    their task that bit tougher, they discover they also       
    need to dig at a second site a quarter of a mile away.    
    Although this one, thankfully, is on the mainland.       
                                                              
    Team leader Francis Pryor thinks it looks like what        
    they're investigating is a classic Iron Age fort, with    
    curved banks and ditches on one side and a sheer cliff   
    on the other.                                             
                                                               
    If he's right, it should give Phil Harding and his        
    diggers at least enough work to keep them busy for       
    three days. And if he's wrong, there's no hiding place    
    on this beautiful but bleak coast!

     As per usual channel 4's numbering is a mess, they        
     previously listed another episode as s19e01, that has    
     now changed however, and this episode is now listed as  
     episode 1
