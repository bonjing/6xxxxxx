I downloaded and created these files to view on a DVD player while I build. I like them so much that now I am sharing them for everybody to use. I purchase tons of stuff from Brownells and highly recommend them for all your gunsmithing or shooting needs. These videos are very in-depth and give tons of info. They had me building my first AR in no time. There are 52 videos in MP4 format, to keep them as universal as possible for most DVD / Blu-ray players.

If you like the videos please rate and seed.

Thanks to everybody that seeds, keeping the information flowing for all.
