Loaded Magazine UK - February 2012 

Loaded is the original, funniest and best mens magazine. Created in 1994 by a bunch of 
blokes with a love of football, girls, music and comedy, Loaded launched the mens lifestyle 
market. 17 years and over 200 issues have passed, but the magazineâ€™s mantra still remains. 
Alan Partridge, Kevin Keegan, Frank Skinner, Noel Gallagher, Britney Spears, Kelly Brook 
and Vikki Blows have all graced the cover over the years. So whether youâ€™re after beautiful 
women, cutting edge journalism, interviews with the best actions and musicians, or just 
irreverent silly-buggery loaded will never disappoint.
