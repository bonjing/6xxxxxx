This is from a live recording at a health conference where Lee Dexter, who operates White Egret Farm in Austin, TX gives a speech in front of a large crowd at a health conference. Her farm is best known for its organic food products, especially raw goat\'s milk, raw cheese, raw cows milk and other natural dairy and meat products. 

She used to be a lead scientist and holds a masters degree in Biology. She had the local government come after her for raw milk and was able fight back against the department of agriculture. It appears that pasteurization of milk was only invented to allow milk to last longer, that is all, just to allow people to make more money.

In this one hour she explains the science behind raw milk and the truth that the department of agriculture and other government agencies do not want you to know.

Raw milk is SAFE, but it is important to know it is only safe if it comes from a properly taken care of farm that has their animals grass fed, they are very healthy and that the farm is very clean. Sadly, this is not how it is for mass produced cow and goat milk.

The reason why so many people are having hard times being able to drink store bought milk is because the good bacterial is killed, your body needs these enzymes.

Fact: If you pasteurized and homogenized cow milk and gave it to their young, they would die... Fact: if you pasteurized and homogenized breast-milk, your newborn would die... So why are we as adults drinking it?


Get educated, learn the facts from proven science, not from what the television box tells you to believe or better yet the government promises you is truth.
