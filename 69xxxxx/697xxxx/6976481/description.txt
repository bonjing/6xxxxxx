Michael Chapman is possibly the finest singer songwriter and guitarist to 
emerge from the UK folk blues explosion of the 1960s.

From groundbreaking albums on the Harvest label, that were favourites of 
John Peel and the underground set in general, through to recent 
collaborations with Jack Rose (R.I.P) and Thurston Moore, he has 
mesmerised listeners around the world with his dark bittersweet tales and 
devastating finger picking.

Most of his albums are still available on CD, so I have no intention of 
denying him his royalties by posting them here. However I do offer the 
following recording for you delectation.

This was recorded for a Los Angeles radio station in June 2011 and gives the 
briefest taste of his remarkable talents.
