s occasionally when there is a fight. 
specially at end of the movie. I suppose the sound quality bit medium quality 
the format says AAC and the bitrate is 128 Kbps.
so you will be fine. however if you have been looking for a relatively quality BluRAY rip then this one is highly recommended by me. "
