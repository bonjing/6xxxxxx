One of the essential Hard Rock albums of the 1980s. Itâ€™s a big sounding album: awesome vocals, guitar heroics, layers of harmonies. Itâ€™s an album that blends the Blues based Rock of the â€™70s with the technical prowess of the â€™80s. It is the result of the songwriting collaboration between singer David Coverdale and guitarist John Sykes, and it has everything one could ask of good pop music: melody, wit, energy, and immaculate production.
