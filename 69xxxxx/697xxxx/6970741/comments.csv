iso.001

3. Rename them like this:
NTG2_2012.iso.001 -> NTG2_2012.iso.002
NTG_2012.iso -> NTG2_2012.iso.001

4. Download HJSplit and use it to join the two files (select the .001 file and it will join the two automatically).
5. You will now have a TNG2_2012.iso file
6. Use ImgBurn (2.5.7.0) to burn on a Verbatim DVD+R at 2.4x speed.

It worked perfectly! Update on the device took "
