Plot: RubÃ©n is a lonely truck driver who has been covering for years the motorway from AsunciÃ³n del Paraguay to Buenos Aires, carrying wood. However, today's journey will be different. This morning, in a motorway stop near AsunciÃ³n, Jacinta shows up an hour later to begin a journey by track which is going to take her to Buenos Aires. Wath's more, RubÃ©n finds out at that very moment that little AnahÃ­, who's 8 months old, will travel with them- It is not the best beginning. As kilometres go by, th relationship between RubÃ©n and Jacinta will grow. they will slowly meet and sip into each other's soul. None of them talks much about their lives. None asks much either. It's a few word journey but it is not a silent one. (IMDB)
