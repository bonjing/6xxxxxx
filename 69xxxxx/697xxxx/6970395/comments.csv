Once I got to episode 5 in the first season (uploaded by the same dude), the image started breaking up into three rows on full screen. I tried it on two different programs, including VLC. Horrible. So I checked season 2 in full screen also. This one isn't as bad. The core episodes are all watchable.

Don't download the OVA, however. It has the same issue as season 1."
