Including something like James ""The Angry Video Game Nerd"" Rolfeâ€™s ""Rocky Jumped a Park Bench,"" a touching, heartfelt guided tour through various sites in Philly where the series was shot, would have been a great inclusion. Or providing fans with the scores of deleted/alternate scenes from ""Rocky V"" (which are currently available on YouTube) or a Director's Cut of that film. Unfortunately, MGM misses the opportunity. Even the easter egg from the ""Rocky V"" DVD is missing."
