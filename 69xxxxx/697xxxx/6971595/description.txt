This is from an old VHS copy I had of this brilliant yet too quickly cancelled series starring Chad Lowe.  As far as I know, only 6 episodes were produced, of which I only have this one single episode left.  "The World's Worst Date" features a young Terry Farrell (Deep Space 9) as the gorgeous blind date.
