Genuine DVDrip, color widescreen, very rare.

This is the REAL story of the Pan Am jet set in 1963, as opposed to the new American series. It has REAL 707 planes, and the pilots don't look like teenagers from Baywatch. There are REAL locations from New York, Paris and Vienna in 1963, including the airports. A treasure for all 'planespotters' and lovers of airline history.

Well, the romances were not much better, but can be endured because of all the historic details. And Pan Am's logo has been altered, probably because of copyright disputes. But the planes are real. And of course, there is Frank Sinatra in the title song.

The real captains and pilots in Pan Am around 1963 where actually quite old and called "Skygods" because they behaved like almighty ship's captains, having been with the airline since the age of flying boats. Promotion went strictly by seniority. 

This film has not been published on DVD in the U.S., but I managed to find a European edition.

The film opened on 27 March 1963, which was en exciting year for aviation. Pan Am was at its summit as the world's leading airline. In May 1963, Pan Am revealed that it had ordered the British-French Concorde, and President John F Kennedy felt humiliated. In a speech on June 5, 1963 at the US Air Force Academy, Kennedy committed the United States to the development of a superior "SuperSonic Transport", the SST, a dream that never came true. 
In 1963, Boeings second passenger jet, the 727, flew for the first time in February, and Douglas started to develop the DC-9.

Widescreen color, DVDrip XviD 2-pass 720x320, original mono sound AC3.
Synch tested, runs well in both my standalone DivX players.
No subtitles on the DVD.
