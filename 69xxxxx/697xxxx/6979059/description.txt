Well this is the REWORKED version of this project. From the first moment i 
was not pleased with the outcome of the project. Quality of the recordings 
was not right (mainly audio) and some of the DVD's had a lot of problems. 

So, i decided that this needed a REWORK when i could do it. Finaly that 
day arrived and now due to a better way of capturing my old VHS tapes the 
outcome of this is much better.

The setlist of these reworked versions will be the same but quality will 
be much higher than the first versions of it. So, drop the old ones and 
grab these

Hope this will please you and gives you much joy has i had putting this 
up. 

Just a special word for the band who made all this possible, without them 
and their music this would not be here. Thank you boys.
