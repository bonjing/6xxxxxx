Description:
Young Christians Beth and Steve, a gospel singer and her cowboy boyfriend, leave Texas to preach door-to-door in Scotland . When, after initial abuse, they are welcomed with joy and elation to Tressock, the border fiefdom of Sir Lachlan Morrison, they assume their hosts simply want to hear more about Jesus. How innocent and wrong they are.

Note : This isn't a "webscr" or a VODRiP mislabeled as a dvdscr, it's an actual dvdscr, and as such, it had some serials that needed blurring. Beyond that, nothing but a little filtering and cropping has occurred here. We could have very easily mislabeled this as a 2012 movie, since that is when it's being released, but we would rather you actually know what you're downloading, than to pretend like we're more important than we are. For those of you that are unfamiliar with this title, it is a reimagining of the film The Wicker Man(The original, not nick cage), directed by the same woman as the original. Hits theaters the 27th, so enjoy.
