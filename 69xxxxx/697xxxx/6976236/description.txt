VueScan 9 is the world's most widely used scanner software.

VueScan is a replacement for the software that came with your scanner and supports most flatbed scanners, printer/scanners and film scanners. Over 10 million people have downloaded VueScan since it was first released in 1998. Whether you are looking for more advanced features that your scanner vendor doesn't provide, or your scanner vendor no longer supports your scanner, VueScan 9 helps you get the most out of your scanner.

Compatible with over 1850 Scanners

VueScan 9 is compatible with over 1850 different scanners, including most HP, Canon, Epson, and Nikon scanners. The best way to see if your scanner works is to download VueScan (it only takes 60 seconds). You can also check this list of supported scanners.

Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux

VueScan 9 works on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Many scanner vendors will stop supporting a scanner and it will stop working on a new operating system. VueScan 9 solves that problem and lets you use your old scanner again.

VueScan Mobile for iPad and iPhone

If you have an iPad or iPhone, you can use VueScan Mobile Free for scanning. This is a completely free program that's available in the app store.

Outputs scans in a variety of formats

VueScan 9 can output scanned documents, photos, and film in PDF, JPEG and TIFF formats. It can also recognize text using OCR and create multi-page pdfs using both flatbed scanners and scanners with automatic document feeders
