Debra, surprise, surprise. 
EE comes to you all the way from.........Aberdeen.

I am surprised how many want these uploads.
There are hundreds, maybe thousands that can't wait for the omnibus !!

I send EE to a good friend in Norway first, then upload it to TPB.
I hope that maybe one day she'll repay me for all these favours, and become an even better friend !!

I uploaded the first part of a series on BBC1, called "Birdsong", but two others also uploaded it, so I will mostly upload documentaries from BBC3 and BBC4   e.g."BBC4 Amazon Rainforest".

You don't sound very Polish, I guess that you are probably an ex-pat ?
