SOME TRIVIA FROM IMDB

The most famous scene of this film originated by an accident. In the filming of a chase scene down a steep slope, Buster Keaton inadvertantly dislodged some rocks which tumbled down after him as if in pursuit and he had to scramble to dodge them. At a preview showing, Buster saw that that accident got the biggest laughs in the film. Thus inspired, Buster decided to reshoot the scene with over a hundred papier-maiche "rocks" with sizes ranging from pebbles to six foot boulders so his character would have to deal with a massive avalanche in the scene. 

In his desperate search for a woman - any woman - to marry, Buster Keaton is passing a variety theater. There is a large picture of a visiting artiste who is playing there, and Keaton bribes someone to let him go in at the stage door. As he goes in, a workman removes a box that was obscuring the bottom of the poster ... and we see the name of the "artiste" ... Julian Eltinge. Eltinge was a famous female impersonator, so famous that no further explanation is needed when Keaton almost immediately emerges, looking disconcerted. 

Buster Keaton had this project foisted upon him by producer Joseph M. Schenck, who had bought the rights to the hit Broadway show. Keaton later called it his least favorite feature and tried to keep film historian Raymond Rohauer from restoring the only known copy of the movie.
