LÃ -bas AKA Down There (2006)
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0855869/


In LÃ -bas Akerman approached a subject directly linked to her own history. Although Akerman did not want to make a film in Israel, convinced that neutrality would be impossible and that her own subjectivity would interfere, she found herself shooting LÃ -bas while teaching and living in Tel Aviv. Akerman's film evolves from the confines of her apartment. In the film we rarely see Akerman; she leaves her apartment only for the occasional visit to the shore. Voice-over narration serves as the framework for her reflections on family history, her Jewish identity, and her childhood. She wonders whether normal everyday life is possible in this place and whether filming is a realistic option. With no intentions defined in advance, the film takes its natural course.
