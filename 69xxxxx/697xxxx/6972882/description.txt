This is the audio from the end of the movie Shortbus, ripped
from the DVD and featuring Mx Justin Vivian Bond singing "In The
End" with heart and soul.  vs "Dendrophile" album version of the
song is available in another torrent but I like this movie
version which features the rowdy Hungry March Band ending.

There are three versions in this torrent:

Long   - About 8 minutes long, from the time Caleb says "I'll be
         back in five minutes."
Medium - About 6 1/2 minutes long, from the time Bitch and the
         others start playing violins.
Short  - About 5 minutes long, from the time Mx Justin Vivian
         Bond starts singing "In The End".

All three fade out just before the distortion Sofia hears as she
begins having her first orgasm.

I realize this music is on the soundtrack CD but that version is
a great deal different.  I like this one straight from the movie
best, so here it is.  I'm upping these in two separate torrents
as FLAC and MP3.
