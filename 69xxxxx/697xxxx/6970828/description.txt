Hello and Thank you for downloading!

To Install Run the game do the following:

First Make a Short-cut of HL2Loader.exe (recommended) or hl2.exe in a desired Folder.
Then Right click the short cut and add '-game garrysmod' at the end of the line where it says TARGET.s (Picture 1)
	Example: "D:\My Stuff\Garry's Mod 11 (rev104)\HL2Loader.exe" -game garrysmod
You are now Ready to go.

For Multiplayer:
If you are to Host , lets say a LAN game do the following.
	Fire Up a game and Open the Console.
	Type in: sv_lan 0
	If not : sv_lan 1
	If it still does not work:
		1:  sv_lan 0
			retry
		2:  sv_lan 1
			retry
This should work!
Note: It must be the same Revision(patch) of the game! So use this one for the best results!

Other Stuff about the RIP:
The game may Crash on some stages depending on the OS, or some other stuff that I cannot figure out.
(some times killing a Combine or Entering some Out-of-Map Zones.
Thats all! I tested most of the addons and they work!
Have fun.

All the Credit for the game goes to Garry Newman.
All the credit fot the RIP/Non-steam Version goes to SAS41.

Please bare in mind, if you like the game BUY IT!
