5. Men Who Love Women

Danish drama series about the fight for political power - and the personal sacrifices and consequences this has for those involved on and behind the political stage.

With the support of her Minister of Trade and Industry, Birgitte puts forth a proposal for gender quotas on Danish companies' boards of directors. The proposal meets resistance both in and out of government - and the country's most powerful businessman gives Birgitte an ultimatum that could have serious consequences. Meanwhile, members of the media choose to focus on the very attractive and ambitious Minister's private life, which turns out to be morally problematic. While Katrine turns down at first an offer of help to take better care of herself, Kasper gets into a muddle with the ladies.
