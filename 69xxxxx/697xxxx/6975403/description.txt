              been divorced due to incompatibility arising             
               mainly due to his businesswoman mother,                 
              Shalini's hatred of tennis, and he lives with         
            them every alternate month. Both would like              
            him to get married, and accordingly Shalini             
          picks London-based Kamiah, while Siddharth             
           picks Bhatinda-based Manjeet Ahluwalia. Chirag,       
          who sneaks off to practice tennis at night, is       
            asked to make a choice but informs them that he        
          is in love with a model named Anishka. Watch            
           what happens when the displeased couple decide
