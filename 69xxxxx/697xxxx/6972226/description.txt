Random Album Title is a progressive house album by deadmau5, released on the labels mau5trap recordings, Ministry of Sound and Ultra Records. It is, in all, his third and breakthrough studio album. The album contains the singles \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Faxing Berlin,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Not Exactly,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and deadmau5\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s collaboration with Kaskade \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I Remember\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". It was released physically in Ireland on October 3, 2008 and in the UK on October 6, 2008. In the United States, and Canada, there are two versions of the album, Unmixed and Mixed. It was released September 2, 2008 digitally (beatport.com, iTunes, etc.), and was released physically worldwide on November 4. The album represented a departure from the normal style of deadmau5, focusing on a more downtempo and trance based sound, instead of the more dance-driven sound of his other albums.
Following the success of the single I Remember in the UK, Random Album Title entered the UK Top 75 Albums chart at #31 in May 2009. A video for I Remember was released in early 2009. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Faxing Berlin\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" appears in At Play, which is 6:17 longer compared to this album version\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s length.
The track \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Arguru\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was written in memory of Juan Antonio Arguelles Rius, a well-known audio-software developer and musician.
The track \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Brazil (2nd Edit)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has been used twice so far for other artists. Kylie Minogue sampled the song in the sessions for her album Aphrodite in an unreleased song named \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Change Your Mind\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Alexis Jordan also used the song on her debut single, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Happiness\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". It was used as a remixed mash-up for Haley Gibby\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s 2010 recording \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Falling in Love,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" billed as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Falling In Love With Brazil.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"
