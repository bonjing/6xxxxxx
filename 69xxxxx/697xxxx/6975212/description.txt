About the stations:
Just like a TV set, live Internet television depends on the origin and not on the software that displays the TV images. Some stations can be off line due to their servers' overload or Internet traffic jams. Not all stations have a 24 Hours schedule. The video quality is dependent on the broadcaster's own bandwidth; the higher the bandwidth, the better the video quality you will receive. For most TV and radio channels, a modem speed of 56Kb/s is required. For the broadband TV stations, you need 300 Kb/s.
