CU Amiga Magazine Mar 1990 - October 1998

CU Amiga was the direct successor to Commodore User magazine. It featured
game reviews, news and technical articles. The latter increased 
significantly as the Amiga market shrank. EMAP gave the magazine a 
dignified send-off in the last issue, and CU remains one of the more
influential magazines of the era.

These PDFs are the complied collections of page scans available on
public Torrent trackers. They've been OCR'd to allow text searching and
copying - this should prove very useful for the retro archivist who'd
like to have their own local searchable archive. They look great on most
PDF readers, including the iPad. The OCR software has increased the file
size slightly, and some of the early issues haven't OCR'd as well as the
later ones, due to the layout and fonts used.

More OCR'd mags will be periodically available - please checkfor more information.

Thanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum site
(www.worldofspectrum.org), and all the visitors to RetroPDFs for their
continued support.

90's style "greets" to anyone formally or currently involved in the
Amiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat
Will, mUb and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD
Grapevine. Nostalgia ain't what it used to be ;)
