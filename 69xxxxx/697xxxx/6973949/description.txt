This is a fantastic series from one of the most beautiful countries in the world. Please enjoy!!!

Over six distinct journeys. Marvel at the staggering beauty of Scotland's islands from the air. The latest in challenging aerial photography technology shows the islands in a dramatic new light, from some of the remotest islands in the UK, to some that are within easy reach of Scotland's mainland cities. This stunning television series was funded by Seirbheis nam Meadhanan GÃ idhlig and originally produced in the Gaelic language by SMG TV Productions. Its title, 'Iomall nan Tonn' - 'The Edge of the Waves' - is beautifully appropriate.
