HOMESTUCK SOUND TEST is a fan compilation of 'extra' music from Homestuck, with around FOUR HOURS (!!!) of play time, over 100 tracks.

It contains unreleased tracks, removed tracks (with the original cover art and track number), and remixed tracks (songs that have been officially released and then altered for use in a Homestuck flash), unreleased songs by the music team (over 80 of these!) as well as music from two albums: The Baby Is You by Radiation and A Plumbthroat Christmas by Albatross Soup. There is also an in-depth credits text doc. Enjoy!

Changes from the previous version include: Added a metric fuckton of new songs, added track art (by myself), made everything nice n' tidy.

You can always contact me over Pesterchum (I'm incisivePlayer) if you want to suggest anything that can be added, or correct an error, or whatever.

Remember to seed!
