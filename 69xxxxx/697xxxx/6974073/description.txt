 Jaswant Sisodia rules supreme in the town      
 of Bijnor and one of his indulgences involve   
 forcing a girl Anshu to be his mistress.       
 Anshu's parents are as helpless and            
 humiliated as the vulnerable victim, who       
 ironically gets willfully raped every night    
 by Jaswant. Jaswant's close aid , who he as    
 well considers his younger brother, comes to   
 the town and supervises his illicit operations.
 His loyalty towards Jaswant remains integral   
 until his empathy towards Anshu overpowers it. 
 That's when he decides to betray his mentor.
