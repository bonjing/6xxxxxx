Once Upon A Time is, at its core, a story about hope. "For us, thatâ€™s what a fairytale is. Itâ€™s that ability to think your life will get better. Itâ€™s why you buy a lottery ticketâ€”because if you win you get to tell your boss that youâ€™re quitting and you get to move to Paris or wherever and be who you always wanted to be. And thatâ€™s Cinderella, right? One day sheâ€™s sweeping up and the next sheâ€™s going to the ball. Adam and I just wanted to write about something hopeful that for one hour a week allows one to put everything aside and have that feeling that your dreams just may come true."

Emma Swanâ€™s life has been anything but a fairytale. A 28-year-old bail bondsperson, sheâ€™s been taking care of herself since she was abandoned as a baby. But when Henryâ€”the son she gave up 10 years agoâ€”finds her, everything changes. Henry is desperate for his momâ€™s help and thinks that Emma is actually the long, lost daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming. Yes, the actual Snow White and Prince Charming. Even stranger, Henry believes that Storybrooke, the sleepy New England town he calls home, is really part of a curse cast by the Evil Queen, freezing fairytale characters in the modern world with no memory of their former selves.

Of course the seen-it-all Emma doesnâ€™t believe a word, but when she gets to Storybrooke, she canâ€™t help sensing that everythingâ€™s not quite what it seems. As Henry shows Emma around with the help of his fairytale book, the town, and its inhabitants like Henryâ€™s therapist Archie Hopper and the enigmatic Mr. Gold, seem just strange enough to set off her already suspicious nature. She becomes even more concerned for Henry when she meets his adopted mother, Regina, who he suspects is none other than the Evil Queen herself!

Storybrooke is a place where magic has been forgottenâ€”but is still powerfully closeâ€”and happily ever after seems just out of reach. In order to understand where the fairytale worldâ€™s former inhabitants came from, and what ultimately led to the Evil Queenâ€™s wrath, youâ€™ll need a glimpse into their previous lives. But it might just turn everything youâ€™ve ever believed about these characters upside-down.

Meanwhile, the epic battle for the future of all worlds, modern and fairytale alike, is about to begin. For good to win, Emma will have to accept her destiny and fight like hell.

Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, two master storytellers behind Lost and Tron: Legacy, invite everyone to brace themselves for a modern fairytale with thrilling twists and hints of darkness, brimming with wonder and filled with the magic of our most beloved stories.

 

"We kept circling back to the idea of fairytales. The very first stories that you hear when you're a kid. They're full of magic and heroics and fear and joy. But we also found fairytales are full of all these unanswered questions. Like why is Grumpy grumpy? Why is Geppetto so lonely that he'd actually carve a little boy out of wood? And did the Evil Queen really try to kill Snow White simply because of vanity? With Once Upon A Time, we set out to explore those questions and not re-tell these stories but attempt to dig beneath what we all know and try to discover something new."
