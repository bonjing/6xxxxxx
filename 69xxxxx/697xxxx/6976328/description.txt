Folkal Point\'s sole album is one of the most expensive and sought-after 
British traditional folk LP from the early \'70s.

Some 500 copies of this record were pressed on the tiny Midas imprint (an 
offshoot of the only slightly larger Folk Heritage label), aproximately half of 
which were destroyed in a flood. That left around 250 for the band to sell at 
gigs. Though it seems unlikely that all those were sold, very few have turned 
up since.

Musically it\'s a likeable, gentle collection of well-known songs sutch as 
Scarborough Fair, Sweet Sir Galahad and You Ain\'t Goin\' Nowhere, as well 
as some folk standards. Its main assets being Cherie Musialik\'s warm, tender 
voice, which like the best British woman folk singers of the late \'60s and 
early \'70s has a high, pristine timbre. The overall effect isn\'t as square as on 
many similar collections, though, with a wistful vibe and even hints of a 
darker, more psychedelic mood emerging on several occasions.
