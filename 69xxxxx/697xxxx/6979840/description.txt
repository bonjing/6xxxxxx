Crosby, Stills & Nash is the first album by Crosby, Stills & Nash, released in 1969 
on the Atlantic Records label. It spawned two Top 40 hits, "Marrakesh Express" and 
"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes" which peaked respectively at #28 the week of August 23, 1969
and at #21 the week of October 25, 1969, on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. The 
album itself peaked at #6 on the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart.

Coming on the heels of the Sweet Baby James reissue by Audio Fidelity, the outfit that releases 
limited edition remastered versions of classic rock albums, is the widely celebrated debut album 
by Crosby, Stills and Nash. Going back about a year earlier than Taylor's breakthrough record, 
Crosby, Stills & Nash also signaled a shift away from the harsher, heavier sound of the late 60s 
and helped establish the template for lighter, more melodic fare that dominated rock for much of 
the 70s.
