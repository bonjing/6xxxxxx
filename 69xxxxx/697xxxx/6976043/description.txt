Randy Burns' voice, at its best, sounds like a young, expressive Pete Seeger, and on this album (reissued on CD in the late 1990s) the comparison is doubly apt, consisting as it does of anti-war songs, old Civil War tunes, and love ballads. All are sung in an achingly earnest style, which fits with the period, and they're all beguiling in their way -- he overcomes his vocal limitations with sheer sincerity, and also reveals himself a good songwriter, his own "Thoughts of Spring" and "All You've Done for Me" standing well next to Eric Andersen's "Thirsty Boots" and David Blue's "I Like to Sleep Late In the Morning." One suspects that Seeger (and quite possibly Lee Hayes) might have heard his "Civil War Medley" with the pride an artist has in an admirer emulating his work and style. Additionally, his selection of material has a linear order and momentum that could have made it a good screenplay outline, if anyone had been shooting Civil War stories in 1966. The sound is spare, Burns' six-string joined on some numbers by Emery Fletcher on 12-string.
