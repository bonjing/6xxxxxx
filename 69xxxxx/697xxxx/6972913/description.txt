A milestone of the Czech New Wave, Milos Formanâ€™s first color film The Firemenâ€™s Ball (HorÃ­, mÃ¡ panenko) is both a dazzling comedy and a provocative political satire. A hilarious saga of good intentions confounded, the story chronicles a firemenâ€™s ball where nothing goes rightâ€”from a beauty pageant whose reluctant participants embarrass the organizers to a lottery from which nearly all the prizes are pilfered. Presumed to be a commentary on the floundering Czech leadership, the film was â€œbanned foreverâ€ in Czechoslovakia following the Russian invasion and prompted Formanâ€™s move to America.

The last, best, and funniest movie Milos Forman would make in his native Czechoslovakia, The Firemenâ€™s Ball is a deceptively simple miniature. This 73-minute movie, its premise scarcely more than an anecdote, finds an entire universe in the benefit gala staged by a group of inept, officious, mildly corruptâ€”in short, intensely humanâ€”volunteer firefighters.

Forman, whose international reputation as a leading member of the Czech new wave was established with his rueful 1965 comedy Loves of a Blonde, had left Prague for the Krkonose mountain village of VrchlabÃ­, there to develop a follow-up screenplay with his colleagues Ivan Passer and Jaroslav Papousek. â€œOne evening, to amuse ourselves, we went to a real firemenâ€™s ball,â€ he recalled. â€œWhat we saw was such a nightmare that we didnâ€™t stop talking until the next day about it. So we abandoned what we were writing on to start writing this script.â€

A Czech-Italian co-production (according to Forman, it was Carlo Pontiâ€™s $65,000 that enabled the movie to be made in color), The Firemenâ€™s Ball was shot in VrchlabÃ­ with an entirely nonprofessional cast. The protagonist is the town itself. Forman has assembled an impressive ensemble of grotesque types and fantastic faces. The movieâ€™s droll naturalism occasionally flirts with cuteness, but its deadpan comedy is darkened by an unwaveringly clear-eyed view of human stupidity and deception.

The ball is a series of small catastrophes, absurd ceremonies, and inane intriguesâ€”these rendered all the more ridiculous by the firemenâ€™s tendency toward self-important official rhetoric and coercive authoritarianism. Just about everything that can go wrong does. Decorations fall from the ceiling. The brass band misses its cues. The lottery prizes are pilfered by those assigned to watch over them. The reluctant participants in a beauty contest run for cover and, in the confusion, a fat middle-aged lady happily crowns herself the winner. A fire breaks out in the middle of the feteâ€”itâ€™s a particularly haunting sequence, as everyone leaves the ball to watch the heroes in action. As the townâ€™s new fire engine gets stuck in a drift, the firemen are reduced to ineffectually shoveling snow on the flames, then return to the hall to find the remaining prizes missing. The movieâ€™s comic acme comes when the firemen dim the lights so that the culprits can replace the purloined goods, then turn them back on too soonâ€”catching one of their own as he attempts to replace a massive head cheese.

â€œWeâ€™ll never live down the disgrace of his putting it back,â€ one smoke-eater moans, and in the unlikely event that any Czech viewer (or, indeed, anyone else) missed the correspondences between these bossy firefighters and a leading segment of Czech society, Forman ends with a backstage meeting where the firemen squabble among themselves over stolen prizes and, citing â€œthe honor of the brigade,â€ decide that everyone at the ball is a suspect. (After all, those who didnâ€™t steal could have.) The movieâ€™s final imageâ€”the smoldering ruins of an old manâ€™s farmhouseâ€”makes a particularly prescient ending.

Completed in mid-1967, The Firemenâ€™s Ball exemplifies the ironic humanism and sly political allegory characteristic of the Czech New Wave. It also managed to offend everyone from its Italian producer to the Czech head of state to the nationâ€™s volunteer firemen. The movie was shelved for a year; released at the height of the heady political thaw known as Prague Spring, it was playing theaters when the country was invaded by its Warsaw Pact allies in August 1968. An inescapable symbol of Czechoslovakiaâ€™s doomed reforms, The Firemenâ€™s Ball had its American premiere a month later, closing the same 1968 New York Film Festival that featured Jan Nemecâ€™s Report on the Party and the Guests, another movie that was initially banned, then released, and would never again be publicly shown in communist Czechoslovakia.Forman, who soon after relocated to the United States, has always maintained that The Firemenâ€™s Ball has no â€œhidden symbols or double meanings.â€ The movie is not without a sharp political edge but it is not exactly an allegory. Subsequent viewings transform Formanâ€™s deceptively slight masterpiece into something more mysteriousâ€”a sort of bemused documentary meditation on the non-actors who populate the screen. Few evocations of the human comedy have been so bitter and so sweet.
