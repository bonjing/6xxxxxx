Colin Murray is joined by Alan Hansen and Lee Dixon to review the day's two Premier League matches, 
as Arsenal faced Manchester United at the Emirates Stadium and Manchester City took on Tottenham Hotspur 
at the Etihad Stadium. These clashes were likely to have a major bearing on the title race, and the Gunners and 
Spurs were looking for revenge following remarkable losses in the reverse fixtures in August, when United won 
8-2 at Old Trafford and City triumphed 5-1 at White Hart Lane.
