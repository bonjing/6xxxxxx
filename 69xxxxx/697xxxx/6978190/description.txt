SOME TRIVIA FROM IMDB

One of the lies Adrian tells to the virgin is that Kumar works at the White House. Kal Penn, who plays Kumar, actually works at the White House and took time off from that job to make this movie. 

Todd calls Harold "Sulu" at one point. John Cho, who plays Harold, also played Sulu in the 2009 version of Star Trek. 

David Burtka, who plays "David Burtka" is Neil Patrick Harris's fiancÃ© in their real lives. In the same way that the character that Neil Patrick Harris plays is distinguished in the credits from being himself, Burtka is credited as "David Burtka" instead of "himself."
