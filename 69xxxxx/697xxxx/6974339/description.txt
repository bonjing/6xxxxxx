find sexy for various reasons.  Some show nudity and some don't,
but there is nothing hardcore.  They range from just a few
seconds to about four minutes long.

As I mentioned in part 4, I'm still doing a little editing. 
This time I tweaked the first two Angelina Jolie and Elizabeth
Mitchell scenes in Gia, and Mary Steenburgen's stripper dance in
Melvin and Howard.  I guess the only other clip that stands out
is Jane Fonda in Barbarella.  They intentionally obscured her
naked body with the credits but this is all the world has ever
seen as far as I know.  Too bad.  Sure would love to see the
clean original film leak out of a vault someday.  Otherwise it's
a wretchedly bad movie in my opinion, by the way.

This torrent is set to fall in place with the first four batches
in case you want to keep all of them in the same directory.
