This is an excellent textbook for first year nursing, allied health, or biology students in college. The material is organized and well-written; concepts are so easy to follow and understand. Very little, if any, background knowledge is required to follow the concepts in each chapter. Overall, an excellent textbook for learning the complexities of the human body, and it will also provide any student with a solid foundation in anatomy & physiology for graduate studies. Marvelous book!
