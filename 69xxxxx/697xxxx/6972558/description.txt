Lyrics:
Walls of ice will surround my frozen heart
Start to melt with the warmth of your desire
Can this be love I feel for you now?
Please don\'t tell me you can\'t take it

Since the day our stars first alligned
My whole worlds been frozen in time
I love you so much I could die
And I can\'t sleep at night

There is a snowstorm, there is a snowstorm
That\'s blowing throughout the walls of my heart
There is a snowstorm, there is a snowstorm
And it fills till the depths of my emotion
Now I\'m lost, I\'m a prisioner of passion
