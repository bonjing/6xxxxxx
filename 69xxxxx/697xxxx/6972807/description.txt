France has two great clarinet players: Jean-Marc Foltz whose latest album, "To
The Moon", still figures in the "Albums Of The Month" section.The other one is
Louis Sclavis, without a doubt better known, and quite prolific. The problem
with him is that he switches genres easily, between film music, straight-ahead
jazz, avant classical, avant chamber jazz, over his great African trio, duets
with Aki Takase, tightly composed modern jazz, to more adventurous music. Not
all his initiatives are successful, and the breadth of his scope make each new
album a surprise in style. That can be good, but sometimes also disappointing.

This trio is pure jazz with composed pieces and improvised tracks, but all with
an adventurous streak, and that's only possible and successful because of the
superb musicianship both technically and creatively. Sclavis is of course on
bass clarinet, but also on soprano sax, Craig Taborn plays piano and Tom Rainey
drums, without a doubt each among the best on their instrument today.

The compositions range between the melancholy ("La Visite") and the joyful ("Up
Down Up", "Possibilities"), or even the slightly insane ("Luccioles"), but all
of them are musical delights. On "La Visite", on which after a long and sad
Taborn piano moment, Sclavis brings some of the most heart-rending bass
clarinet-playing that I've heard in a while, slowly driving his beautiful
playing to a wailing climax.

Sclavis is excellent throughout, using his full skillset on the clarinet from
classical over swing to modern music, Taborn and Rainey are not only functional
but they create the overall environment becoming a perfect fit for the
variations in mood and styles, not just accompanying but creating the context in
which the soloist must journey. Despite the variations, the music is still very
coherent. One of Sclavis' least polished albums, yet the rawness of the
adventure suits him quite well.
