COLLECTION OF ALL 3 VOLUMES OF BOONDOCK SAINTS:IN NOMINE PATRIS

If you're a huge Boondock Saints fan as I very much am( of course that refers to the first movie ), then you must own this collection of the six issue mini-series from 12-Gauge Comics. 'In Nomine Patris' is a grim, bloodthirsty opus that reveals the extremely dark past of Il Duce.
