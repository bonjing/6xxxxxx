PHP is the best-conditioned ship-breaking site in Chittagong, home to the world-renowned ship breaking industry. However, the workers risk their lives while wrestling with thousands of tonnes of iron pieces at the yards, which are full of asbestos and toxic gases. There is always a chance of an explosion while burning the waste oils trapped in stacks of iron. The workers could easily get crushed and killed while cutting or moving iron plates.Nothing from a dismantled old ship is a waste. A rusty piece of iron and even waste oils mixed with mud are all recycled and sold through auctions. Half of the worldâ€™s retired ships are dismantled in Chittagong. Its ship-breaking industry provides 85 per cent of the domestic needs of iron in Bangladesh, where none is produced.
