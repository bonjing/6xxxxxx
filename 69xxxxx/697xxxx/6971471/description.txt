[b] Thx Hive

CM8 Doing it right the first time :D

Source: DVD-R PTP Thx

Encode:

DVD itself didnt have the highest bitrate for that kind of movie, but had a couple of watermarks and property messages which took a bit longer to remove.
you wont see anything from them through the whole movie. I used the same transitions like on that War horse movie.
So its a clean unmarked rip now and looks and sounds as it would be from a retail dvd.
since it came with 5.1 audio there is no need for me making a dvdrip if the retail is coming out later on.
even with that lower source bitrate i managed to make a perfect copy - added sharpness,brighness,rgb and denoise. had to take a bit higher bitrate as usual to make flawless copy that wont get pixelated in snow,water,flying and fast scenes.
looks as perfect as possible
got very nice indeed
enjoy
