Coal House at War
This fascinating living history series sees three families return to Stack Square, transporting them back to 1944 and the Second World War, to live as coal miners' families. Having given up their comfortable lives, they are faced with the dangers and many hardships of war. The families experience all aspects of life as it was in 1944. The men work long, punishing days down the coal mine, followed by tending the Stack Square shared allotment as people were encouraged to 'Dig for Victory' to overcome food shortages. They also have to endure the arduous Home Guard training, each getting a taste of army life and discipline. The women have to juggle their relentless household chores with compulsory work at the munitions factory, undertaking a variety of different tasks for the war effort. The children, meanwhile, have their own worries with daily doses of cod liver oil and the ever present threat that their pet rabbits may be served up for dinner. Joined by evacuees and the Bevin Boys, young lads sent by the Government to work the mines, the families struggle to cope with strict regimes, rationing, air raids and blackout fines but rediscover the strong community spirit and courage that war evoked.

4)  Part 4
At the end of the first week in the Coal House, how are the children coping with no playstations or mobiles to occupy them?

Will they pass the school cleanliness inspection, and how will they get on with the animals at Stack Square?

8)  Part 8 
Tensions are running high, the women reach a munitions milestone and there's panic underground. The Bevin Boys take their first tentative steps underground and what little confidence they have soon begins to dwindle as the reality of the task ahead starts to dawn on them. The pressure is on to succeed, but their inexperience leads to some choice words from the other Stack Square men.

9)  Part 9 
It's been a rollercoaster week for the Coal House families. The families let their hair down and party like it's 1944, some of the Stack Square chickens end up on the menu and there's evacuation drama for the families.

10)  Part 10 
With victory nearing, the pressure is on to fuel the frontline in the mining community of the Coal House. Will the men in the mine and the women at the munitions factory hit their deadlines? The scholarship exam looms at school, and a testing day in the mud leads to promotion for one of the Home Guard

11)  Part 11 
It is time for the men to hang up their lamps, the women to take off their uniforms, and the evacuees to return to their parents in the city - but not before everyone gets in the swing at the community dance for a final send-off.

12)  Part 12 
The children take the dreaded school exams as they spend their last week in the square. Who will receive the coveted trophy, and how will they feel about leaving their wartime lives behind?

13)  Dance House 1944 
Dance House 1944 takes a look at how people faced the music and danced during the Second World War despite bombs falling and bad news from abroad. Veterans of the fighting front and the home front describe how important dancing was for them and chart the changes in fashion from strictly ballroom to jitterbug and jive.
