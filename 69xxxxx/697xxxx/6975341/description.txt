ROUDRAM SYNOPSIS N REVIEW:

Roudram is a dubbed verison of Tamil movie Rowthiram, which is action thriller based movie. The movie starts in the 1980s. A young Boy (Jeeva) is taught by his grandfather (Prakash Raj) to be bold and brave and fight against all odds, especially all that's evil. 

Jeeva grows up with his grandfather's words as the Bible. However, Jeeva's parents (Jayaprakash and Lakshmi) want him to lead a peaceful life. Enters Shriya, a law college student. She is the daughter of a police official (Babu Antony). Obviously it's romance between the young man and the woman. Meanwhile, Jeeva is forced to earn the wrath of a goon (Ganesh Acharya).

Shobarani is producing this movie in telugu on SVR Media private limited banner. Popular Bollywood choreographer Ganesh Acharya plays an important role in the movie.

Analysis: First half of the movie adequate. Second half is stuffed with the content and a couple of interesting twists. If the screen play had been more linear and taut, it would have made a huge impact. On a whole, Roudram is a good film. We have to wait and see how it works at the box office.
