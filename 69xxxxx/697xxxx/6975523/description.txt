PLOT:
Casey Jones is the story of a quirky young man with an irresistible propensity for 
violence. A lifelong outcast, Casey learned at a young age to channel his brutal urges 
into sports, but after being kicked off the local hockey team for excessive force during

interrupted though when a vicious gang of street punks, the Purple Dragons, savagely beat 
him with pipes for attempting to remove their graffiti.
