"7:15 A.M."

Mary Margaret and David continue to grapple with 
their unrequited love, and Emma and Regina grow 
suspicious over a mysterious new stranger in 
town. Meanwhile, in the fairytale land that was, 
Snow White yearns to ease her breaking heart as 
Prince Charmings wedding to King Midass 
daughter approaches.

Evolve... or die.

'Out of respect' you shuld get a clue. The synch 
does not change at all after the dropout, and 
can NOT change. Why? Because there are no video 
or audio frames lost, the frameserver simply 
served up black and discolored frames. [Count 
the frames in the offending section of both the 
xvid and the 264.] I guess it is pretty obvious
why you included no sample of the so called out
of synch portion... 

Enjoy :)
