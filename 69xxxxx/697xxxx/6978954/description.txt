LITTLE FREDDIE KING CHASIN THA BLUES
Label Burnside Distribution 
Released:  Jan 17, 2012
Format: Mp3@320

Little Freddie King's life has always been hard, Hell, not long ago he was blown out of New Orleans by Katrina and went missing for a time. When he finally settled back into town, Freddie was forced to move out of his new apartment by toxic Chinese drywall that was wrecking the place. It's always been this tough, and it always will be. 

"Chasing Tha Blues" takes you on a rough ride through Freddie's life. You get to meet "Crackho Flo" and hang out at the "Bucket of Blood". It's all in the songs. No matter whether it's at home at BJ's Lounge, on the road in New York, or overseas, the vocals are made of grit and tears, and the guitar licks can't be written down. The power is in the spaces between the notes.

Little Freddie King creates raw urban blues with a gritty spirit that is the authentic thing. He was born in McComb, Mississippi and is the last of the 'great country blues guitar players'. Freddie is a cousin of the late great Lightnin Hopkins and a cultural treasure in the Mississippi and Louisiana region and New Orleans area. ]
