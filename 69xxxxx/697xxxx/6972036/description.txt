All of the right tools to keep your data safe!


There are plenty of causes of data loss, including human error and the dreaded hard drive crash. But, whatever the reason, don't let your files fall victim. Get Backup Pro is a powerful utility for creating encrypted backups, and synchronizing folders or computersâ€¦

Key Features:
â— Choose from full, incremental, and versioned backups.
â— Encrypt backups using one of four encryption standards (AES-128, AES-256, Blowfish, Triple DES) to further protect sensitive data.
â— Compress backups to save disk space.
â— Set a backup/synchronization schedule for each project (daily, weekly, monthly).
â— Back up to CD/DVD, locally mounted devices, or network volumes.
â— Drag and drop templates for Address Book, Mail, iTunes, and Documents right to your backup project.
â— Break large backups into volumes for easier storage on DVDs and online services.
â— Restore backups on any computer without the help of Get Backup.
â— Synchronize two folders (or computers) locally or over a network (one-way and two-way).
