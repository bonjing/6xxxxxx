People often ask me which scales fit which chords, beacause when the play
"noodling" around the same pentatonic shapes is sometimes the only system

to start and finish on plus fresh melodic ideas.If you feel you are stuck in
a musical rut i will help you reach further toward your musical goals. If
you are ready to take your playing to the next level join me as we discover
