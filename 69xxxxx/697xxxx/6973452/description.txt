This torrent contains the full collection of NES roms, according to the

Special note:

  Take notice that the No-Intro datfiles keep track of raw ROM dumps, without
  any "headers". In the case of NES ROMs, most emulators need the
  additional headers. This means that a headerless rom collection of
  NES games, while strictly correct according to the No-Intro database, is
  unplayable in most emulators (MESS and Nestopia are in their way to fix
  this issue).
  
  However, this particular ROM collection has headers for most files. The few
  exceptions are some bad dumps (marked with [b] in the filename) and a
  couple of binary dumps (files with the .bin extension). This means that all
  NES games for which a good dump exists are playable in this collection.

Other collections available:

- Nintendo Game Boy
- Nintendo Game Boy Color
