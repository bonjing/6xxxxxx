Features:

- Production proven results demonstrate this technologyâ€™s ability to
achieve realistic smoke and fire effects for cutting-edge industry
applications.
- FumeFX supplements the userâ€™s artistic vision with the power of real-world physics for the ultimate in both style and realism.
- A multitude of parameters and FumeFX helpers give users maximum control of the fluidâ€™s behavior and appearance.
- Easy to use, basic effects can be created with just a few clicks.
- Options include the use of powerful AFC and Gradient controls, which are unified through all Sitni Sati products.
- Plug-in design incorporates extensive support for Particle Flow and Thinking Particles.
- Dynamic simulations allow for bi-directional influence between FumeFX and particle systems.
- Advanced scripting via MAXScript is possible with almost every aspect of FumeFX, including access to all simulation data.
- FumeFX is capable of dynamic interaction with other scene objects.
- For those technical artists who want to write their own shaders, a standalone rendering library is avilable for Windows and Linux, both 32 and 64 bit versions.

Simulation
- Start simulations from scratch or by using other simulation results as a starting point.
- Stop, pause and continue simulations at any point.
- Simulation is multithreaded â€“ users can select how many CPUâ€™s to dedicate to their simulation.
- Users can watch the simulation progress in the interactive Preview Window.
- Interactive simulation allows user to change almost every parameter during the simulation and see itâ€™s influence on the simulation result.
- FumeFX can use Variable Density solver that uses smoke density and temperature as variables.
- Draft simulations can be created in mere minutes for fast previewing.
- Multiple advection schemes that can minimize numerical dissipation.
- User has control of which data is written to output files for rendering and further processing.
- Wavelet Turbulence algorithm quickly adds extra detail to low
resolution simulation caches while preserving the existing overall
motion.
- Retimer is a very efficient and fast method to slow down or speed up caches without the need to re-run simulation.
- Post Processing module can significantly reduce cache size by optimizing grid size around smoke/fire. It also allows users to decide which channels will be excluded from the final caches.

Rendering
- mental ray for 3ds Max renderer support â€“ available for both Windows and Linux.
- The Preview Window gives users almost instant feedback on render settings.
- Fast self-shadowing is produced through an Illumination Map which is integrated inside of the FumeFX object.
- A highly efficient Multiple Scattering model enhances light dispersion throughout fluid.
- Fluid Mapping integrates procedural map details with fluid motion.
- The dynamic FusionWorks atmospheric renderer provides:
- Render Elements: Fire, Smoke, Velocity
- Proper blending with AfterBurn and ScatterVL Pro.
- Balanced mixing of FumeFX and compatible atmospherics with 3ds Max Fog
- Ability to apply Image Motion Blur
- Option to affect Effect Channel
- Z depth



Installation:

1. Disable/close any running firewall(s)

2. Install Fume, run as admin if required, simply let it open normally in sandbox if you are using avast.

3. Go to folder C:\Program Files (x86)\AFLICS\ (It's there even if you installed Fume somewhere else)

4. Run AfterFLICS_tools.exe as ADMINISTRATOR and go to Service --> Stop (Keep the program open)

5. Replace the AfterFLICS.exe (from crack folder) in C:\Program Files (x86)\AFLICS\

6. Back in AfterFLICS program, go to Service --> Restart (you may now close the program)

7. Run 3ds Max 2012 as ADMINISTRATOR, you can find Fume under command panel > Create > Geametry drop down list

8. Click on FumeFx button and AfterFlics will pop up with activation window, minimise max at this point

9. Back in windows Run 'cmd' (press windows + R in keyboard), type 'ipconfig/all' note the Host Name: (should be the name of your PC)

10. Go back to Max and in the activation window type the noted Host Name from previous step and press 'Add Server'

11. With new server selected (not the localhost) press Authenticate, new window will pop up

12. Select Manual Activation radio button and enter anything you wish.

13. When Fume runs for the first time, you may face flicker issues, without changing any setting in Fume Save the Max file, close the application and Run max as usual.
