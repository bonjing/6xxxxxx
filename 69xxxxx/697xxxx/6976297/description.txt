When a green ogre called Shrek discovers his swamp has been 'swamped' with all sorts
of fairytale creatures by the scheming Lord Farquaad, Shrek sets out, with a very 
loud donkey by his side, to 'persuade' Farquaad to give his swamp back. Instead, a 
deal is made. Farquaad, who wants to become the King, sends Shrek to rescue Princess 
Fiona, who is waiting for her one true love. But once they head back with Fiona, it 
starts to become apparent that not only does Shrek like Fiona, but Fiona is keeping 
something secret.
