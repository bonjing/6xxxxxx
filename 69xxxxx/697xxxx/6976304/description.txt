Complex were a band from Blackpool, Lancashire, England who recorded 2 
privately pressed albums in the early 1970s. The first of these, a self titled 
album found here is now a super rare psychedelic album that sells for very 
high prices on the collectors market.

The original master tapes are long lost and the resulting CD re-issue (now 
long deleted) was copied from the best surviving vinyl that could be found.

Therefore donâ€™t expect pure digital sound. The original was recorded on the 
cheap, pressed on the cheap, and poorly packaged in a sleeve that was too 
small! (meaning most original LPs were stored by buyers simply in dusty 
inner sleeves)

So, on the minus side, the sound quality leaves a little to be desired. But on 
the plus side, the music is wonderful sounding very similar to best of the 
British pop-sike scene of 1967.

If you are a fan of bands like Kaleidoscope, Wimple Winch, Tomorrow, 
early Floyd, etc you will find much to enjoy here
