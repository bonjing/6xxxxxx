---------------------------------------

Blaze Media Pro is a suite designed for audio and video files. It can play, convert, edit and burn them.

After a brief installation process, you can notice how simple and straightforward the user interface is. It is divided into the file menu, playback and playlist windows, audio and video options.

Once you have added audio and video files to the playlist (drag and drop is not supported), you can play them in a simple media player.

Blaze Media Pro converts audio files (including CD tracks) to ADPCM, AIFF, AU, A/u-LAW, VOX, MP3, OGG, WAV, WMA and AAC, as well as video files to Flash FLV, SWF, 3GP, AVI, MPEG, WMV, MOV and the iPod and PSP profiles.

You can configure frequency, channels, audio and video bitrate and codecs, quality, encoding mode, video height and width, and more.

The conversion process (batch converting is supported) takes little time to finish (according to the size and format of the file), and sound and image quality is well maintained.

Audio editing options include using an amplifier, fade in and out, automatic gain control, chorus, compressor, distortion, echo, equalizer, flanger, gargle, normalizer, pitch, reverb, reverse, silence, tempo, filters, and more.

Furthermore, Blaze Media Pro lets you burn a CD or DVD, edit audio tags, use an audio recorder and merger, edit videos, split or join videos, capture videos, rip DVDs and extract audio content.

The bottom line is that Blaze Media Pro is an impressive suite dedicated to audio and video options, and it comes packed with some pretty advanced features. The program uses a small amount of system memory, and it has not failed on us during our tests. We strongly recommend it to all users.
