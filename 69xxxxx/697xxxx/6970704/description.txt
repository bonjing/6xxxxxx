This is encoded at the lowest bitrate I found to be be transparent, and as such is a bit larger than other SDDVD rips.. Resolution and aspect ratio of the DVD have been preserved. There are no subtitles present on the DVD, and as such none are encoded in the MKV - having the side effect of making this extender (read: Xbox 360) friendly. The audio source is mono, so this contains AC3 stereo sound.
