Hi, this is my first torrent -

Ancient Conquest: Quest for the Golden Fleece

This is a naval strategy game based in the historic time of Ancient Greece with fantasy overtones. It was released in 1999, and has no protection what-so-ever.

I had been searching torrents for ages and to no avail, but eventually found a copy on a recently deceased website a while ago. I thought it was time I gave back to the community.

If you're a fan of retro games, or have ever played this, then I hope you enjoy it. I had it as a child and trying to play in Polish was highly disappointing.

Only needs Daemon Tools, or a similar program, to mount and install.

Please comment, as I hope I'm doing this right.

Thankyou.
