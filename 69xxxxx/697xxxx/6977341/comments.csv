,hasbeenhonshu,2012-04-11T02:15Z,My apologies to Lindoffs. The previous comment I made was in error. Due to there only being UDP trackers for this content the download sucks for people like me who cannot get port forwarding.
ing is a hard drive killer with no content to finalize.
Lots of seeders and peers but no download activity after 2.4 GB.
I deleted it and said good riddance."
