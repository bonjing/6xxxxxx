Yes it is slow paced because the 3 hour per episode but the drama is also quite convincing and character developing is not so akward like other swedish series (Maria Wern, Irene Huss example). Quality was also surprisingly good for three hour per 4.4 gigs. Watched in 32 inch screen. I don't even miss the 5.1 audio..well because it's not a action movie. Thanks for the RIP!"
