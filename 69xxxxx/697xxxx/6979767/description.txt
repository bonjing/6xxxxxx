       XviK is a new group out there with one intension           
        and that's bringing internals of good old class-            
        ics that haven't been done in a while.                     
        We are not here to race rlses nor to be first.               
        We intend to bring good movies back to life.                 
        We make most of our releases 2cds with ac3 sound             
       to get as good quality as possible.                         
      We do not always follow TDX rules on that one.               
                                                                   
                                                                        
                                                                 
                                                                        
                                
          We are currently looking for..
