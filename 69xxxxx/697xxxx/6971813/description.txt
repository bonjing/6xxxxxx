ReleaseNotes:

This Dave Edmunds-produced album took Austin's best-known band and introduced them to the world in 1986. The two big hits, Kim Wilson's own "Tuff Enuff" and Sam and Dave's "Wrap It Up," move the band in a new R&B-flavored; direction. This album encompasses the many influences that make up the T-Birds: zydeco on "Tell Me," soul music on "Two Time My Lovin'"(with Los Lobos), and a blues tribute to their home base, "Down at Antone's." This is easily the best of their three Epic releases with guitarist/singer Jimmie Vaughan. (J.G.) -- âŒ Frank
