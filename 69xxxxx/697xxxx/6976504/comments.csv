First of all if you dealt with as much Pdf files everyday like i do you would know that ""Adobe""
doesn't display some pages on books from certain publishers.For example Adobe won't display all the pages from books published by pearson,cengage etc and Adobe reader will tell you so,if it can't display certain pages IT DOESN'T MEAN THE FILE IS DEFECTIVE,If the file was defective it won't display completely on any reader ""Foxit"" included


The fact that Adobe invented pdf doesn't mean a fucking thing

Had you taken the time to inform yourself before shooting your mouth off you would have realized that Adobe has many problems/issues regarding the reading of files

And I'm not scaring anyone into downloading phony products ""Foxit Pdf Reader""is a very popular reader used by millions,it's not a phony product as a matter of fact it's used by the majority of people here on the TPB many even say it's better for reading than Adobe and even though i use Adobe i think 'Foxit"" is a lot smoother

Out of my 2000+ uploads there has not been a single complaint in regards to a defective or corrupt file.My warning is there to let down loaders know that there might be an issue if using Adobe and for your your info many ebook up loaders have warned down loaders about Adobe not displaying all the pages that's why we use ""Foxit"" as a back up

THANK YOU MR_DAWG FOR A COMPLETELY USELESS AND FUCKING STUPID COMMENT "
