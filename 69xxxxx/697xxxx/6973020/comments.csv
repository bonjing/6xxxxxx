I had a need to clone a working Windows 7 from a Dell Optiplex computer to a much later Inspiron 530 which always failed with Blue Screen. I was faced with doing a clean Windows install which would have meant hours of work. Instead I just used the bootable Acronis CD which I had previously created - didn't worry about adding any new drivers and it worked - Windows 7 on the new computer ! 

This program will do Workstations and/or Servers.

Thank you to the uploader."
