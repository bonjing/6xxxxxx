Minorities in the Middle East: A History of Struggle and Self-Expression

The Middle East is a kaleidoscope of competing ethnic groups. This informative volume by a scholar at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem seeks to examine the struggle for self-determination by many of these ethnic groups in the region. The strength of the book lies in the breadth of its coverage of minorities in the Middle East.

Individual chapters describe the condition of such Muslim minorities as the Kurds, Berbers, Baluchis, Druzes, and Alawites. The author also explains the history of Christian minorities, such as the Copts, Assyrians, Armenians, Maronites, and the Sudanese Christians.
