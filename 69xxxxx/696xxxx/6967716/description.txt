                              =========================
                              





With thousands of UFOs sightings worldwide every year, can our alien experiences really all be put down to imagination? Alex Podovich of Las Vegas UFO Hunters travels to the Extra-terrestrial Highway in Nevada and Peter Merlin visits a supposed crash site in search of evidence of what happened.


Area 51, Hangar 18, the Montauk facility, the Dulce Base, the undersea world of Sanya, HAARP in Alaska, Pine Gap, Fort Detrick, Rudloe Manor, and the Zhitkur underground realm--these are just a few of the select, highly classified installations about which the governments of the United States, Australia, China, Russia, the United Kingdom, and others prefer that we, the general public, remain steadfastly ignorant.


And these same governments have excellent reasons for wanting to keep us in the dark. It is at these secret facilities that for decades, clandestine research has reportedly been undertaken into crashed UFOs, deceased alien entities, bizarre creatures and unknown animals, lethal viruses, biological warfare, mind-control experimentation, and much, much more.


Whether situated deep under the ocean, far below the ground, or within the heart of remote, fortified desert locales, these and many other supersecret places are guarded with a near paranoid zeal by those in power who wish to keep their secrets buried and locked far away from prying eyes.
