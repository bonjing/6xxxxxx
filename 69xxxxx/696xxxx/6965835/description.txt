Description
Experience the breakneck adrenaline rush of hitting the dirt track at 80MPH
The official Speedway GP 2011 game delivers all the action, excitement and death-defying thrills of speedway motorcycle racing! Experience the breakneck adrenaline rush of hitting the dirt track at 80-MPH - with no brakes! - in the Android Marketâ€™s premier motorbike racing title.
Speedway takes place on oval dirt tracks, with riders reaching up to 80-miles per hour on the straights, and then power-sliding into the corners at full speed; and all with no brakes. The single-gear motorbikes are fuelled by methanol, providing a significantly more explosive compression ratio than standard fuels, and resulting in dangerously high speeds with very little in the way of safety measures.
Speedway GP 2011 brings all this adrenaline-fuelled excitement to your Android device with beautifully detailed 3D visuals and exhilarating realism. Race around 11 different real-life stadiums as you step into the intrepid boots of 15 actual speedway superstars in the most daring, dangerous and dynamic motorcycle racing game on the Android Market.
