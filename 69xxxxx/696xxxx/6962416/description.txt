Cate Archer Is a Spy in H.A.R.M.'s Way

The sequel to the award-winning The Operative: No One Lives Forever returns
you to a world of espionage, intrigue, and dry humor inspired by the
'60s spy craze. Armed with an arsenal of deadly weapons, cunning spy gadgets,
and devious traps, you must undertake a dangerous, top secret mission that will
take you to exotic locales like Japan, India, and Akron, Ohio in your quest
to thwart H.A.R.M.'s plans for global domination. The dastardly villains
of H.A.R.M. are back and only one obstacle can thwart their quest for global
denomination: Cate Archer, the daring super spy who failed their last
nefarious plot. They've summoned the world's deadliest assassins to take
her out of the spy trade once and for all. Meanwhile, the united States
has uncovered a top secret Soviet project that could bring about World War III.
Can Cate avert a nuclear holocaust and simultaneously keep herself out of
H.A.R.M.'s way? An all-new, advanced AI system gives enemies a deeper
understanding of their environment. Watch them work at desks or step
outside for a cigarette break. Lure them into the shadows by knocking over
a bottle or disturbing a wind chime. Evade them as they coordinate attacks
to outflank you. You'll need sharp wits and quick reflexes to save the world
from H.A.R.M.
