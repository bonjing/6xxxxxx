Itâ€™s a co-op survival horror game. Up to 6 players in online co-op mode, or just you, on your own, playing the Solo mode. The aim â€“ cleanse each area of zombies, in waves, until you get to the last one. The Big One. The Patriarch. Then exterminate him, too. Actually, they arenâ€™t â€œzombiesâ€. They are the left-over â€œspecimensâ€ from a cheap and dirty government program to clone soldier-monsters. The basic ones will just munch on your arm and try to disembowel you. The bigger ones were the first ones they tried arming. Nothing much. Just a chainsaw or a blade for starters. They had just got on to the chain gun and rockets when the government tried to secretly shut down their secret program.

But, in the typical way these things go, the program didnâ€™t want to be shut down. The specimens got loose. No-one was left alive to turn off the specimen-cloning equipment. And now they are running amok. Well, some of them are running amok. Others are shambling amok or even jumping amok, but you get the idea.

The police were sent in, but that wasnâ€™t even a challenge for the specimens. The first army units hadnâ€™t been warned what to expect. The screams of â€œits got a bloody chainsaw!â€ over the radios probably didnâ€™t do much for morale, as whole units were chewed up. Quite literally, in some cases, of course.

And now, there is just you. And a few friends. The few survivors from the first police and army units thrown in. Of course, you canâ€™t tell anyone anything, because that would be a breach of the Official Secrets Act 1911, 1920, 1989. And that would be a disciplinary offense. So just get in there and do your bit for Queen and Countryâ€¦

Zombies. Lots of them. Big ones, little ones. Armed and Dangerous. JUST MAKE THEM ALL GO AWAY!
