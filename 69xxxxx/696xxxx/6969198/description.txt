This game threatens to break gaming conventions by throwing
a player into a surreal world of subconscious, where reality mingles
with illusion, and symbolism replaces traditional storytelling.
As a player, you must recover you shattered soul, piece by piece, by wondering
around gameâ€™s 20 levels, while the environment changes from claustrophobic to moody to sublime.
Whilst roaming around, you see illusions that disappear when approached,
while at the same time real obstacles appear to block your path.
Things get even more interesting when you turn the world upside-down
so that illusions become reality, and reality turns into illusion.
