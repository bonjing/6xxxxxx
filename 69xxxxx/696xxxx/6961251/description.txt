Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

Bev Harris talks to Alex about the increased potential for vote fraud as privately owned corporations consolidate and move toward internet voting. Harris is a writer, activist, and founder of Black Box Voting Inc., a national nonpartisan, nonprofit elections watchdog group. She is the author of Black Box Voting and her investigative journalism has appeared in both the alternative and mainstream media. Alex also covers the latest breaking news, including the decision by GOP candidate Jon Hunstman to drop out and endorse Romney as Ron Paul's campaign grows in strength. 

Alex also covers the latest developments on Iran as it is reported that the Mossad has posed as CIA agents in attacks on the oil-producing nation.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
