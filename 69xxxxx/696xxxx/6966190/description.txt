                           DESCRiPTiON 

 TV presenter Kate Thornton comes to terms with a secret from her teenage years
 - from the age of 11 to 15 she suffered from eating disorder anorexia, a      
 condition that still affects many youngsters today. She looks back at what    
 triggered her obsessive dieting and talks to those closest to her at the time,
 who recall what they remember of her lies and her skeletal figure. Twenty-five
 years since she beat anorexia, she also meets other sufferers, hoping her     
 experiences can help them in their fight against the illness.  
               
                                 Enjoy!
