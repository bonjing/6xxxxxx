East Broadway Run Down is a 1966 album by jazz saxophonist Sonny Rollins, his last album before
industry pressures led him to take a six year hiatus. The album represents one of his more
notable experiments with free jazz, according to The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz illustrating
the furthest extent to which he incorporated noise elements into his playing. It has been
critically described as among his 60s "jewels" Music journalist Piero Scaruffi praised the
album for the dissonant titular song, a bold thematic improvisation on the riff of Lionel Hamptons
Hey Baba Rebop..
