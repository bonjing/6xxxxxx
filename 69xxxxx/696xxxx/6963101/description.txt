                Chapter Outline:
                ----------------
                
     Chapter 1:
     ----------
        Introducing WPF describes the architecture 
        of WPF, its DirectX plumbing, and the new
        device-independent measurement system that 
        resizes user interfaces automatically.               
   --------------------------------------------        
     Chapter 2:
     ----------
        describes the XAML standard that you use 
        to define user interfaces. Youâ€™ll learn
        why it was created and how it works, and 
        youâ€™ll create a basic WPF window using 
        different coding
   --------------------------------------------
     Chapter 3:
     ----------
        delves into the layout panels that allow 
        you to organize elements in a WPF window. 
        Youâ€™ll consider different layout strategies, 
        and youâ€™ll build some common types of windows.
   --------------------------------------------   
     Chapter 4:
     ----------

   --------------------------------------------   
     Chapter 5:
     ----------

        keyboard, and multitouch events that all WPF elements support.

   --------------------------------------------        
     Chapter 10:
