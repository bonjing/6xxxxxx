         After several people in the New Mexico desert wind up missing or 
     dead, including an F.B.I.  agent and most of his family, police Sgt. 
     Ben Peterson teams up with F.B.I.  agent Bob Graham to find out what 
     is causing  the strange occurrences.  They find send a strange print 
     found at one of the crime scenes and it is sent to the Department of 
     Agriculture.  Doctor Harold Medford and his daughter Doctor Patricia 
     Medford arrive  and ask  to be  taken  to the scene  of some  of the 
     disappearances.  When  they  get  there  they  are  shocked  to find 
     gigantic ants,  whose mutations were caused by the first atomic bomb 
     explosion  nine years earlier.  They manage  to destroy  the nest of 
     ants,  but not before  two winged queen ants  and a couple of drones 
     have hatched and escaped the nest.  Now it is a race against time to 
     find the  two queen ants  before they  can establish  more nests and 
     hatch more queens.

      After two years of limited distribution, we found it time for our   
      work to be available on a larger scale. Therefore we decided to     
      enable more sites to host our releases by including the             
      'INTERNAL' tag in our directory naming. Our releases aren't         
      internal though; we release them. The good news is we stay who we   
      are and keep being non-competitive.                                 
                                                                          
      Know anyone who likes our releases, and wants to help out? We're    
      currently looking for a WHQ based in EU. Feel free to contact us.
