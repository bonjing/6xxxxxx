Optimization of aviation and space vehicle design requires accurate assessment of the dynamic stability and general properties of hybrid materials used in aviation parts. Written by a professional with 40 years of experience in the field of composite research, Hybrid Anisotropic Materials for Structural Aviation Parts provides key analysis and application examples to help the reader establish a solid understanding of anisotropic properties, theory of laminates, and basic fabrication technologies.

Tools to ensure cost-effective, optimized fabrication of aircraft, satellites, space vehicles, and moreâ€¦

With a focus on analytic modeling and dynamic analysis of anisotropic hybrid materials used in structural parts, this book assesses how and why design mechanisms either work or fail. It describes how current manufacturing techniques can apply alternative electronic and ultrasonic systems to improve the strength of an aircraftâ€™s parts, reduce vibrations, and counteract deicing effects, among other vital requirements.

Presenting valuable case studies involving manufacturers such as Boeing and DuPont, this book covers topics including:

    * Nano composites, impregnation processes, and stress/strain analysis
    * New techniques for analyzing interlaminar shear distribution sandwich/carbon/fiber/epoxy technologies
    * Non-destructive methods, control technological parameters, and the influence of technological defects
    * Use of carbonâ€“silicon nanotubes and ceramic technology
    * Strength criteria and analysis, and composite life prediction methodologies
    * Dynamic aspects and stability of jetliners and lattice aviation structures
    * Interlaminar shear stress analysis and possible failure
    * Fatigue strength and vibration analysis

This volume offers a useful, informative summary of the cutting-edge work being done in the field of high-performance composite materials, including fiberglass and carbon. With coverage of topics ranging from stress analysis and failure prediction to manufacturing methods and nondestructive inspection technology, it provides unique information to benefit a new generation of composite designers, graduate students, and industry professionals working with high-performance structures.
