  Eight year old Robin has an extraordinary    
  way with numbers. He uses his gift for       
  calculation to help his village folks. His   
  happy world is shattered when his uncle Joe  
  and aunt Sheila, a sly couple aware of his   
  powers, convince his innocent parents to     
  send him to town for better education. The   
  couple exploit him with live, ticketed shows 
  where Robin magically solves complex         
  mathematical problems. Despite his fame,     
  Robin longs to go back to the simple life of 
  his village.
