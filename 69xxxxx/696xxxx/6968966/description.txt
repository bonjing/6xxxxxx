Another classic.

Taglined 'A journey to the end of comprehension', this here version is the uncut 6-episode TV mini series, re-released in 1985, digitally re-mastered in 2004.

Missing from our German/English subs version, we've added the 6-minute Director's cut extra which is also in English language.

Plot? Not here, you might want to be surprised, and it's all available in abundance, starting with IMDB or Wiki - take it from there...


Enjoy
