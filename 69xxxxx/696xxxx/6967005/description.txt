SD Maid Pro Full v0.9.7.5

Requires Android: 1.6 and up + (root)

Release Date: January 17, 2012


Description

A maid for your android, to regain precious memory and keep it clean & tidy.

THIS APP IS INTENTED FOR ROOTED DEVICES!

Without root, functionality is limited as SD Maid won't have access to all necessary directories.

This is a powerful tool! Use at own risk!


* Nobody is perfect and android neither.
* Apps you have already deleted, sometimes leave data behind.
* The system constantly creates logs, crash reports and debug files you don't really need.
* The market leaves temporary files of downloaded apps behind.
* Lets not go on here...

- Why not get a maid to clean it all up? SD maid will help you keep your device neat, clean and tidy for you :)!

- Choose a tab, press check and then either click a single item to delete or press the clean all button. It's just that easy.

- The explorer is a full fledged filemanager, use it to crawl through your androids files.

- You can use the searcher to open/delete or rename files (wildcards are supported as is searching inside files).

- The corpse finder searches your device for dormant directories and compares those to the list of installed applications.

- The system cleaner scans the devices known directories with unnecessary files.

= The Optimize DBs tab checks databases (System/Apps) and allows you to shrink bloated databases to speed up access and free space.

= The Misc tab features various cleaning options. A bit of a playground for me to implement user requests.

= 9 features are currently available in the free version and an additional 2 can be unlocked by buying and installing the unlocker.

= SD Maid is constantly being developed and is designed very carefully.
