Rage Against the Machine take Christmas No.1 slot

Rock band Rage Against the Machine ended Simon Cowells four year domination of 
the Christmas charts tonight after a hugely popular Facebook campaign helped the 
Los Angeles nu-metallers snatch the Christmas number one slot in 2009 from X-factors 
Joe McEdlerry.

More than half a million people downloaded the bands famously anti-authoritarian and 
expletive laden track â€œKilling in the Nameâ€ in what was seen as a broad protest against 
the increasing influence of manufactured pop music.

C/O Wikipedia

Thank you.

The Wikipedia blackout is over â€” and you have spoken.

More than 162 million people saw our message asking if you could imagine a world without 
free knowledge. You said no. You shut down Congressâ€™s switchboards. You melted their servers. 
Your voice was loud and strong. Millions of people have spoken in defense of a free and open 
Internet.

For us, this is not about money. Its about knowledge. As a community of authors, editors, 
photographers, and programmers, we invite everyone to share and build upon our work.

Our mission is to empower and engage people to document the sum of all human knowledge, and 
to make it available to all humanity, in perpetuity. We care passionately about the rights 
of authors, because we are authors.

SOPA and PIPA are not dead: they are waiting in the shadows. Whats happened in the last 24 
hours, though, is extraordinary. The internet has enabled creativity, knowledge, and innovation 
to shine, and as Wikipedia went dark, youve directed your energy to protecting it.

Were turning the lights back on. Help us keep them shining brightly.
