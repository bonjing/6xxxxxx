Description: 
One-off documentary marking Muhammad Ali's 70th 
birthday. The programme focuses on the former boxer's 
relationship with Britain, and features contributions by 
those who met him on his many visits. Yorkshireman 
Richard Dunn describes what it was like to face Ali in his 
prime, and talks about the hero's welcome he received in 
his native Bradford after he had been soundly beaten. 
TV presenter Dickie Davies discusses An Audience with 
Muhammad Ali in 1974, which he hosted, and Mohamed 
Hussein recalls the time Ali and his wife had their marriage 
blessed at his South Shields mosque during a visit to the 
North East in 1977.
