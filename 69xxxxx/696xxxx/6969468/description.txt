            Summary        
                                     
                                        
                                                                  
                                                                     
         The possibility of Leonard and Penny finally getting back     
         together in a relationship could prove to have disastrous     
         results when Leonard offers Penny a spur-of-the moment        
         invitation to a romantic dinner date just for the two         
          of them.                                                      
                                                                       
                                                                     
                                                                  
      
       
         Release  Notes    
                                     
                                        
                                                                  
                                                                     
         Proper notes: ASAP's release is missing the title             
         sequence. It is also missing the Chuck Lorre slate at         
         the end, which really should be a mandatory part of every     
          episode of every show he does...
