,Phntzm79,2012-02-08T17:14Z,Brad Pitt used to nail that crazy Scientologist bitch before he was famous! WTF? Such a pig! Phantazm
o harshly criticized Elizabeth Grant's Saturday Night Live performance one day and then changed her mind the next day! This crazy bitch doesn't even have the brains to understand that Scientology is a psycho cult! She is very jealous of the success that Lana Del Rey has achieved and probably thinks she is a better singer than Elizabeth Grant. She is super ugly and is a brainwashed cult member! What a waste of Carbon atoms! Peace, Phantazm79"
