Four years in the making, Life will set a new benchmark in family entertainment and natural history epics.

Life is the latest wildlife epic from the BBCâ€™s award-winning Natural History Unit. It has the revelation, cinematic style, sense of place and emotionally involving individual sequences that that were the hallmark of The Blue Planet and Planet Earth, with all the scope, detail and content of an Attenborough epic, and the addition of close-up, intensely dramatic new behaviour â€“ all captured by the worldâ€™s top wildlife photographers with the aid of the most cutting-edge and sophisticated filming techniques.

This ten-part natural history blockbuster, shot in HD, is the definitive exploration of the diversity of life on Earth, revealing the most spectacular and fascinating behaviour driven by the endless struggle to survive. Life stars a cast of 'box-office' wildlife characters, filmed on every continent and in every habitat across the world, with each drama-filled episode entirely dedicated to one of the planet's ten most important wildlife groups. The series has the revelation, sense of place, cinematic style and emotionally involving individual sequences perfected in programmes such as The Blue Planet and Planet Earth, but with the addition of close-up, intensely dramatic new behaviour - where the animals are the stars.
