Arthur Christmas reveals the incredible, never-before seen
answer to every child's question: 'So how does Santa deliver
all those presents in one night?' The answer: Santa's
exhilarating, ultra-high-tech operation hidden beneath the
North Pole. But at the center of the film is a story about
a family in a state of comic dysfunction and an unlikely
hero, Arthur, with an urgent mission that must be completed
before Christmas morning dawns.
