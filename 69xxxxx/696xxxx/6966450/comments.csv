Tried to edit the entry but it didn't let me, so I uploaded a new one. I thought I had deleted the previous one, but maybe that didn't work either, or I cocked something up again. Thanks for taking care of it.

Hoping enough people will DL and start seeding this soon.

The second album (Never Rest in Peace) is not in 320kbps because it originated from another torrent (didn't remember which one, so please advise and credit here if you know)."
