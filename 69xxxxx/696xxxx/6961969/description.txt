With his latest outing How to Rob a Bank, Porter continues to refine his style, and the result surely is one of the more diverse albums in his canon. On The Lemon Tree, for example, he dips a delicate, McCartney-esque melody into an Andrew Bird-inspired, chamber-folk arrangement, while Fear Only Fear drafts its rippling rhythms from Bruce Cockburnâ€™s solo acoustic projects. Elsewhere, Psychic Vampire crosses from blues to jazz, and Hard Place softens the southern-rock edges of Drive-By Truckersâ€™ work. Once again, though, Porter stops short of his target because he never quite finds the final pieces that would make his melodies utterly unshakeable.

At its heart, How to Rob a Bank â€” like Porterâ€™s other recent offerings â€” revels in its slickly delivered simplicity. Its songs, at least initially, seem to be far removed from the intricate guitar patterns that dominated the material on The Trees Have Soul. With time, however, the subtle textures he weaves into his arrangements combine to elevate the affair, revealing the intimacy as well as the aggressive ambition that burbles beneath the surface of tracks like Colored Lights and Wide Open Mind.

Porter shows the greatest growth within his lyrics. Throughout How to Rob a Bank, he spins tales from a variety of perspectives, assuming roles like an actor. On Hard Place, itâ€™s a Marine; on Learning the Language, itâ€™s an assortment of characters in need of liberation from their past; and on How to Rob a Bank, itâ€™s a corporate executive who ran off with the loot he stole from the pockets of everyday Americans. Porter speaks personally, too, pledging his love in Barefoot Reel and cleverly couching frustrations with his own career in a song about artists who achieved their fame only in death.
