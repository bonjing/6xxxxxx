Even the hard-core electric blues player would have to admit that there's only one thing sweeter and more satisfying than kicking back and listening to a great acoustic blues player do their solo thing - and that's picking up the acoustic yourself and banging out your own killer solo bluesy groove.

Joe Dalton's 50 Acoustic Blues Licks You Must Know is so much more than a killer hand-picked collection of acoustic blues licks - it's a veritable construction kit for the solo acoustic blues guitar player. 

Yes, there's plenty of great fills, contrary motion moves, double and triple-stops, hammer-ons, pull offs, slides and other assorted smoking lickage. But you also get intros, a variety of bluesy progressions to work with, turnarounds, constant bass grooves and countless tips on putting it all together, creating your own sound and crafting your own mesmerizing solo acoustic blues pieces. 

Acoustic blues guitar relies as much on stock techniques, grooves and licks as it does on creative improvisation and personal interpretation. And this is exactly how Dalton presents the material; he'll first show you a stock move, then show you how to connect that move to other moves, and then he guides you through various approaches for twisting and turning those moves into your own.

50 Acoustic Blues Licks You Must Know is a must-have, highly addicting and extraordinarily effective learning experience. Grab the box and dig in!
