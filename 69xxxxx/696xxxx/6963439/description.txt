I see that TvTeam wants to take over.
I have no problem with that, I'll step aside.
But if you want me to keep uploading to TPB, please tell me. 
I can use Xvid if you want, but it is slower to rip, and I like to go to bed early !!

I always upload to "Sendspace" then email a link to a friend in Norway, before I upload to TPB.
If Dee, Debra and Dave want to text me your email address to 0044 7845 4688 95, I will send the link to you as well. 

I went to the website for torrentday to have a look, but you need an invite to join. 
I don't have any friends to invite me.
Who would want to befriend a sad, blind, drunken Scotsman !!
