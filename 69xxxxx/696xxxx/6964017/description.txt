Review from All Music Guide:
(4 1/2 STARS)

Grammy-winning comeback set that brought Buddy Guy back to prominence after a long studio hiatus. Too many clichÃƒÂ©d cover choices -- "Five Long Years," "Mustang Sally," "Black Night," "There Is Something on Your Mind" -- to earn unreserved recommendation, but Guy's frenetic guitar histrionics ably cut through the superstar-heavy proceedings (Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Mark Knopfler all turn up) on the snarling title cut and a handful of others.
