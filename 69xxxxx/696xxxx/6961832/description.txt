Truth, they say, is stranger than fiction. If that be so, how does one define 'strangeness', especially when it comes camouflaged in bitter-sweet memories of incidental recall and sudden, hazy flashbacks? Call it deja vu or happenings anew, the collection explores myth and realityâ€”occurences of long ago and situations that are practically current. Strange Stories and Teenage Tales. A winning combination!
The Guardian of Gunrockâ€”24 Short Stories is a collection of the Strange Stories and Teenage Stories that won a prize in the Competition for Writers of Children's Books organized by CBT.
