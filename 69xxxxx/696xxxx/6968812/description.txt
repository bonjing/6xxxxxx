 Imagine a make-up girl who became an extra    
 and then the most wanted heroine of the       
 early 80s.Chronicling the meteoric rise       
 and steep fall of the erstwhile screen        
 sensation - Silk Smitha, The Dirty Picture    
 is set against the colorful and entertaining  
 backdrop of the South film industry of the    
 80's.The quintessential siren, Silk, knew     
 her audiences, and it didn't seem like        
 anything would stop the fiercely ambitious    
 starlet, till it did, in the shape of         
 unrequited love. To the world, she was the    
 queen of sensuality. But at heart, Silk was   
 just another woman craving true love.
