Boy Wonder 2010 DVDRip XviD-VoMiT

PLOT:
A young Brooklyn boy witnesses the brutal murder of his mother and grows up obsessed with finding 
her killer. Thus begins his life as a quiet, straight-A student by day and a self-appointed hero 
at night. But what is a real hero? And who decides what is right or wrong? As the boundaries blur, 
Sean's dual life wears on his psyche and his two worlds careen dangerously close to colliding. Like 
a graphic novel you can't put down, Boy Wonder challenges morality, distorting perceptions of what 
is right and what is justified, as it races to its shocking conclusion.
