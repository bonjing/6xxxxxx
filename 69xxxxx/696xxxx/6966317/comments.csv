I don't have a preactivated version of this one,but only latest version with SD patch who
working fine either.
Btw,you need to know that this one will not work on DVD copy protected as this soft is not able to remove any copy protection so.
That's why this last one is not the best then.
You must first,rebuild a new iso of your DVD with all copy protection removed and then,use this one for.
Double time and a waste of time for.
However if you wanna i up it :
let me know and i will...
