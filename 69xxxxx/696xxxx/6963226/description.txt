NOTES:

Ok had this video a while and no audio til now ....thanks to those at Nos 10 
Readnfo ....well the video on a whole was very dark and needed some lov'in ,also missing 4-5 secs but nothing more and you 
can't tell unless u were syncing it.
Workdone ....filtered the video and clean it up some,however still pretty dark and trust much,rise the brightness any higher
and it will look wasted out and .
Audio i needed to cut unwanted  and then sync ...took 12 cuts in the end due to missing video etc...but got there in the end.
Also remastered the audio changing all EQ bands aswell as using a standard hiss removal filter.

Oh got to say the video is watermarked with a site URL ...no i didn't put it there,but didn't fancy having a big ... blur there either.
Last about 40 secs a time and appears 3-4 times throughout.
