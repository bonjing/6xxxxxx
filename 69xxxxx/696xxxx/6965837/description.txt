Description

Must have app for any root user. Make backups, flash ROMs, and own your device.

ATTENTION: We have started the rollout of ClockworkMod Recovery 5 for some devices. It will have faster tar backups, and will properly preserve the filesystem type at time of backup. If CWR5 fails to flash try flashing again, that usually fixes it (bad flash). If you have any issues with CWR5, feel free to roll back to the previous version, and report the bug to me at koush@clockworkmod.com!

* Flash your recovery to the latest and greatest ClockworkMod recovery.
* Manage your ROMs via a handy UI.
* Organize and perform backups and restores from within Android!
* Install ROMs from your SD card.
* Install your favorite ROMs over the air! 

Premium Version:
* Premium ROMs
* Receive notifications for when your ROM is updated!
* Automatic backups
* Install from QR Code
* Web Connect
* Support

Why does ROM Manager ask for account permissions?
Web Connect only needs to access your Google account to connect it to your google account. It can't access any private data or passwords.


Troubleshooting:

Droid users: Stuck at the "M" logo? Flash an alternate recovery and flash back to ClockworkMod.
HTC Users: Flash recovery not working? Try fastbooting a recovery on.
Droid X/2/Pro Users: You must run the Bootstrap application first to use ROM Manager.
Samsung users: You must flash a Clockwork compatible kernel first (see XDA forums)

IF YOU ARE HAVING LICENSE ISSUES, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE LATEST VERSION OF FREE (4.0+) AND THE LATEST LICENSE (1.0.7+) INSTALLED!
