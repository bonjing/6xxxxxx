[T],iamgreat,2012-01-19T02:42Z,FQM's XviD and ORENJi's 720p releases are both missing the scene at the beginning of the fourth act (27.54) where Aidan meets one of Bishop's men outside the house and takes a moment on the steps to advise him to leave the city. Aidan then walks into the kitchen and sits down at the table and tells Josh that he has been a little hard on him. It is a rather big 59 seconds that is missing which entirely sets up a later scene.
