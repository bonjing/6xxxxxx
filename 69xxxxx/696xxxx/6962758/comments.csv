That is a problem with your end i believe. I used to have this problem when playing some incomplete files. It would show me like 4 hours of movies that i had previously deleted (As deleting files doesnt really ""delete"" them, it just makes the disk space appear empty on the OS allowing it to be written over)

I dont know what caused/causes it but it only happened on one windows installation, i have never seen it again since reformatting 100 more times."
