Plot: Mark Wahlberg leads the cast of Contraband, an action-thriller about a man trying to stay out of a world he worked hard to leave behind and the family heâ€™ll do anything to protect. Set in New Orleans, the film explores the cutthroat underground world of international smuggling â€“ full of desperate criminals and corrupt officials, high-stakes and big payoffs-where loyalty rarely exists and death is one wrong turn away.

Things quickly fall apart and with only hours to reach the cashâ€¦
