I'm not sure about the lack of metadata; but the exact same copy I nabbed off the Autosport servers is the exact same copy I uploaded. In fact I just downloaded the pdf file off this torrent again and I see content creator; and encoding software; as Acrobat 9.5.0. I also did a fresh download of the official Autosport copy, and it lists the creator and encoder as Acrobat 9.5.0 as well."
