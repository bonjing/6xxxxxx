Live at Roseland Ballroom is the first live album by the jam band Gov't Mule. It was taken from their performance on New Year's Eve, 1995, opening for Blues Traveler. It was recorded at the Roseland Ballroom in Manhattan.

The album was out of print for over a decade, and used CD copies sold for over 30 dollars (US) on amazon.com at one point. The album was reissued in 2007 on Evil Teen Records, the record label of Warren Haynes and his wife/manager Stephanie Scarmado. The reissue featured a cover of Voodoo Chile recorded after Woody's passing. In the reissue liner notes, Haynes relates that he chose to include this track, rather than a track featuring the original lineup with Woody, due to the audio quality of the recordings available to him at the time.
