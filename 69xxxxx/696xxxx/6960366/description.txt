Rosie Ledetâ€™s music continues to changeâ€”and thatâ€™s a good thing.  It is evolving. The zydeco princessâ€™ debut on the JSP label is also her first with producer Andre Nizzari, and under his direction the gentle flirtations with a more mainstream sound heard on previous albums, such as 2001â€™s Show Me Something, are brought into full bloom.  The result is her freshest and most energized release to date.

The songs are classic Ledet; her sassy, sexy way with words is evident in the come-hither lyrics of the title track, This Is Gonna Take a While, and Git Up on It.

The range of her vocal abilities is also well represented; her voice is clear and light on the straightforward zydeco of Caffina, sultry and BeyoncÃ©-esque on For Those Who Like It Funkyâ€”indeed, itâ€™s easy to imagine Ms. Knowles singing the R&B; rumble Poison. Funky, as the title suggests, is given a funk under-pinning by Chuck Bushâ€™s bass, while Baby What You Do to Me, and Stop Lyinâ€™ Keep Tryinâ€™, sound almost like accordion-rooted rock. This is largely due to Nizzariâ€™s handling of the guitars and keyboards; his hook on Love Is Gonna Find You is reminiscent of Mark Knopfler, while his keyboard work on Keep the Faith has a fun, space-age feel to it.  But just when the music seems to venture too far into foreign territory, Ledetâ€™s energetic accordion and Damon Dugasâ€™ rubboard remind us where its heart lies.

Some of Ledetâ€™s longtime fans may balk at what they hear, but an artist of her caliber deserves to be heard by a wider audience.
