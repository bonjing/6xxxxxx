Not all, but yes, most things in the western world are indirect or direct capitalist propaganda. 

Even every commercial is pure direct propaganda, embracing a ethical, philosophical and foremost political system with minimum or no fact presented. 

I think it's you who are the one who dont understand the wide concept of propaganda. 

They are obviously trying to pitch something here, but it's extremely fuzzy what and for what reason. My guess is that they are trying to sell them self as gurus to get more customers to their crystal cleansing clinic or whatever.
