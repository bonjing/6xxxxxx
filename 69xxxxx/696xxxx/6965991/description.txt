DUKE ELLINGTON and JOHNNY HODGES BACK TO BACK
Released 1959 
Recorded February 20, 1959 - Columbia Studios, New York
Label: Verve
Format:Flac

In February of 1959, Duke Ellington and Johnny Hodges decided to collaborate. The result was not a heavily arranged big band project, but a blues record. In place of an orchestra, there was a quintet, including Harry â€œSweetsâ€ Edison on trumpet. An unusual feature is Ellington in the role of sideman, in essence backing Hodges (Note: there are many rumors over the tension in this session). Never the less, the ensemble weaves through a catalogue of tunes (only one Ellington piece). A subsequent LP, Side By Side was released the same year.
