I havent ripped any of the episodes myself and just have combined torrents from 3 or 4 uploaders to 1 source. The original file names were left unchanged. Full credits to them. 

I believe it has all episodes from Season 1-5 (including a special episode (S05E0) and the first 2 episodes of Season 6. 

Subtitles NOT included.

Although this series isnt near as classy as \\\\\\\"Frasier\\\\\\\" (my all time favorite), it\\\\\\\'s still great for its light humor and morals.

I am seeding from Japan, and will provide maximum bandwidth as long as I can (maybe a week). Please download and seed so that we all can experience it.
