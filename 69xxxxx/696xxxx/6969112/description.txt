In this highly political Japanese film, a family's disintegration is shown as an analogy for the Japanese descent into heartless materialism. Though his family members have resigned themselves to their downward spiral both socially and economically, the son of the household has not. He is ambitious to attain something and to strike out on his own. What happens instead is that he grows increasingly disillusioned about his life and his world.

Throw Away Your Books is unquestionably a product of the late Sixties and early Seventies, when rebellion ruled the artistic roost and everything from â€œanti-theaterâ€ to â€œun-universitiesâ€ were in vogue. In the same way, Books is something like â€œanti-cinemaâ€: itâ€™s unburdened by anything like a linear plot or conventional storytelling, has no real beginning or end (or even a middle, really), and floats freely from one loony scene to the next. Despite all this, itâ€™s not the unwatchable disaster it could very easily have been; itâ€™s actually quite charming in its ragged insistence on being its own self.
