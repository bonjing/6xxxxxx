Synopsis: Unlike the full version or other 'portable' versions, this does not
require ESET to run. This will scan for ESET licenses, afterwhich, you can save
to a text file. This works for ESET Anti-Virus, Smart Security, and Business
Editions.

I created this because i hate installing stuff on my computer especially
dangerous software like this. I've removed all the unnecessary components like
'Automatic License Insertion', etc.

This is a no frills, license finder for ESET.
Simply scan, save to a text file, and use.

Enjoy ~
