
Plot: 
Following years of growing apart, Harold Lee (Cho) and Kumar Patel (Penn) have replaced each other with new friends and are preparing for their respective Yuletide celebrations. But when a mysterious package mistakenly arrives at Kumarâ€™s door on Christmas Eve, his attempt to redirect it to Haroldâ€™s house ends with the â€œhigh gradeâ€ contents-and Haroldâ€™s father-in-lawâ€™s prize Christmas tree-going up in smoke. With his in-laws out of the house for the day, Harold decides to cover his tracks, rather than come clean. Reluctantly embarking on another ill-advised journey with Kumar through New York City, their search for the perfect replacement tree takes them through party heaven-and almost blows Christmas Eve sky high.
