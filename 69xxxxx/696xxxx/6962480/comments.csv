,Cehemm,2012-05-08T18:34Z,"I couldn't make it work with Multiman 2.0 on CFW 3.55 Kmeaw : the game launches but when I select GoW or GoW II it always returns to the XMB. I read somewhere you had to change the resolution to 720p, but it didn't work. Maybe it's due to my external hard drive cause I can't copy the game to internal (it always crashes).
Did anybody manage to make it work? "
