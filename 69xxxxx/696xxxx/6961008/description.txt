Here's another film from "Unusual Films", the film division of Bob Jones University, a Christian fundamentalist university in South Carolina. This time the story is set during the Spanish Inquisition. Here's the description from the DVD box:

//Set in the splendor and terror of the Spanish Inquisition, Flame in the Wind is a gripping drama of heroic Christian faith. It tells the story of Carlos, an earnest young nobleman who becomes involved in the age-old struggle between truth and error. Carlos is faced with a choice: the church system offers safety, protection and respectability, the Scriptures offer Christ and salvation from sin -- and with these, torture and death. To all those who trust Christ, Flame in the Wind is a challenge to be willing to endure persecution for the sake of the truth, even if it means the sacrifice of their lives.//

Directed by Katherine Stenholm. Written by Tim Rogers. Starring David Hewson, Bob Jones Jr, Bob Jones III, Richard Rupp, Edward Panosian.
