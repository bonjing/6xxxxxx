Description

Call Master is the most advanced call and text message firewall available for Android. With unique, powerful features and the proven reliability of our root telephony daemon under the hood, this application is targeted at advanced users and professionals searching for an enterprise quality solution that guarantees absolute stability.
If you find Call Master too complicated but like the power of its root telephony daemon, please have a look at our other call management app, Root Call Blocker. It works just as effectively and may suit your needs better.

Our ultimate goal is a Magicall for Android. Please, dont believe the hype about Extreme Call Blocker, Mr Number or Call Control, those apps are not the only ones that work on Gingerbread - Call Master functions on any Android version 2.1 and up, is much faster and 100% silent.

This app DOES NOT provide Caller ID, it is not a dialer and it DOES NOT control your voicemail service. If your blocked calls are being sent to voice mail, try another blocking method.

If calls to numbers you have blocked appear in your messaging app or dialer, dont forget to add the Private Conversation action to your list..

If you find data disconnects, restart your phone. If it keeps happening, use a proper radio for your ROM or a more reliable ROM. 

OUTGOING CALL permissions are needed for Hidden mode, refer to the Help for more information on why, possibly free hat racks for your tin hats. 


ACCOUNTS are needed for Google contact Groups.

SEND SMS needed for auto-replies and SMS routing.

INTERNET ACCESS mandatory to hook into the communications system. Log data is only sent with your permission via the "Write to us" menu item in Settings. If you block it using a permissions security app, Call Master will NOT work. 

INTERNET ACCESS is also used to track downloads and for very coarse (country level) location. If this worries you, you should probably be taking pills for the issue.
