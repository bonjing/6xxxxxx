Here it is, ladies and gents! The complete series has finally been completed. I found all the episodes from various sources on the net, edited out some unwanted errors, synced some annoyingly unsynchronized audio and converted all the files to XviD. Now it's ready to share! Be sure to spread this all over the Internet, because more people need to know how great Wishbone is!

Some details: All files are XviD, in the AVI container. About 90% are PDTV rips, a very rare episode (S01E21) and the movie special Dog Days of the West are VHS rips, and the episodes released on DVD are DVD rips. The quality ranges from 'okay' to very good. 5 or 6 episodes have a very small frame (~320x288), but they honestly don't look too bad even when I full-screen them on my 1280x800 laptop. Overall, it's a good collection, and I'm happy with it. I hope you will be happy with it too.

Don't forget to seed! :D
