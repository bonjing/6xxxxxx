NOTES:

First off the video ....pretty poor in most places the source was,lots of camera movement,colour change now and again.Just
a bit like the russian mi4 video was.
Audio i used one that was give via megaup ...but it sounds like 26ks,but unsure who the capper is so thanks too them.
Audio sucked ass IMHO ....really bad,considering some of the cam audio we've been having lately....

Workdone ....took the russian release and encoded it,changed the brightness,contrast,colour,rgb colours,sharpness etc....couldn't do 
a nothing about the movement really so thats still there :( .
Audio was a fecking nightmare :( ....had to resync from scratch as it wouldn't mux to my encode at all ....had to remove 1.5 secs of audio
to line it up with for a start,then it was going oos badly every other min .So did some stretching and made several audio files so i could sync it
better....but still needed 41 cuts in total as there was missing video in several places normally 2-7 secs at a time.
Hoping i got most of it insync ,scrolled through and looked ok too me.
Oh also remastered the audio the best i could ....used a hiss and noise removal aswell as changing the EQ bands....still sounds crap for cam,but its
all we've got so ......
