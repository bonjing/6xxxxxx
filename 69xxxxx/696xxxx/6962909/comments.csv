SO IF SHE ALREADY KNOWS THAT THERE IS A SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE GREEKS, WHY IS SHE DOING A DOCUMENTARY, A DOCUMENTARY IS SUPPOSED TO INVESTIGATE WEATHER OR NOT SOMETHING IS TRUE OR FALSE, RIGHT OR WRONG. 
THIS IS JUST A PIECE OF BULLSHIT FROM A WOMEN WHO CAME TO SWEDEN FROM GREECE MANY YEARS AGO, AND SHE ARE NOW POINTING HER LONG FINGER AT HER COUNTRY WHERE SHE WAS BORN IN, IT'S A TYPICAL SWEDISH THING TO POINT AT SOMETHING THAT IS LESS PERFECT AND SAY , HAHAHA. CUZ SWEDEN IS ALWAYS BEST ACCORDING TO SWEDISH PEOPLE.AREN'T WE? 
PASCALDIOU GOT AN OFFER FROM THE SWEDISH CHANNEL ""SVT 1"" TO MAKE A WHAT THEY CALL A DOCUMENTARY OF ""HER"" COUNTRY (SINCE THE ""BAD"" ECONOMY IN GREECE), AND OF COURSE SHE ACCEPTED IT, SHE WENT DOWN, TALKED WITH SOME PEOPLE OVER A FEW INTERVIEWS WHO WERE FIXED BEFORE THEY STARTED THE CAMERAS, SHE THEN WENT TO THIS PLACE TO FILM, WHERE THEY GET YOU FREE FOOD IF YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY, (AND BE HONEST, ALL OF THEM WERE PAKISTANIAN,AFGHANISTANIAN,AND SOME SLAVIC PEOPLE IN THE LINE FOR THE FREE FOOD), AND THEN SHE GOT ""HOME"" TO SWEDEN , GOT PAID, AND THE WORK WAS DONE, SIMPLE AS THAT. 

FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO WONDER WHAT KIND OF PERSON I AM, I AM SWEDISH. IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY, ADD ME ON TWITTER AND HUNT ME DOWN.
