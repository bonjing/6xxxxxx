**PERSONAL NOTE**

I was Listening to the Alex Jones Radio Show on the GCN radio Network, when
a whistle blower came on the air in regards to Alex's discover of KBR's "Project Overview and Anticipated Project Requirements" PDF,
which Alex stated that the FEMA campes were activating (being staffed and employed) just the week prior. When this whislte blower cam on the air,
she told Alex he was reading the wrong document and told him to find "Statement of Work for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), 
National Continuity Project (NCP) Program and Mission Support Services (PAMSS)". I Downloded both files immediately from the FBO.gov site
(which wasn't that hard to find) and within an hour of the whistle being blown, the files were pulled down, with a note implying the documents were classified.
Here they are in their original format. Please read, share, email or whatever to friends and family, especially those in military and navy.
