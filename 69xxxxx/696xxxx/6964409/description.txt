THIS IS A PROPER BLU RAY RIP,THE PREVIOUS RIP ON TORRENT OF THE SAME SIZE WAS 720P LINE AND NOT BLU RAY,DOWNLOAD THE SAMPLE AND COMPARE WITH THAT COPY,YOU WILL NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE IN VIDEO AND AUDIO QUALITY


THIS IS ONE OF MY PERSONAL FAVORITES......FINALLY A GOOD REMAKE



SOME TRIVIA FROM IMDB

If you read the graffiti on the jail cell wall, one appears to say "Romero".

The film opens with the song "We'll Meet Again," as performed by Johnny Cash. The song is from the same album that provided "The Man Comes Around," which opened another remake of a George A. Romero film, Dawn of the Dead. The album is "American IV", the last full album Cash released before his death. "The Man Comes Around" and "We'll Meet Again" are the opening and closing tracks, respectively.

Each actor that was transformed into a "crazie" had to sit in the make-up chair for three hours.

The old police car they go back to get is a 1973 Ford LTD from the same year as the original movie.
