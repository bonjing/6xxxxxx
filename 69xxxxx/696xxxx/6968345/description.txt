Review:

Jenn Grant is on an upswing. The Halifax-based pop singer/songwriter sounds positively peppy on her third album, which is full of charming melodies, playful arrangements and electro-tinged dance beats that leave her folk roots in the dust.

Grant seems to be writing with an audience in mind, a departure from the introspective broken-heartedness displayed on 2009â€™s Echoes. She adds some grit to her overwhelmingly pretty vocals on How I Met You, a horn-punctuated Motown chorus to All Year â€“ just one of the albumâ€™s many standout choruses â€“ and sinister synths on Walk Away that prevent a saccharine overdose and suggest an entirely new direction.

The ability to pull off such fearless variety â€“ softer, intimate folk also makes appearances â€“ is a sure sign of a songwriter who has come into her own.
