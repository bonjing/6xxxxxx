,Tigercubette,2012-04-03T20:16Z,I have been wanting this complete set for a long time. I stopped coming on this site due to ISP notices. But now I've learned how to weed out ones that are false and being tracked. I want to thank you for the beauty of your uploads. I have seeded and will continue to seed for another week. I've uploaded 31gbs on each episode so that I am not a common leech.
ions, same engine, etc.  I'm just a little more used to Handbrake and I think the interface is a little faster.  Vidcoder is a little more stable than Handbrake's nightlies and I like how the author decided to keep target file size.  So there's pros to both programs.  Yes, I'ved upped subme to 11 and lowered motion estimation range to 32 (from 64).  That's really about the only changes (i think)."
