Hi everyone, this is my first torrent upload, so please feel free to give me constructive comments about anything related to torrent.  My source for these episodes is not quite DVD quality, but still good quality for a 1996 TV show.  I am on a decent high speed residential connection in Canada so please be patient at first, i will try and upload as much as i can and hope others will help seed.   

Please comment!  Also, I have season 2 available, which i will upload after Season 1 has enough seeds. (to sustain itself)

As a teenager growing up around the time this show first aired, it was the best cop drama on TV (IMO) and a shame that it did not run longer.  Very hard to find on the web as a torrent, so here it is!
