Instructor's Solution Manual (ISM) for "Thomas' Calculus, 12th Edition", based on the original work by G. B. Thomas and as revised by M. D. Weir and J. Hass (c2010). Packaged in a single, fully bookmarked, page-numbered and editable (unprotected) PDF file (36 MB) with its own table of contents. Also the student's solution manual (solutions to odd-numbered problems) for the online chapter 17 has been inserted for completeness. 7-ZIP archive to reduce data transfer and download time by 10%.

Comment: This solution manual can also be used for the Single Variable, Multivariable and Early Transcendentals versions (with small effort) of this well-known text. Will also prove useful for the most part with University Calculus (c2012) by the same authors.
