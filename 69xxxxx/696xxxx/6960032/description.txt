Itâ€™s Sunday and Chintu canâ€™t wait to get   
up since his father is arriving today. He  
accompanies his mother to the station.     
Before they reach, their jeep breaks down  
only to start mysteriously. This is only   
the beginning of a bizarre ride for the    
family that sees the father oversleep and  
miss his station, the mother trying to     
follow in another train only to realize it 
wonâ€™t stop for six hours and the father and
son now desperately trying to chase the    
mother. A series of funny and weird events 
thus separate mother, father and son with  
each trying to find one another. Will the  
fun ride ever end for the three? Sunday is 
a funny, witty and quirky watch for the    
entire family directed by the late Pankaj  
Advani. It won the best Short Fiction Film 
and the Best Music Direction awards at the 
41st National Film Awards, 1994.
