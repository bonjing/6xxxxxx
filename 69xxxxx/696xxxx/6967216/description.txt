    [b][i]Will Smith, Alice Braga and Charlie Tahan[/i][/b]


[b][color=blue]::Plot::[/color][/b]
  [b][i]In December 2009, military virologist Lieutenant Colonel Robert Neville (Will Smith) loses his wife Zoe 

(Salli Richardson) and daughter Marley (Willow Smith) in a helicopter accident during a chaotic quarantine of 

Manhattan. A genetically-engineered variant of the measles virus created by Dr. Alice Krippin (Emma Thompson), 

meant as a cure for cancer, had mutated into a lethal strain. It spreads throughout the world, killing 90% of 

humanity. By September 2012, Neville is the last healthy human in New York City; the rest of the plague's survivors 

have degenerated into predatory, cannibalistic beings referred to as "Darkseekers",[4] who hunt the immune humans 

as prey. The Darkseekers are so named for hiding during daylight due to a painful intolerance of UV radiation.
Neville's daily routine includes experimenting on infected rats to find a cure for the virus and trips through a 

decaying Manhattan to collect supplies from abandoned homes or hunt for the deer that have moved into the city. He 

also keeps vigil each day for a response to his continuous recorded AM radio broadcasts, which instruct any 

survivors to meet him at midday at the South Street Seaport. Neville's isolation is broken only by the 

companionship of his German Shepherd Sam and interaction with mannequins he has set up as patrons of a video store.
When one of his rat experiments shows a promising treatment, Neville sets a snare trap and captures an infected 

woman. An enraged Darkseeker alpha male attempts to rescue her, but is driven back by the sunlight. In his 

laboratory in the basement of his heavily fortified Washington Square Park home, Neville tries the new serum on the 

infected woman, seemingly without success.
The next day, after finding one of his mannequins ("Fred") out in the street in front of Grand Central Terminal, he 

is caught in a snare trap and passes out. He regains consciousness at dusk and frees himself, but is attacked by a 

pack of infected dogs. Although Neville and Sam manage to kill the dogs, one bites Sam during the fight. Neville 

brings Sam home and attempts to save the dog by injecting a strain of his serum, but it is too late; a heartbroken 

Neville is forced to kill his only companion.
Overcome by grief and rage, Neville attacks a group of the infected the following night with his UV light equipped 

SUV. He manages to kill several Darkseekers, but they overwhelm and nearly kill him before he is rescued by a pair 

of immune humans, a woman named Anna (Alice Braga) and a boy named Ethan (Charlie Tahan), who followed his radio 

broadcasts. Anna and Ethan take him back to his home, where Anna explains that they are making their way to a 

survivors' camp in Bethel, Vermont. Neville disputes that such a camp exists, and expresses his doubt when Anna 

says God told her about it.
The following night, the alpha male leads a mob of Darkseekers in an attack on the house. Anna, who was unaware of 

Neville's precautions in covering his scent outside the house, inadvertently allows the Darkseekers to follow their 

trail and discover Neville's home. When the Darkseekers charge the house, Neville uses UV worklights to push the 

mob back, but the infected easily shatter the lights and continue their attack. Neville kills the first wave of 

Darkseekers with claymore mines, but finds himself defenseless against the second wave. Neville tries to find Anna 

and Ethan, but before he can, a Darkseeker enters and attacks him. The Darkseeker retreats upstairs and begins 

tearing a hole in the roof so other infected can get in.
After Neville saves Anna and Ethan, they hear the infected climbing the house, so they retreat into the basement 

laboratory. They seal themselves in a reinforced plexiglass room with the infected woman, and they discover that 

Neville's treatment is in fact working: the subject looks much more human. The infected break in and the alpha male 

starts throwing himself against the plexiglass, cracking the material. Realizing that the last treatment has been 

successful, Neville draws a vial of the infected woman's blood and gives it to Anna before shutting them inside a 

coal chute hidden in the back of the lab. He uses an M67 hand grenade to wipe out the attackers at the cost of his 

own life. Anna and Ethan are later seen driving in Vermont and stopping at the gated entrance to the survivors' 

colony, where Anna hands over the antidote. In a voice-over, Anna claims that the survivors are Neville's legacy, 

as his fight for a cure became legend.

Alternate ending
In the film's original ending, Neville realizes that the alpha male is identifying the woman he was experimenting 

on by a butterfly tattoo, and that the alpha male wants her back. Neville puts his gun down and returns the 

infected woman. Neville and the alpha male then exchange stares; Neville apologizes to the Darkseekers; the alpha 

male acknowledges his apology, and the infected leave. The final shot follows Neville, Anna, and Ethan as they 

drive away towards Vermont with the antidote.[5]
Due to test audience's dislike of the film's original ending, several scenes were altered before the film's 

release, especially the stand-off between Neville and the infected in his laboratory. Visual effects supervisor 

Janek Sirrs recounts the original ending, starting with the standoff: "At that point, Neville's â€” and the 

audience's â€” assumptions about the nature of these creatures are shown to be incorrect. We see that they have 

actually retained some of their humanity. There is a very important moment between the alpha male and Neville. The 

alpha male slapped his hand on the glass and smeared it, revealing a butterfly-shaped imprint."[/i][/b]
