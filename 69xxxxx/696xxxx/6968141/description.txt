SOME TRIVIA FROM IMDB

In real life, Justin Timberlake is older than Olivia Wilde, who plays his mother. 

Amanda Seyfried, Justin Timberlake, Olivia Wilde, and Vincent Kartheiser also appeared together in Alpha Dog.

While the movie was about people who would look 25 years old until they die, Amanda Seyfried is actually the only significant character who was 25 during filming. 

Many of the character names are those of famous, and not so famous, watchmakers. The name Weis is pronounced the same as the watchmaker Albert Wajs. 

The producers, director, and distributor of "In Time" were sued by Harlan Ellison, for alleged similarities between the film, and his short story, called, "'Repent Harlequin,' Said The Ticktockman". He requested all copies of the film to be destroyed before its Oct. 2011 release. Ultimately, however, after seeing the movie, Ellison dropped the suit, he and the producer made amicable announcements, and no mention of Ellison was made in the credits.
