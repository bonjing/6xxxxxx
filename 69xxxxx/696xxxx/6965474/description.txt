These files were not ripped by me, chabosun, but (ostensibly) by the folks at holyfuckingshit40000 dot bl0gsp0t dot comic-minus-the-ic who have distributed them through M3g@Upl0@d. According to the supplied log, they were ripped with cdparanoia III and encoded with FLAC 1.2.1. While I can't 100% vouch for the accuracy of this info, the files sound excellent and the scarcity of the material in question compels me to upload it regardless.

Q: Why are you uploading someone else's rip when their copy is still available for download?
A: (1) As far as I know, this album is not readily available in FLAC on TPB or other torrent networks. (2) It deserves, imho, as wide an audience as possible. (3) I don't trust M3g@Upl0@d to continue to make it available; in the hands of hundreds (wishful thinking, I know) of seeders, it will be less likely to disappear from the internet than is the single copy on M3g@Upl0@d.

Please seed for as long as you can. Let's keep these hard-to-find rips alive and available to anyone interested.
