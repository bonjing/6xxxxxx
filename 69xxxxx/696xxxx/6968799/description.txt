This is a CD I've had for about 20 years and I pull it out when I need something I haven't heard in a long while. It's a great example of how other musicians take inspiration from members of Pink Floyd. Rick Fenn is channeling David Gilmour's guitar licks all over the CD. I hope you enjoy this - I know I have for many many years!
