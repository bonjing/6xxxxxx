Hayat is a 12 year old girl who lives    
with her family in a village in Iran.    
She is looking forward to give an exam   
in the village school and is preparing

her father falls ill and has to be       
hospitalized. Hayat is distraught at     
having to babysit her infant sister on   
the most important day of her life. But  
she is not a girl to give up that easily.

exam. Would she succeed?
