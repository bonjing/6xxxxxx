Good one Zappaz!

I'll have to remember that one"
 he went to the big-chief and asked: woh-woh bigchief, as the leder You always name the newborn. But how do You do it ??

Well - If I see a bull on the praerie - i call him big-bull and if i see a black sky - i call him black cloud.

But why do You ask - TwoFukingDogs ??
