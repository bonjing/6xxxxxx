Hello!

This is my first torrent, so tell me if I did it right, I think I did...

This is Swiftkey X for Android Phones. There is already one on TPB like this, but its for tablets. This one is for phones. (This one and the tablet one works very well, I use both of them)

This is version 2.2.0.121, and updates are not possible. The android market keeps track of what you buy, and if you try to update this, it'll say something to the effect of "You have not purchased this app." Even though the update button is there on the App's page.

Please seed, go against SOPA, and I'll have another app up shortly (probably Wolfram|Alpha 1.04 for Android) keep your eyes open for that! Its an amazing knowledge engine.

Thanks everyone!
