However both version has shown one part of the movie which is not shown in the theater but still, most of it are missing as shown from the trailer which is weird why it's still not released in DVD :( I think the full version of this movie is nearly 2 hours but this version and the other is the same which is 1 hr 33 mins. Anyway, this quality is magnificent 10/10 !"
