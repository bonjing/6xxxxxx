While Yanni seems much drawn to black music and artists on his shows and 
in this concert from many varied countries indeed, the truth is he finds 
the best genius in "staying closer to the knitting of his own creative 
genius" in regards to where he really does score the points that place 
him into the category of the supreme for western audience tastes

We get a beautiful rendition of Vivaldi's four Seasons winter segment
in this concert and lovely music that follows that is the true stuff of
Yannis best music achievements
