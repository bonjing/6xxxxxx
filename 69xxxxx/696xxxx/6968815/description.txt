Bluegras virtuosos The Rice Brothers return with their second release as the 
family unit. Award-winning guitarists Tony and Wyatt Rice are joined by brothers
Larry (mandolin) and Ron (bass) on this fine collection of traditional and 
contemporary bluegrass, drawn from sources as diverse as Bill Monroe and Tom
Petty. With Larry and Tony sharing vocal chores and all four brothers shining on
their instruments, the brothers Rice share the music that's in their blood.
