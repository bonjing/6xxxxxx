Retro Game Master, known in Japan as GameCenter CX (ã‚²ãƒ¼ãƒ ã‚»ãƒ³ã‚¿ãƒ¼CX GÄ“mu SentÄ ShÄ« Ekkusu?), is a Japanese television series where Shinya Arino, a member of comedy duo Yoiko, plays Japan\\\'s most popular video games (a majority of which are Family Computer games) and records his progress as he works through a time limit, usually lasting up to one day. He is supported by his Assistant Directors (herein referred to as ADs) and Staff, both via moral support and actual gameplay.

He also gets the chance to interview game designers and to play arcade games occasionally.

There are currently seven DVD sets released in Japan. The show has been on-air since November 4, 2003 with a new episode every 2 weeks when a season is running.

Fuji TV is currently looking for international distributors for subtitled DVDs

As of June 23rd 2011, gaming website Kotaku has been streaming English translated episodes of the series. Note: Future seasons are most likely not returning -- \\\"Sadly, due to the mixed response to Season 1, it\\\'s unlikely we\\\'ll be doing another season of Retro Game Master.\\\" --Joel Johnson wrote on November 19, 2011 at 10:08:05 AM EST through e-mail.

On January 13th, 2012, Kotaku announced that their agreement to broadcast the show had ended; there will be no second season, and existing episodes will be removed when the rights expire.


Note: This is the American Season 1 shown on Kotaku which appears to be compiled from different episodes and seasons of the Japanese airing on Fuji TV. Thus the episode compilation difers from the Fuji TV season 1 airing. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retro_Game_Master
