Collective Political Violence is a concise, but thorough, interdisciplinary analysis of the many competing concepts, theories and explanations of political conflict, including revolutions, civil wars, genocide, and terrorism. To further his examination of each type of conflict, Earl Conteh-Morgan presents case studies, from the Rwandan genocide to the United States civil rights movement. Along the way, he illuminates new debates concerning terrorism, peacekeeping, and environmental security.
Written in a knowledgeable, yet accessible, manner, Collective Political Violence treats the issue of political violence with an impressively wide geographic range, and successfully straddles the ideological divide.
