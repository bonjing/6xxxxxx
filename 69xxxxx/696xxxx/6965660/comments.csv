ight since i saw a 9.0 version with keygen..ppl says in comments that that keygen is INFECTED.this torent has CLEAN keygen and a CLEAN crack.Also most of newer versions of some applications are improving ONLY the graphical Interface but it is still same engine.This version can still update the LATEST definitions for spyware.I want to ask you : what would you prefer to download and install, a 2010 version , active , CLEAN,REGISTERED with newest definitions available , OR a 2011 version improved only on Graphical Interface with an infected crack/keygen and after 15/30 days to get a Trial warning?"
