Beginnings always make history, as we all know. In every field of life, the position of 'the first,' is hallowed.
But just like beginnings, some endings too, have great historic value. Time has given an ever permanent throne only to the first, it never changes. Be it the first aircraft, the first steam engine, the first man in space, or anything else. But things are different in
the case of lasts. The record of being the last may change with time. In our modern world, a dodo bird or a mammoth might still be born again, recreated from fossil remains, thanks to advances in science. So we have to add the tag 'till date,' to some of the lasts.
Sometimes, it's the ending that gives more relief, than the beginning. An example is World War II. The feeling that the war had finally ended made the world happier than the victory of the Allies. In some cases, the first itself becomes the last. Do you remember the tragic story of lUXUry liner Titanic? It's very first journey became its last one too. 
This issue of 'Tell Me Why' tells about some ofthe remarkable endings that left their mark on history.
