NOTES:

Ok first off i know there is millions of releases already of this film,but not many have full crop of the chairs so 
opted to go down that rd.
Video as been tweaked,changing the brightness,contrast,rgb eq,intes,quad,resize and sharpness..
Audio i have clean in AA and changed all the EQ bands aswell as light hiss removal and then finally saved as a mp3.

Now for the the read nfo part ....well instead of just using a normal crop and cutting loses off,i went and used a quad crop
so i can cut at angles and not just up/down/left/right.
Now for this i had to recall the filter in vdub twice ...once for each chair.
Now the downside is it makes the film slightly unlevel has the right side had to be cut more.....and it pulls the video down.
Heres some screenies so you can see how much is lost and what i mean about being unlevel:

Now the its not always noticable but when there is straight lines you can see thats its uneven....If i pulled it back up level i would
have just create a new black border so that was pointless ....anyway take it or leave ,just a different option for you all :)
