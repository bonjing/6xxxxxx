This book challenges the widely held view that the information technology revolution has been a blessing for citizens of the Third World. It shows how the governments and corporations of the industrialized countries created the global IT regime by systematically excluding Third World representatives and their visions of the information society. Then these same actors pressured Third World societies to abide by the new international regime.  Using Egypt as a case study, the book explains from a critical realist perspective how Third World peoples are being deprived of the essential human right to shape new rules that govern their lives.
