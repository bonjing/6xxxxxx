"Kidnapped, blindfolded, trasported in the trunk of a car, this is the true story of a Christian woman who experienced the peace and grace through her abduction that only Christ can give."

Here's another very obscure movie. This comes from "Ken Anderson Films", which means it is a Christian film. This was based on a true story about the kidnapping of Eunice Kronholm in Minnesota. After the movie, there's an epilogue with Eunice and her husband talking to the camera where Eunice tells us that "God is really a great god". Strange stuff.

Directed by Bruce Lood. Written by Bruce Lood, based on the book by Ruth Peterman. Starring Scott Wallace, Joe Greco, Wiley Harker, Bunny Kacher, Don Marston
