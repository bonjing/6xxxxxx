The mp4 version of this movie download doesn't work on our Sony
HD/bluray player - so we made this compatible 720p HD Xvid version
instead to share with you all. Even load it on a USB memory stick if your
HD player has a USB port as its cheaper and less complicated than making a disc!

This movie is just now playing just down the street at a movie theater in town -
however its twenty bucks a head when you add in soda andetc

I don't begrudge them that, however I do think we have to make some effort
to correct the imbalance in trash material that's mainly been for 
some time in recent years mainly on television and on the DVD shelves in this
town - by making this nicer to view stuff more widely available using these
means - if you can afford to buy the disc as a souvenir - please do so
however I do believe that competent download are the way of the future for
the industry instead.

So enjoy another of John Le Carre's masterpiece novels brought to you
in a movie
