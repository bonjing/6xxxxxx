Hello everyone!

This is my 2nd torrent!

I present to you Wolfram|Alpha 1.0.4.2636360!
This app works great on my device, but as with all android apps not downloaded with the Android Market, it will not let you update it. Small price to pay, however.

If you happen to get a "Unable to parse the package" error upon install, check the file against the checksum of the torrent. If it doesn't match, redownload because its corrupted.

Seed, protest SOPA, and have a good day.
