    Maciste arranges for himself and his new friend Bangor to be captured    
    by a mysterious band of white-clad marauders and taken to an             
    underground city. There the two are forced to turn an enormous wheel     
    along with other captives as part of a gold-and-diamonds mining          
    operation. The underground city's queen, Halis Mosab, takes note of      
    the handsome, muscular Maciste and chooses him to be her consort if      
    he can meet such challenges as saving the kidnapped Princess Saliura     
    from a gigantic ape. Maciste kills the ape and carries Saliura back      
    to the aboveground world. The white-clad marauders can't follow them     
    if it means being caught in the sunlight which instantly dissolves       
    them. Maciste then returns to the underground city to save the other     
    captives. Meanwhile, high priest Kahab informs his son, Katar, that      
    their queen is not one of them but, unbeknownst to her, was kidnapped    
    as a small child from the "world above." If Katar can marry her,         
    their children can be "normal" and can live in the world of sunlight.    
    Katar sees Maciste as his enemy and is pleased when the re-captured      
    Maciste is now subjected to a test of strength which will not only       
    kill him but also Bango and another captive named Loth who is in love    
    with the Princess Saliura.
