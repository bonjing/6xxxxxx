,cindy25,2012-01-18T12:13Z,thanks for letting us know; just found the real 308 pre-air on another site
s the CTV broadcast of s2e12. It is already out on DVD. We’re WAAAAAY behind on this show right now in Canada. ASAP, thanks for trying but reading the ep summary can sometimes be a huge clue. CTV might mix it up since they have a dozen or so eps to catch up so don’t automatically write it off every week. Eventually CTV will get to s3 and then the HDTV rips can come.
