Experiencing the World's Religions provides a clear and compelling account of the world's major religious traditions. With an engaging narrative and powerful photographs from around the globe, the text conveys the vitality and richness of the world's religions. It views religion as a living cultural wellspring that not only concerns systems of belief but how those beliefs are expressed in ceremonies, food, clothing, art, architecture, pilgrimage, scripture, and music. The text goes beyond traditional approaches to personally connect students with the traditions discussed. With additional pedagogy, primary source excerpts, expanded discussion of religious controversies, and more, this fifth edition has been thoroughly updated in both content and design to provide students with a better understanding of religion and the world at large.
