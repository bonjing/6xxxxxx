This is my favourite playlist. 
Ranging from 80s to dubstep, best works of their genres.
I actually uploaded this torrent for my buddy but I wanted to share so that the seed count could increase and people who has the same taste as me could have a 233-song playlist in their hands.

Enjoy, and seed.
