ere has this marxist utopia where races, sexes and anything else NATURAL is supposed to be ""neutral"" ever succeeded? Nowhere.

So far it has only given us war, conflicts and genocide.

When we start to appreciate that we are all different, and that nature made us this way for a reason, then we can look forward to a peaceful future. For us all. "
