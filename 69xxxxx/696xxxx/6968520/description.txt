(National Film Board of Canada production)

This provocative documentary examines racial, flexible-sexual orientation,
cultural, and ethnic concepts of integration in Canada where they have 
obviously opted for an assimilation of all into an end product that involves
an elimination of all mental precepts on race and sexual being
that may be present now that could possibly resist or stand in the way of
this idea of "remade human" nirvana.

Some brief nudity and occasional foul language

Note: We have given up our industrial strength Bell fibe service modem
(7mb upload speed) for now as we are looking to relocate in a few weeks -
for now we are on auxiliary power in that we are using our secondary cable 
modem that has limited speed service(1mb)although we get unlimited upload
use at a cheap monthly rate incl unlimited 24mb downloads. Please help with
seeds - merci (in-between launches we keep the modem on to service
some torrents that need even just a bit of seed to make self supporting
we expect.


PS Fiber optic speed internet users in America for instance pay much better
rates for high upload speeds than we do in Canada at the present - could use
some competition up here fer sure!
