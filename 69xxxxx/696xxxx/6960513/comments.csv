I am so glad for your answer!

It is incredible that we have literally millions of books on PB covering every imaginable aspect of knowledge (or non knowledge!) and yet we don't have the full collection of books of a person that his writings burnt by a western regime! 

It is as if a conspiracy of silence has been involved and we need to break this silence!
The task is not only on you (that after all you have already  contributed the most knowledge in PB) but also on all serious uploaders( like moman73, mantesh, bookzilla, maelstrom etc) and the task is also upon me that I have not irresponsibly contributed nothing yet...

The works of Wilhelm Reich have arbitrary assigned to a private profit-monger body that is interested in its own profits and not in spreading the knowledge of  such an important person that died in a american prison 55 years ago.
I don't know if you know this, but Wilhelm Reich has written a lot others non known books that dictated to be freely published 50 years after his death. (That means 2007)
And yet this private body have refused to publish these works under very dubious excuses.

But this is another story.
We still don't have his books that have published while he was alive...

Anyway, I follow all your downloads and seed them a lot. (yes even the book about the goat medicine!I seeded 300%!)
I read them all  using some speed read techniques and hence I owe you so much! (yes in PB you can use this expression without involving the matter of money at all!)
It is like you have provided me 2000 different university courses for free!
I hope that someday when the copyleft will be the world rule and we will have won the battle for ever to meet you in real life.
Thanks my friend no matter if you can achieve to upload the whole Wilhelm Reich work!
(but if you manage to do this also, you will be in the  status of God for me!)

PS and staying on subject about this particular upload one last thing to say;
 there is even a very rare book that covers the secret correspondence between Reich and Einstein.Really amazing book!"
