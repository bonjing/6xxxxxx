I'm on Google Chrome and when I clicked ""GET THIS TORRENT"" there was a pop-up to either ""launch application or do nothing"".....i was confused and have selected ""Do nothing"" by mistake and it remembered that setting....

I don't know how to change that setting again...I have already deleted all cookies and cache in Chrome...I'm unable to download any torrents from Pirate Bay now.....PLEASE HELP"
