"Step off the edge of the planet with me..,"

Sa-roc hails from the southeastern area of Washington DC, a city thatâ€™s a mashup of poverty stricken hoods, a strong radical movement, and a fierce loyalty to cultural preservation.

Her lyrics and sound convey her unique approach to the rap game. She dares to be different, speaking truth, not bs rhetoric. Her style is intergalactic, flow is other-worldy. She has traveled extensively, collecting these experiences as inspiration for her music. From subject matter ranging from melanin to pyramids, Saroc spits metaphysical ideas over melodic hip hop beats, seeking to fuse knowledge of self with great music. She is undoubtedly and unapologetically a REAL MC.
