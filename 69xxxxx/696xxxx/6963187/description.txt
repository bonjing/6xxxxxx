NOTE: Not quite as cool as World Radio, but worth a try....the sound quality is superior - but fewer stations

Description
We made this app for those tired of listening to the same tunes. There are thousands of stations out there that provide good music without ads. Designed from scratch as a Mac app, Radioline has the elegance and simplicity you expect: it just works and never gets in your way.

Features:

* Tons of radio stations from over 100 countries. New stations are added
  every day by our team.

* A short selection of stations you already know, immediately available.

* A place to store the stations you like.

* Logo and album art for your enjoyment.

* Keep an eye on what is playing on the other stations in real-time:

  Radioline lets you know if something you like is playing on a different
  station.

* Background friendly: Growl notifications and keyboard shortcuts make
  it easy to switch stations without breaking your focus.

What's New:

* Minor bugfixes.

* Last.fm scrobbling is back (check the preferences).

System Requirements:

Intel Mac, OS X.6 or greater
