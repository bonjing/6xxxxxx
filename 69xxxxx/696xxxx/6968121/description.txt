Back in the 80 producer Jaap Egermont made stars on 45.
This was original a mix of a bootleg called lets do it in the 80\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s
This bootleg had a lot of beatles tracks in it,but wasnt mixed that good.
Then stars on 45 came out and became a world wide hit.
The only thing wrong with the stars on 45 was it didnt have the original beatles
tracks in it.
But this one does,perfectly mixed (better than the original)
bitrate 320kb/s
Enjoy this little masterpiece.
