  [i]Ash Ketchum is now 10 years old and is able to start on a new journey as a PokÃ©mon trainer. The night before Ash had to go meet Prof. Oak he had a dream and broke his alarm. That Day he overslept which caused him to miss his chance on getting one of the three Kanto starter PokÃ©mon: Charmander, Bulbasaur or Squirtle on his first day. However, Professor Oak had one last PokÃ©mon at his lab, a Pikachu. At first Pikachu did not get along with Ash, but over the course of the season Ash gained Pikachu's trust and they became best friends, developing a special bond. On the way Ash meets Misty, the Cerulean City Gym Leader who loves water PokÃ©mon and wants to join him until he pay's her for her bike which was accidentally destroyed by Pikachu, and Brock, the Pewter City Gym Leader who wants to join Ash on his journey so he can become the greatest PokÃ©mon breeder. Ash catches and makes friends with many PokÃ©mon which sets him up for a great adventure. However, through his journey he has to deal with the Team Rocket trio of Jessie, James, and Meowth, and his childhood rival, Gary Oak, Prof. Oak's grandson who also is a PokÃ©mon Trainer that always seems two steps ahead of Ash. After obtaining all 8 Kanto Gym Badges needed to compete in the PokÃ©mon League at Indigo Plateau, Ash reaches the top 16, losing out to a close friend, Ritchie.[/i]
