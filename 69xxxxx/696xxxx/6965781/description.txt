A great performance and set list to open the tour!  Brother Gregory came out of the gate singing as only he can; Warren added his strong vocal talents to the opening set and the band closed out before intermission with no vocals at all - doing a tasty instrumental, Jessica, that was hot!

After the appetizer, the second set consisted of the masterpiece, Live At Fillmore East - an album that stands the test of time and always is appreciated by the fans and the band  (hint - they enjoy playing it as much as we enjoy listening to it)!  Does it get any better than Stormy Monday or Liz Reed or Whipping Post or ...?
