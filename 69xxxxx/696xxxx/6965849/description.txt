Comments: Footage shot by the road crew towards the end of KISS' 1988 tour of the US. Mostly behind-the-scenes footage and off-the-cuff comments from the crew (don't ever work on a KISS tour seems to be a common comment). Shows how much work is actually done on a  show but also shows that the crew has some time to relax and that part of the time it's just mind-numbingly boring. Also contains live footage shot from the mixing board using a tripod, some footage of Anthrax shot from the side of the stage, comments on Gene's arrest, and a wedding. Grainy and blurry, probably a 3rd generation VHS transfer.
