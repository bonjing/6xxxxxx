Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Thursday, January 19 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks about the breaking news that officials are declaring Rick Santorum the winner in Iowa while admitting a final tally may never be known -- including Ron Paul's actual standing in the crucial caucus -- due to missing votes in eight precincts and other voting irregularities. 

Alex also covers the latest news on the SOPA and PIPA protests that have taken a largely clueless Congress by surprise. 

Alex also covers Senator Rand Paul's pledge to fight against the twin internet censorship bills the government is attempting to foist on the American people. 

Alex talks with software freedom activist and computer programmer Richard Stallman, founder of the GNU Project to create a free computer operating system, about SOPA, PIPA and copyright issues.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
