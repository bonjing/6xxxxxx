But when the artist dismisses her without payment, Luciana impulsively steals an unfinished version of the paintingâ€”only to find that somone is ready to kill her to get it back. What could possibly be so valuable about the picture? As friends and clients are slaughtered around her, Luciana turns to the one man who has never desired her beauty, novice librarian Brother Guido.
