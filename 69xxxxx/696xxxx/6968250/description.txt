Note from tNe: I can no longer provide anything from SyFy networks promptly as the network itself has changed scheduling; I am now 3 hours behind everyone else and these slower preset encodings take up to 4 hours to complete. Posting the following morning of a SyFy broadcast is the best I can do. This is ONLY SyFy broadcasts; all other networks are still on the same earlier schedule here.
