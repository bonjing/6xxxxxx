IN CONGRESS, 11 January 2012
The unanimous Declaration of the one united Dominion of a Canadian

When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one person to fill 
the gaps which have divided episodes of a series and to assume among the powers 
of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of 
Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires 
that they should declare the causes which impel them to the action.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all releases are not created 
equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain characteristics, that
among these are Source, Bit rate, and the lack of Haste. â€” That to secure these 
characteristics, councils are instituted among groups, deriving their just 
powers from the consent of the groups, â€” That whenever any Form of Council or 
group becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter 
or to abolish it, and to institute new order, laying its foundation on such 
principles and organising its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most 
likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that
groups long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; 
and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to 
suffer, while poor qualities are sufferable than to right themselves by 
abolishing the groups to which they are accustomed.

It would be brilliant if everyone stopped taking the best of Canadian shows and
claiming they are American simply because an American broadcaster has acquired
rights to broadcast the show in America. We don't claim Grey's Anatomy is a
Canadian show simply because it is on CTV. Most every current show with a ".US"
is actually Canadian. Montreal and Burnaby are not in the USA. The production 
companies / copyright holders Muse Entertainment and The Beedie Group are ".CA". 

It would be nice if other groups didn't avoid Canadian shows. You get various US
shows from Canadian feeds so why shy away from the Canadian shows on those same
channels you clearly have access to. There is a 2 Hard Done-by monopoly at this 
time because no other group won't avoid Canadian shows other than Flashpoint. 
The holder of the monopoly has been the most publicly vocal group about the
inherently unacceptable nature of ".CA" shows out there. Frustrating irony.  

The coverage of the most recent New Year's Eve programmes was comprehensive but
the quality was total shit. They were concerts with the bit rate overly generous
to the video at the expense of decent sound for a concert and even that was 
blocky like nothing i have ever seen from a scene group. Low bit rate analogue
capture up-converted and mis-labelled? Kinda looks like it. But with noone to
say boo or the threat of a nuke they get away with releasing mis-labelled stuff. 

The scene-wide habit of splitting shows into CD-size slices is fucking annoying. 
That it is actually somewhat contrary to the your rules to ensure files are
re-joinable is idiotic. Noone burns things to CDs any more. Not splitting the
files in the first place would be the sane thing to do. It was so with the 
Canadian Country Music Awards a few months ago. Make that the standard. 
Re-release as much as you all can in un-split versions, ignoring all dupe
concerns. By the end-user's perspective split-file episodes are what need to be
nuked. -- Or do it with 720p files too and fuck with everyone equally so we all 
hate all of you for everything you are all so proud of.  

  British group WATERS actually made a point of this 3 years ago with an episode 
  of Jonathan Creek. The nuke reason is quite illogical in the latter half: 
     invalid.proper.reason_avis.join.fine.in.other.apps.eg.avimux_vdub.is.known.
     for.problems.joining.avis.with.vbr.audio_no.rule.to.state.that.split.avis.
     even.need.to.be.joinable.let.alone.in.virtualdub.specifically

   no.rule.to.state.that.split.avis.even.need.to.be.joinable
   
   Again it is said, why the fuck split them in the first place when 1400MB fits
   fine on a DVDR or your favourite hard drive. 
   
Far too many examples exist to demonstrate that speed is now priority over
quality. The thrill of being first at all costs may be fun but for the person
downloading a flawed file there is no joy when they learn what they have. As 
Soon As a Person gets such a file they look for somewhere to complain. 

If you can't guess, since this show on the ".US" Declaration Of Independence 
fell to a lone ".CA" to release some fun was had with the nfo and greivances 
openly declared. If you ".US" folk had not been so careless to all collectively 
skip it in the first place you wouldn't need a ".CA" to cover your ass and fill 
a gap in this show. Next week is Mount Rushmore. Wonder what will be had there. 
Not a fan of Patton so that episode might be intentionally skipped.

This episode comes from History Television, the original and domestic home of 
Trashopolis and the mini-series The Kennedys. It is not the same as History. 

History Television was the commissioner and proud broadcaster of The Kennedys.
History was the late comer who demanded control and then said it was shit once 
it was made to their demands. Though the mini-series was good enough for History 
to show on their UK channel of the same name it was sloughed off to ReelzChannel
in the US who demanded world premiere or they too would pass. The mini-series 
was to be on in March in Canada but ReelzChannel said they could do no earlier
than the first week of April. So the premiere in Canada was cancelled. And you 
wonder why a fan of Canadian tv is fed up with things being dictated by foreign 
(ie American) parties. O how i find such sweet irony in releasing this episode.  

                                 Proudly Canadian
