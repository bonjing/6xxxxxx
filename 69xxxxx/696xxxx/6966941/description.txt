It is hard to define original sound, especially when it springs from the roots of a musical style which goes back hundreds of years, but Jody and Kate's music is truly unequaled in capturing the heart and soul of a number of styles including old-time, bluegrass, whimsy and instrumental virtuosity. They open the doors lead us into a completely different universe of classic traditional sounds.
