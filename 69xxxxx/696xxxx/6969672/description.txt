This is my 1st official SC-SDH release since TNA Impact HDTV 2009-05-28 XviD-AT-SDH that was uploaded by AhsokaTano and I have decided to return to capturing and encoding and uploading and I hope everyone appeciates my time and effort put into doing this each and every week. I don\'t have to do this. I am only doing it as a favor to the wrestling fans around the world who appreciated my efforts in the past here at SDH to bring wrestling to the fans from the fans. The last official SDH release was SDH release #715 on May 28, 2009 and if this show is a successful release here on TPB then I will upload WWE as well as TNA and maybe Star Wars The Clone Wars as well.
