Hold your breath as Paul Walker (The Fast And The Furious) and Jessica Alba (Sin City) star in this tense, underwater action adventure set in the dangerous, shark-infested waters of the Bahamas.




When four young free divers come upon a legendary shipwreck rumoured to contain millions in gold, they believe their dream of buried treasure has come true. But nearby on the ocean floor they unearth another, more sinister, mystery. The fortune-hunting friends make a pact to keep quiet about both discoveries so they can excavate the shipwreck before a rival treasure hunter discovers their secret and beats them to the gold.



But with much at stake, their loyalties are teasted. Facing hidden dangers at every turn, the hunters suddenly become the hunted.
