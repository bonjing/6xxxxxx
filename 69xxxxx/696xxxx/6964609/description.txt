In a future where people stop aging
at 25, but are engineered to live
only one more year, having the means
to buy your way out of the situation
is a shot at immortal youth. Here,
Will Salas finds himself accused of
murder and on the run with a hostage
- a connection that becomes an important
part of the way against the system.
