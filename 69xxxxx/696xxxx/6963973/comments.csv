ady out on DVD. We’re WAAAAAY behind on this show right now in Canada. ASAP, thanks for trying but reading the ep summary can sometimes be a huge clue. CTV might mix it up since they have a dozen or so eps to catch up so don’t automatically write it off every week. Eventually CTV will get to s3 and then the HDTV rips can come.
