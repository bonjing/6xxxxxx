READ BEFORE DOWNLOADING
========================

If you already have any ~450 MB MKVs from season 2, follow these steps (for uTorrent):

1) Add the torrent, and UNCHECK "Start Torrent"  (Otherwise, add the torrent and immediately select "Stop" from the right-click menu)

2) Locate your MKVs and copy them into the folder newly created for this torrent (should be "My Little Pony_ Friendship is Magic Season 2 (1st Half)")

3) Rename the MKV files to their matching names in this torrent's file list

4) In uTorrent, right click on the stopped torrent and select "Force Re-Check"

5) If the MKVs match those in the torrent, their pieces of the Downloaded bar should turn green

6) Start the torrent

These steps will allow you to reseed the files you already have without redownloading.  (Other BT clients should have a similar procedure.)
