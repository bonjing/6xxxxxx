Authored by award-winning teacher and noted researcher Susan Nolen-Hoeksema, Abnormal Psychology blends cutting-edge research in psychopathology with compassion for people who suffer from psychological disorders. Capturing the excitement of major advances in biological and psychosocial research and treatment alternatives, Abnormal Psychology imparts a true enthusiasm for and appreciation of scientific investigation.

The authorâ€™s scientific and caring approach, combined with strong study tools, has won accolades from instructors and students alike. Abnormal Psychology includes Faces Interactive Case Studies, which link information about disorders covered in the text to Face Interactive Online, integrating the media resources to the written text. The fifth edition continues to place great emphasis on an integrated approach to abnormal psychology, on making biological information clear to students, and on providing a strong focus on empirical research and diversity.
