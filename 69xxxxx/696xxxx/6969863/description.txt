SOME TRIVIA FROM IMDB

In the scene where Coach Vice rubs his testicle on 67's face (Mark Anthony Lopez), those are Andy Dick's actual genitals. The shot was filmed several times, much to Lopez's displeasure. 

The film was shot in 20 days, and edited solely by Marshall Cook over the course of a year on his laptop using Final Cut Pro. 

The line that Coach Vice says to Mitch - "Hey... I didn't say it was a bad pass" - was improvised and not in the script. It was inspired by an incident involving a prank Andy Dick pulled in college, where the dean called him into his office, telling him he had 2 strikes left before he was kicked out. As Andy began walking out, the dean said to him "Hey... I didn't say it wasn't funny."

PLOT:This ensemble comedy follows the Pullham University Bluecocks, a small liberal arts college with a Division III football program (the lowest division in the NCAA). When the head coach unexpectedly dies, the future of the flailing football program is in jeopardy, as they have not had a winning season in decades. In a desperate attempt to create some media attention for the athletic program and the university, President Georgia Anne Whistler hires known lunatic and felon, Coach Rick Vice, for what could be the football programs final season. Vice, an overly aggressive redneck racist, quickly becomes the team's and athletic director's worst nightmare. Vice especially butts heads with Mitch DePrima, a reluctant quarterback who was drawn to the college thinking he would play ball as a big fish in a small pond, only to find himself riding the bench in his final year. Navigating between an insane coach...
