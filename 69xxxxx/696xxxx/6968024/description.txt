  Shankar Narayana is an honest politician      
  who meets with a near-fatal accident.         
  Some years later, Shankar's son Ajay has      
  grown up to become a police officer.          
  Ajay's mission to bring down the trade of     
  drugs and weapons, takes him to Istanbul.     
  It's while there that he first meets          
  fashion student Prashanthi. Ajay is           
  smitten with her. Back in India, Shankar      
  finally awakes from a long coma. Ajay         
  creates an elaborate home-life charade        
  to shield his still-fragile father from       
  any stress or shock. While out on the         
  streets, it is time to hunt down Don Nayak    
  and his criminal associates who tried to      
  kill his father all those years ago.
