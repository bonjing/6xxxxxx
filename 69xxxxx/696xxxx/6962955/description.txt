Minecraft installer 4.0.0 for minecraft 1.1.0
READ THIS !!!BEFORE!!! (Especially the troubleshooting section) You E-Mail me for help
I will be using the same name on all my torrents now to avoid confusion with the names (Sorry)

This Minecraft installer was compiled by kaise123 (Kai) It includes some cracked Minecraft servers in the server list.

This installer has 3 options for Basic minecraft without mods, minecraft with mods, and minecraft with a mod for improving performance (For slow computers) It is easy to choose which version you want in the installer. All versions have an in-built list of cracked minecraft servers.

I take no credit for the loader, which was created by AngelDE98, AnjoCaido, Mojang (The base), Kartracer97, Smoolak, JBExtrem, Zebz213 and others.
I merely added all the mods and the 'cracked' loader and made a convenient easy-to-use installer that gives you options =)
The mods are owned by their respective creators and I take no credit for their creation. To see the page the mods came from just Google the mod's name.

This is an easy-to-use, user-friendly way of putting minecraft on your computer.

Known Bugs:
Not sure yet xD
Please report ANY non-normal minecraft errors or bugs to me!

############## TROUBLESHOOTING ###############

If you find that mods don't work, RE-install using the installer and try again. If it still does not work RE-install again and try without an internet connection and see if that works

Minecraft lags??? Try the optifine version. Even though the game may look like it has crap graphics it still needs a half-decent PC to run on.

Java Error? (EG: A Java Run Time Environment was not found on your computer) Install the latest java. 64 Bit computers often need both the 64 AND the 32 bit version.

Can't spawn items in multiplayer? If you are sure that you have permission to spawn items on the server, You may need to change some configuration in your minecraft installation directory.
