DVD - rip from the Japanese LD (CBS Sony Records) - made â€‹â€‹borsland respected.
Found in one of the Russian trackers.
In this version, unfortunately missing the song "Money",
But in this embodiment, an uncompressed audio track.
IMHO. Also, the video quality is the best of all versions of DVD.
I know four.
There is a song "Money" at the end of the concert after the credits.
She comes from a different version.
IMHO.Quality number 2
Will be compared with anything ...
