Description
Plot: Every day, across all corners of the globe, millions of users log onto Second Life, a virtual online world not entirely unlike our own. They enter a new reality, whose inhabitants assume alternate personas in the form of avatars â€“ digital alter egos that can be sculpted and manipulated to the heartâ€™s desire, representing reality, fantasy, or a healthy mix of both. Within this alternate landscape, escapism abounds, relationships are formed, and a real-world economy thrives effectively blurring the lines between reality and â€œvirtualâ€ reality. First time feature director Jason Spingarn-Koff digs deeply into the core of basic human interaction in the documentary film â€œLIFE 2.0â€³ by assuming his own avatar and immersing himself in the worlds of Second Life residents â€“ whose real lives have been drastically transformed by the new lives they lead in cyberspace.
