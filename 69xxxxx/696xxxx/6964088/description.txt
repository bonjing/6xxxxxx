Shaped by Richard Barsam\'s more than twenty years of classroom experience, Looking at Movies uses students\' natural enthusiasm for the subject as a foundation for going beyond enjoyment toward intelligent, analytical understanding of movies. Professor Barsam\'s clear writing, thorough presentation of fundamental film principles, and unique pedagogical additions to the traditional introductory textâ€”including an entire chapter devoted to analytical writingâ€”ensure that students approach screenings and writing assignments equipped with the analytical tools necessary to be active, insightful interpreters of movies.
