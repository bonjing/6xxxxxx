SOME TRIVIA FROM IMDB

The film is partly autobiographical: many of the events that happened to Hal and Oliver are based on Mike Mills' experiences when his own father came out as gay and began a homosexual relationship after Mike's mother died. 

Early in the movie, Oliver comments that his dog, Arthur (and other dogs in the same breed, Jack Russell terrier) now by chance are very cute to humans, and that people love them so much that they often put them in TV shows and movies. The most famous "acting" Jack Russells of recent years (Moose, who played "Eddie" in the TV show Frasier and Moose's son, Enzo, who was the title character in My Dog Skip) were both owned and trained by the same professional animal trainer, Mathilde de Cagny, who owns and trains Cosmo, the dog playing Arthur. 

Both Ewan McGregor and Christopher Plummer have played Iago in stage productions of 'William Shakespeare''s 'Othello'.

PLOT:It's 2003. Thirty-eight year old graphic artist Oliver Fields has just lost his father Hal Fields to cancer, after Oliver's mother Georgia Fields passed away five years earlier. Oliver is naturally a sullen man due to his growing up relationship with his parents (his mother who had a unique view on life) and watching his parents' cordial but somewhat distant relationship with each other, but is more so now because of his personal family loss. Oliver embarks on a relationship with Anna, a French actress. Oliver is hoping that his re-energized relationship with Hal following Georgia's death and Hal's new outlook on life during that time will show Oliver how to act in a loving relationship. After Georgia's death, Hal came out of the closet and began to live with a joie de vivre that did not exist before, which included an open relationship with a much younger man named Andy...
