Please read the troubleshooting section bellow as it may help with common problems.

Common issues and troubleshooting:

* Cannot take the next picture \ Sensor inaccurately follows movement

This is a compass calibration problem, go to Photaf picture taking mode and before taking the first picture, wave your phone in a figure 8 pattern to reset the magnetometer in your device.

* Cannot create file, make sure to use a valid file name

Usually, this is a file creation error, due to SD card either not available, full or corrupted.
This error can also popup when the specified name already exists.

Try the following:

- Use a different unique name

- Make sure the SD card is not mounted to your PC via USB

- Make sure you have enough space on your SD card

- Move some unused files from your SD to your computer, sometimes too many files on the SD can cause problems too

- Reboot your device

* Colors on the Motorola defy are wrong

Use the defy hack option, under settings. Then, restitch your panorama.
