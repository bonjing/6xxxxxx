The Mumbai Chuzzlewits

From BBC Radio 4. Written by Ayeesha Menon; Full-cast dramatisation.

A reworking of Charles Dickens Martin Chuzzlewit, set amongst the Catholic community in modern-day Mumbai, India.

Convinced his relatives are after his money, miserly old recluse Martin Chuzzlewit adopts orphan girl, Mary to be his carer. As she will inherit nothing upon his death, he believes she will do her utmost to keep him in good health. But when his grandson Mickey falls in love with her, Martin's plans are thrown into disarray. Disinheriting him, Martin triggers a complex web of deceit, betrayal and manipulation as the extended family and hangers-on close in, in pursuit of his fortune.
