                           DESCRiPTiON 
                          
 Jim Swire travels to Libya to investigate the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, in which 
 his daughter Flora was one of 270 people killed after a bomb exploded aboard Pan 
 Am Flight 103. He tries to find out whether Colonel Gaddafi was behind the 
 atrocity and meets Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, the only man convicted of the attack, 
 and talks to the country's new administration in his search for answers.
                                        
                                 Enjoy!
