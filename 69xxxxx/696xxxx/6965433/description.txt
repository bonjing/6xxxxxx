A multinational array of top grandmasters explain the difference in thinking between professional and amateur chess players, and how the amateur can bridge the gap. It usually takes at least a decade of sustained effort for even the most talented player to reach the grandmaster level - this book cannot guarantee to make the reader a chess grandmaster, but it is certainly a healthy nudge in the right direction. The editors, ex-British Champion GM Jacob Aagaard and three-time Scottish Champion GM John Shaw, have recruited a line-up of strong grandmasters to share their wisdom.
