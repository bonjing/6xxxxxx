The One... sees some of Britain's best entertainers return to the screen to show off what they do best.

 In the 2010 Christmas special Ronnie Corbett returned to BBC One to celebrate his 80th birthday. The octogenarian comic legend appeared alongside some of the biggest names in British comedy, in sketches featuring everything from a superannuated super-hero to a stage-struck dog.

 Three brand new episodes were then recorded for broadcast in early 2012, with Jasper Carrott, Lenny Henry and Griff Rhys Jones the comedians getting their own showcase this time.

Our Review: 

The One Ronnie was perfect family entertainment - some of the sketches and autocue gags were quite old-skool, but there's were couple of really great sketch gems performed in the show (the Blackberry sketch went viral on the internet), and the cast was really top drawer indeed: A-list greatness.
