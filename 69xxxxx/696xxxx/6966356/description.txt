Yula and the Extended Family (Y&XFM) is an ever-growing, ever-morphing poetic tribe. 
Music is often hard to categorize, especially when one is aiming for a new kind of sound. Inspired by everything from hardcore punk to Mediterranean rock to Klezmer to Caribbean brass, The eXtended Family plays music which is punk in spirit and joyous in melody, a new kind of blend we call ro-punk...
 
Yula Beeri (singer/songwriter/piano/guitar/bass) ex World Inferno, Star Fucking Hipsters and NaNuchKa fronts this unique Ro-Punk outfit with members of Gato Loco, The Torcher Chamber Ensemble, This Way to the Egress.  They come together as THE Extended Family.  Since their first show at Le Poisson Rouge in February 2009, Yula and the eXtended Family have toured extensively along the East coast and the SouthWest, and released two cds (Dark Side of The Bee, and Victor). Yula and the eXtended Family are constantly growing new music, and the next cd will be released in early 2011, with many more to come!
