IMMERSE's release is missing the title sequence. Also missing the Chuck
Lorre slate at the end. He's only had like a few hundred epsiodes of TV
with it, you'd think people would remember that shit by now.


Everything might change when Leonard offers Penny a spur of the moment 
invitation to a romantic dinner for two.
