This is the HiDef NASA-HD video footage of the launch of the last mission of the Space Shuttle.

Space Shuttle Atlantis launched on July 8, 2011 as mission STS-135. This video starts about 15 seconds before the launch and continues for nearly 5 minutes after the launch. It ends just before the separation of the large fuel tank. The video and audio are maintained at a very high quality.

The video is encoded in H.264 AVC at 8000Kbps and 1080p. The audio is 5.1 channel AC-3 16bit at 48Khz. The video and audio are joined in a .mt2s container in order to retain the 6-channel audio. A regular .mp4 would limit the audio to 2 channels.
