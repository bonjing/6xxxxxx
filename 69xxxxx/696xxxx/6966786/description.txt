A re-upload of the same game, only this time it's compressed and in many parts, ideal for torrents. Hopefully this one seeds better.

Name: Negima!? Neo Pactio Fight!!
Region: NTSC-J (Japan)
Genre: Party/Fighting

Based off of the alternative version of Negima, Negima Neo. It follows a different storyline than the original and features some new characters alongside the ones already known.

The gameplay has both party and fighting elements in it. Up to four players compete on one of a good number of stages, where players try to complete different tasks before everyone else; for instance, one of the events involves breaking as many statues as you can in order to score points.
Players also have two attacks which they can use to hinder opponents and complete the different tasks. It is possible to reduce another character's HP to zero, at which point they are removed from the game.

At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins.

Enjoy!
