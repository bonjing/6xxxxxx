Syncing with iOS

Mental Case 2 can sync in the same way as Mental Case 1.9 over Wi-Fi with Mental Case apps on iOS. The way you begin a sync differs slightly: To sync Mental Case 2, tap 'Start Sync' in the iOS app. Your iOS device should appear in the Mac app in the source list on the left. Select it there, and follow the instructions.

WARNING: At this time, the iOS edition of Mental Case does not support all features of Mental Case for Mac. There is no support for formatted text, no multiple-choice quizzes, and it can only handle a maximum of two facets (sides) per note. An update is planned to address these shortcomings. In the meantime, it may not be suitable for studying all types of notes.
