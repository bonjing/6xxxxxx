Groovejaar is a Grooveshark download app.
Simple.

Search for mp3 files and play or download without hassle.

At the time of upload this version is fully working AND bypasses the current boycott in Germany.

Enjoy.

For Windows users just click on GrooveJaar.jar or on start.bat (an annoying command prompt will popup) , for other systems start.sh or java -jar GrooveJaar.jar from console (after changing the current path in the GrooveJaar's path, obvisouly)
