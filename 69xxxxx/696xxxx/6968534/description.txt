The deadliest weapon on the battlefield is neither the bullet nor the gunâ€”itâ€™s the lone sniper.


Through the scopes of the worldâ€™s most precise marksmen, SNIPER: INSIDE THE CROSSHAIRS takes you on a journey to discover the science and psychology behind the most extreme shots in military history. Deconstruct well-known missions, from Vietnam to Iraq to Afghanistan, by hearing firsthand recollections from the soldiers who were there and whose fingers pulled the triggers. Finally, meet Canadian sniper Rob Furlong, who, for the first time on American television, tells the story of his history-making shot in Afghanistanâ€”striking a Taliban fighter from 1.5 miles away.


Ballistics, tactics, weaponry, stalkingâ€“this feature-length special examines these critical components in vivid detail, and uses compelling interviews, cinematic reenactments, CGI technology, and modern-day shooting demonstrations to put you squarely inside the crosshairs.
