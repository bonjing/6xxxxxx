The "Handbook of Quantitative Criminology" is designed to be the authoritative volume on methodological and statistical issues in the criminology/criminal justice field. Like handbooks available in other disciplines (economics, psychology, sociology), this book will be the go-to book for new and advanced methods in the field that will provide overviews of the issues, with examples and figures as warranted, for students, faculty, and researchers alike. Authored by leading scholars in criminology/criminal justice, the Handbook contains 24 chapters on topics in the following key areas: (1) research design, (2) experimental methods, (3) methods for overcoming data limitations, (4) innovative descriptive methods, (5) estimation techniques for theory and policy, (6) topics in multiple regression, and (7) new directions in statistical analysis.
