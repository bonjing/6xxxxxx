Words from a NOOB:  


Although I had put this video out her anonymously yesterday, I am putting it here as myself.  Also, It was my belief that yesterday's file was not working as it would not download from here.  Since yesterday, things have changed and I was able to upload my own file from the anonymous post I made.  Low and behold it worked.
  

Should anyone have information to help me along in creating files to share, please feel free to share you thoughts.  


Thank you for your patience and enjoy the show.  Seeding would be appreciated.  Thank you gain.
