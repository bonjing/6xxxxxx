Music for adults...Songs with real melodies...instruments in tune...vocals and harmonies in pitch...nice music.... Now if all that turns you off, that's too bad, for Boo Hewerdine's new album is all of the above. He's an entertainer, and entertain he does, time after time after time. This is the type of album you can put on and feel a smile come over your face while listening. It's that good! It's a return to good old-fashioned singing and songwriting, with every song here having something to recommend it. And that's what Baptist Hospital by Boo Hewerdine is...highly recommended!
