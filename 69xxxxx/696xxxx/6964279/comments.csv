If you're attempting to watch this, you're either one of those people who will give any new film a go, and might not be that into it, or you're a fan of Steve Martin's. If you love him and know how his films are, then you'll be very pleased. You won't be bored. It's super sweet and a little quirky/nerdy with the birdwatching so enjoy.

No point wasting time in life genuinely being surprised that every film doesn't play out like transformers or terminator."
