- SOPA: Anti-Piracy or Censorship? Wikipedia's Jimmy Sales vs. Copyright Alliance's Sandra Aistars

Congressional support for a pair of anti-piracy bills is weakening after Wednesday's historic online protest in which thousands of websites went dark for 24 hours. Hollywood film studios, music publishers and major broadcasters support the anti-piracy legislation, saying it aims to stop the piracy of copyrighted material over the internet on websites based outside the United States. "We're talking about sites that are operated and dedicated to piracy and that are really preventing individual creators across the country from having an economic livelihood from their creative pursuits," says Sandra Aistars, Executive Director of the Copyright Alliance, whose members include the Motion Picture Association of America, NBC Universal, Time Warner, Viacom, ASCAP and BMI. But critics say the bills could profoundly change the internet by stifling innovation and investment, hallmarks of the free, open internet. "Wikipedia can be defined as a search engine under these [bills]," says Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Sales. "That would mean it would be illegal for Wikipedia to link to a site, even if we are explaining to the public what is going on here. That would become illegal. This is outrageous. It's not acceptable under the First Amendment."


- Obama Rejects Keystone XL Pipeline Under GOP Deadline, But Opponents Prepare for Long-Term Fight

The Obama administration has rejected the Keystone XL tar sands oil pipeline that would stretch from the Alberta tar sands to the Gulf Coast. On Wednesday, President Obama said he was turning down TransCanada's application for the pipeline because there was not enough time to review an alternate route that would avoid the Ogallala Aquifer in Nebraska. Obama had tried to delay a decision until next year, but Republicans responded by passing legislation forcing a decision by the end of February. Environmental groups have hailed the permit's rejection but it does not mark the end of the pipeline fight. TransCanada has already announced it will re-apply for a permit based on a different route, and Obama said he was only making his decision based on time constraints, not on the pipeline's "merits." We get reaction from Jane Kleeb of Bold Nebraska and 350.org founder Bill McKibben, an expert on climate change who has led massive protests in Washington, D.C. against the pipeline over the past six months. "This was a real victory for people standing up," McKibben says. "If we hadn't gone and done what we did in the streets ... then the oil industry, as usual, would have gotten away with a really bad idea."


- Historic Effort to Recall Wisconsin Gov. Walker Reveals "People Power" After 1 Million Sign Petition

Opponents of Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker have submitted more than a million signatures seeking his recall in a statewide vote. The million-plus signatures amount to nearly double the required number of 540,000 and may mark the largest recall effort in U.S. history. Walker is being challenged for pushing through a controversial law ending collective bargaining rights for most public workers. "Most people do not realize that those one million signatures represent almost a half of the electorate in Wisconsin," says John Nichols of The Nation magazine. "[Walker] will be forced to face a new election because he adopted the austerity measure of the Republican leadership of Washington and try to balance budgets on the back of public employees, tried to destroy their unions, try to cut school funding, and succeeded in cutting funding, and we are going to have a referendum on the most fundamental of economic issues."


- Recount Leaves Santorum Ahead of Romney in Iowa GOP Caucus

Rick Santorum has been declared the winner of the Iowa caucus after a recount gave him a 34-vote lead over Mitt Romney. The outcome could slow the momentum of the front-runner Romney, who is hoping to wrap up the Republican nomination with a win on Saturday in South Carolina. "It's a big deal," says John Nichols, Washington correspondent for The Nation magazine. "[Santorum] spent a tiny amount of money per vote, as compared to Romney."
