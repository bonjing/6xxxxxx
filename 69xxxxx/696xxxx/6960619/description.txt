 Now this was a nice surprise. DVD-R was pretty nice, only real problem 
 was the washed out and sort of dull colours. So all we did really was  
 pump some life into it as well as adding a few other little video      
 tweaks. Came out really nice, perfectly in sync. This does have a      
 "For Your Consideration" watermark that pops up at various points along
 the bottom of the screen, this is usual for a SCR.
