Designed for the non-traditional Liberal Arts course, Mathematical Thinking and Quantitative Reasoning focuses on practical topics that students need to learn in order to be better quantitative thinkers and decision-makers. The author team's approach emphasizes collaborative learning and critical thinking while presenting problem solving in purposeful and meaningful contexts. While this text is more concise than the author team's Mathematical Excursions (Â© 2007), it contains many of the same features and learning techniques, such as the proven Aufmann Interactive Method. An extensive technology package provides instructors and students with a comprehensive set of support tools.
