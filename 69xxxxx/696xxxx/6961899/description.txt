The game differs from standard bike racing games by having the character riding downhill almost exclusively, due to the incline of the tracks. Attacking is also encouraged with two attack buttons, one for a left attack, and the other for the right. These attacks can be upgraded to more powerful attacks by performing tricks or collecting powerups. A bike shop with several unlockables for purchase is available but is only accessible in one player mode. Up to four players can play the game, but when playing with more than two, the available tracks and modes are limited.
