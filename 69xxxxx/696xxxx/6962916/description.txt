      Charley is a hustler. He's been on his own long enough to know how 
    to work  people and situations.  He finds that the father  who threw 
    him out as a teenager has died. He's left him an antique convertible 
    and something more important, a previously unknown brother, Raymond. 
    Raymond is autistic,  but has the ability  to calculate  complicated 
    mathematical problems in his head with great speed and accuracy.     
      Their father  left his fortune to Raymond,  who doesn't understand 
    the concept of money. Charley is enraged by what has happened and by 
    his father keeping Raymond's existence from him for his entire life. 
    He kidnaps Raymond from his care home  but when he tries to get back 
    to LA finds that Raymond will only fly Qantas.  The two begin a long 
    road trip that will lead them to an understanding of each other.

      Anyone querying the AR should know that i cropped 4 pixels from    
      the top and bottom and 12 pixels from the left and right of the    
      720x576 source, and that this cropping when resizing to 608x352    
      gives an AR error of -0.887%. Enjoy! :)

     After two years of limited distribution, we found it time for our   
     work to be available on a larger scale. Therefore we decided to     
     enable more sites to host our releases by including the             
     'INTERNAL' tag in our directory naming. Our releases aren't         
     internal though; we release them. The good news is we stay who we   
     are and keep being non-competitive.                                 
                                                                         
     Know anyone who likes our releases, and wants to help out? We're    
     currently looking for a WHQ based in EU. Feel free to contact us.
