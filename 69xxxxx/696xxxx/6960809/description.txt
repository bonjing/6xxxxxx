       it the food he purchased from a munchie run, he is put in jail    
     and is given a 1 million dollar bail. The rest of the group must    
      bail Kenny out before Nasty Nate gets to him. The group decides    
     to sell marijuana that Thurgood gets through his job as a janitor   
        at a pharmaceutical lab. They become pals with rap star Sir      
     Smoke-A-Lot and the rivals of dealer Samson Simpson. On the side,   
      Thurgood seeks the love of Mary Jane, an anti-pot daughter of a    
      dealer. What follows is typical pothead behaviour with a ton of    
                           cameos. Look carefully.

     After two years of limited distribution, we found it time for our   
     work to be available on a larger scale. Therefore we decided to     
     enable more sites to host our releases by including the             
     'INTERNAL' tag in our directory naming. Our releases aren't         
     internal though; we release them. The good news is we stay who we   
     are and keepbeing non-competitive.
