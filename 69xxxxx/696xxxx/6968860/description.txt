Thanks for the encouragement Debra, it is nice to feel wanted !!


I have given you a little bonus tonight, watch past the end of EE and see what you think.
I can give you that every night, might be of interest to all you ex-pats.



Does anyone out there live in Phoenix, Arizona ?

I may be going there for treatment, and I need somewhere to stay for a few days.
I am not a sad, fat, lonely drunk. I was only joking !!
