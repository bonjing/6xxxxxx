There is a scene missing, the scene in which Goering is rallying his troops, infuriated by Keitel's remarks about 'the Fuhrer being here with us' and Goering asking if he is the only thing that's left and if all the rest are willing to betray the Fatherland, etc etc.

Pity this version is not the FULL version ..."
