Unstable Tetris

Tetris meets Physics, Warning HIGHLY ADDICTIVE
Tetris meets physics in this addictive puzzle game. Stack the blocks to the target height, but make sure they do not fall. Great challenge and high scores are saved fo players to show off how good they are.

Great game, fun and realistic.
Only reason I am rating it four stars is that it is a bit slow at first, and that there is a block that has five squares. This doesn't follow tetris in that tetris means four. But it is still a good game and the block makes sense in some ways. Thanks for the work devs!
