Super Mario Bros X is a pretty particular game because it is a new version of the old Super Mario Bros. adapted to current times.

Like in any other release of this Nintendo classic, Mario should fight against a huge horde of enemies that wanted him out of the way. In order to defeat them, he should use its abilities and the things he has around him cleverly.

The difference between Super mario Bros X and the older ones, is that it has a â€œcooperativeâ€ mode. You will be able to play with a friend simultaneously on a divided screen, destroying all the monsters that you find on your way.

Super mario Bros X is not a Nintendo official released, but it keeps the spirit that made famous the original one. A download that definitely will keep you in front of your computer for hours.
