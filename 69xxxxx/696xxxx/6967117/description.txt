After a highly successful 2011 The Ragbirds are kicking off a new year with the release of their 4th studio effort, Travelinâ€™ Machine on January 1st, 2012. In this exciting mew album the band has seamlessly blended a wide palette of musical genres into a fresh and cohesive 10-track package that is full of life and energy.

Itâ€™s rare to stumble upon a band that brings as much joy and creative flare to their music as the Ragbirds. Led by the energetic front woman, Erin Zindle, the band tastefully unites multi-cultural rhythms with a roots rock flavor that is as captivating and flirty, as it is smart. 

The five-piece project is clearly built around the multi-talented Zindle, who is not only the singer and songwriter but is proficient in a range of stringed instruments. This classically trained violinist can aptly pluck the eight-stringed mandolin, wield a wild accordion and rock the banjo while maintaining lead vocals. Surrounding Zindle's earthy-sweet voice is the whirlwind of a guitarist T.J. Zindle, dynamic bassist Brian Crist, drummer Loren Kranz and standout percussionist Randall Moore. 

Chock-full of radio-friendly material, Travelinâ€™ Machine showcases the bandâ€™s skills with adventurous lyrics and a unique blend of styles. The album kicks off with the contagious opening track â€œSix Wheelsâ€ - an energetic song with Afro-Cuban rhythms and a frisky pop melody that manages to linger in your head all day long. The second track, â€œFollowing Youâ€ has obvious bluegrass influences with just a charming wink of country twang. 

Sweeping throughout the album is a breezy quality that makes you feel like celebrating. Tracks like â€œSilence is Everywhereâ€ and â€œMoribayassa (Iâ€™ll Fly Away)â€ highlight the percussive prowess of the group with layers of thick drums and sounds reminiscent of an African village. In â€œLearn to Shineâ€ Zindleâ€™s beautiful voice leads a soaring reprise you will want to hear while youâ€™re driving towards a mountain sunset, while the lively Cajun-Zydeco-inspired â€œThe Bullyâ€ seems straight out of the bayou. The bands diversity shines in the unique â€œAcrobatsâ€ â€“ a Circus-waltz with haunting accordion undertones, while â€œMercy of the Seaâ€ is a rock Sea-Chanty with a classic swagger. All and all the album takes the listener on a great musical journey that is as inspiring as the world landscape from which it is drawn. 

Beginning January 1st Travelinâ€™ Machine will hit on-line stores and boutique music shops around the country. A bright and diverse addition to any music collection, the album provides charming, danceable songs that can be enjoyed by listeners of all ages.
