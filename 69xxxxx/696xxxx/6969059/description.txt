Cheesy Nirvosa started recording mashed-potato style glitch psychadelia in 2006.
Maturing in sound for more than a year Cheesy Nirvosa finally started releasing 
albums in the summer of 2007.

Cheesy Nirvosa\'s homefried beats break from traditional cycles and regularity. 
The sound aims more for confusion than melody, often favoring some that sounds
particularly out of place than a tune which syncopates expectedly. Variation 
in Cheesy Nirvosa\'s hypnotic form varies from breakcore glitch to the truly
mellow sounds of tonal vibrations and binaural beats. This isn\'t noise music,
this isn\'t anything thats quite like anything. Which is exactly Cheesy Nirvosa\'s
goal with his music, to get you thinking, to break listeners out of the mold of
what they thought music had to be.

Beginning in the spring and summer of 2009 Cheesy Nirvosa has taken his music in
a more ambient direction. While still retaining much of the chaotic types of sound
he developed with previous albums, Cheesy Nirvosa\'s Audible Prolapse is a fresh,
new, sometimes more mellow brand of his style of hypnotica. This move was not only
chosen to reflect new tastes in music preffered by Cheesy Nirvosa but also an attempt
to please a broader listener base.

More than a year in the making this newest album \"Software Engineering\" clarifies his
lastest music style. While still heavily reliant of atonality and discord this album 
emphasises a distinct pulse throughout the background of each song allowing the listener
to carry through the experience with a certain flow going throughout the experience.

Made primarily from raw digital files heavily manipulated and many other techniques
including off-the-wall re-verb and echo this album is a harsh chaotic thrill ride
from start to finish while still retaining heavy ambient undertones. The last track
serves to ground the album with a bold pure ambient song that spans over an hour
and a half of playtime.
