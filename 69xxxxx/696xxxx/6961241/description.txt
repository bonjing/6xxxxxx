SOME TRIVIA FROM IMDB

Elephants make several appearances in the film. Rainn Wilson's character is watching a TV show about elephants and we hear them in the background, the car dealership has a large pink elephant on the roof and beside t.j's bed there is a figurine of another elephant. 

In the pool scene, Hesher asks R2 to shut down all the trash compactors. This refers to R2-D2 from Star Wars. Director Spencer Susser also directed a TV special short, _R2-D2: Beneath the Dome (1992)_. 

All of Hesher's "persona", according to Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is inspired by late bass player from Metallica, Cliff Burton.Not only that, but the movie features a significant amount of music from the "Burton" era, including the solo that Hesher plays in the garage (Anesthesia, from the Kill 'Em All album) and, of course, the Hesher lettering.
