MAHARISHI AT
THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL

During the week of May 6-13, 1974, Great Britain celebrated
World Plan Week. Lectures, conferences, and
symposia were held throughout the nation to demonstrate how
the World Plan to train teachers in Maharishi's Science of
Creative Intelligence would eliminate the age-old problems of
mankind in this generation.
The highlight of the week was a lecture by Maharishi
at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Maharishi examines
the scientific research on his Transcendental Meditation
technique which has confirmed the existence of a fourth major
state of consciousness, characterized by uniquely deep
rest, heightened alertness, and coherent brain functioning.
Maharishi also discusses the remarkably wide range of
practical benefits that come with experiencing this state
regularly through Transcendental Meditation.
