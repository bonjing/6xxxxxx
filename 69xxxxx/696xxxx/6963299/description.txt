Biology: Life on Earth [9th Edition] Chapters 1-4

I am currently taking a class that is requiring me to read this book. I could not find this book anywhere online for free, so I \"obtained\" it and I\'m scanning the chapters as I read them for class. There\'s about 30 chapters in all.

I figured since the book is 80 bucks USED, and over $100 new that it was not worth paying that much and that other individuals such as yourself could use the extra money to pay off your college debt or something.

Here\'s the first 4 chapters, more to come soon. I\'ve included the cover so you can reconfirm that this is indeed the book you are looking for.

Scans are 300dpi and in color. PDF format.

Only the chapters have been scanned, not any pre-text garbage or table of contents, etc.

Please seed.
