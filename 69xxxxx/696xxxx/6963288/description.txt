    The final chapter of Lucifer Valentine's Vomit Gore Trilogy winds to     
    a chuck-blowing close as two of Satan's most devoted slaves merge        
    into one infernal being. Shortly after Angela Aberdeen arrives in        
    Hell to fulfill her pact with Satan she is sent back to Earth on an      
    unholy mission to destroy yet another unfortunate victim. Now, a new     
    Angela (Hope Likens) will suffer the excruciating pains of the           
    Devil's Curse as her bulimia takes over, and she begins to merge with    
    her tormented predecessor.
