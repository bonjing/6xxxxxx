Using classic thermodynamic principles as the point of departure, this new edition of a popular resource supplies the understanding and tools required to measure process efficiency and sustainability with much improved accuracy. Exploring the driving forces in the chemical and power industries, Efficiency and Sustainability in the Energy and Chemical Industries: Scientific Principles and Case Studies, Second Edition investigates why losses occur and explains how to reduce such losses.

Numerous case studies, examples, and problems illustrate the thermodynamic analysis of process performance to explain how to effectively analyze and optimize work flows and environmental resources. The authors compare the present industrial society with an emerging one in which mass production and consumption are in harmony with the natural environment through closure of material cycles. In this second edition, the bookâ€™s structure of Basics, Thermodynamic Analysis of Processes, Case Studies, and Sustainability has been unaffected, but a few additions have been made.

New and updated information includes:

    * A new chapter dedicated to the increasing levels of CO2 emissions, with special attention to the removal and storage of CO2
    * A new chapter on the rapidly emerging hydrogen economy
    * An extended chapter on lifecycle analysis that examines the fate of the quality of energy during the lifecycle
    * Increased focus on integrating the environment into the thermodynamic analysis of the systems or processes considered
    * New problem sets and exercises

Complete with the keys to a quantification of process efficiency and sustainability, this cutting-edge resource is the ideal guide for those engaged in the transition from fossil-based fuels to renewable and sustainable energy sources using low-waste procedures.
