The No Shit Shirleys are seven soulful singing women offering up an acapella stew guaranteed to kick you in the pants! Singing everything from Cuban Carnival music and tragic Russian love songs to sweet Mandarin flirtations and wrenching Appalachian protests. The harmonies are complex, the arrangements original and the songs are in at least seven different languages. The mission: to promote joy, love and happiness through singing and - if possible â€“ to save the world. Is it possible? We say YES!
