The film revolves around Krishna (played by Krishnam Raju) who brings together an unlikely group of 5 youngsters to help in creating awareness among their villagers to revolt against the cruel village head, Rambhoopal (Rao Gopal Rao) and his henchmen. Even though being a revolutionary theme, the movie was wonderfully made without the usual noise that accompanies the leftist movies and fashioned on the lines of the great epic Mahabharatham. Amazing performances by all the actors (Krishnam Raju, Raogopal Rao, Allu Ramalingaiah etc.) and wonderful technical backup make this movie another classic from Bapu. The film also has Chiranjeevi as a very young actor (his second movie to be released) in the role of Parthu.
