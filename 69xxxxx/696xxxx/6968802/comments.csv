 this text I would be extremely grateful! I have the regular 12th edition manual, but it seems they have changed some numbers around. This requires too much cross referencing; not to mention that I freaked out on the first problem I noticed with this issue (I thought I forgot how to maths lol).


Thanks again. Will +1 after I check out the quality/accuracy!"
