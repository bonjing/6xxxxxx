Based on the Bruce Springsteen'song Highway Patrolman.

Synopsis: An intensely sad film about two brothers who cannot overcome their opposite perceptions of life. One brother see's and feels bad in everyone and everything, subsequently he is violent, antisocial and unable to appreciate or enjoy the good things which his brother desperately tries to point out to him. Frank understands the atrocities of life as a big picture, Joe does not, Joe is content to enjoy smaller pleasures -children, family, routine. Joe mistakenly believes he can straighten his little brother out and convince him that life is good. Frank is a cursed man. He is cut between his love for his brother and his repulsion at self-indulgent contentment. The result is a painful story of heartbreak, heartache, disappointment, despair, and the tragic side of love.
