                Brett McBain is preparing a welcoming feast for the woman 
                he married last month in New Orleans when he and his three
                children are gunned down by desperadoes. Frank, the most
                hardened villain, works for the railroad that will pass
                through the land Jill McBain has inherited. Will auctioning
                off the land quickly increase her odds of surviving?
                Harmonica gets the money for the high bid by turning in
                Cheyenne for the $5,000 award. And he keeps Jill, too, but
                seems more interested in settling an old score with Frank
                than either the land or the lovely widow.
