Hello Mavs. Down with price gouging! In order to make this successful I need you all to do your part and that includes the following:
1. Share this file with everybody. Which means sharing it directly or telling others about this torrent.
2. Seed this torrent. That means keep uploading it for a while after you have downloaded %100.
3. Make suggestions/requests for books.
4. If you have an e-copy or pdf of a book that is sold in the bookstore, give it to me and I will add it to this torrent. 
5. Share your know-how with newbs so they can learn how to acquire this file.
Thanks and I hope you all enjoy!!

This is mainly a collection of math and science books. Remember if you want other books included, make suggestions or provide copies.
