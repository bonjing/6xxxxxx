The Book "The First Civilization" by Jas Garcha

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This book, "The First Civilization", was created in order to further awareness and acceptance of a Resource Based Economy by explaining and defending this system from a scientific perspective. Beginning with a brief introduction on human behavior and its relationship to the environment, this book is divided into 3 main sections:

1. A detailed description of what an RBE could look like and how it might be run, including the specific technologies that could be employed.

2. An attempt to address and disprove many of the questions, concerns and objections that have been brought up in response to the RBE concept.

3. A general description of an experimental protocol that could be used to test the RBE idea and provide a scientific basis from which to push for a transition.
