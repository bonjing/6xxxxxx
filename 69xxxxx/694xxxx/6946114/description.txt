Armchair Theatre is the first solo album by Jeff Lynne, released in 1990.

"Every Little Thing" and "Lift Me Up" were released as singles. The album also features two classic cover versions "September Song" and "Stormy Weather" the latter recorded as a tribute to his late mother. The album re-united Lynne with Electric Light Orchestra's keyboard player Richard Tandy and fellow Traveling Wilburys member George Harrison (both Harrison and the Wilburys were signed to Warner Bros. Records, parent of Reprise Records which released this album). Despite positive reviews the album became only a minor hit. It has been rumored that a re-release of Armchair Theatre is set along with his new, long awaited 2011/2012 solo album.
