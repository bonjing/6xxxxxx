The story has three themes which run concurrently through the film. A stagecoach carrying a rich widow home to her family's hacienda. A war party of Indians, returning to their village; and two fur traders waiting to meet a different group of Indians with whom they trade. The war party attacks the other Indians, and kills their leader, who owns a magnificent white stallion. White Bull (Waterston) attempts to capture the horse, but it is too quick, and makes off carrying the dead chief. Pike (Sheen) and Henry (Keitel) wait in vain for the traders, and are then attacked themselves by the war party.
