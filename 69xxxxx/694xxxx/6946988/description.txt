This is an adaptation and completion of Charles Dickensâ€™s last novel, Edwin Drood, left unfinished at the halfway mark at his death on 9 June 1870.

A strange, disturbing and modern tale about drugs, stalking and darkness visible, The Mystery of Edwin Drood by writer Gwyneth Hughes is a two-part psychological thriller about a provincial choirmasterâ€™s obsession with 17-year-old Rosa Bud and the lengths he will go to to attain her.

John Jasper is a troubled man, his psyche split between darkness and light. He has spent his life in the stifling and claustrophobic cathedral town of Cloisterham in a state of frustrated ambition and has become addicted to opium in an attempt to still his ennui and expand his horizons.

But the opium is fracturing Jasperâ€™s mind so that even as his soul reaches for the sublime in his music, his darker self has conceived a murderous hatred of his nephew Edwin Drood who, he believes, stands between him and the lovely Rosa. The stage is set for a story of mental and moral decline as we discover exactly how far Jasper will go to attain the object of his desire.
