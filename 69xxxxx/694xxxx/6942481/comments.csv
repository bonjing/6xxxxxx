And porkolts. You know porkolts?

2
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,869
Yes, I've had it.

3
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,869
It's very good. Better than 
goulash. But you won't get it in 
Budapest now.

4
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,869
Why's that?

5
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,000
All the pigs have gone to Moscow.

6
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,869
When do I get to meet your 
friend?

7
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,500
I'll take you to him. Not eating?

8
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,000
Would you excuse me a moment?

9
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
No firing!

10
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Who told you to fire? Who told 
you to fucking fire?

11
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,869
Fucking Hungarian amateur! We 
wanted him alive!

12
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,000
Much obliged."
