Storyline

It is Lifeday, a holiday that is celebrated on Chewbacca\'s home planet Kashyyyk. Chewie and Han Solo are trying to get to the planet where Chewie\'s family is waiting for him, but the empire is out searching for the rebels, giving everyone a hard time. While we are waiting we get a look at the everyday life of a Wookiee family. We meet all the familiar characters from Star Wars and we are introduced to Boba Fett during a small cartoon. We also pay a visit to the Cantina and meet all the monsters again.
