├óΓé¼┼ôCowboy Junkies├óΓé¼┬¥ is one of the best names to convey a band├óΓé¼Γäós sound. The words├óΓé¼Γäó connotations signal a wide musical palette for the band to draw from as they frame the torch song tales delivered by Margo Timmins who continues to make despair sound so good. This artistic expanse keeps listeners engaged, as they never know what is coming next.
This DVD finds The Cowboy Junkies at the end of their 2004 One Soul Now tour at the Liverpool Philharmonic Hall in England, three years after their last appearance in the UK. They are a sextet that have been all been working together since their major label debut, 1988├óΓé¼Γäós The Trinity Session. Joining Margo are Alan Anton on bass; Jaro Czerwinec on accordion; utility player Jeff Bird, who played mandolin, harmonica, and percussion; and her brothers, Peter on drums, and Mike, lead guitarist and songwriter of the band├óΓé¼Γäós original songs. Playing together for so long has obviously given them an air of confidence as they play on a bare stage; it├óΓé¼Γäós just them, their music, and colored lights.
The set opens by going back to their beginnings with their cover of The Velvet Underground├óΓé¼Γäós ├óΓé¼┼ôSweet Jane.├óΓé¼┬¥ The song is expanded by Mike├óΓé¼Γäós brilliant playing. He├óΓé¼Γäós a slow, steady hand that knows exactly what he├óΓé¼Γäós doing and does it like very few, reminiscent of David Gilmour in style, though not in sound. Sitting in his chair, he delivers a smoldering fury that, combined with the accordion accompaniment, could very well have transported the listener elsewhere were it not for the song├óΓé¼Γäós familiar steady beat kept by the rhythm section.
The sounds and moods are constantly shifting. ├óΓé¼┼ôSun Comes Up It├óΓé¼Γäós Tuesday Morning├óΓé¼┬¥ is a short, easygoing country tune describing the brief moments of strength during a break-up before the remembrance of heartbreak sets back in. It is followed by Robert Johnson├óΓé¼Γäós "32-20 Blues,├óΓé¼┬¥ a grim, angry tale about dealing with lovers when they doesn't come home. Mike soars to magnificent heights once again with the aid of a metal slide on this 13-minute epic. The accordion and mandolin on ├óΓé¼┼ô├óΓé¼ΓäóCause Cheap Is How I Feel├óΓé¼┬¥ create a smooth country/folk sound. Mike drops a great fuzzed-out guitar solo in the middle of it.
