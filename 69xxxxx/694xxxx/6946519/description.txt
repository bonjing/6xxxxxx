Stephenie Meyer, Anne Rice and Stephen King, unlike anyone else, have known how to re-create the world of the vampires in their best sellet:r, making us a part of their "terrible" reality. This book explores the present situation of the vampires. It is a work that any reader or spectator of the great novels or movies of this genre would want to read sooner or later, as it rightly complements those highly successful novels by exploring not only the history but also the present situation of the vampires. And it achieves this by drowning us in a host of chronicles that show how these "dark angels" are, their obsessions and desires, as close to the humans as their own nature.
Amidst these pages, you will also find chilling details about the occult rituals of vampirism, potions, poisons and their antidotes from the first accounts up to the present day, following the footsteps of Bram Stoker in the depths of Count Dracula's country, the most famous "blood drinker" of all times.

â€¢ What is a vampire?
â€¢ Vampire customs.
â€¢ In search of Count Dracula.
â€¢ Polidori's vampire.
â€¢ The lineage of vampires.
â€¢ Preventing vampire attacks

What the reader will find below are facts or fabrications that have emerged through thousands of years and have reached our times under the cape at times seductive and delicate, and at times terrible of the essence of the Prince of darkness.

â€¢ Do you think that there could be a vampire in your family?
â€¢ Could we fall in love with one of these terrible creatures?
â€¢ Could we turn into one of those beings that emerge after twilight?
â€¢ How can one recognize a vampire?
â€¢ Is it true that a woman who makes love with a vampire becomes immortal?

Manuela Dunn-Mascetti was following the trail of vampires through East Europe while she was studying Anthropology and Mythology in the University of London, increasing her fascination for the legendary past of this dark legend up to the present day. Her first book is an illustrative account of the myths, symbols and rituals that surround the figure of the Goddess, and it has been published by Ediciones Robinbook.
