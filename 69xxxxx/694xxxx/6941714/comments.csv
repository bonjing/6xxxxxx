3D plasma tv and I was wondering how can I play these movies on my tv with the best quality.  I know I can not use my 4 gb usb flash for anything over 4gb.  No Hard drive over 4 gb is recognized by the tv.  I do not want to have to buy a media player.  My laptop does not go to 1920X1080 res. or have 3d capablity  How can I watch these 10, 20, 30, 40+GB 3D movies on my tv? I have a bluray burner but unless it is a iso file, I do not know how to convert a top quality bluray video file on to a 25 gb BD discs. Please someone HELP!!!"
