These selections from the many writings of Thomas Sowell over a period of a half 
century cover social, economic, cultural, legal, educational, and political issues. The sources range from Dr. Sowellâ€™s letters, books, newspaper columns, and articles in both scholarly journals and popular magazines. The topics range from late-talking children to â€œtax cuts for the rich,â€ baseball, race, war, the role of judges, medical care, and the rhetoric of politicians. These topics are dealt with by sometimes drawing on history, sometimes drawing on economics, and sometimes drawing on a sense of humor.
