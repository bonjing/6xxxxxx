 Album Info..: 
 
 Godsmack recorded its self-titled debut for 1,500 dollars and served up a 
 triple-platinum helping of meaty, cleverly written, pure metal. The tribal "Voodoo"  was one of 2000's best singles. Unfortunately, the group's sophomore effort, Awake, doesn't live up to its predecessor. The first three songs -- "Sick of Life," "Awake," and "Greed" -- blend together unanimously into a swirl of Tony Rombola's jackhammer  guitar riffs. It's the deeper cuts that are the standout tracks. The dirgy, slow  groove in "Mistakes" is hook laden. One common thread between Godsmack and Awake is lead singer Sully Erna's angst-ridden lyrics. "Oh God, I'm makin' the same mistakes," he cries in "Mistakes," as Rombola's guitars encircle him. Drummer Tommy Stewart, on "Trippin'," aptly pronounces Erna's anger in "Face down/I walk away/Every time I  think I do the right thing/You turn your back on me." The album opens with the  pronouncement, "I'm gonna do it again." Probably not.
