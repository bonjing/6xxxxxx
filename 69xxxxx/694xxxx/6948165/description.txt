Thursday was a great kickoff to the final weekend of the Beacon run, with great guests like Leslie West of Mountain and members of Gregg Allman's band joining in the fun!

One early highlight in the first set was Warren's song "River's Gonna Rise" from his upcoming album Man In Motion.  This version had a great groove and really helped cement this tune in the rotation.  The instrumental "Bag End" allowed the whole band to stretch out, and Leslie West added his heavy rock vibe to "Crossroads" and "Going Down."

Gregg was really at his best to begin the second half, singing his heart out on "Melissa" before ripping a bluesy version of "Come On In My Kitchen" with guest guitarist John Kadlecik of Furthur.  "Maydell" segued flawlessly into the Jimi Hendrix tune "Manic Depression," which rocked the house!  That powerful 3/4 groove sounds so good with the big ABB sound behind it.

"No One To Run With" was jammy and inspired, and a host of guests, including Jay Collins and Scott Sharrard from Gregg Allman's band, contributed to a massive groove on "That's What Love Will Make You Do."  Derek really went for it on "Mountain Jam," displaying some of his best playing of the whole run.  He was in Skydog territory, totally in the zone and hittin' the note! 

An exciting, guest-stacked "Southbound" encore finished the show with a bang, but not until after midnight!
