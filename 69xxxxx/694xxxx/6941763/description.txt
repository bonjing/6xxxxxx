BBC Ones much praised, multi-award-winning drama Sherlock, starring Benedict Cumberbatch 
and Martin Freeman, returns for an eagerly awaited second series of three, 90-minute films 
A Scandal In Belgravia, The Hounds Of Baskerville and The Reichenbach Fall.

Something terrible has happened to Henry Knight; Sherlock and John investigate the truth 
about the monstrous creature which apparently killed their client's father. A hound from 
hell? What seems like fantasy in Baker Street is a very different prospect in the 
ultra-secret army base that looms over Dartmoor.
