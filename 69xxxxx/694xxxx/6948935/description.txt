To the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intentionally 
posting fake comments & files. Their meaning is just trying to spread 
confusion and to frustrate TPB and it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s users. 
Less downloaders = less seeders = less download speed etc = not good! 

It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intentionally keep posting fake comments & files. It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s an easy answer against 
those who intentionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
