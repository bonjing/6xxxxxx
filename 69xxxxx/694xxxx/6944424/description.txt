  For completionists only, here is a rare widescreen laserdisc rip of Arabian Knight,
  the terrible Miramax edit of Richard Williams' masterpiece The Thief and the
  Cobbler.

  The quality here is pretty poor, typical for a standard laserdisc of the time. A
  better DVD rip of the film is also available here via torrent.

  Please watch The Thief and the Cobbler Recobbled Cut, which restores Williams'
  original intention as seen in his workprint.

  Williams is the three-time Oscar-winning animation director of Who Framed Roger
  Rabbit? and A Christmas Carol. The author of the book The Animator's Survival
  Kit, he is considered one of the greatest living animators.

  He spent 24 years on his masterpiece The Thief and the Cobbler, which was never
  completed as intended. This terrible Miramax version inserts song numbers, bad
  voiceovers and generally spits all over Williams' intentions.

  Please watch The Thief and the Cobbler Recobbled Cut, which restores Williams'
  original intention as seen in his workprint.

  You can see all of Richard Williams' work on a certain Tube video site at
  the channel thethiefarchive.
