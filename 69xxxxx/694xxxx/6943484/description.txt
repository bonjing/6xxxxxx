Little Mix\\\'s cover of the Damien Rice track \\\'Cannonball\\\' is the lowest-selling single from an X Factor winner since 2004. 


The four-piece girl band, who triumphed in the final of the reality show earlier this month (December 11), claimed the Number One spot in the Official UK Singles Chart last night (December 18) and outsold the rest of the Top Five put together. 


But The Guardian reports that even though they racked up the biggest first week sales figures of 2011, their track still sold less copies than any of the other previous X Factor winners, with the exception of Steve Brookstein\\\'s 2004 cover of the Phil Collins track \\\'Against All Odds\\\'.
