The.Living.Dead.At.Manchester.Morgue.1974.XviD-NvadR [REMASTERED] 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071431/

Although the influence of George Romero's Night of the 
Living Dead is undeniable, the film didn't produce anywhere 
near the number of followers as its sequel, Dawn of the 
Dead. 
One of the few films that followed in Night of the Living 
Dead's zombified footsteps is Spanish filmmaker Jorge Grau's 
The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue. Inspired by Romero's 
unrelenting piece of work, Grau headed to the U.K. in order 
to make a film that his producers hoped would be little more 
than a colorized version of Night of the Living Dead. What the 
producers got instead was a film that stands on its own merits 
and now ranks among the subgenre's finest due to an intelligent 
screenplay, sharp cinematography, and shocking gore effects.

The story begins with George (Ray Lovelock), an antiques dealer 
from Manchester, becoming a traveling companion of a young woman 
named Edna (Cristina Galbo) who has damaged his motorbike at a 
service station. As the travelers set off for the peaceful 
confines of England's Lake District, a series of bizarre 
incidents lead them to realize they are trapped in the middle of 
a zombie outbreak. To make matters worse, a local police inspector 
(Arthur Kennedy) believes that George and Edna are the source of 
the incidents and begins a relentless persecution of the duo.
