I do apologize folks, the subtitles included with our 1080p version of this movie will only work with the 720p version, unless the sync is adjusted so the
action starts at 1 minute 40 seconds rather than 2 minutes 12 seconds

This batch of subtitles has been modified to work with the 1080p version
or were found to already match without modification

My apologies once again
