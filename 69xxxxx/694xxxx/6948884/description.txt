Cabell Cab Calloway III (December 25, 1907 â€“ November 18, 1994) was an American jazz singer 
and bandleader. He was strongly associated with the Cotton Club in Harlem, New York City where 
he was a regular performer.

Calloway was a master of energetic scat singing and led one of the United States' most popular 
African American big bands from the start of the 1930s through the late 1940s. Calloways band 
featured performers including trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie and Adolphus Doc Cheatham, saxophonists 
Ben Webster and Leon "Chu" Berry, New Orleans guitar ace Danny Barker, and bassist Milt Hinton. 
Calloway continued to perform until his death in 1994 at the age of 86.
