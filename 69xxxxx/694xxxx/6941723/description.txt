This is every episode of Satyrcast.  This was a podcast done by Scott Murray, currently of Lost in the Static and Another Pagan Podcast.  
So many people that listen to our show on Jackaloperadio.com have requested copies of Satyrcast, that decided to create this Torrent or all of the episodes.

The first few episodes are really, really rough.  This was an experimental, \\\"Hey can we even do this?\\\" kind of time, and it was really just four friends (or more) messing around online and having fun.

Mind you, it turned into a two year plus kind of weekly unloading of ourselves online.

My co-host of my current show hates it, so there\\\'s a good chance that you\\\'ll like it. 

We made a promise at the start of Satyrcast to do it as long as it was fun, and toward the end, you can see that it stopped being fun, so it was time to end it.

I\\\'m not proud of the work I did here.  It was a good time for us, and a few people enjoyed it on a regular basis, but I would have preferred to leave it to the aether, but alas, many people have since requested to hear it, so here it all is, for the world to decide if it\\\'s crap.

Enjoy, or don\\\'t.  We certainly had ups and downs with the show.

I\\\'ve included a few sample files of other shows I really enjoy, as I always love to promote really good audio work.  If you don\\\'t like Satyrcast, check out the few other shows included, you might find one you enjoy.
