SOME TRIVIA FROM IMDB

Pierce Brosnan was originally rumored to have a role in this movie. 

This franchise is known for spoofing spy films, chief among them, the Bond films. Rosamund Pike, who costars in the film, played a Bond girl in Die Another Day.

The girl in the motorcycle, when Johnny grabs a helmet during his chase in a wheelchair is Lily Atkinson, Rowan Atkinson's daughter. 

The two cars initially chasing JE in the wheelchair chase scene were black Alfa Romeo 156 saloons identical to the two black Alfa Romeo 156 saloons chasing James Bond in the opening chase scene of _Quantum of Solace_.

PLOT:Rowan Atkinson returns to the role of the accidental secret agent who doesn't know fear or danger in the comedy spy-thriller Johnny English Reborn. In his latest adventure, the most unlikely intelligence officer in Her Majesty's Secret Service must stop a group of international assassins before they eliminate a world leader and cause global chaos. In the years since MI-7's top spy vanished off the grid, he has been honing his unique skills in a remote region of Asia. But when his agency superiors learn of an attempt against the Chinese premier's life, they must hunt down the highly unorthodox agent. Now that the world needs him once again, Johnny English is back in action. With one shot at redemption, he must employ the latest in hi-tech gadgets to unravel a web of conspiracy that runs throughout the KGB, CIA and even MI-7. With mere days until a heads of state conference...
