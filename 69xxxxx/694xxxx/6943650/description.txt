As you can tell, I'm throwing out music from some of my faves. 

Any requests?

Also, there is apparently a bit of confusion as to "What the fuck are .m4a files?" so here's a bit of a primer:

Apple Lossless (also known as Apple Lossless Audio Codec, ALAC, or Apple Lossless Encoder, ALE) a type of audio compression created by Apple Inc.

Having Lossless in the name, obviously means Apple Lossless is a Lossless codec, unlike a lossy codec (such as mp3) where audio quality is lost forever in the name of smaller files, lossless stores the original CD track without loss, like zip for audio. Apple Lossless can compress CD quality audio file to roughly half its original size.

Apple Lossless files can be decoded at relatively high speed, in comparison to other lossless codec. Apple lossless supports 16 bit and 24 bit audio, as well as multi channel audio, such as 5.1

Apple Lossless files are stored in the MPEG 4 container and have a .m4a extension. The MPEG 4 container is also used for Advanced Audio Compression (AAC), a lossy compression (currently all tracks purchased from iTunes Music Store (iTMS) are AAC).

There MAY BE SOME CONFUSION as to if .m4a files are compressed or not. Usually a quick look at the file size reveals if a file is compressed or lossless, as lossless files tend to be 3 times the size of high bit rate, compressed files.

Be assured all my files are lossless.

Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen (born September 23, 1949), nicknamed "The Boss," is an American singer-songwriter-performer who records and tours with the E Street Band. Springsteen is widely known for his brand of heartland rock, poetic lyrics, and Americana sentiments centered on his native New Jersey.

Springsteen's recordings have included both commercially accessible rock albums and more somber folk-oriented works. His most successful studio albums, Born in the U.S.A. and Born to Run, showcase a talent for finding grandeur in the struggles of daily American life; he has sold more than 65 million albums in the United States and more than 120 million worldwide and he has earned numerous awards for his work, including 20 Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes and an Academy Award. He is widely regarded by many as one of the most influential songwriters of the 20th century, and in 2004, Rolling Stone ranked him as the 23rd greatest artist of all time in its 100 Greatest Artists of All Time list.
