REVIEWS
â€œI've tested all of the RDP and VNC apps on my Xoom and I must say that this one worked best for me. Connections were solid over Wi-Fi (could not test 3G properly because I don't get the best signal from home). The user interface and the way it handles the mouse cursor & custom keys is my favorite as well. Not to mention that this app covers both RDP + VNC, and is such a reasonable price for what it does!â€ Nick
â€œThis app is awesome. Ridiculously easy to set up. The pointer they came up with is great and it runs flawlessly on my EVO.â€ Andre
â€œEasy to set up and use. Minimal lag, its nice to be able to access my home pc from anywhere. HTC Incredibleâ€ dan
â€œPerfect app. Ample help files. Stable. I use it to admin my remotely hosted servers at multiple locations. Thanks for a good app.â€ Johan
