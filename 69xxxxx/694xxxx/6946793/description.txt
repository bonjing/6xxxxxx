Whatâ€™s more fun for guys than reading comics? Making their own. Your Life in Comics lets boys ages 9â€“13 do just that. Inspired by the Free Spirit favorite 100 Things Guys Need to Know, this do-it-yourself comic book features cartooning exercises and prompts that get boys thinking about important subjects in their lives, including family, friends, school, health, and the future. Rather than provide the story, the book allows guys to decide what happens by creating words and drawings of their own. Some of the interactive exercises feature completed comic strip panels where boys imagine and write the dialog. Others let guys draw comic strips of their own. Freestyle activities let kids personalize the book and explore who they are. Web extensions point the way to additional fun, interactive resources online.
Comic books and graphic novels help educators and parents get reluctant readers interested in books. Your Life in Comics goes a step further and helps get guys thinking and writing about critical topics in their lives.
