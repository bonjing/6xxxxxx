Note : 
Ok another nice 720p HD CAM from 26K :) big thanks for sharing source files 
bro. but like all cams still had the normal problems that come with them so 
appended some filters  to video to improve, then added the audio to filtered 
video :) opted for higher bitrate just to help the dark scenes look better 
so enjoy another fine CAM
