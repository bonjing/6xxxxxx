The city of Dakota is kicking its poor minority residents out to make way for a huge commercial amusement park that will make the privileged richer. Tempers are running high among the poor population and especially among Dakota's heroes as they figure out where they stand and decide whether they will stop a (race) riot or encourage it! Starring Static, the Blood Syndicate, Icon, Holocaust, Hardware among others

Very different from most mainstream comics Milestone's universe-wide tie-in is about rioting recalling the aftermath of some of the most heinous American crimes including Martin Luther King, Malcolm X as well as the Rodney King riots.
