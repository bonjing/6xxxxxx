To make it fit the screen nicely you'd be missing all but the very middle of the picture.
Not really the kind of copy I'm looking for, even if it did download faster than 0.2Kbps. :/
Not sure why so much of the picture has been cut away... perhaps to keep the file size low? :/ I suppose it's ok if you want to watch it on full-screen on a small square TV but that's not much use to me. The quality's fuzzy even at normal ratio, let alone enlarged to full-screen."
