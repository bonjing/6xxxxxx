Trend Microâ„¢ Titaniumâ„¢ Internet Security provides advanced protection for your family so you can connect with confidence.

    Friendly, Adjustable Parental Controls
    Without having to look over their shoulders, you can easily protect your children from inappropriate websites, limit their time on the Internet, and see detailed activity reports about what they do online. The Parental Controls can be quickly customized.

    
    Data Theft Prevention
    Prevent hackers and spyware from stealing credit card numbers, passwords, email addresses, and other sensitive data.

    
    Securely Erase Documents
    Deleting a file just removes the directory information used to find it, but not the actual data. The Secure Erase feature overwrites deleted files with random data, so that the contents canâ€™t be retrieved. For even more security, the Permanent Erase option overwrites files seven times and meets United States government data security standards. 

    System Tuner
    Maximize Performance
    The System Tuner feature can help you recover disk space, make MicrosoftÂ® WindowsÂ® start faster, clean out your instant messaging history, and optimize your computerâ€™s performance. You can even schedule automatic tune-ups that will keep your PC running smoothly.
