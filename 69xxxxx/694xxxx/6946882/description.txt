This Bosten, Mass. band's only album is a real sleeper, with very little reputation among collectors. A pity, because it's great! It's a diverse mix of psych influenced prog rock, with some pop, blues, and hard rock, featuring fuzz-wah guitar, sax, and flute. Check this one out, as it's pretty consistent to.
