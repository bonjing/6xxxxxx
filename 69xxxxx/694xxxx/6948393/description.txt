Inception 3D for HTC 3D (or any other 3D devices that play side-by-side 3D videos).

1. Move to your SD card.

2. Play video with Gallery, or a File Manager app.

3. Hit Menu, and select, "Play in 3D".

4. Sit back, relax, and enjoy. Works better with headphones, but I can hear the whole movie just fine through the HTC 3D speakers.

NOTE: This movie was not FILMED in 3D, so it is not TRUE 3D. It is 3D that was done digitally. Still cool to have, especially if you like having awesome stuff on your awesome HTC 3D phone.
