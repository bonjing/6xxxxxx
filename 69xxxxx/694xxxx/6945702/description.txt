Presenting Analysis, Context, and Criticism on Literary Movements

Another valuable title in the Gale For Students line, this set is meant to "provide readers with a guide to understanding, enjoying, and studying literary movements." Twenty-eight literary movements are described in their historical and cultural contexts. Volume 1 includes literature before the twentieth century (alphabetical chapters from "Bildungsroman" to "Transcendentalism"), and volume 2 covers the twentieth century ("Absurdism" to "Symbolism").
Each chapter consists of an introduction, brief entries for representative authors and works, and discussion of themes, styles, variations, and historical context. An original signed critical essay is included in each chapter along with, in most cases, lengthy excerpts from one or more previously published critical works. Black-and-white photos, sidebars listing such items as media adaptations and suggested topics and resources for further study, bibliographies of source material, and annotated further reading lists complete most chapters. A particularly useful feature is "Compare and Contrast," in which the cultural and historical background of each movement is compared to conditions in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.
Front matter for each volume includes a volume-specific table of contents, a literary chronology, and a list of contributors (mostly freelance writers). Three indexes are found at the end: a "Cumulative Author/Title Index," a "Nationality/Ethnicity Index," and a "Subject/Theme Index." Also at the end of each volume is a useful glossary defining and cross-referencing terms from abstract to zeitgeist.
