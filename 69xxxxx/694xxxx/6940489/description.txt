story arch for New X-Men, as well as Joss Whedonâ€™s mid-2000s run on Astonishing X-Men.

12 "Destiny - Bond" January 6, 2012
"Destiny - Kizuna" (Destiny-çµ†)  June 24, 2011

On the brink of world destruction, Charles reaches out to all the X-Men (consisting of Archangel, 
Colossus, Nightcrawler, and Rogue) and mutants (consisting of Captain Britain and Deadpool) around 
the world asking them to support one another and protect humanity. Learning that Takeo hates him for 
being born into a world where his powers cause him so much suffering, Charles blames himself for 
causing Takeo pain. The X-Men try to attack Takeo, but are easily defeated. Charles then prepares to 
destroy Takeo's mind and kill him, fully intending to die along with his son. Jean's presence manages 
to revive the X-Men and give them courage to fight on as she states that mutants and humans are working 
together in this crisis. Hisako recalls her friendly past with Takeo and insists that Takeo is a good 
person who can be saved. Her feelings cause her armor to generate a brilliant light, reaching Takeo and 
bringing him back to his senses. He and Charles are able to reconcile, and Takeo's body is destroyed, 
but not before he is able to reassure Yui and Charles that he is alright. The X-Men stand committed to 
standing together against future threats to human and mutant peace. Cyclops gives Jean's necklace to 
Hisako as a symbol that he has accepted her as a full-fledged teammate he can trust, as he and Emma begin 
a friendly relationship. In a post-credit scene, it is revealed that Magneto's plastic prison has been 
destroyed and he has escaped with the teaser line saying "The Battle of the X-Men continues..."
