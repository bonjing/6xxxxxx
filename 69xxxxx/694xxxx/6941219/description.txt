Review by Matt Collar (AMG)
Journeyman tenor saxophonist Scott Hamilton keeps things light and swinging on Back in New York. Bringing to mind a mix of Dexter Gordon and Ben Webster, Hamilton has always displayed an unerring classicist aesthetic, and this album is no exception. Featuring the deft rhythm section of pianist Bill Charlap, bassist Peter Washington, and drummer Kenny Washington, Back in New York is a template for what solid modern mainstream jazz should sound like. To these ends, Hamilton kicks things into gear with a sprightly take on "What Is This Thing Called Love," nudges his way through a tasty samba version of "Love Letters," and keeps thing warm and fuzzy on "This Is Always."
