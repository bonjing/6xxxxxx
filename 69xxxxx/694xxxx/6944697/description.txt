The rise of biological control techniques and integrated pest management (IPM), and their successful application in agricultural systems, has attracted many entomologists to attempt the crossover of these methods into household and industrial environments. Covering all the major groups of insects and other arthropods considered urban pests, this reference provides the reader with an up-to-date and comprehensive review of basic biology, behavior, distribution and, most importantly, control methodology.

"Handbook of Urban Insects and Arachnids is an excellent reference text for urban entomologists. It is the first international census of the pests affecting households, structures, public health, and landscapes. With internationalization and the "shrinking globe," pest distributions are expanding. In addition, lines between structures, public health, and landscapes, as well as lines between regional and international research and cooperation on urban pests, are becoming less static. Thus, this resource is a timely addition to our libraries, and it will fill an important niche."
