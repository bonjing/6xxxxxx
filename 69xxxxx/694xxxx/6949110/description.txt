Demul v0.5.7 (beta version) with some roms that I got to work with it.

Check the ROMs folder in the file list to see what games there are.

You will probably have to update the paths and plug-ins location under Config, as well as change the controls and such. If you have any questions, google is your friend cuz I'm not expert on this emulator.
