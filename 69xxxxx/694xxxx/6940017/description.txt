In recent years, the terms Visualization, Infographic and others have been bantered around with almost no regard to their use or meaning. There is a new vernacular emerging in the realms of data representations, but that doesnâ€™t mean we can ignore the much simpler origins and best practices of charts and graphs.

Brian Suda takes you on a journey through the basics and makes it easy to produce beautiful looking, accurate representations of data. Heâ€™ll walk you through how to visualize and design data in such a way that it engages the reader and tells a story rather than just being flashy, cluttered and confusing.
