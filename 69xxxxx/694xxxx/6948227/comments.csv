@SectorVector the difference between 6MP and 8MP is 2 million pixels add to that's the idea of moving images and you can get a shit load of bits. Silly silly guy!"
g few megabytes improves the quality. That would have been impolite.

PS: I myself have never ripped a movie. But maybe you could have different settings for different ""types"" of movies, instead of one size fits all. Just a thought. You know best. So just ignore me if am blah-blah-ing here.

As a reference i kind of like Mitzep's releases.
If he were to come back, i'd switch my loyalty :)

Best wishes. Its nice to have a informed uploaders like you."
