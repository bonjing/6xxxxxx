 Firstly, thanks to BiDA for syncing the LiNE audio. Tagged this as a   
 PPVRip because that is what it looks like, can't really see this being 
 a true screener. Anyway we didn't do that much to this one, just a few 
 little filters such as denoise here and there, before then converting  
 to x264. More than watchable.
