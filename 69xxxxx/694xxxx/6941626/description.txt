This is my first uploaded torrent, please forgive any mistakes I may have made :)


On this torrent you'll find all the Stephen King works published between 1974 and 1994 (from Carrie to Insomnia). All of these are of very high quality, and were painstakingly proofread. All books are available in 4 formats: .docx, .pdf, .epub and .pdf. You can read them on your e-reader of choice, print, or read them on the PC.

I hope you all enjoy the works of this terrific author. I intend to publish a 2nd torrent later this year (very late, in all likelihood), containing all remaining Stephen King books.

Enjoy, and please help me seeding.
