				Overall:
				--------
	The book contain 471 pages including the intro, about the Author, and 
	the Index Book, in addition of the code source that is available with 
	the package.
	
	P.S:
	----
	To get the most knowledge and experience and skills, i recomend that 
	you work hard before viewing the source code, at least; This is my 
	opinion thanks.

				Chapter Outline:
				----------------
	This bookâ€™s projects (chapters) are grouped into five sections. In many
	cases, the same solution is provided in all chapters in that section,
	with each chapter providing new features to the project from the  
	previous chapter.
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   				Section 1: Basic Concepts:
   				--------------------------
   	In the first section, youâ€™ll build three simple workflows. In Chapter
   	1, youâ€™ll create a workflow using the workflow designer and some of the 
   	basic built-in activities. In Chapter 2, youâ€™ll re-create the same
   	workflow in code. This will give you an opportunity early on to see 
   	both designer workflows and coded workflows. Both types will be 
   	demonstrated throughout the book. In Chapter 3, youâ€™ll use the 
   	flowchart activity, which provides the ultimate flexibility in 
   	designing complex workflows.
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------	
   				Section 2: Designing Workflows:
   				-------------------------------
   	In the second section, youâ€™ll build a workflow that computes the cost
   	of an order. Each chapter will add additional features to the project 
   	from the previous chapter. The project in Chapter 4 demonstrates how
   	to pass data into and out of a workflow. In Chapter 5, youâ€™ll 
   	interactively execute activities based on a
   	collection of objects. Chapter 6 will show you how to handle and throw
   	exceptions. In Chapter 7, youâ€™ll explore the two main ways to extend 
   	the workflow activities: creating a custom activity and executing the
   	InvokeMethod activity.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------- 	
				Section 3: Communication:
				-------------------------
	In the third section, youâ€™ll build workflows that take advantage of the
	integration with the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF). The 
	project in Chapter 8 builds a console application that communicates
	with other instances of the same application using WCF messages. In 
	Chapter 9, the console app is replaced with a Windows Presentation 
	Foundation (WPF) application, which demonstrates how the application 
	and workflow can interact with each other. In Chapter 10, youâ€™ll host
	a workflow in a WCF web service. Youâ€™ll also consume that service using 
	a workflow application.
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
				Section 4: Workflow Extensions:
				-------------------------------
	A key component of workflow design is the use of extensions to 	
	configure the environment in which the workflow activities operate. The 
	project in Chapter 11, for instance, demonstrates how to use the
	standard SQL persistence extension. This extension allows the state of 
	the workflow to be written to a SQL database and retrieved later, when 
	the workflow is resumed. In Chapter 12, youâ€™ll explore ways to
	extend and customize the persistence operation. The project in Chapter 
	13 demonstrates how to track the execution of a workflow in a variety 
	of ways. In Chapter 14, youâ€™ll use database transactions to ensure
	data consistency across multiple activities. In Chapter 15, youâ€™ll 
	execute the application updates on the same database transaction used 
	to persist the workflow state. This will guarantee that the workflow 
	state and application data stay consistent. Finally, in Chapter 16, 
	youâ€™ll learn how to configure extensions when the workflow is 
	instantiated by a WorkflowServiceHost.
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   				Section 5: Advanced Topics:
   				---------------------------
   	Chapter 17 demonstrates how to include logic within the workflow design
   	to handle abnormal conditions such as compensation and cancellation. In 
   	Chapter 18, youâ€™ll see how to use both built-in and custom activities 
   	to support collections of objects. The project in Chapter 19 uses the 
   	Interop activity to execute workflows and activities that were created 
   	using previous versions of WF. In Chapter 20, youâ€™ll use the Policy 
   	activity from version 3.0 in a WF 4.0 workflow.
