Plot: Diane Blaine has the face of a movie star. Unfortunately, fallen star/tabloid queen Jamie Stephens already made it famous. Hollywoods constant rejection due to what Diane refers to as â€œTJSâ€ (â€œToo Jamie Stephensâ€) has made her bitter, frustratedâ€¦.and, yes, whiny. Co-worker/boyfriend Jack Sanders doesnÃ¢Â€â„¢t help matters. His idea of ambition is letting it ride. Now heÃ¢Â€â„¢s in major debt to a trigger-happy mobster who, interestingly enough, has a thing for Jamie Stephens. JackÃ¢Â€â„¢s only way out? Convince Diane to be Jamie and wipe out the debt having one meal with a made man. ItÃ¢Â€â„¢s literally the performance of her life. With JackÃ¢Â€â„¢s on the line.
