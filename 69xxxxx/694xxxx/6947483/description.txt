Ronnie Hawkins is a rockabilly singer who may be more famous for his backup musicians than his own music. His backup group from the early 1960s, The Hawks, evolved into The Band.  His two most sought after albums have never been issued on CD, until now. What makes these albums so special is the guitarist on both albums is Duane Allman.  Ronnie Hawkins was originally issued on the Cotillion label in 1970. Along with Duane Allman, it also features King Biscuit Boy and Eddie Hinton.  The Hawk was originally issued on the Cotillion label in 1971. Besides Duane Allman, it also features Donald "Duck" Dunn on bass and The Memphis Horns.
