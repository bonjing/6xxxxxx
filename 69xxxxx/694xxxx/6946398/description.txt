Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Tuesday, January 10 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks about today's crucial New Hampshire primary. A new poll indicates that GOP presidential candidate Ron Paul is statistically tied with Obama in a hypothetical head to head, making him the only Republican candidate other than Mitt Romney to be in such a position. 

Alex also talks about John Huntsman's effort to take down Paul and fast moving developments in the Middle East as Iran puts another enrichment facility online and the EU moves up the date for its meeting on an embargo against the oil-produicng nation.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
