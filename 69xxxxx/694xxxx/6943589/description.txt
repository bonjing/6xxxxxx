There was a time when everybody believed that history is only the biography of great 'men'. Legendary women of the past, like Cleopatra, have been the exception, not the rule. This is no longer true. The history of the modern world also includes the lives of great women. Through the ages, women did come to the forefront, and their genius could not be confined by the walls of society.
This issue of Manorama Tell Me Why takes a look at the luminous lives of g reat women - extraordinary women who changed the world. The world has known so many g reat women, that some names had to be left out due to space constraints. We hope to include them in a separate issue in future.
