Quote:
When a mysterious book of powerful spells binds itself to him, the fact that Rob's life has been falling apart doesn't seem like such a big deal. What do his girlfriend leaving him or his mountain of debt matter when mystics and demons are overrunning the town in search of the book--and him? To survive, Rob must learn to control the book's unpredictable magic, while his life slips even further out of control.
