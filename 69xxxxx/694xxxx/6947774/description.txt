Stella is a beautiful young girl who dreams of becoming one day a famous singer. Her boyfriend Andreas leads a quiet life working at his small store, and doesn\'t approve Stella\'s quest for fame.

Greek spoken language, unfortunately could not find any English subs on the web (neither were there on the DVD).
