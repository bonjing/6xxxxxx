I have been trying hard to find srt files, for some of my movies I have found one, for some not (as in the case of this movie). The only solution for the latter is hopefully some Greek-English speaker with more time in his hands, to come up with a custom translation.

I might even try to make one in the weekend myself, to see how long it will take me."
