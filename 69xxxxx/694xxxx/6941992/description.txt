thx m8

Encode:
what a great movie and a early dvdscr
since i was sleeping when we got the disc the guys had a 10h headstart.
a smallrip and a x264 encode is already out. now its time for a hq avi version.

The DVD itself was nice, also came along with 5.1 audio, just the 2 spots with the
property logo which appears for 45secs each is in the way of a perfect release.

Added brightness, sharpness, rgb and denoise.
Since the property logo is big above and small below filling the screen,
blurring the property part is impossible. Decided to do the crop only when
needed method on a transition scene before and afterwards the spots.
So the complete rest of the movie is uncropped, just the 90sec are.
Since these spots are now in transitions scenes you wont see when they are.
This is the perfect solution for it, looks like real dvdrip now.
got very nice
enjoy
