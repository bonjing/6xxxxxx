Release Notes:
--------
After their introduction to the world through the singles "The Truest Faith" and
"Honey Mine," the partnership of Marcus Joons and Daniel TjÃ¤der (also of The
Radio Dept) presents its debut album, An Album By Korallreven. The project was
conceived after Joons returned from an extended trip to Samoa where he found
inspiration in the local choirs. Mesmerized by the South Pacific and the
exhilaration of travel, he shared his newfound passion with TjÃ¤der and a
partnership was born.
