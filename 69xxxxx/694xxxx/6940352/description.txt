The Old Grey Whistle Test was launched on 21st September 1971 from a tiny studio tucked behind 
a lift shaft on the fourth floor of BBC Television Centre. From humble beginnings it has gone 
on to provide some of the best and most treasured music archive that the BBC has to offer. In 
its 40th anniversary year, this programme takes us on a journey and celebrates the musically 
mixed-up decade that was the 1970s and which is reflected in the OGWT archive. There are classic 
performances from the glam era by Elton John and David Bowie, an early UK TV appearance from 
Curtis Mayfield, the beginnings of heavy metal with Steppenwolfs iconic Born to be Wild anthem 
and the early punk machinations of the 'mock rock' New York Dolls. 1973 being the pinnacle year 
sees archive from Roxy Music, the Wailers and Vinegar Joe. The programme's finale celebrates 
the advent of punk and new wave with unforgettable performances from Patti Smith, Blondie, Iggy 
Pop and The Jam.
