LatinAdultery - Cassandra Cruz)






Cassandra Cruz met a man on the Internet and is supposed to meet him for their first date at a bar, but she's late and, for whatever reason, doesn't tell him, so poor homeboy thinks he's stood up, and he leaves. Bartender John is burning a hole in the bar wiping it down when Cassandra bursts in and mistakes him for her date! John goes along with it, telling her he wanted to surprise her, so that they'd have the whole place to themselves. When he locks up, Cassandra, who's married, cuts to the chase and gets naked so she can get some dick!
