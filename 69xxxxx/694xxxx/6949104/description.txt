First Public BETA released on January 12th, 2012.


This is a modification, that will bring you back to Vice City of 80's, but on this time it will be on GTA IV (RAGE) engine.
We're planning to make a conversion of Vice City (including transport, atmosphere, weapons).
We hope you'll enjoy it, when it will be released.
