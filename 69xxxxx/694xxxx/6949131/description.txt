 Darryl Revok is the most powerful of all the scanners, and is the head of the   underground scanner movement for world domination. Scanners have great psychic   power, strong enough to control minds; they can inflict enormous pain/damage
 on their victims. Doctor Paul Ruth finds a scanner that Revok hasn't, and
 converts him to their cause - to destroy the underground movement.
