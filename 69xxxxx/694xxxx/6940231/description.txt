 Album Info..: 
 
 "Monday Morning," a sunny slice of folk-rock with Beach Boys harmonies, opens 
 Fleetwood Mac and makes it clear that the band is no longer a blues-rock outfit. 
 Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks were the catalyst for Fleetwood Mac's successful re-emergence as a mainstream pop/rock band. While Buckingham only contributed three songs, he helped the band develop a coherent vision, providing crystal-clear backings for Nicks' hippie anthems and Christine McVie's remarkably improved pop-soul. McVie dominates the album, contributing some of her finest songs, including the sighing "Over My Head" and the bouncy "Say You Love Me." Nicks' songs function as folky counterpoints to McVie's sweet pop, and she rarely ever wrote songs as memorably affecting as "Rhiannon" or "Landslide." Remarkably, Fleetwood Mac is a blockbuster album that isn't dominated by its hit singles, and its album tracks ("World Turning,""Sugar Daddy," "Crystal") demonstrate a depth of both songwriting and musicality that would blossom fully on Rumours.

 HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality 
 of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!
