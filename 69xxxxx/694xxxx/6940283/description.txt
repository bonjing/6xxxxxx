Chapter One of my second custom story, Rotting Prison.

The beginning of Rotting Prison. You play as a nameless character who finds themselves stuck in an abandoned prison. Your only goal is to survive long enough to get out. Throughout the course of the story, the player will find notes which explain what was happening inside the prison. The story of this custom story does not focus on the present, but more of the past. The notes will reveal more about the prison, and why it is the way it is while the player is exploring it.
