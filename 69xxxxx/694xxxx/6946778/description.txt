Ever since its launch in 1984, New In Chess has been the most popular and widely-read chess magazine in the world, with a readership that ranges from world champions to the humblest club player.No other magazine in chess history can boast such a glittering array of world-class grandmasters amongst its regular contributors.
Now, to mark the 25th anniversary of the magazine's launch, New In Chess: The First 25 Years brings you an anthology of its best and most entertaining articles over the period.
From tournament reports, annotated games, interviews, historical articles, endgame analyses, and much, much more, the book offers a unique perspective on the chess of the past quarter of a century.
Here you can read inside accounts of many of the greatest chess stories of the past 25 years, including Kasparov's stunning retirement announcement in 2005, Fischer's final years in Iceland, how Kramnik took the world title from Kasparov in 2000, and how Anand took the same title from Kramnik himself, eight years later.
The many interviews in the book include no fewer than nine world champions, plus countless other leading grandmasters.
