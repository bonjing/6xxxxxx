This is a recording of the whole Live Feed of the first stop in the The Fault in Our Stars Tour which ran from 7pm to just past 12m ET. This isn't up on YouTube yet/anymore, so I thought I should put it up here for posterity.

The John and Hank Show runs from around 0:17:35 to 1:35:41, and the fans start taking over the feed after 2:24:00. All together, the video is 5:21:15 long.
