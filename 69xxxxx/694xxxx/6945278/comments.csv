It deals with the idea, that some real people could get immoratlity by means of controlling the time periods inside the special lab-city called ""Vechnost"". They look like people but they are trained to work for Vechnost forever, as a part of its mechanism. They correct time holes,help people from other time to solve their problems by means of special mind- operating system.

Everyone from Vechnost is immortal and they live in a very futuristic looking like place in the center of time , but some periods of time blocked from them, so two engineers are sent to solve the problem.

As soon as The main character falls in love the operation goes wrong-this causes the destruction of the lab by people from some other time.

The woman turns out to be fake-love, a spy, who was sent to disorganize Vechnost .

Very moody and hypnotic film. I liked it more than ""Solaris"""
