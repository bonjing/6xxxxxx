The book was made into a movie entitled Konets Vechnosti (USSR, 1987). It broadly follows the novel, with the notable exception of the ending. The novel ends with NoÃ¿s and Harlan mutually deciding that Eternity's suppression of spaceflight was not in the interest of humankind and then living "happily ever after". The Soviet-era film, however, ends very differently. The ending takes place in the mid-1980's Germany rather than 1932 Los Angeles, with NoÃ¿s never fully describing why she wants Eternity destroyed. Harlan yells at her that he was but a pawn in things, storms off, and there is a strong implication that he and NoÃ¿s would not have any further contact. Following that, a scene shows Harlan observing both Twissell and Finge in 1980's clothing getting out of a Rolls Royce and walking together. The clear implication is that Twissel and Finge were using Harlan as a pawn to further their own materialistic gains. While out of step with the rest of the film as well as the novel, the ending does follow the Soviet concept that the "everyman" (Harlan) is frequently manipulated by the bourgeoisie as a pawn to the bourgeoisie's own ends. The movie ends with a long shot of Harlan walking away from the camera, alone, down a highway.
