The adventure starts off as a coming-of-age story for a teenager, Randolph P. McDuff, as he escapes his city life and seeks to start over in the west. On his journey, he meets fellow travelers Romeo Jones, Louis Clark Jefferson, the cranky wagon master Bumpy Schmitts, his daughter Onery Sue, and the rootin' tooin' cowgirl Subliminy Jane. These band of misfits then go off on an adventure to hunt down the legendary treasure "El Glitterado."
