This show seems to be by the same creators as the 2011 documentary called Jig.
They contain the same people and have the same story line but TLC is supposed
to be airing 8 parts of this series which would end up with a much longer
total runtime than the original movie alone; therefore, there must be some
new material.  Enjoy!
