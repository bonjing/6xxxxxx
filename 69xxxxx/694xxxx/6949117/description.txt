 In the 1960's at Arthur Kingston's old butcher house blood and guts were
 routine. That all changed one night when the blood spilled was human. At the
 hand of a murderous, rampaging butcher, two workers and the owner's son were
 killed. The factory was shut down. Decades pass. The massacre became a legend,
 but the abandoned butcher house still held the evil in its halls. As six
 teenagers explore the old butcher house, they unleash the horror that lies
 within.
