
Scrawl v1.1 MacOSX Retail-CORE

the world's simplest and most easy-to-use note taking application ever. It is always sitting in the menu bar for easy access whenever you need it, and it syncs your notes across all of your Macs with iCloud.



iCloud Support
Scrawl has been designed for iCloud so that it will save and sync your notes across all of your Macs. For example: if you add a note to Scrawl on your MacBook, it is automatically synced and added to your iMac. No setup necessary.

The Interface
The interface is important for any app, and Scrawl takes it to the next level. Not only is it easy to access and use, but it also looks extremely slick and clean - something many note taking apps lack. Scrawl can handle an unlimited amount of notes as well.

An Amazingly Simple Text Viewer & Editor
Scrawl makes everything simple, including the text editor. To create a new note, simply click on the + button. Scrawl will then open the text editor. Just type, and Scrawl auto-saves the note. To view a full note, just double-click on it. You will be able to see the date it was last edited on by looking at the date in the bottom-left corner. If you make any changes, the date will automatically change.

Note Taking That Makes Sense
These days, note taking managers such as Evernote, Todo, and Things are just too complicated. They assume that the user knows how to set everything up, and that they understand how to get everything synced between their Macs. Scrawl understands that the user just wants to jot down a note, and then forget about it until they read the note again

A Few of Scrawl's Features:
- Scrawl autosaves notes.
- Search the each note's content, as well as the title.
- Srawl is in the menubar for easy access.
- Includes a beautiful interface based off of QuickLook.
- Right-click on the menubar icon to view all of the app's settings.
- Change the size & texture of the window easily in the Preferences.
- Optionally open at login.
- And much more!

Use Scrawl For:
- A simple note taking tool.
- A great place to store stuff you want to copy, and then later paste.
- A password manager.
- A contacts list.
- And many more things!

To the \\\"United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users\\\",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intentionally 
posting fake comments & files. Their meaning is just trying to spread 
confusion and to frustrate TPB and it\\\'s users. 
Less downloaders = less seeders = less download speed etc = not good! 

It\\\'s in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intentionally keep posting fake comments & files. It\\\'s an easy answer against 
those who intentionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That\\\'s for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let\\\'s just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what\\\'s said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the \\\"United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users\\\"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
