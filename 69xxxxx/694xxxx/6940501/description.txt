This is a collection of 11 Klaus Schulze concert bootlegs I've acquired over the past several years from various P2P sites.  Since many of these are hard to find, I decided to roll them all into one torrent and upload for your enjoyment. If you are a Klaus Schulze fan, you won't want to be without this collection!

Here's a list of the contents:

Berlin SFB Radio 1976
Black Forest 1981 (3 CD)

All files are mp3, and most are fairly high quality. I didn't rip any of these, so a big thanks to all the individuals who have shared these in the past.  

Enjoy, and don't forget to seed!
