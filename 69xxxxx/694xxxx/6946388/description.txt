
Well I hate to point fingers at hard working sharers, but the
Made In America posts here at TPB are a disaster as far as
accuracy.  They show episode 12 missing but in fact, all the
episodes from 6 on up are misnumbered.  Example:

Made.In.America.2011.S01E06.Jack.Daniels.Zero.Motorcycle.and.New Balance.HDTV.XviD-CRiMSON

That's actually episode 7 according to the IMDB:
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2081801/episodes

And in my opinion, they should be named in the order the
segments appear in the episode even though the IMBD doesn't do
it that way.  In this case it would be:

New Balance, Jack Daniels, Zero Motocycle

So anyway, they're all numbered wrong up to episode 10 which is
the last one I can find shared here, and it's an even worse
disaster.  Whoever started it shared the sample and the text
file but forgot to include the actual episode!  Oh well :)
These guys work hard and share a LOT of stuff and I'm not
slamming them, just stating a few facts to help the collectors
get things straight.  Such as, it's La-Z-Boy, not Lazy Boy.
Heck, even the IMDB has Ghirardelli spelled wrong.

OK, enough griping.  I'm trying to get this set straightened
out, that's all.  For starters I renamed every one I had, both
to show the correct episode number as well as to fix typos and
shorten the insanely long original filenames.  I replaced . with
spaces.because.this.fucking.nonsense.drives.me.batshit.and.I
can't see the purpose of it.  I'm not saying there isn't a
purpose in doing it, just that I can't see one.
