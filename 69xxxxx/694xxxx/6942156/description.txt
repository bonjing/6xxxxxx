The Alex Jones Show
Sunday, 08 January 2012


[sebaygo1]


The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events.

The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.

On the Sunday, January 8 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks about the rapidly escalating situation in the Persian Gulf as Iran declares it will block the vital waterway if the European Union decides to embargo its oil and the U.S. and Britain steam warships to the area for a confrontation. Jesse Ventura responds from Mexico to the smear campaign and lies designed to destroy his reputation. Alex also talks about the GOP debate last night and Ron Paul's performance.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
