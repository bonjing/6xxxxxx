  aka "Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn"                                             
                                                                              
  A sequel/remake of the film The Evil Dead. A young man named Ash takes      
  his girlfriend Linda to a secluded cabin, and plays back a professor's      
  tape recorded recitation of passages from the Book of the Dead. The spell   
  calls up an evil force from the woods which turns Linda into a monstrous    
  Deadite, and threatens to do the same to Ash. When the professor's          
  daughter and her entourage show up at the cabin, the night turns into a     
  non-stop, grotesquely comic battle with chainsaw and shotgun on one side,   
  demon horde and flying eyeball on the other.
