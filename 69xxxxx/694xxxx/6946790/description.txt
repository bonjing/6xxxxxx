Review
"With a lovely layout and careful, consistent use of vivid colors, the new Evergreen appeals to the current generation of students who are primarily visual learners and need visual learning cues and strategies in order to be effective learners. I was really impressed by the thoughtfulness that went into creating the new layout and the creative use of color in the design."
"The additional essay examples are a big help...It makes a difference to see a mode demonstrated in more than one way..."
