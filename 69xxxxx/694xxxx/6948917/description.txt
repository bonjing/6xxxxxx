                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Mark Chapman narrates an exploration of Britain's complicated relationship    
 with alcohol during the latter half of the 20th century. The programme charts 
 how conventions surrounding the drinking habits of men and women changed from 
 the 1940s onwards, as the largely masculine culture of pubs and working men's 
 clubs began to recede, and also discovers the influence foreign travel and    
 advertising had on the types of beverage that were popular in the UK.
         
                                 Enjoy!
