Some of you will recognize the track "Super Educated" from one of Primo's mixtapes, but not know much about the artist who created it. Don't sleep on Arcee no more, even though he hasn't put out any new music for a while. This blended mixtape/mini-album is from 2003 and mixed (with expert skill) by DMC champ DJ Lil' Jaz. Jake One handles production on 4 of the tracks. Fiyah.
