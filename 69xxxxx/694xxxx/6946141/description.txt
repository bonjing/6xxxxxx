It being the season of goodwill and bad jumpers, it is time to relive the best moments
from a number of snowy Christmases that came to the NBC Studios in California between
1962 and 1974 for Andy Williams's annual yuletide songfest. With guest appearances from
the Osmond Brothers and the Williams Family.
