 Like any other entry in Rhino's Complete Greatest Hits series, Foreigner's Complete Greatest Hits does contain all the group's charting hits, from "Feels Like the First Time" to "Say You Will." This makes it more comprehensive than almost any of the other Foreigner compilations -- yes, the double-disc Jukebox Heroes has more material, yet this is concise in its completeness. This doesn't capture their peak as well as Records, but it does cover more ground, which means it has "I Want to Know What Love Is" and "Say You Will," among other late-'80s hits. Yes, it doesn't have "Midnight Blue," unlike Jukebox Heroes, but that is, after all, a Lou Gramm solo hit. If you're looking for all of the hits by Foreigner proper, this is indeed the way to go, since it has all of them on one disc, with nice sound and packaging -- just like  the Complete Greatest Hits series promises. -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine
