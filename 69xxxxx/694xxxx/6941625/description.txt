Perhaps Lynyrd Skynyrd's most underrated album, 1976's Gimme Back My Bullets was another inspired and consistent set from one of Southern rock's founding fathers. Like its predecessor, Nuthin' Fancy, Skynyrd's fourth release didn't produce a hit single like its first couple of albums had, but there were several songs that subsequently became standards for the band. Highlights include the album-opening title track, which captures Skynyrd at their toughest, powered on by muscular guitar riffing courtesy of Gary Rossington and the late Allen Collins, as well as "Searching," the latter being included later in the year on One More From The Road.
