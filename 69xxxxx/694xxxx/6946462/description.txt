Too Much Too Young: Children of the Middle Ages

History Documentary hosted by Dr Stephen Baxter, published by BBC in 2011 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Medievalist Dr Stephen Baxter takes a fresh look at the Middle Ages through the eyes of children. At a time when half the population was under 18, he argues that although they had to grow up quickly and take on adult responsibility early, the experience of childhood could also be richly rewarding. Focusing on the three pillars of medieval society - religion, war and work - Baxter reveals how children played a vital role in creating the medieval world.
