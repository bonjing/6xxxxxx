Our sixth album of deep and mysterious longform ambient music.
A continuous, 50 minute piece split into six parts.

Though slowly evolving and spacious, this is probably the brightest sounding so far.
Play it quietly in the background or put on your headphones and emerse yourself in the music.

The music is generative: 
each note is played in a long loop, the length of each loop if different for each note, so although the music may seem to vary only slightly, it never quite repeats itself.

Again, the songs titles are named after Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) - small planetoids and other objects in our solar system whose orbits are on average greater than that of Neptune.
These objects are in turn named after characters from Greek and Pacific island mythology.
