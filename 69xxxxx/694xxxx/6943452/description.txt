Practice Anatomy Labâ„¢ (PALâ„¢) 3.0 is an indispensable virtual anatomy study and practice tool that gives you 24/7 access to the most widely used lab specimens, including human cadaver, anatomical models, histology, cat, and fetal pig. 

PAL 3.0 features a whole new Interactive Cadaver Module that allows you to peel back layers of the human cadaver (from superficial to deep layers) and view hundreds of brand new dissection photographs specially commissioned for version 3.0. It also features a new Interactive Histology Module that allows you to view the same tissue slide at different magnifications, thereby helping you identify structures and their characteristics. You will get more opportunity to practice via the new question randomization feature (whereby each time you retake a quiz or lab practical a new set of questions is generated). PAL 3.0 retains all of the key advantages of version 2.0 including the simplicity and ease-of-use and simulated fill-in-the-blank lab practicals. 
 
PAL 3.0 is available online in the Study Area of Mastering A&P;, however here is the full DVD version so you can use it on your laptop or home computer.

Enjoy!
