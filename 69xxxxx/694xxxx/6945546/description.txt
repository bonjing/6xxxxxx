Description

Plot: A young rock and roll band heads into the forest to focus their creative energies and work on the songs for their next album. But when things donâ€™t go according to plan, a series of murders unfolds and reshapes the music in ways they never might have expected. Vincent Dâ€™Onofrioâ€™s DONâ€™T GO INTO THE WOODS is a slasher movie with a twist; itâ€™s also a compelling rock and roll musical featuring songs by Sam Bisbee. DONâ€™T GO INTO THE WOODS explores the dark side of the creative process with plenty of frights.
