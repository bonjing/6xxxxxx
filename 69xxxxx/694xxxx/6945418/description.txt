When the beautiful Julianne Moore discovers as have many an American woman along the way (no doubt) that her husband's pent up frustrations and abusive outbursts and demeanor are the result of being a closet homosexual who is only just "found 
out" she turns to the most unlikely source of comfort - a black man who presents
as an "only recently emancipated slave" as tempers on the matter run high in this
small town it seems.

Incredulously even this source of comfort turns out to be slow to recognize
her pain in any way as to bring her relief. Instead the man she turns o seems
to play "hard to get" stringing her along for all the signs she gives full
acceptance and brings the community along, before it could be considered safe
to take her up on her obvious forward advances that are sexually aggressive
in her articulation with him.

Its sad that when movies that look at the American cultural mosaic as presently
constituted ignore the great men of Europe who at present are in the 
millions in South American countries (Spanish men that is). My brother in 
law is from Chile and I have never met a man who is kinder and more decent and
caring to the Irish spirit  having been welcomed rightly - that it is a terrible
situation that can only be corrected by using education to eliminate bigotry
against the human spirit coming into its own where people can give each other 
the righter kind of care that almost all are yet yearning for down there.
