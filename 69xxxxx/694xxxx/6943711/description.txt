The Sword of Etheria, released in Japan as OZ (OZ -ã‚ªã‚º- Ozu?) and in Korea as Chains of Power, is a Beat Em\\\' Up/Action Adventure video game for the PlayStation 2 by Konami, developed by the same team who created Suikoden III and most of the Castlevania games. It was released on June 30th, 2005 in Japan and on February 24th, 2006 in Europe. It was also re-released as a Konami Best Hit in Japan on January 26th, 2006. Unfortunately, the game has never been released in North America.

The game\\\'s Japanese title OZ, literally means Over Zenith which is shown in the opening sequence of the Japanese version. Its definition of \\\"Surpassing the Peak\\\" also explains the words Over Zenith that appears when the Tension gauge is maxed out (see Gameplay). On the other hand, OZ is also used to refer the group comprising the three greatest \\\"Katenas\\\" (term is used in all versions of the game).

Gameplay

In The Sword of Etheria the player controls Fiel as the protagonist where he will be partnered by Almira and Leon, who are both AI-controlled characters but each given their own individual HP gauge. The Sword of Etheria offers a new distinct battle system to the Beat \\\'em up genre which is a real-time gameplay where the player will perform a launch attack on enemies which bashes them into the air and multi-hit aerial combos could be performed whilst the enemy is in thin-air as if juggling them in the air. With the assistance of both Almira and Leon, stronger and better combos could be performed.

A \\\'Tension\\\' gauge will be shown in right part of the screen which will be indicating the player\\\'s performance with combos. It increases by chaining aerial combos and decreases if a large delay gap is present in-between attacks. In addition to this, a \\\'Deathblow\\\' could be performed altogether by Fiel, Almira and Leon as a final blow to multiple enemies when a \\\'hint\\\' displays on the screen. As the game progresses, the Tension gauge will level up and will be longer, thus given the ability to use more powerful Deathblows. If the gauge rises to Level 3, maxing out the gauge will display \\\"Over Zenith\\\" which is also the name of the strongest Deathblow that could be performed.

The Sword of Etheria focuses deeply in its battle system and story which is divided by Chapters and presents anime looking characters. Stages vary from typical forests fields, villages to different kinds of dungeons.

A special bonus chapter is playable when certain requirements are met. In that chapter, the three main characters portrays some of the The Wonderful Wizard of Oz characters but neglects storyline. Fiel as Tin Man, Almira as Scarecrow and Leon as Lion.

OZ also included a feature which enables changing the characters\\\' costume. These costumes that can be bought in-game are from various games made by Konami which includes Suikoden III, Castlevania: Lament of Innocence and Silent Hill 3[2].
