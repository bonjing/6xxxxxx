If you're a true WWE fan then you would know King of the Ring didnt start in 1993 
but was rather a one night tournament back on house shows back in the late 80's 
up until 91. They even had the gimmick on tv back in the 80's as Harley Race, Jim 
Duggan, Haku, and Randy Savage all held the crown. This was the 80's and WWF had 
the talent to spare plus they had good storylines that made sense. Anyways, King 
of The Ring was always one of my favorite WWF PPV's. Granted, 1995 King of the 
Ring was one of the worst PPV's of all time. There is too many repeats on this 
set that could have been avoided, but Mankind-Undertaker Hell in the Cell and 
Angle-McMahon Street Fight are two of the best matches you'll ever see so I 
understand putting that on another disc. However, King of The Ring 1994 had one 
of the greatest 3 minute matches you'll ever witness, Owen Hart VS 1-2-3 Kid. 
If you've never watched it, go out and do so. The opening contest of that PPV, 
Ramon vs Bigelow, was pretty damn good as well. The Diesel VS Bret Hart match on 
the same PPV was pretty great as well. All in all, i'm a fan of the WWF I grew 
up on. The 90's may have not been the cool time to watch WWF but alot of those 
matches and storylines beats out anything the WWE is putting out today. I wish 
they focused more on earlier King of The Rings rather then random matches on the 
PPV. I think they should have just put out the entire King of The Ring PPV set 
rather then this decent but could have been so much better set.
