Believe in a cover-up? Don't believe in any phenomena?  Try the Following:

GOOGLE this "UFO site:.gov" (without quotes) Using this search string you will find every Google cached .gov website that contains "ufo".  Use the

too try.


All the important docs are contained within the first few pages of results. Some are hard to read and some have been redacted - a lot. But the information 

contain inside can be pieced together to paint the broader picture that was actually painted very long ago. UFOs, EBEs, whatever you want to call the 

phenomena, presents NO threat to National Security. 

As a service to the community Believers and Skeptics, I have downloaded and collected all the DOCS I have came across (will update, if needed). 

Please, take your time, on a nice day to read and skim through these Govt Docs. Not one of these documents came from a public domain, none have been 

produced or touched by anyone but the United States Government.

The collection may be obtained directly from my site, USENET, or p2p, the info is below:
