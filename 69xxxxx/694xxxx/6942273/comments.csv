 - 2 days ago: Why is this [meaning 'DVDSCR DOCUMENT' 350.00mb] now listed as episode 0... Isn't it the same as the one that aired on the 9th?

 - 2 days ago: it's [meaning 'ASAP' 232mb] almost the same as the 1st episode, but with a slight delay. I have uploaded the HDTV version as well.

Make of it what you will, just thought i'd pass it along in case you hadn't yet found better info. "
