
The advanced book/DVD package has been created to provide contemporary drummers with a method for studying and developing the technical and musical skills required to perform todayâ€™s challenging, progressive drumming styles.

Rhythmic Designs expands on the groundbreaking polyrhythmic, polymetric concepts covered in Harrisonâ€™s previously published Rhythmic Illusions, Rhythmic Visions and Rhythmic Horizons books and videos by offering detailed analysis and transcriptions of twenty drum tracks from the recent Gavin Harrison & 05Ric albums â€œDropâ€ and â€œCirclesâ€ (featuring guitarist Robert Fripp and keyboardists Dave Stewart and Gary Sanctuary). Along with the 204-page book of note-for-note transcriptions and practice exercises, the double-sided companion DVD features more than two-and-a-half hours of video packed with descriptions and discussions of the drum parts, set-ups, tuning and recording processâ€”plus six minus-drums, play-along tracks.
