                Silent Scream. Part 1.
                New three-part crime drama by Lynda La Plante. Film
                star Amanda Delany has the world at her feet. The
                tabloids cannot get enough of her and she in turn
                cannot get enough of the spotlight. Then, when she
                arrives home late one evening from a night shoot,
                Amanda puts the key in her front door for the last
                time. The next morning, the press gathers on her
                doorstep - but this time the journalists are
                reporting on her brutal murder. DI Anna Travis is
                shocked by what she finds out about the actress -
                especially the truth behind Amanda's glamorous public
                image. For all her fame and fortune, it seems Amanda
                Delany was lonely, damaged and afraid. Can the team
                work out whether jealous friends, jilted lovers or
                scorned wives were capable of her murder?
