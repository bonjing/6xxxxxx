   Sam and Molly are a very happy couple and                  
   deeply in love. Walking back to their new                  
   apartment after a night out at the theatre,                
   they encounter a thief in a dark alley, and                
   Sam is murdered. He finds himself trapped                  
   as a ghost and realises that his death was                 
   no accident. He must warn Molly about the                  
   danger that she is in. But as a ghost he can               
   not be seen or heard by the living, and so he              
   tries to communicate with Molly through                    
   Oda Mae Brown, a psychic who didn't even                   
   realise that her powers were real.
