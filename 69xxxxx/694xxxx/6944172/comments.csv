[V],.BONE.,2012-01-10T21:18Z,dont know what went wrong there it should be just Pirate_Mysteries_1.04.apk
blet is rooted and has version DG 2.22.0. The file Pirate_Mysteries_1.04.apk.apk-001 shows ""unknown"" when installed on a SD card. If I remove the .apk-001 from the file name the Ap tries to install but fails. Am I doing something wrong?  I am new to the android tablets."
