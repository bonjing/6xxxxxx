First of all this is a beta release but it's pretty much stable.

How to play Call Of Duty Black Ops online:

[RUN EVERYTHING AS ADMINISTRATOR]

1- copy alterops.exe and DBNetwork.IndigoSxS.dll to your game directory.

2-open alterops.exe and login using your alteriw account.



TROUBLE UPDATING THE GAME?
 delete cachesSxS.xml on your black ops folder.

then run the updater again and wait, it may not pop up right after you clicked because it may be updating itself.
so be patient.

OPTIONAL - register at(if you haven't already) in order to play the game.

NICKNAME:
your account's nickname will be your game nickname so choose wisely, you can also change it through
console (use \ to bring it up) using the following command "/toggle name YourNameHere".


UPDATES:
go to alterops.net to further updates.


INFO ABOUT SERVERS: 


-DWKEY.DAT is used only if you want to set up a server, it's the online licence used by alterops 
to certificate your own server.



HOW TO HOST A SERVER [took from here:

    Make sure you have BO and alterOps updated.
    Request a key on http://alterops.net/
    Press download dwkey.dat and save it to your BO folder
    The key on the first line is sv_licensenum 0, so use that in your commandline
    Run BlackOpsMP.exe +set dedicated 1 +set sv_licensenum 0 +exec server.cfg +map mp_nuked


LOW FPS/ STRUTTERING this is mostly treyarch's devs fault but:

-you can try some changings like
turning on the "Shader Warming", which pre-chaches all the shaders so you get a less struttering,
but you may get a increased loading time.

-you can also turn off the shadows which may be the most gpu intensive feature.

-and try to change the multithread use of the game, by going to Call of Duty - Black Ops\players\config_mp.cfg,
and search for Â«seta r_multithreaded_device "0"Â» and set it to 1.
