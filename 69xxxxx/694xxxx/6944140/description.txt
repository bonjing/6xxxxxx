July 22, 1934 - outside Chicago's Biograph Theater,
a barrage of FBI bullets brings down John Dillinger.
As the body of Public Enemy Number one crumbles to
the ground, one of the strangest, most riveting
stories in the history of crime begins to unfold.
It seems that J. Edgar Hoover's boys have unknowingly
blown away the wrong Dillinger -- not John, but his
brother. While G-Men are grabbing the headlines, the
real Dillinger slips away to go straight with a new
life. But "Scarface" Al Capone knows all about
Dillinger and his secret new identity, and confronts him.
He wants Dillinger to pull one more heist, a bank where
Capone has millions stashed away. And he's got an offer
Dillinger can't refuse. So now, five years after his
death, with Chicago's most infamous mobster holding
his wife and son for insurance, John Dillinger has to
pull off the biggest bank job of all time.
