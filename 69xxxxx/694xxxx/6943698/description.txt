File Recovery Tips
File recovery utilities take advantage of the fact that the actions performed when emptying the Windows Recycle Bin are reversible.

When a file is deleted, the operating system only changes the attribute of the space used by the file from an "occupied" status to an "available" status. The fileÂ´s information is hidden until it can be unlocked by a recovery utility. It is a good idea to avoid writing files to the affected drive partition to steer clear of writing over data that you wish to recover. Learn more>>
