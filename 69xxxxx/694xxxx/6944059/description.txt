the aspect ratio is wrong in the last 8 episodes and should be 16:9 (or there abouts) - you can change this in VLC by right clicking under aspect ratio.

After filming completed on the 2009 series, Henriksson stated that he would not play Wallander again, having only signed the new contract because he thought the 2005 series could have been better.[19] However, he has since suggested he would be interested in playing the role in an adaptation of the final Wallander novel, The Troubled Man, because "it is the definite end".[20]
