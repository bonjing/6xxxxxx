This is a real-time and interactive version of "Pipe Dream", a music animation from the first Animusic DVD. It is originally an ATI graphics demo to demonstrate the Radeon 9700's abilities, but it also works on NVidia cards (Geforce 5 and higher).


Additional Info & Tips:

This is a Tweaked version: It doesn't display the logos while the demo is running and it runs in Developer Mode (more functions, see the ReadMe for Shortcut Keys)

Before you run the demo, change the resolution, multisampletype and quality by editing Sushi.ini - You can force the Aspect Ratio and the Refresh Rate by removing the slashes and modify the values.
If you get an D3DAw Error, try to lower or disable the multisample settings. 

Run without loading screen:
Create a shortcut to PipeDream.exe and add the parameter -noloading
Example: "PipeDream Directory\PipeDream.exe" -noloading
