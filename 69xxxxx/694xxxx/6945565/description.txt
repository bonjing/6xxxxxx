  Nancy Nestor (Wendie Malik) sees herself as the perfect wife and mother,  
  and now that her teenage genius son Hal (Justin Long) has been named      
  high school valedictorian, her own moment of public glory is close at     
  hand. Unfortunately, it's been over three months since Hal locked         
  himself in an upstairs bathroom to work out the mathematical equations    
  in his head while also watching the cheerleader next door (Danica         
  McKellar) bounce on a trampoline. To Nancy's dismay, no amount of         
  threatening or coaxing seems to have any effect on Hal. Noted             
  psychologist Dr. Curly Weeks (Ed Begley Jr.) comes to her aid to develop  
  a program that just might get her obsessive-compulsive son out of the     
  bathroom and onto the graduation podium.

  Ripped from the Allumination DVD (in English without any subtitles).      
                                                                            
  The only extras on the disc consisted of trailer spam for Allumination    
  releases--Ghosts Never Sleep (2005), Lost (2004), Mafia Doctor (2003),    
  One Last Ride (2005), Raising Genius (2004)--all of which are available   
  online already (the trailers that is), so I did not rip them.
