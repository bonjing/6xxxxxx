Gerry Mulligan - The Gerry Mulligan Quartet With Chet Baker  
Label: Giants of Jazz
Released: 1966
Format: 320kbps CBR

Though Mulligan is primarily known as one of the leading baritone saxophonists in jazz history - playing the instrument with a light and airy tone in the era of cool jazz - he was also a notable arranger, working with Claude Thornhill, Miles Davis, Stan Kenton, and others. Mulligan's piano less quartet of the early 1950s with trumpeter Chet Baker is still regarded as one of the more important cool jazz groups.
