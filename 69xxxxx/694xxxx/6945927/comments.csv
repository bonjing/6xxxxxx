I was wondering if you could try your expertise on a couple books... 

Nolte, J, The Human Brain: An Introduction to its Functional Anatomy, 6th Ed.

Moore, K.L. and Persaud, T.V.N., The Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology, Saunders/Elsevier, 8th Ed

Gartner, L.P. and Hiatt, J.L., Color Textbook of Histology, 3rd Ed., Elsevier (Saunders)

Grays Anatomy for Students and The Grays Atlas and also Grant's Dissector

Sorry for so many but this is just a fraction of what I have actually purchased. 

The editions really don't matter just whatever comes about. Thanks a million!"
