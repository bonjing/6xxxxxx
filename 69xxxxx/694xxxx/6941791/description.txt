Masive 5.95 GB Collection Of MonsterHunt Files Mods Maps Sounds Textures Music

Save you loads of hours of ingame downloads i play all the new games but just cant 

leave this one it never gets old it changes all the time theres loads of servers

and people still playing what have you got to lose :)


Unpack then full instal from the Unreal Tournament folder

Then run UTPatch436 and instal then same to 451 then to 451b patch

Then unpack the backup files to the folder you instaled Unreal Tournament 

Then instal UTCacheCleaner3 it moves ingame downloads to the proper place after playing

utregfix is only needed if you have problems with the registery or instaling umods

The only problems you may get with the backup files is in game file version mismatches
its because people change file contents with out changing the names some times
all you have to do to get on the server you want is to remember the file name
go to your UT instal directory search for the offending file and remove it
then reconect to the server 99% of them will be in C:\\\\UnrealTournament\\\\System

Thats it go kill some monsters :)
