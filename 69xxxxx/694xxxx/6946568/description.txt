NOTES
============
Two pieces of good news:

First of all, PonyArchive is reborn! 
http://yayponies.eu

So far they only have 700 MB raw rips for download.  However, following a discussion I had on PonyChat, it looks like they plan to make more MKVs like this one and the others from the late PA.

Secondly, also discussed in that chat session, iTunes is re-releasing Season 1 -- fixes for colours and other quirks about the original iTunes downloads are expected.  YayPonies might not even NEED to colour-correct the new iTunes files.  Compare both here:

This MKV file was retrieved from WuploadSearch.com (yay Google!).  Apparently, someone named "ZR" created this remux.  Much obliged, whoever you are.

**MKV files are compatible with media players such as MPlayer, VLC, ALLPlayer, foobar2000 and PowerDVD.  For other compatibility, try installing The Combined Community Codec Pack, or consult the website of your preferred media player.

PLEASE SEED LIKE CRAZY (upload at least 20% more than what you download... that is, um, if you don't mind...)  I expect to compile a torrent of the first half of season 2, and another for the full season as the episodes come out; until then, I will continue to seed this and other single-video torrents that need it.

Enjoy your ponies, and don't forget to support the show and its community!  :D
