When Checkmate fails to bring the rogue metahuman O.M.A.C. under control, they call in S.H.A.D.E.'s best agent, Frankenstein! It's all-out monster mayhem as O.M.A.C. and Frank battle in the streets of Metropolis. But what is Brother Eye's real goal? It's up to Father Time and Ray Palmer to find out! Continued from this month's O.M.A.C. #5!
