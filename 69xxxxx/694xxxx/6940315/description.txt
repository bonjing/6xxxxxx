The Ecstasy of Auto-machines

by Norio Nishiiima

Takashi Ito, Born in 1956 in Fukuoka, Japan.

Ito is one of the leading experimental filmmakers in Japan. He graduated from Art and Technology Department of Kyushu Institute of Design in 1983 during which he made a debut with the film SPACY in 1981 (Inagaki who created sound effects for the film was also a filmmaker and his classmate at the institute). He was rather a premature virtuoso.

SPACY is consisted of 700 continuous still photographs which are re-photographed frame by frame according to a strict rule where movements go from rectilinear motion to circular and parabola motion, then from horizontal to vertical.

The technique itself of reconstructing sequential photographs was already seen in the earlier Japanese experimental films during the 70s such as Ä€TMAN (1975) by Toshio Matsumoto (he was Ito\'s teacher at Kyushu Institute of Design) and DUTCH PHOTOS (Orandajin no Shashin,1976) by Isao Kota whose influence is apparent in Ito\'s works. However, one finds Ito\'s style more complex and sophisticated, and utterly new.

 For example, in Ä€TMAN the subject is a human being disguised with Japanese Noh-mask whereas in SPACY the subject is photograph itself. This, together with the last shot where the camera and the filmmaker (self-portrait) come into the same frame indicates the self-reflexive characteristic of his work. Compared to the two-dimensional \"flip-book\" style illusion of DUTCH PHOTOS, SPACY has vast spaciousness and dramatic sensation of movement and when it\'s accompanied by the sound, the film reveals the side of a fantastic film.

 \"Film is capable of presenting unrealistic world as a vivid reality and creating a strange space peculiar to the media. My major intention is to change the ordinary every day life scenes and draw the audience (myself) into a vortex of supernatural illusion by exercising the magic of films.\" (Takashi Ito, in Image Forum, Oct.1984)

 We were also enchanted with the fast speed of \"automatic\" camera as if it was computerized. The ecstasy of auto-machines which move beyond man\'s logic and sensation. And the filmmaker\'s desire to \"get into\" the film instead of possessing it. This ecstasy and the desire are common to all of his films including sequential photograph works as well as his other series such as THUNDER (1982) GHOST (1984) and, GRIM (1985) which are occult experimental \"horror\" films featuring the technique of bulb shutters and time-lapse photography. In his most recent works THE MOON (1994) and ZONE ( 1995), two styles are integrated under the motif of \"dreams and memories\".
