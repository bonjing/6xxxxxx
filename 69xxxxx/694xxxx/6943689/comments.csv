Mainly reference/inspiration for some of the guys working with 3D, but really it's as much for anyone simply collecting images over the internet.

So: Animals = pictures of animals.
Porn = nude women.
Weapons = pictures of weapons/armor, armored vehicles.
Drawings = regular art, fan-art and concept art. Mainly sci-fi/fantasy art.

It's pretty much just here for the people that already know about it, not so much for random people just browsing the web. But now you know!"
