[b]TVO - The Agenda with Steve Paikin, January 4 2012: It's the End of the World[/b]

The Mayans told us 2012 was the end. Movies and books are picking up on that same theme. Why are prophecies of doom so prevalent in today's world?

[u]The End of the World[/u]

We see it in blockbuster movies like "2012" and "Contagion." We read about it in books penned by environmentalists and existentialists: the apocalypse is upon us. The Agenda examines why prophecies of doom are so prevalent and what the phenomenon says about the human condition.
