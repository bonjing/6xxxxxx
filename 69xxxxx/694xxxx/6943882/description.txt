   RELEASE NOTES     
                                                 
                                                                     
   With this sequel to his prize-winning independent previous film,  
   "El Mariachi," director Robert Rodriquez joins the ranks of Sam   
   Peckinpah and John Woo as a master of slick, glamorized ultra-    
   violence. We pick up the story as a continuation of "El           
   Mariachi," where an itinerant musician, looking for work, gets    
   mistaken for a hitman and thereby entangled in a web of love,     
   corruption, and death. This time, he is out to avenge the murder  
   of his lover and the maiming of his fretting hand, which          
   occurred at the end of the earlier movie. However,  the plot is   
   recapitulated, and again, a case of mistaken identity leads to a  
   very high body count, involvement with a beautiful woman who      
   works for the local drug lord, and finally, the inevitable face   
   -to-face confrontation and bloody showdown.
