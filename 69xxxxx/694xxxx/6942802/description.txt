Hungry Beast (originally Projext NEXT) is an Australian television program, that was broadcast on Wednesday nights on ABC1 and repeated on 
Thursday nights on ABC2. It is produced by Andrew Denton's production company, Zapruder's Other Films. The show is a half-hour program and is
structured as a hybrid between a current affairs program and a satire/comedy show. The presenters were initially given a single editorial
instruction: "Tell me something I don't know". Rather than having a strict format, the show was started without a clear format in mind, with
the final shape evolving alongside the presentation team that had been assembled. As a result, prior to the show's debut executive producer
Andrew Denton described it as "unclassifiable" due to the chaotic nature of the work, likening the show's format to the Internet.
