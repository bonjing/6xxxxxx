in titles what each episode had in them..

no one seeds it hit and runs.. so this prob go the same way

its a shame.. as its a great series.. that mocks
famous and evil people in the world
and exposes the gov corruptions in aussie
and abroad..

i see they cancelled anymore seasons

this happens when you have a show like this
that exposes stupidity and corruption in the world :)"
