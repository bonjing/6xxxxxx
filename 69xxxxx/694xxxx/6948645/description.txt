This comprehensive text examines what it takes to progress toward - and ultimately become - an expert in physical therapy. It explores multiple dimensions of expertise: how expert practitioners develop, what knowledge they use, where they acquire that knowledge, how they think and reason, how they make decisions, and how they perform in practice to demonstrate what it takes to progress and ultimately become an expert in physical therapy.

    * Introduces the four core concepts that comprise the model of expertise: Knowledge, Clinical Reasoning, Movement, and Virtue
    * A Data Collection Tools Appendix provides a step-by-step description of the process that the authors used to select, interview, and collect data from the experts in each case study to demonstrates the use of critical thinking and research-based analysis

    * Contributed chapters on Expert Practice and Clinical Outcomes, Clinical Reasoning and Expert Practice, and Implications for Practice
    * Implications for Practice chapter covers the implementation and results of this model of expertise in a staff development program
    * A Postscript "The Voices of our Experts 10 Years Later" where clinicians share the evolution of their expertise
    * Two chapters on Inquiry into Expertise and Implications for Doctoral Level Education in Physical Therapy provide insights into the practical application of the core concepts of the physical therapy model of expertise and facilitate the continued development of expertise in physical therapy.
