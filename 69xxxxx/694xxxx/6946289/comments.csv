Direct link to the torrent:
https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6893601/The_Big_Bang_Theory_Season_5_Ep_1-11

Or just goto his/her profile page, it happens to be the only torrent uploaded but has positive comments and the torrent is +7 / -0 quality rated for what it's worth.

For whatever reason the download speeds aren't great for that torrent even with 400+ seeds (about 130-150kb/s) but it beats the hell out of this irritating 60kb/s for 0.1% increments followed by nothing for an hour."
