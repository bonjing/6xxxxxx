Through a misunderstanding, Annie receives an invitation for her and her spouse to join media mogul Terrance Bishop (Ronny Cox), at his New Mexico ranch to discuss her dream job: hosting a radio advice program. Fearful that being single will ruin her chance of a lifetime, Annie conspires with Mark Crane (David James Elliott), an old college friend, recent widower, and father of two teenagers, to pose as a married couple for the weekend. A series of comical misunderstandings color the trip, leaving Annie emotionally involved with MarkÃ¢Â€â„¢s family and battling with her own conscience. As the entertaining and touching story unfolds, Annie begins to realize that the truth may have its consequences, but ultimately itÃ¢Â€â„¢s what opens our hearts and brings out the best in each other.
