A mixtape by Slum Villageâ€™s Elzhi, WITNESS MY GROWTH escaped from the underground in the mid-`00s and was finally released â€œofficiallyâ€ in early 2009. The dynamic collection features solo stuff by the ever-opinionated rapper from his early days as an underground Detroit innovator up through the days he had taken over the production reins of his seminal trio from JayDee.
