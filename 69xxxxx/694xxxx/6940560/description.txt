DESCRIPTION:

The Global Bell Curve: Race, IQ, and Inequality Worldwide is a book by Professor Richard Lynn, published by Washington Summit Publishers, June 2008. 

As its title implies, it builds upon the best-selling 1994 book The Bell Curve, by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray, which presents extensive data suggesting that, in the United States, intelligence is a better predictor of socio-economic status (including earnings, employment, family size and involvement in crime) than are other commonly quoted factors.

The purpose of Professor Lynn in this book is examine how far this thesis holds for other multiracial societies.

It follows Lynn's 2006 book IQ and Global Inequality (with Tatu Vanhanen),and his other books on social inequalities and their causes.

While Lynn and Vanhanen (2006) focus on differences in the development and wealth of nations, The Global Bell Curve finds consistent evidence of race-based social hierarchies in its selected countries and regions.
