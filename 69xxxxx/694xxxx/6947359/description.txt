First of all let us say we're deeply disappointed with the rated traders on board this site. 
Not only did they not check out this site's source but also we dont think it even matters anymore to groups if there on rented sites or not! 

You think that this is a safe scene with groups and users of this calibre spread across the rented sites? Think again.

Here at sceneclean we aim to keep the scene exactly that! CLEAN. Delpurge these insecure n00bs and keep yourself safe!
