When I picked up this book and looked inside, I was immediately entranced. You get much the same effect when you pick up a book of quotations - every single small phrase or paragraph that you read is to the point and interesting or funny or remarkable. There\'s no waffle in a book of quotes, nor is there waffle in Gallagher\'s handbook. It\'s an idea book for someone with little time, or someone on the move (say, on a train to work). It gives you 101 ideas, mostly one page long but sometimes two, with so many diagrams that you don\'t need a board to follow the lines. Actually I should write Ideas, as they definitely deserve a capital letter!
