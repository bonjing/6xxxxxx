 Not sure if WarrLord is the original provider of this SCR, if not then 
 shame on you. Either way huge thanks to whoever actually got the source
 up first. Just stop leaking stuff ffs. Anyway we just did the usual    
 here, took the file and converted it whilst running a few filters and  
 our custom encode settings on it. Source had a small res so expect to  
 see a higher quality version from us when one becomes avaliable. Enjoy!
