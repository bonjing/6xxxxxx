â€œApril Mae & The June Bugs,â€ the bandâ€™s debut album, features original songwriting along with some very special reinterpretations of songs by such artists as Cab Calloway, Shel Silverstein and Eddie Cochran. The breadth of the bandâ€™s material reads like a recipe for American music gumbo; equal parts jump blues, rockabilly, swing and the spirit of New Orleans permeate their music along with a dose of vintage vibes added like Tabasco sauce.

Traveling and performing through the deep south, soaking up the sounds of roots music forms like bluegrass, delta blues, rockabilly and swing led April to seek out upright bassist JJ Culpepper to form the June Bugs. April Mae, lead vocalist, also plays washboard and percussion with the June Bugs. Dave â€œCatfishâ€ Fecca sizzles on cigar box guitar, electric guitar and banjo, while JJ Culpepperâ€™s rollicking, expressive bass lines provide the perfect balance between Aprilâ€™s hot-smoke-and-honey vocals and guitarist Catfishâ€™s gritty leads.

Reviewers are appreciating this group's eclectic, whimsical and refreshing style, here are a few:

"A solidly entertaining collection of American roots music!" 
~Tom Cullen, Contributing Editor Blues Revue/President, Bucks County Blues Society

April Mae & The June Bugs opened for Grammy Awards performer Imelda May in Philadelphia's Johnny Brendaâ€™s in June 2010 . Phillyist Associate Editor Allison Krumm declared;

â€œBetween headliner Imelda May and local trio April Mae and the June Bugs, Johnny Brenda's morphed into a rockabilly heaven fit for The King himself.â€
