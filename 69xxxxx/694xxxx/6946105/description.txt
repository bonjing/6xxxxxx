CloneCD is the perfect tool to make backup copies of your music and data CDs, regardless of standard conformity. CloneCD's award-winning user interface allows you to copy almost any CD in just a few mouse clicks.

Since the release of 5.0, CloneCD is not only able to copy CDs but also most DVD formats, such as DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+RW, DVD+R Dual Layer and DVD-RAM. The movies are copied 1:1 and therefore not modified (compressed). Note that to copy movie DVDs you also require AnyDVD.

CloneCD also works with other formats such as ISO and UDF files and copies CDs/DVDs. CloneCD allows you to create perfect 1:1 copies of your valuable original compact discs. Should your non Red Book standard music CD not play in your car audio, the backup created by CloneCD will.

SlySoft combine knowledge and innovation with many years of experience and direct communication with customers to provide constant improvements, therefore making CloneCD the highest quality copying application around.
