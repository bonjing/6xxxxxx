Plot:
 
Johnny English goes up against international assassins hunting down the Chinese premier.
 
Notes:
Preety poor for a bluray encode by themole if you ask me!! audio bitrate was low as well so bumped this up to 320 and kept the 6 channels so here is my attempt! take it or leave it
will do proper brrip when bluray source is out
