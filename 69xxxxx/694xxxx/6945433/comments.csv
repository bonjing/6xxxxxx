,noonereally101,2012-04-05T22:53Z,thanks for the upload and all but the 3D is horrible. I'm was not sure what the problem was but it seems  it was a converted 2D to 3D. 
nal hdd and use the tvs native video codecs. and the reason your hdds over 4 gb not being recognized is because it need to have a ntfs allocation. format your drives for ntfs and it will work. i have a 50pw350 lg tv, and i just tried it with a tb hdd. just watched resident evil afterlife sbs, and its almost 10 gb.
