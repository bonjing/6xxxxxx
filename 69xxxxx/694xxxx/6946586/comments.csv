I just thought, whoa, great that looks like I won't miss anything!

But I can understand why you did this, it's easier for you to organize, you have 3 torrents you don't need to update anymore and it may be cooler for those people that already have all the pulpvibe traxx and want to get only the lapfox ones, but...

The content is great, no doubt.. but the torrent descriptions are more confusing than a help for us, I know what they contain since I've spend a good amount of time going through all the folders of your torrent but for a newbie this might be a hell.. 
I don't want to criticize you all the time, somehow feel bad for doing so but ya know, I really love your work and just want it to be understood and used :]

so I thought of a solution myself instead of just criticizing:

Since you cannot edit the descriptions of your 4 torrents and I'm sure you don't want to reupload them my idea was it to make a updated version of this torrent which may have grown to a size of roundabout 9,75GB.. write a very informative description, people love that, in which you give some helpful information what it all contains just as you did in this torrent and add the information that there's also an alternative way to download several parts of it, write what these parts contain and give the links so people that were probably looking for lapfox releases and thought they might first checkout if this torrents could contain all they need will see that there's an easier way for them to get what they want without downloading a 9,75GB folder.
I really love writing and organizing stuff like that as you might see in my torrents from Rchetype http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7290606/Rchetype_All_Albums_%5BMP3_320%5D_%5Bv.1.1%5D 
so I could basically write those texts and do the whole organisation stuff if you want me to :)

However, just a suggestion ^^"
