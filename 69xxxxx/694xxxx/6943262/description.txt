      A nearly-suicidal, young woman visits a psychotherapist.       
      She is in love with a priest, and the diagnosis of her         
      husband's mental illness leaves no hope. The psychotherapist,  
      in her attempts to resolve the amassed difficulties, seemingly 
      begins to duplicate the life stages and behavioral patterns    
       of her patient. A script for this film is based on motifs from 
      the best-seller, scandalous novel, Witch and Rain, by female  
     author, Jurga Ivanauskaite.
