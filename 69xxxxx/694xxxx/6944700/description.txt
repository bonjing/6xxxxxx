Chemistry in Your Life, 2nd Edition

Chemistry in Your Life is designed for liberal arts students who are required to take a science course, but do not necessarily have a strong background in chemistry or science. The book ties every chemistry concept to things familiar to students - nutrition, drugs, the environment, household items. Rather than wait until the end of the text to apply chemistry to relavant topics, Chemistry In Your Life integrates the applications from the first chapter, providing students with interesting reasons to learn the concepts, and better analogies to understand them.
