 "Both films feature startling performances by Barker and Doug Bradley."
  -The Star

 This is a rare example of Barker's early work, featuring a young Doug Bradley
 as a surreal incarnation of a celluloid nutter and electroconvulsive therapy
 boy next door Pinhead. These two short films were restored under Barker's
 supervision and are accompanied by filmed interviews with Barker, Bradley and
 other key players.
