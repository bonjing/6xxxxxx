This Band Is Awesome

They Dont Have A Shit Song, I Rate

Their Music Is Similiar To That Of Mumford And Sons And Their Voice Is As Distinctive As Kings Of Leon.


This Contains All Three Of Their Albums:

 - Flaws
 - I Had the Blues But I Shook Them Loose
 - A Different Kind Of Fix (Incl. iTunes Bonus, Beg)

I have included 2 Songs From There EP, "The Boy I Used To Be".

"The Hill" & "Cancel on Me" are also on The EP but I Didnt Include It Because It Can Be Found On The other Albums.


These Guys Are Seriously Underated.



Seed & Enjoy
