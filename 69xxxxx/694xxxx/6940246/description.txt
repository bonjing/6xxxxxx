Episode 1 - Decency in the Middle

The final countdown to election day is full of surprises on all sides as Denmark prepares for parliamentary elections. Birgitte Nyborg, facing her first election as party leader, decides at the last minute to head in her own direction - the question is whether the voters will reward or punish her for this change of course. Likewise, Birgitte's press advisor Kasper Juul and TV journalist Katrine Fonsmark are each thrown off track in their own way in this super-professional, super-competitive race.
