,RexRexroth,2012-06-01T02:59Z,"This is the best DVDR available of this film.  The other one currently on TPB (tagged as ""Never on Sunday"") has NO English subs, (only Swedish and Norwegian) so unless you know any of those languages you will miss the portions of the film spoken in Greek and Russian.  The other rip is also packed with seven (!) trailers to other older movies.

This rip has a choice of five audio languages, and subs in nine languages.

Many thanks to the original uploader."
