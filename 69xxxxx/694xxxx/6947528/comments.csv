,thebash,2012-01-25T04:27Z,"Not to complain, but i have recently noticed ""26K"" releases and started downloading them because they are 720p done the x264 codec.
My issues are that more often than not the audio bitrate is ridiculously low, i mean when you are downloading 2gb worth of file i don't see how ruining the file for 100mb can be justified while everyone else is trying to keep the original ac3 on xvid 700mb files.
don't get me wrong i prefer the file with aac audio which means i don't need to convert to aac because that's all windows media centre will accept for mp4 files and i like it because the decibel gain is much better than ac3.
As a second complain i find that when i load ""26K' releases into MetaX to input description and covers it corrupts the file, that because for whatever reason i need to rename his file to .mkv and then convert to mp4 container with MKV-AVI to MP4 utility (after that it's all sweet).
in short keep up your releases, add more audio bitrate and i don't care what you do with the container because i can still fix it on my end even though it would be nice if they were true MP4 containers.
TIA"
