Description:
A valuable training aid for the whole family.
Wherever we are, and whatever we do, accidents and emergencies are a part of our lives. Would you know what to do if you were first on the scene? By knowing how to make essential first aid decisions, you can make sure that you are prepared to act in an emergency. Using simulations of real-life events where your choices and decisions affect the outcome, Teaching-you First Aid Skills helps you to acquire those skills, which we all need to learn, but for which we have never found the time.
