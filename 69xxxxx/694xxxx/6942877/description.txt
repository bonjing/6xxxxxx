RARE POISON!! YUGUSLAVIAN BAND RECOMMENDED!!
 POP MASINA was formed in early 1972 in Belgrade, Serbia by Robert Nemecek (bass, vocal), Zoran Bozinovic (guitar, vocal), Rasa Djelmas (drums) and Sava Bojic (guitar, vocal). By the end of that year, Bojic left while Djelmas was replaced by Mihajlo Popovic, thus forming the best known power trio line-up.
