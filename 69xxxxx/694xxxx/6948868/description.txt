                A Rare Bird.
                A row between keen birdwatchers in
                Midsomer-in-the-Marsh turns nasty when their
                president is killed. Patrick Morgan met his death
                while hoping to sight a rare bird, but is his
                obsession with ornithology to blame - or something
                more sinister? Barnaby and Jones attempt to discover
                the truth.
