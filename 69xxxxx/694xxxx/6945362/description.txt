Along with large capacity hard disk popularity, people were already used 
to coping compact discs to CD/DVD image files (also called compact disc 
image document) , generally used is the famous ISO 9660 international 
standards format, therefore CD/DVD image files are called ISO files.
Because the ISO file retained complete data information of the compact disc 
(including compact disc boot information), you were allowed the convince to 
use commonly used CD burning software (for example Nero-Burning ROM ) to 
record the disc with your CD-R/RW over and over forever, it can also be used 
directly through Virtual CD-ROM drive software (for example SoftDisc).
UltraISO is a CD/DVD image file creating/editing/converting tool , it can 
directly edit the CD/DVD image file and extract files and folders from it, 
as well as directly make ISO files from your CD/DVD drive or hard disk. At

your own bootable CDs and DVDs. You now have the power to make and edit your 
own ISO files, and then burn them to CD or DVD for your own needs.
