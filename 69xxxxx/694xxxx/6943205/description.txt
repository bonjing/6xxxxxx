Fort Apache [1948]

In John Ford's sombre exploration mythologising of American heroes, he slowly reveals the
character of Owen Thursday, who sees his new posting to the desolate Fort Apache as a
chance to claim the military honour which he believes is rightfully his. Arrogant, obsessed
with military form and ultimately self-destructive, Thursday attempts to destroy the Apache
chief Cochise after luring him across the border from Mexico, against the advice of his
subordinates.
