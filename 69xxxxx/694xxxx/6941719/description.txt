           Just as the first IMDb user comment says, the one      
           that begins with "A Classic in  World Cinema",  I      
           just cannot do anything but concur with  it  all.      
           This is a fantastic piece of french  cinema  that      
            features WW2 and moral ambiguity, not to  mention      
               Simone Signoret who was a big star in France, see          
           for instance "Les Diaboliques" or "Casque  d'or",      
           both out on Criterion.                                 
                                                                  
           Furthermore this comes from  the  Criterion  that      
           came out in  May  this  year.  PROMiSE:s  release      
           from 2003 uses a PAL source.                           
                                                                  
           I would also like to take the moment and  express      
           my gratitude towards   Ingmar  Bergman   who  has      
           always been a great icon to me. You will be            
               missed deeply.
