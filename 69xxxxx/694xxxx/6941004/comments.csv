I think the earlier seasons generally have more grain, so the crf 19 requires a higher bitrate.  The video quality on the dvds is better in the latter seasons, requiring less bitrate to maintain the same quality.  That's the beauty of crf encoding.  You always get the file size just right...larger when needed (earlier seasons) and smaller when not needed (latter seasons).  I hope crf encoding catches on with other rippers/encoders."
