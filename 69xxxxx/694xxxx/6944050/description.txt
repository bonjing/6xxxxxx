Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

Alex welcomes back to the show Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Shaffer, who will talk about the impending war on Iran and also the presidential candidacy of Ron Paul. His memoirs, Operation Dark Heart, was bought up and destroyed by the Pentagon. The book details Shaffer's five months in Afghanistan. 

Alex also talks with investigative journalist Wayne Madsen about the situation in the Persian Gulf. Madsen has written numerous articles for the alternative and so-called mainstream press, including the Miami Herald, Houston Chronicle, Philadelphia Inquirer and others. Madsen edits and publishes the Wayne Madsen Report.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
