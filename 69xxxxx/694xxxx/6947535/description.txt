The open source nature of the platform has not only established a new direction for the industry, but enables a developer or forensic analyst to understand the device at the most fundamental level. Android Forensics covers an open source mobile device platform based on the Linux 2.6 kernel and managed by the Open Handset Alliance. The Android platform is a major source of digital forensic investigation and analysis. This book provides a thorough review of the Android platform including supported hardware devices, the structure of the Android development project and implementation of core services (wireless communication, data storage and other low-level functions). Finally, it will focus on teaching readers how to apply actual forensic techniques to recover data.
