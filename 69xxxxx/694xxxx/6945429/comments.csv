And a Heaven in a wild flower,  
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand,  
And Eternity in an hour.âŚ 
(To copy-paste Blake)

I like the prose style of the writer.

Other books from pg 221 (Further Reading) would be welcome. I wish the back-cover would be included in the pdfs; usually has the author's bio."
