,reb-caps,2012-01-16T17:55Z,"@akro - thanks for the info, I will check it out.  And yes, I cap all of this series although I don't really upload torrents anymore (just came here to followup on reports of stripped filenames).

I don't see a way to PM users on this site.  And not sure if posting links is allowed here.  If you know how to use IRC, come see me on irc.irchighway.net in room: #survivor-central  and pm rebecca, I will show you how to get direct access to my new releases (as well as back eps), which you are welcome to reshare.
