RStevens presents Diesel Sweeties Pocket Sweeties Vol 1 - being re-released free to the internet for a very special RStevens birthday! 

"Diesel Sweeties has taught me that my uptight, strapped in, repressed existence was the Wrong Way to go about Things. R Stevens isn't afraid for his characters to deliver dialogue from atop the potty or behind a post- coital cigarette. The unreal veneer of pixels allows him to slip a plethora of icky moments under our radar.
Of course, you catch him at it, and he plays dumb, delivering a string of nice-as-pie comics about kittens. Or a sequence of comics built around almost pointillist wordplay.
He's wily.
This collection showcases his wiliest moves to date."
