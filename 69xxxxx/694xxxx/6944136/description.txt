Droopy, a detective basset hound, lulls the bad guys into a
false sense of security by acting slow and dumb when in actual
fact he is a genius. The shrewd Droopy always outwits his enemies!
Droopy Dog was a low-key animated movie character created by
Tex Avery at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1943, this mournful deadpan
witty Basset hound detective who spoke in a jowly monotone voice and,
though he didn't look like much, was shrewd enough to outwit
his enemies - the conniving Butch the Irish bulldog and the thieving,
nasty wolf and English Fox.
