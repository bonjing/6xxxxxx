Why not be greatful its actually uploaded, if u hav such a problem pay for the damn thing, no u wont u will keep bitchin but no matter saves u $15, oh and what u think these ppl dont hav jobs and lives either... yes they sit at hom waiting to upload videos at 60fps for pricks like u.

PS. im guessing the hate for 29fps and the overall bumming of 60fps is due to ur shit Xbox 360 why not open ur wallet a bit and stop being so tight BUY a PS3 has no problems playin nethin. or stream it from ur comp to ur tv theres plenty of ways to watch shit on tv
