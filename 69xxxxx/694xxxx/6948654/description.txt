Neuromuscular Rehabilitation in Manual and Physical Therapy explores the vast and complex discipline of neuromuscular rehabilitation and simplifies it for clinical use. It is a practical source book for practitioners of manual and physical therapy who work with movement rehabilitation after musculoskeletal injury and pain conditions, sports rehabilitation, surgery and central nervous system damage. The book is a synthesis of over half a century of research and can be described as 'neuromuscular rehabilitation made easy'. It explores movement control and how it is affected by injury, pain and central damage. It provides practical solutions and comprehensive demonstrations (DVD) of movement rehabilitation for the upper and lower limbs and the trunk/spine.
