The Allman Brothers Band closed out the second weekend of the 2011 Beacon run with a well-played, diverse show that had something for everyone.  You could almost say this show had three sets:  The first set, a mellow/bluesy second set featuring Scott Boyer and Tommy Talton of Cowboy, and a jamming third set.

The first set kicked off with the powerful combo of "Hot'Lanta" and "Statesboro Blues."  The multi-tiered jams in "Rockin' Horse" make it one of the most adventurous and dynamic songs the ABB play, and this is no exception.  After a blast of the blues with "Stormy Monday," with Gregg singing with authority, Derek's mysterious new instrumental "Bag End" hypnotized the crowd.  Warren's souflul "River's Gonna Rise" and an explosive "Every Hungry WOman" capped off a tight first set.

Next came an extended mellow interlude that was like a set in itself.  Gregg held the crowd in the palm of his hand for "Melissa," and then growled out the blues on "Can't Be Satisfied" from his recent solo album.  Scotty Boyer and Tommy Talton, who backed Gregg on his legendary On Tour album, then joined the ABB for beautiful renditions of "Please Be With Me" and "All My Friends."  Tommy stayed on stage for a bluesy "Hoochie Coochie Man," wrapping up the Cowboy mini-set in style.

The "third set" began next as the band took off on an epic "Dreams," with Warren taking the main slide solo on a Gibson Les Paul that once belonged to Duane Allman.  Warren did Duane proud on this one!  "Revival" was jammed out to the extreme, with the "JaMaBuBu" drum/bass segment in the middle, before returing to a joyous conclusion.

This show also marked the first "Whipping Post" encore of the 2011 Beacon run, and this version is fierce and takes no prisoners!
