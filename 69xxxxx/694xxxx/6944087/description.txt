I apologize for the low upload speed. It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.
I see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. 
Ok pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. 
Surely I wont always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it is up to you to help these shares to spread.

Robert Wyatt (& Soft Machine) Discography

A MUSIC torrent :)

Dig the peculiar musical experience of: Robert Wyatt
 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wyatt


Robert Wyatt has trodden a long path since his beginnings in the 60s.
Psychedelic rock, Canterbury rock, progressive rock, jazz, avantgarde are all genres where he has left his distinctive mark, always in an unconventional way, regardless of easy listening syrens. An all round artist loved by other artists, also for his friendly collaborations with unknown emerging musicians. His complete discography was impossible to gather but I deem that the 119 albums that you will find in this torrent can satisfy the insane tastes of the most demanding "wyatters" :)

I'm particularly grateful to Hemix for his two impressive bootlegs "Guest Vocalist" and "Old New Borrowed Brew" where he collected the contributions of Wyatt in albums of artists very rare to find. Those albums are missing but not the parts concerning Wyatt.

For sake of completness the Soft Machine discography is complete in its main albums, live and compilations and includes also works where Wyatt was no more present in the band.

So... have a good wyatting...

All the album are zipped (since the number of files was too high for TPB).
The sampling rate is 320kbps when possible.
Different rates are signed in the name of the albums zips.

Enjoy :)
