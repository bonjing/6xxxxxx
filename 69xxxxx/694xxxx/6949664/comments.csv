I and many others are very appreciative of yours and others' efforts uploading MotD and full games here on PB. I seed while I can but can't leave things on my HD forever seeding a football match that's more than a few days old. It's not like a film where it can be watched anytime.

You had stopped uploading full matches here and have made complaints that others have essentially plagiarised your work from another site. Surely your reasons for uploading matches in the first place are because you are being generous with your time and allowing people all over the world to see these matches/programmes?

If someone puts your initial upload from elsewhere on here where more people have access to it and can therefore download it, isn't that a good thing? Isn't it the same as having lots of people seeding a file on here?

Admittedly, if that's what they have done, then they should state that it is one of yours that they are merely passing on.

You don't get paid for doing this, so of course you can just walk away. But really I don't see why you don't want your initial efforts to be spread as far as possible for the enjoyment of as many people as possible, which is the reason you made the comment above, isn't it?"
