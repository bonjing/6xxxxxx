John Mooney Against The Wall
Label Platinum Entertainment 
Released: 1996
Format:Flac

The very first notes on this album, a cymbal crash followed by slamming tom toms from Recile's drum kit, then a slide on Mooney's guitar with Andrews' B3 sneaking up behind, say you're in for a good time. When Mooney's rich, slightly quavering voice then starts singing about heading down by the levee, "on sacred ground," you just know he means it. This song is powered one hundred percent by that unique sweet New Orleans steam. And that's just the beginning.
Mooney sings in a rough baritone and plays stunning acoustic steel guitar, electric slide, or his own self-made "swamp box," which sounds as down-home as the name suggests. The other musicians, most of them from Mooney's working band, are just as fine, with drummer George C. Recile a regular second line in his own right. The album is loose-limbed, energetic, swampy, and as smoky and sweet as good barbecue
