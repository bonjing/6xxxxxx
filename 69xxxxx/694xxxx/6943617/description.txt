John Fahey Various Artists  Friends Of Fahey Tribute
Released: 2006
Label: Slackertone Records
Format: Mp3@320 

Friends of Fahey Tribute celebrates the late John Fahey (d. 2001), creator of what he called "American primitive guitar." A project initiated by a Vietnamese-American who goes by the single name Tinh, it brings together guitarists who count Fahey as an influence or at least a particularly admired colleague. (Well, it's not quite all guitarists; George Winston opens the disc with a piano reading of Fahey's "Steamboat Gwine 'Round de Bend" and concludes it with a harmonica version of same.) Inspired by hymns and early blues, Fahey's compositions have a stately, deliberate aura encompassing a sense of American time, affording one the impression that Fahey was hearing something just out of listening range of his fellow citizens. The music is -- no other word will do -- beautiful. Though evoking a lost past, it is, however, never sentimental, cloying or nostalgic.
