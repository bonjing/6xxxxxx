,comedylover22,2012-05-26T07:26Z,Is it only me who though that it was a bit blurry in actions scenes? But Thanks YIFY :) Please put these movies into .mkv formats its great for HD and the sound can be full 7.1 cahnnels DTS!!!! plus it would be even less GB than this. so please take this advice it might end up saving a WHOLE LOT of people a WHOLE LOT of bandwith :) Thanks again.
