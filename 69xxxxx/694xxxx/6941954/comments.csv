isode is way to deep and political for people outside of USA to understand. Unless they follow politics and know about the presidential candidates. To understand Homer's parodies you need to know who Glenn Beck is, and what FOX News are doing to the politics in America. Great episode! Loved the Jon Stewart/ Stephen Colbert reference! "
