NOTES:

Ok wasn't going to bother with this as its pretty poor imho ...however a few friends asked so here ya go :P
Right used bida's release and basically just gave it some TLC ...had to use heavy noise filter aswell as a HQ smoother
to try and hide the pixel break up the best i could ...
Slight tweak in the brightness,contrast,chroma and rgb colours ...Audio is untouched and just stripped and remuxed to our rip.
Dvdscr .....dvdscr my arse!!!
To me it looks like the ppvrips we get from the motels ...usually with the LE in the bottom corner,so tagged as i seen fit.
Got too warn you again its not the best and don't be fooled by screenshots on others aswell as ours ...best way to see the 
true Q is to download or at least grab the sample......this way you can is have smooth it plays or how bad it breaks up ...
screenies won't show you this :D
