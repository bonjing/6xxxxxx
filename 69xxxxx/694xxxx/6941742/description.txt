NOTES:

Wow that was a mission and half :lol: right the video was pretty poor,full of noise,lack of colour and basically
pretty poo.Audio was even worse ...one of the worse cam audios i've heard and also was oos in parts and had repeated
lines and non english audio added for gaps where cam audio was missing ....it was piss poor IMHO.
Work done ....shit loads.
Audio first ...well stripped it and ran him,hiss,noise filters all over it,changed all the EQ levels and resaved.
Now for the worse part ...for some reason the whole file was oos when muxing to my rip so had to resync the lot arghh.
36 i had to make ranging from 22 secs to 10mins.....so considering i had to do this i have also opted to remove the non
eng audio parts inc the video ....seems pretty pointless have audio that doesn't even match the video lol.
Video ....needed more than some TLC ...but with lots of love we got there :D First maded a small script to load into vdub
which was only really contained heavy noise filter.From there i opted to used loads of filters from vdub ...HQ smoother,rgb eq
chroma,brightness,contrast sharpness ...
Basically the video almost looks like a totally new source now ,but must say from time to time the colour does go slightly
out ...but thats because the source files did.
Readnfo part is basically too warn you the audio STILL sucks donkey balls and there might be a few odd audio slips....but if
u want it now,this is the best your going to get i'm afraid.
