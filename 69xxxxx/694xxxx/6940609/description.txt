Known issue:
Downloading maps from within the Application will not work.
The maps you have installed previously will work.
I'd recommend downloading a map you want prior
to installation via your current copilot installation .
Or install maps after new installation manually via our Map Topics.
UNINSTALL CoPilot 8.2.0.368 FIRST before installing 8.2.0.814



To make this version work 
look in your sdcard. it will be in /sdcard/copilot/save/pk.txt it should not be necessary to delete, as long as you uninstalled any old versions, but if for some weird reason you're having problems, delete it. then unmount your sdcard and reload the app.
1. Uninstalled the old version.
2. Installed new version.
3. Deleted save/pk.txt
4. Start CoPilot.

Upgrade/installing over the old one did not work.
