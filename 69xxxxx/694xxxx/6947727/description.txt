    Description

Plot: From the Oscar(R)-winning team behind â€œMan on Wireâ€ comes the story of Nim, the chimpanzee who became the focus of a landmark 1970s experiment to show that an ape could learn to communicate with language if raised and nurtured like a human child. But as Nimâ€™s natural instincts take over and the humans trusted with his well being fail to protect him, â€œProject Nimâ€ uncovers the unflinching and extraordinary journey of one animal thrust into human society.
