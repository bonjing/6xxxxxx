o as to my knowledge, it is the first movie directed by Vincent D'Onofrio. He's probably best known from his role as the very intelligent and cunning, Detective Robert Goren on LAW & ORDER - Major Crimes Squad. This is also referred to as (Major K squad - Major K is the part of the police department that ONLY deals with very serious cases like MURDER and White Collar Crimes, Child Abduction, etc.). 

ANYWAY,
Maybe I am biased because I am a big fan of Vincent D'Onofrio.He also played the PEST CONTROL GUY, who was killed and taken over by  ""THE BUG"" in the MEN IN BLACK.
If his directing is as passionate as he takes his acting, it should be a good flick. I'll judge the plot's quality my self. 
How's is the A/V quality."
