  By making these instructionals available to the MMA community we hope
  to encourage the producers and makers of them to step up their sense
  of quality and to make them understand that even if people dowload
  their material without initially contributing economically to their
  creation, they will eventually buy all the material they experience
  as worth it, attend the seminars, purchase gear and train at the
  schools of those that manage to produce instructionals good enough
  and present them in ways that makes it easy to understand and learn
  what MMA and its sub arts really is about. And specificly for them
  to understand how important it is not to compromise on the quality.
  So that the downloaders too in their turn one day can ful fill their
  dream of becoming professional MMA fighters without having to pass
  thrue a jungle of scams and unprofessional instructionals costing
  them money they can use on more important stuff.

  Most of the amateur MMA practitioners do not have a budget that
  allows them to waste his or hers money on material that does not live
  up to their expectations. Our intention is never to hurt anybody
  involved in creating instructionals economically or their reputation
  in any way. But we see this as a way of filtering out those
  instructionals that are overcharged and completely worthless that
  seem to infest the internet. By sharing the material with the rest
  of the MMA community we hope to encourage both young and old
  MMA practitioners to get better and creators and producers of
  instructional material to step up their efforts and produce quality
  material.

  Remember, if you truly feel that the instructional you have just
  downloaded has helped you become a better fighter and you have the
  economic means. Please buy it! support those that are worth it so
  that they can produce more good material.



  Working together since 2010 - Enjoy this great release!
