Series Summary
Based on Gerry Deeâ€™s real-life experiences as a high school teacher before he switched to comedy full-time, MR. D is a story about a charming, under-qualified teacher trying to fake his way through a teaching job, just like he often fakes his way through life. The premise shines the light on teaching from the teacherâ€™s point of view, and as it turns out, teachers donâ€™t know everything, especially Mr. D â€” who struggles to keep one step ahead of his students.
