If the mysterious plague sweeping the nation wasnâ€™t bad enough, Dean is still going ahead with his doomed wedding tomorrow morning. That leaves him with a choice. Pick up the button holes and chocolate fountain as instructed by bridezilla Elaine, or go with five mates (and a stripper) to play â€™Zomballâ€™ at a top secret military compound where you get to shoot zombies with huge stun guns. Disobeying the golden rule of Zomball (â€™never never humiliate a zombieâ€™) the stags face overwhelming odds from the massed undead and each stag is hunted down. The truth about Zomball is finally revealed and suddenly the mother-in-law is the least of Deanâ€™s problemsâ€¦.
