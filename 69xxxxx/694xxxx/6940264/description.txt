Set in the zombie apocalypse, Left 4 Deadâ„¢ 2 (L4D2) is the highly anticipated sequel to the award-winning Left 4 Dead, the #1 co-op game of 2008.

This co-operative action horror FPS takes you and your friends through the cities, swamps and cemeteries of the Deep South, from Savannah to New Orleans across five expansive campaigns.


Youâ€™ll play as one of four new survivors armed with a wide and devastating array of classic and upgraded weapons. In addition to firearms, youâ€™ll also get a chance to take out some aggression on infected with a variety of carnage-creating melee weapons, from chainsaws to axes and even the deadly frying pan.

Youâ€™ll be putting these weapons to the test against (or playing as in Versus) three horrific and formidable new Special Infected. Youâ€™ll also encounter five new â€œuncommonâ€ common infected, including the terrifying Mudmen./
