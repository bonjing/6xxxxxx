In 1969 singer guitarist and songwriter Tom Johnston and drummer John Hartman formed the core of what would become The Doobie Brothers, Skip Spence of Moby Grape (and formerly of Jefferson Airplane) introduced them to one another after Hartman arrived in California considered to meet Spence and join an aborted Grape reunion New bandsfÃ¶rvanterna Johnston and Hartman called their fledgling group Pud and experimented with different lineups (sometimes in linjeups was Spence) and stylesthey performed in and around San Jose, they were mostly a power trio (with bassist Greg Murphy), but briefly worked with a brass section in 1970 they teamed up with bassist Dave Shogren and lead singer guitarist and songwriter Patrick Simmons Simmons who had belonged to several area groups (among them was the band "Scratch" which was an acoustic trio with future Doobie bassist Tiran Porter) and also appeared as a solo artist was already an accomplished Fingerstyle players whose attitude to complementary instrument Johnston's rhythmic R & B, flip out in a recent interview, Tom Johnston attributed any band name to friend and housemate Keith "Dyno" Rosen noted that boys' preference for "Doobie & # 8221, they considered the new nickname of an improvement over Pud 

The Doobie Brothers honed their chops by performing live all over northern California in 1970, which attracted a particularly strong following among local chapters of the Hells Angels and was a recurring gig at one of the bikers' favorite places the rustic Chateau LibertÃ© "in Santa Cruz Mountains An energetic number of demos (including eight cards and illegally released on Pickwick Records in 1980 under the title Introduction to the Doobie Brothers and has since been bootlegged on CD under that title and on the way up, and both with extended song choice), showcased fuzz-toned dual lead electric guitars three-part harmonies and Hartman's frenetic drums and the band earned a contract at Warner Bros. Records 

At this point in its history, the band's image to keep in mind that theracial biggest fans - leather jackets and motorcycles, however, the group's 1971 self-titled debut album departed significantly from the picture and live sound of the period album which failed to chart emphasized acoustic guitars and frequently reflected country affect bouncy lead-off song "Nobody" the band's first single has surfaced up in their lives that several times over the subsequent decades,

A string of hits followed, including Johnston's "Long Train Runnin '" and "China Grove" from the 1973 album The Captain and Me Other noteworthy tracks on the album, Simmons' country-ish ode South CiTy Midnight Lady and the explosive hard rock raveup Without You as the whole band got songwriting credit on the scene later the song would sometimes stretch to a 15-minute jam with additional improvised textsby Johnston A 1973 appearance on the debut episode of Don Kirshner's Rock Concert featured one such epic performance of the order of 

In the middle of recording their next album in 1974 is formerly loads are now Habits Hossack abruptly departed the band citing exhaustion from constant touring Drummer songwriter and vocalist Keith Knudsen (who previously drummed for Lee Michaels of you know what I mean fame) was recruited quickly and left the Doobie at a major tour within days of joining in September 1973 (Hossack was later replaced Knudsen in the band Bonaroo has served as a dressings for Doobie shortly thereafter) Both Hossack drums and Knudsen's voice is heard on Vices 

In 1974 Steely Dan co-guitarist Jeff "Skunk" Baxter learned that his bandwas retirement from the road and that Donald Fagen and Walter Becker intended to work almost exclusively with session players in the future when the need for a stable gig, he segued into Doobie Brothers as third lead guitarist in the middle of their current tour, he had previously worked with the band in studio put the pedal steel guitar, both Captain ("South City Midnight Lady") and products ("Black Water" Tell me what you want ") and had already played with the band as a" special guest "during that year's Tour 

Loads up the band first # 1 single: Simmons' signature tune "Black Water" which contained the memorable refrain "I would like to hear some funky Dixieland sweet mama come and take my hand, climbed to the top of the charts in March 1975, and eventually powered the album to multi- platinum-pcatus Johnston lyrical Another Park Another Sunday (as a single man featured in "Black Water" as the B-side) and his horn-driven funk song "Eyes of Silver" had also reached # 32 & # 52 respectively last year 

In this period and for several subsequent trips in the Doobie often supported on stage by Stax Records legends The Memphis Horns Live recordings with brass section lotion was broadcast on radio on the King Biscuit Flower Hour in the absence has been officially released, they have also performed as a session player on several Doobie albums 

Before the end of 1974, Johnston's health was suffering from a secure transport, he was absent when the band joined the Beach Boys Chicago and Olivia Newton-John on "Dick Clark's Rockin 'New Year's Eve" that December when the western-theme Stampede had been completed for the release in 1975, it contains even a hit single Johnston cover of Holland-Dozier-Holland-written Motown hit Take me in your arms (originally sung by Kim Weston, and also covered by the Blood Sweat & Tears) song included a distinctive Baxter Simmons guitar solo contributed atmospheric " I cheat Hangman & # 8221, and Neal's Fandango an ode to Santa Cruz, Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady Ry Cooder added his slinky slide guitar to John's cowboy song "Rainy Day Crossroad blues" 

In the early spring of 1975 promotional tour for the Stampede Johnston condition was so insecure that he needed urgent hospitalization for a bleeding ulcer with Johnston and convalescent tour already underway Baxter proposed to recruit a fellow Steely Dan alum to fill the hole: singer songwriter and keyboardist Michael McDonald Simmons Knudsen Porter and McDonald divvied up and sang Johnston parts on tour while Simmons and Baxter shared guitar chores 

under contract to release a new album in 1976 Doobie was at a crossroads, their main songwriter End singers remained inaccessible as they turned to McDonald and Porter for the material to supplement it by Simmons The resulting LP Takin 'it to the Streets debuted a radical change in their sound guitar-based rock and roll gave way to blue-eyed soul and soft rock stress keyboards and horns Baxter contributed Jazz -inflected forms guitar styles reminiscent of Steely Dan with more emphasis on minor chords throughout the song's many internal melodies particular McDonald's voice became the band's new signaturesound of Takin 'it to the Streets featured McDonald's title track and it keeps you Runnin' both hits ("It keeps you Runnin '" was covered by Carly Simon on her album another passenger with the Doobie backing her) Bassist Porter wrote and sang a tribute to the absent Johnston entitled to any special "A greatest hits compilation Best of The Doobie followed before the end of the year (1996 Recording Industry Association of America certified Best of the Doobie" Diamond "for sales of over ten million) 

Their new sound was further refined and McDonald's dominant role cemented with 1977's Livin 'on the fault line that contained a cover of the Motown classic "Little Darlin' (I Need You)" "Echoes of Love" (written for but notrecorded by Al Green and James Mitchell, then in Memphis Horns and Earl Randle, both of which had worked with Green well as Simmons to some music and text written in conjunction with the finished version and Randle Mitchell song later recorded by The Pointer Sisters) and "You belong to me "(written by McDonald and Carly Simon, who had a hit with its own version of the song) to help promote Fault Line band performed live on the PBS show sound stage and appeared as himself in a two-part episode of the comedy What's Happening! This album is a shimmering almost seamless masterpiece perhaps the most musically sophisticated and richest in history Doobie Jeff Baxter used an early type of guitar synthesizer (Roland) on many of the tracks (there are heavy with his solo on the title credits?? R and on the "Chinatown") There are also wonderful horizontal bands and vocal arrangements and some absolutely superb horn arrangements string of David Paich to increase the band's big play also highlights even more the use of minor chords, often used in jazz, unlike many pop / rock groups using minor chords for his dark and sinister feel Doobie managed to temper that with strong pop hooks, resulting in an album but not really jazz, much of the sense of "cool jazz" era in a pop setting 

Both the Streets and Fault Line reflected Tom Johnston decreased role in the group after his condition restored to fitness and card back in the fold, he contributed an original song Streets ("Turn It Loose") and also added a vocal cameo that SImmonen "tune" Wheels of Fortune "He also did live appearances with the band in 1976 (documented in a concert filmed in the same year Winterland in San Francisco, extracts from which are sometimes on VH1 Classic), but was sidelined again and the fall because of fatigue, no of Johnston's songs appeared on the fault line, although he had written and the band had recorded five of his compositions for the album Finally, before the Fault Line was released Johnston had his off tracks and he left the band which he founded (though he was commended on guitar and vocals and was pictured on the album's inner sleeve band photo), he launched a solo career that eventually resulted in a modest financial success of Warner Brothers albums, all you heard is true (1979) and the less successful Still Feels Good (1981) 

Uconnecting transition band also elevated former roadie Bobby LaKind to the stage singer and percussionist in the studio LaKind first contributed percussion and Streets, he had gone the road crew in 1974 

After nearly a decade on the road and with seven albums in the trunk of the Doobie career unexpectedly soared by the success of their next album 1978's every minute of it spent five weeks at the top of the charts and dominated several formats radio for most of two years McDonald's song "What a fool believes was written with Kenny Loggins was the band's second # 1 single and earned songwriting duo one Grammy Award for Record of the Year in the fast-paced McDonald boxes title track received Grammy for Pop Vocal Performance by a group album and was rewarded with Album of the Yearnicka Among other memorable songs on the album "Here to Love You" Dependin 'On You (co-written by McDonald and Simmons), "Steamer Lane Breakdown" (Simmons, a bluegrass instrumental) and McDonald's "What Fools survive? "(Which included a long guitar coda improvised by Baxter in a single take, according to a 1980 interview in Guitar Player Magazine) Nicolette Larson (whose best known hit Lotta Love) and resigned former bandleader Johnston contributed guest vocals on the album 

The triumph minutes the minutes was bittersweet, but because it coincided with the near-dissolution of the band while touring the pressure recording and releasing an album every year brought down members Jeff Baxter and Michael McDonald had Been in the middle of a creative conflict for some time McDonald wanted a simplepolished rock / R & B sound while Baxter insisted that the fake guitar parts in a more avant garde style (Both McDonald and Baxter closer to the field in the documentary series Behind the Music, which aired on VH1 in February 2001) Just as every minute impressive successes had become apparent founder drummer Hartman longtime guitarist Baxter LaKind left through the revolving door, a two-track as the January 27, 1979 broadcast of Saturday Night Live (with guest host Michael Palin) marked the final television appearance of this layout and a short tour Japan was the last live performances by the band in its middle-period configuration (Hartman later went Johnston7,'s touring band in 1979 and taped an appearance with Johnston, who was sent on soundstage 1980) 

With the surprise smash album embedded in the charts and more money to be made about the remaining Doobie (Simmons Knudsen McDonald and Porter) decided to go ahead in 1979 Hartman was replaced by ace session drummer Chet McCracken and Baxter of several instrumental string player John McFee (end of Huey Lewis early band Clover), Cornelius Bumpus also recruited to add vocals keyboards and saxophone to the line up this line-up toured throughout 1979 including stops at Madison Square Garden and New York's Central Park to the No Nukes benefit shows with like-minded artists such as Bonnie Raitt Crosby Stills & Nash, James Taylor, Carly Simon, Jackson Browne, Bruce Springsteen and John Hall 

1980 marked the return LaKind the lineup as a full member and his Doobieninth studio album entitled "One Step Closer LP contained the hit title track and the Top Ten smash" Real Love "(not to be confused with the John Lennon composition) but do not dominate the charts and radio as minute by minute, two years earlier, largely due to an over-saturation the "McDonald sounds" like many other artists (such as Robbie Dupree Steal Away here who copied "McDonald sounds" almost note for note) heard on the radio at that time (not to mention McDonald's many guest vocal appearances on hits by other artists at this time as Kenny Loggins, Christopher Cross Nicolette Larson and others) Than The album was also musically much weaker than the previous three with the band sounding tired and seemingly much more than McDonald's "back-up tapes"When (according to contemporary references in those days) Long frustrated with the reality of relentless touring and the desire for a stable home life and struggling self-admitted problems with cocaine Porter left the band after the recording of detailed Well-known session bassist Willie Weeks went up and the Doobie continued to tour during throughout 1980 and 1981 (Post-Doobie weeks have been performed with Gregg Allman Band, Eric Clapton and many others) Also during this tour session veterinarian Andy Newmark climbed the card for Knudsen, who was in rehab when 

the end of 1981 although Simmons had resigned from nrw band at the prospect that call themselves "Doobie Brothers" but the remaining original members of a sound that was light years from its original version and a "leader" in McDonald, which was ready for es solo career, the group chose instead to close down and even that was not decided until after a rehearsal done without Simmons in a vain attempt to keep the band going as an interview with McDonald on "Listen To The Music" The Doobie Brothers official video history / documentary Released in 1989, he continued to say in that interview that at that point they could not have been further from the Doobie sound if they had tried the reluctant Simmons already hard on his first solo album reunited for a 1982 farewell tour on the promise that this would really be end at their last concert at the Greek Theatre in Berkeley, joined the stage by founder Tom Johnston for what is supposed to be the final surrender of his short "China Grove" EarlierMembers Porter, Hossack and Hartman then took the stage for an extended version of "Listen to the Music" Knudsen sang while Simmons Johnston and McFee traded licks on the guitar by all members through the years just Shogren was absent when the group took its "final" bow The live album Farewell Tour followed in 1983
