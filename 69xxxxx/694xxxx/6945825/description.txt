O&O; DiskRecovery Tech Edition â€“ Professional data recovery for service providers

O&O; DiskRecovery Tech Edition is authorized for commercial use on an unlimited number of computers. For the one-time cost of a license, self-employed administrators or service technicians can recover data on any computer where the product is supported. When needed, O&O; DiskRecovery can also be started directly from an external disk (e.g., USB stick) which means thereâ€™s no time-consuming installation. Its unique combination of three different scanning and recovery algorithms allows O&O; DiskRecovery to track down any data than can be recovered. O&O; DiskRecovery can even find and recover data in the most extreme situations, such as with already formatted or destroyed file systems.
One important special feature of O&O; DiskRecovery 7 Tech Edition is an option for creating a bootable medium based on Windows PE 3.0. Along with O&O; DiskRecovery, this bootable medium contains various O&O; system recovery programs that provide access to the Windows Registry and stored files.
