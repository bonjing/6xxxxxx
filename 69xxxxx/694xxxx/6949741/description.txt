Puzzle Quest: Revenge of the Plague Lord for Mac OS X is a robust gaming experience that continues the critically acclaimed and fan-favorite Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords.
 
Battles continue to be fought in the beloved match-three competitive puzzle game style in one of three gameplay modes, and the tremendous amount of new content offers the possibility for many additional hours of play. Plague Lord offers fans their choice of four new hero professions--bard, rogue, ranger and warlock--as well as scores of new spells to cast and items to collect, plus challenging new quests, monsters, bosses, and the introduction of a new archenemy, Antharg, the Lord of Plague. Gamers engage in competitive play using existing or new heroes, and utilize online multiplayer connectivity. 

Infinite Interactive has delivered much more than the average upgrade. The incredible amount of new material that Plague Lord includes sets a new precedent for offerings on Mac OS X.
