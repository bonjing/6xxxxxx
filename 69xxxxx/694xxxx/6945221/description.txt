Truth Be Told (2011) 

"Truth Be Told" plays upon the old adage, that "honesty is the best policy," and according to Colorado's leading marriage counselor, Annie Morgan (Candace Cameron Bure), honesty is the key to successful long-term relationships. Ironically, Annie has never been married and doesn't always follow her own advice. Through a misunderstanding, Annie receives an invitation for her and her spouse to join media mogul Terrance Bishop (Ronny Cox), at his New Mexico ranch to discuss her dream job: hosting a radio advice program. Fearful that being single will ruin her chance of a lifetime, Annie conspires with Mark Crane (David James Elliott), an old college friend, recent widower, and father of two teenagers, to pose as a married couple for the weekend. A series of comical misunderstandings color the trip, leaving Annie emotionally involved with Mark's family and battling with her own conscience. As the entertaining and touching story unfolds, Annie begins to realize that the truth may have its consequences, but ultimately it's what opens our hearts and brings out the best in each other.
