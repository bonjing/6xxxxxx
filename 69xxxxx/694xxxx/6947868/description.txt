This Tuesday night was a great show full of hot jams, with a little help from the Juke Horns, plus Rich Robinson of the Black Crowes and Steve Molitz of Particle.

The first set took a little while to catch fire, but it took off during an extraordinary version of "The High Cost of Low Living."  Derek really reaches for the stars on his solo, and there is a nice little moment at the end of the song when he and Warren trade riffs.  The band carried the momentum into a red-hot "Kind of Bird" that tore the roof off the Beacon!  The Asbury Jukes horn section added a lot to the ominous tone of "Blind Willie McTell," sung brilliantly by Gregg and Warren.

The Juke Horns stayed on for the next two songs, which also featured guitarist Rich Robinson of the Black Crowes and keyboardist Steve Molitz of Particle.  "Soulshine" was made even more uplifting by the big band sound, and Warren sang with much soul on a poweful "The Weight."  The first set wrapped up with a scorching "One Way Out."  Not bad for a half a show!

After kicking off the second set with "End of the Line" and "Gambler's Roll," both of which found Gregg in great voice, the band dove into a fierce and exploratory "Black Hearted Woman."  After that, Warren singing the Otis Redding classic "I've Been Loving You Too Long" was a great change of pace.  A funky "The Same Thing" with a stage full of guests was a showstopper, then the ABB played a magnificent "Jessica" where they didn't need any guests at all to hit the note!

An extended jam on "No One To Run With" was the encore to this great show, with a little hint of "Blue Sky" in the jam.  Another great night of March Madness!
