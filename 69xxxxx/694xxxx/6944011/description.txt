You know who they are. They're the people who, regardless of money, education, looks, or personality, make an impression wherever they go. They are master communicators, and everyone enjoys talking to them. How To Instantly Connect With Anyone; shows you how to be one of those lucky few, so you, too, can meet new people and converse with confidence; be credible and charismatic in every social and business situation; make friends and important contacts wherever you go; and command the respect of everyone you meet. Communication guru Leil Lowndes arms you with all-new, cutting edge, research-based communications techniques for success in life, love, and business. 

You will smash the invisible glass ceiling that keeps many people down both personally and professionally. Your new weapon is a neurologically and psychologically sound concept called 'Emotional Prediction,' or EP. Lowndes explains the power of EP and shows you how to harness it through deceptively simple methods to reach greater success in all of your relationships.
