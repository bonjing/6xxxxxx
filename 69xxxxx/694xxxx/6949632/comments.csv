This driver pack is multi-language. You can select drivers that you want to update. Most apps are built-in but mostly russian but you can uncheck them to disable installation.

Very useful during offline driver installation. Tested also on ASUS P5GC-MX/1333 motherboard. Works great.

English is the default menu but you can choose other languages.

thanks to emopirate...great torrent.
