As the book was published in 1984, it contains classic movies mostly from the 60's and 70's, very few from the 80's. That was the era of videotapes & laser videodiscs, no VCDs or DVDs!

This unique guide is specially for video owners and will be of great help to users of cable television networks. Each of the 1000 titles has a critical summary and is rated in terms of age suitability. The best films are highlighted by a star-guide system and 20 exceptional titles have been given special treatment as all-time Classics. The entries include everything the video user needs to know about a film - from distributor to running time. For easy cross-reference, leading stars, directors and distributors are listed in a separate and extensive index to make sure that you find your favourite film if it is available on video.

The author, Peter Waymark, is a lifelong devotee of the cinema and is the video film critic of The
Times.
