Shipwreck survivor Edward Parker is picked up by another ship, the Apia, which is en route to deliver animal cargo and supplies to a tiny island run by Dr. Moreau. After sending a cable to his fiancee Ruth, who's waiting for him at his original return port, Parker fights with Apia Captain Davies and ends up being tossed overboard. Once on the island, he discovers that the deranged Moreau, aided by disgraced medical doctor Montgomery, has been carrying out gruesome genetic experiments, transforming animals into half-human monstrosities. As Parker desperately tries to escape the island, he develops an attraction to one of Moreau's experiments, a panther woman named Lota. Ruth, meanwhile, joins a rescue ship to go after him. As Ruth arrives and reunites with her fiance, both land in the middle of a nightmarish revolt by Moreau's grotesque victims. A fight for survival ensues as the two struggle to get to safety.
