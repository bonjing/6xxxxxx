  A small, seemingly innocuous plastic reel of film leads surveillance        
  specialist Tom Welles down an increasingly dark and frightening path.       
  With the help of the streetwise Max, Welles relentlessly follows a          
  bizarre trail of evidence to determine the fate of a complete stranger.     
  As his work turns into obsession, he drifts farther and farther away from   
  his wife, family and simple life as a small-town private eye.

  Yes, the bitrate might seem low, but the bits/pixel is 0.191 which means    
  the quality is still good.
