  The documentary was presented to WikiLeaks as focusing on the         
  WikiLeaks material, its impact, and Bradley Manning. WikiLeaks       
  participation was premised on this being the case. The promo by       
  contrast did not name Bradley Manning, and claimed to be The         
  definitive account of the wiki-saga, featuring the first major      
  television interview with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. The film  
  unites all the major protagonists for the first time. Julian         
  Assange made a five-hour long interview. We were not given viewing    
  privileges, despite requesting it. But the Guardian was. Luke         
  Harding from the Guardian previewed it on 27 November 2011 and said   
  on Twitter "Just watched new Channel 4 documentary on #Wikileaks.     
  Its lucid, engrossing and balanced. Recommend. via @C4Press", and    
  James Ball from the Guardian tweeted that he had seen it on the 27th  
  of November 2001
