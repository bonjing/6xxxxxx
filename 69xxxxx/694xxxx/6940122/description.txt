  Linda is having problems with her new family. Her husband Jeff and his    
  two teenagers are making life hell, and she turns to drink and worries    
  about Jeff having an affair. One day Elke, an old friend's sister,        
  appears at the door and moves in for a time. She proves to be intuitive   
  about the family's needs and acts as a sexual catalyst for getting the    
  family out of their relational problems.

  Edward Herman movie features a decent story line involving a              
  disfunctional family caught up in the non-communication syndrome common   
  to families where the husband has re-married to a younger woman who is    
  rejected by the teenage daughter. A bit over played and under acted but   
  saved by the sage advice (and liberal sexuality) of the "heroine", Elke   
  played convincingly by the enticing Shauna O'Brien. Griffen Drew is       
  delectable as Linda, the put-upon new wife, while Lisa Boyle is her       
  usual vixen-like self as the rejecting daughter.The sex scenes are        
  tasteful and erotic but lack emotion and passion, as is so often the      
  case in this genre of soft core films. Still the morale fiber is kind of  
  unique and the ending holds a bit of interest as everything comes         
  together and the future looks considerably brighter for all concerned.
