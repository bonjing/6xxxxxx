Who Is Simon Miller 2011 DVDRip XviD-EVO
****************************************

Plot:
     Like most families, the Millers have their challenges. Simonâ€™s (Loren Dean) frequent business trips have created some distance between him and the rest of the family, leaving Meredith (Robyn Lively) stretched and struggling to keep things together. Daughter Sarah, an 18-year-old honor student, has recently gotten herself into trouble at school while son Kevin, 15, struggles to engage with anything outside of a video gameâ€¦ But these issues all prove to be trivial when Simon goes missing. Sensing something is not right, the family frantically searches Simonâ€™s office for information. Discovery of a stash of passports, all with Simonâ€™s picture but each with a different alias, reveals that their father has been keeping more than a few secrets. In a frantic phone call, Simon urges the family not to tell anyone of his disappearance, not even the authorities, right before the line goes deadâ€¦
