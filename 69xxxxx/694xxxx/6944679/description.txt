The sub-zero temperatures and glacial conditions to which the polar regions of the Earth are often subject would make it difficult for many of us to survive there for long periods of time. Yet life is present in both the Arctic and Antarctic, and the lure of discovering new territories and resources has attracted both researchers and explorers to these icy expanses. Readers will journey alongside some of the early expeditions and will learn about the conditions and life that comprise the polar ecosystems.
