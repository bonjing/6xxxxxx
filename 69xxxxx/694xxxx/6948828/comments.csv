(that's after the 8th issues) in favor of new series Batman Incorporated (Volume 2), Earth 2, World's Finest, Dial H, GI Combat, and The Ravagers.  I know you'll all be very broken up about this, but we will make it through this.  The new titles sound like they will be interesting, if that helps soften the blow.  Although, in Hawk and Dove's case, dropping the title is more of a mercy killing.  Unfortunately, Liefeld will be working on Grifter, Hawkman, and possibly Deathstroke after the new wave hits.  Damn.  At least he isn't doing the art."
