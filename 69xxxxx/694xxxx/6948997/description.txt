ReleaseNotes:

THE ULTIMATE BEE GEES is a double-disc career retrospective featuring the group's many hits and chart-topping singles, performances of a selection of hit songs they wrote for others, and liner notes by Tim Rice. Tim Rice's liner notes accompanying THE ULTIMATE BEE GEES puts the group's extravagant popularity into perspective. 'Within this package is a collection of performances and songs that very few practitioners of popular music of the past could match for quality, originality, and emotion. It's the singing, the harmonies, the arrangements, the sound, the rivalry, the love, the intelligence, the determination, but above all it's the
songs.'

We rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.
HHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)
