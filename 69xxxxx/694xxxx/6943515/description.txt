Description

Plot:In the dead of night, a group of men â€“ including a police commissioner, a prosecutor, a doctor and a murder suspect â€“ drive through the tenebrous Anatolian countryside, the serpentine roads and rolling hills lit only by the headlights of their cars. They are searching for a corpse, the victim of a brutal murder. The suspect, who claims he was drunk, canâ€™t remember where he buried the body. As the night draws on, details about the murder emerge and the investigatorsâ€™ own secrets and hypocrisies come to light. In the Anatolian steppes, nothing is what it seems; and when the body is found, the real questions begin.
