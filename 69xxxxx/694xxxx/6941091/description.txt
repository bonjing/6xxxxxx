  Once Upon a Time in Cabramatta is the untold story of how the         
  Vietnamese community overcame the odds and found their place in       
  multicultural Australia.                                              
                                                                        
  The story begins with the landmark decision of Prime Minister Fraser  
  to open Australias doors to thousands of refugees at the end of the  
  Vietnam War. It is a moment in history that finally buries the        
  infamous White Australia Policy and transforms a nation.              
                                                                        
  The years that follow are as dramatic as they are turbulent - a       
  people struggling to find their place in a foreign land. In this one  
  tiny Sydney suburb, the 80s and 90s see the arrival of street gangs,  
  a heroin epidemic and the first political assassination in            
  Australias history.                                                  
                                                                        
  The Vietnamese people are vilified and demonised. Cabramatta it       
  seems represents all that is wrong with Asian immigration. Whats     
  more the community exist against a political backdrop that is         
  fractured, the universal support for multiculturalism a distant       
  memory.                                                               
                                                                        
  But as the century draws to a close there is a remarkable             
  turnaround. The Vietnamese people finally find their voice           
  speaking up to claim their rightful, democratic place in their        
  adopted home. Cabramatta is a community transformed. Australia, a     
  continent changed forever.
