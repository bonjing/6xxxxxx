Part of Fitzgerald\'s series of \'Songbooks\', it is the only one where the composer is also featured as a performer. This was the first time that Fitzgerald had recorded with Ellington. It is also the entry in the Songbook series that gives her by far most often the opportunity to exhibit her famous scat singing.
Fitzgerald\'s performance on this album won her the 1959 Grammy Award for Best Jazz Performance, Individual.
This album marked the start of a fruitful artistic relationship for Ella and the \'Duke\', the 1960s would see them perform on the CÃ´te d\'Azur for the 1966 album Ella and Duke at the Cote D\'Azur, and in Sweden for The Stockholm Concert, 1966. Their only other studio album, 1965\'s Ella at Duke\'s Place, was also extremely well received.
