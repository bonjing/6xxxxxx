Skullmonkeys for PSP

Also known as Klaymen.

Fantastic platformer featuring Klaymen, main character from DreamWorks adventure game Neverhood with great sense of humor.

This is the only version I found out to be working on psp with custom firmware so far. It's Japanese version, but language doesn't make any difference in gameplay.

Installation: just copy Skullmonkeys folder to ms0:\PSP\GAME\
