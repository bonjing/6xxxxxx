-----------------------------

OS/2 is a computer operating system, initially created by Microsoft and IBM, then later developed by IBM exclusively. The name stands for \\\"Operating System/2,\\\" because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM\\\'s \\\"Personal System/2 (PS/2)\\\" line of second-generation personal computers. OS/2 is no longer marketed by IBM, and IBM standard support for OS/2 was discontinued on 31 December 2006.[1] Currently, Serenity Systems sells OS/2 under the brand name eComStation.
