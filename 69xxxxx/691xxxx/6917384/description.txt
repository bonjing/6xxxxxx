Ella Fitzgerald Sings The Jerome Kern Songbook

CD Released: October 25, 1990 
Label: Verve

In contrast to the Johnny Mercer Songbook, (the only Songbook dedicated to a lyricist), this is the only Songbook where the composer does not contribute any of the lyrics.

Recorded under the keen eye of Jazz Impressario Norman Granz, who produced some of the most wonderful and cherished recordings of the 20th Century. The "Jerome Kern Songbook" is part of that magnificent Songbook series; every song on this recording is a gem and an integral part of the Great American Songbook. No one, and I mean no one, could sing a lyric like Ella. 

Nelson Riddle arranged and conducted the studio orchestra for this album, and the orchestra features some of the great musicians of the time, including Paul Smith (Ella's long-time pianist), Frank Flynn and Dick Nash.
