SYNOPSIS

The Shakabpa Lectures were given by Tsepon W.D. Shakabpa in 1985 at the Library 
of Tibetan Works and Archives (LTWA) at Dharamsala. He read passages from his 
Advanced History (now available in English) and then analyzed and expounded on 
the events and personalities at length, and explained his source materials. 
He also went into lengthy discussions on controversies and even associated gossip 
and rumours, which he could not have included in his book. At one point Shakabpa 
even sings the old accountant's song - for he had started his official career in 
the financial department.

The lectures can be purchased from the Audio/Visual section of the LTWA at Dharamsala. 
For those who are not able to get it from there, we will be releasing them here 
in a series.
