This torrent includes the official podcast mp3s released on the www.glennbeck.com website for the radio show. It includes the "4th Hour" with Pat & Stu which is available only to subscribers (ie. it is not part of the regular radio broadcast).

Sorry for the delay in posting - Friday had Joe Pags filling in for Glenn. I 'll be out of the country until January 4th, so there may be delays in posting until I get back, but every day will go up (eventually).

I had some trouble uploading these two days to TPB, but I had posted to kickass and demonoid.  I always cross post to both of those sites, so if you're desperate, you can find them.

RESIST WE MUCH! CELEBRATE WE MUCH!
