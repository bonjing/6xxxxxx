                       If not, the launcher will not autoload steam
                       and give an error message that only one copy

Installing Instructions:

Note:	Back up all original files first before extraction

- Select everything except "ReadMeFirst.txt"
- Copy or extract directly to where Skyrim is located overwriting
  the existing files (hopefully you've just backed up)
	Example of where Skyrim is located on my WinXP 64 system
	C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\skyrim


I purchased the DVD but don't want it in the drive to play the game
and this fix lets me do that. I can use the launcher with steam running
on or offline and I can also run TESV.exe directly bypassing steam.
If you are adding new mods (.esm files) you will need to run both steam
and the launcher to enable any new mods.

If you obtained the game using other methods, I encourage you to please
buy the DVD.
