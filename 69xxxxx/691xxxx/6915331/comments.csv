,Early_Riser,2012-02-04T20:30Z,"It would seem that you're right and I should have called it ""No Steam Crack"". When I first installed it, I just left the DVD in the drive assuming it was needed to prevent piracy. When I first found this crack it was labeled for no dvd and I kept the name the same. If I install the next update and crack, I will share it with the correct name. Thanks for your input. "
ing but that is something very different from a NO CD CRACK which allows the game to be played without an IMAGE loaded or a DVD in the DVD drive.  and Evidently it is you who has never played the game as running the exe file will never ask you to insert the DVD as it is a Steamworks game and will just launch STEAM (IT will never ask to insert the DVD since the game does not have any DVD check in place so inserting the DVD would not do anything since the game never tries to access it --- Thus the input and question on what this actually is since there is no need at all for a NO DVD Crack !
