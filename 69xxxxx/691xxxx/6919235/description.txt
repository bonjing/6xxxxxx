If You Are Getting A Yellow Question Mark Named "Audio Device On High Definition Audio Bus" In Your Device Manager Then Download This Driver,After A Lot Of Research I Found This Driver,I Spent Many Of My Days On This Because When You Install Windows XP On Your Intel Core 2 Duo E4500 You Have To Install Drivers Manually But If You Install Windwos 7 In Your Pc You Can Get All Drivers Automaticlly Installed On Your Computer.
