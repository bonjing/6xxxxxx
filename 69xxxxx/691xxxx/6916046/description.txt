 PLOT 

 Young poetess Rose Elliot buys a book from a local antique dealer, a diary in 
 Latin of an architect, E. Varelli. She learns of the Three Mothers, and 
 believes her apartment building is one of their houses. She pleads her
 brother Mark, who is studying musicology in Rome, to come, because she is
 afraid. Mark's friend Sara reads her letter, which he left behind in class,
 and discovers the school is run by the Mater Lacrimarum, and is killed for
 this knowledge. The house of Mater Suspiriorum has already been destroyed,
 and by the time Mark arrives in Ne York City, he is investigating his
 sister's murder.

 aGGr0 iNFO 
 
 aGGr0 has been around since 2oo2, at first mainly releasing mp3 and svcd.
 Since late 2oo3 we are only concentrating on quality rips of quality movies.
 We just love AC3 and XViD, and love those movies you won't find elsewhere.
 We are on a quest to widen the minds of those who enjoy film, with lots of
 different types of movies, from lots of different decades. From time to time
 we may release a dupe, but we don't believe that a good release in XViD is
 a dupe on a crappy release made on svcd 3 years ago. If you don't agree,
 then nuke us. We love movies, and we love to spread them for _your_ pleasure,
 not nukers. We are a small group, consisting of friends, ripping the movies
 we love to watch. If you like our releases - spread them. And remember that
 a movie worth watching is a movie worth buying. Stay drunk and stay disco!
