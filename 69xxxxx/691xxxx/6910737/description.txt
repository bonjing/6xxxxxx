::Plot::
  Brought up by a gangster named Bharat Malik, Shivam Pandit lives a faithless and reckless 
lifestyle, doing the bidding of his mentor - which also includes being a hit-man. Bharat does 
not get along with his brother, Raj, and nephew, Munna, who also resent the fact that 
Bharat trusts Shivam more than he even trusts his son, Ronnie. Shivam's life does change 
when he meets and falls in love with a devout Muslim woman, Aaliyah, who opens his eyes 
to compassion and the teachings of Pighamber Mohammad. Shivam wants to wed Aaliyah, 
but her father opposes this due to Shivam's criminal background, and the fact that he has 
been in prison twice. When Shivam insists on getting married regardless of the 
consequences, Aaliyah's dad aims a gun at him, but Shivam ducks and the bullet hits 
Aaliyah, killing her instantly. Shivam returns to his aimless lifestyle, this time in Hong Kong, 
still continuing to work for Bharat...
