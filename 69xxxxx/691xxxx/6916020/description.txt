 John Bishop's Britain sees John taking a closer and comical look at all the   
 things that affect the lives of people in the United Kingdom. John talks to   
 different members of the public about what they think about life in general on
 a various different set of topics and issues. The show also features stand up 
 comedy and short sketches.
