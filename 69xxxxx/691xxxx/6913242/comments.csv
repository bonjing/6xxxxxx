If the Christian premis of Original sin is correct which is the whole basis of Christianity, then theres three fingers pointing back at you, which is the whole message of the Gospel. God is not the reason for mans depravity he is the answer from it, and always has been. Adam once rejected, so did Satan, and heaps to have since followed,,,,,,,, loooking up into the sky blaming the ""evil God"".  Okay I have not watched the movie, but you can put God on trial and blame God. But if God is, as He said he is, then he will say one day, why didn't you listen, why did you have to choose to reject me? There is a chasm of seperation, it is one that you will choose."
