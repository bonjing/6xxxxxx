,maxilos,2012-01-12T05:22Z,@mkima haven't tried this one myself but usually you have to run the .exe in the Japanese locale for your OS(google it) or a program that emulates the locale change(example i use AppLocale instead of switching to the Japanese locale when i want to play something that needs it)
