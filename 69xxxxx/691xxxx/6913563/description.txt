Do you spend a lot of time moving and zooming windows, so you can better see and work with all the content on your Mac? Instead of doing that work yourself, let Moom handle the task for you.

Use the Mouse

Move your mouse over the green zoom button in any window, and Moom's mouse control overlay will appear (as seen in the above animation). Here's what happens when you click the various icons in Moom's mouse control overlay:

* Move & Zoom to Full Screen

* Move & Zoom to Left Half

* Move & Zoom to Right Half

* Move & Zoom to Top Half

* Move & Zoom to Bottom Half

* Revert to Original Dimensions


The Grid

Moom's mouse controls optionally include a grid that lets you resize and move windows by dragging your mouse across its segments:
You can configure the number of segments (width and height) in the grid in Moom's Settings.

Quarterly Results

Dragging the half width/height icons a few pixelsâ€”instead of clickingâ€”transforms them, giving you even more options for arranging windows:

* Move & Zoom to Top Left Quarter

* Move & Zoom to Top Right Quarter

* Move & Zoom to Bottom Right Quarter

* Move & Zoom to Bottom Left Quarter

Quarters available via dragging depend upon which icons you drag. For instance, the left half icon lets you zoom to the top left corner by dragging up, and zoom to the bottom left corner by dragging down.

Multiple Displays

Drag those icons even further towards another display, and you'll see a little arrow pop up, such as this one:


Provided there's a display there, you can combine any zoom icon with any dragging direction to zoom and move to another display at the same time.

Use the Keyboard

Keyboard mode allows you to do everything you can do in mouse mode, and more. Here are the functions you can assign to various keyboard shortcuts:
In addition to zooming windows to full/half/quarter-screen sizes, you can move them (while optionally confining them to the display), send them to another display; and center them.

Simply define a trigger hot key that activates Moom's keyboard control overlay:
While the overlay is visible, you can use easy-to-remember keys (e.g., the arrow keys) to control the frontmost window, instead of having to memorize tons of outlandish key combos.

To keep things as simple as possible, some features are controlled via sequences of keyboard inputs. For instance, to zoom a window to the top left quarter of the screen, you'd press Command-Up Arrow then Command-Left Arrow in rapid succession.
