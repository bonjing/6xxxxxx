 ( RELEASE iNFO )
                                                                     
      This is a really good movie, about one of the most spread      
      and controversial subjects; that the moon landing was fake.    
                                                                     
      Please note that is nothing wrong with the AR, the movie       
      actually looks like this on the source DVD.
