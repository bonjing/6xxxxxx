Amstrad Computer User Magazine Issues 1-90 (August 1984 - May 1992)

Amstrad Computer User (ACU) was the official mag for the Amstrad CPC
series of home micros. Originally it was a bi-monthly club newsletter,
before going monthly when the CPC664 was released in 1985. It was 
published until 1992, when it relaunched as CPC Attack (available as a
separate download).

These PDFs are the complied collections of page scans available on
wwwcpcwikieu . They've been OCR'd to allow text searching and copying
- this should prove very useful for the Amstrad archivist who'd like to
have their own local searchable archive. They look great on most PDF
readers, including the iPad.

More OCR'd scans will be periodically available - please check 
retropdfswordpresscom for more information.

Thanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum site
(wwwworldofspectrumorg), and Gryzon for the equally wonderful 
wwwcpcwikieu. 

90's style "greets" to anyone formally or currently involved in the
Amiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat
Will, mUb and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD
Grapevine. Nostalgia ain't what it used to be ;)
