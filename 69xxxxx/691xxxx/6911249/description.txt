Master Topology Files for iXtreme LT+3.0

After an exhaustive development process we are pleased to release these disc 
profile topology patches for the iXtreme LT+ v3.0 firmware. 

These patches are based on millions of angle measurements spanning hundreds of 
hours to get the most accurate values possible. 


There are currently two patches available: 


1) 
XGD2.COD-BO.COD-MW2.Halo-Reach.top.data.v1.bin 

SUITABLE FOR THE FOLLOWING GAMES ONLY: 

a) Call of Duty: Black Ops 

b) Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 

c) Halo: Reach (XGD2 ONLY, don't use this on backups of the XGD3 beta) 

These games have the exact same topology and therefore can share the same 
profile data. This was confirmed by doing at least 35 iterations of profile 
data for each game and analyzing the results. Over millions of measurements, 
not a single one deviated from the median by more than 1 degree, and there 
were no cumulative effects at all. These games are identical in the way they 
were mastered. 

2) 
XGD3.Profile.ID.F87A804E.top.data.v1.bin 

Suitable for all XGD3 games with this disc profile ID: 

0C3DF524599094E6CB87ECC8-F87A804E 

This covers all current XGD3 releases (at the time of writing) except for 
the Halo: Reach XGD3 beta. 

Checkand stay up to date with the latest news on the usual 
sites so you don't end up patching and burning the wrong data if a new XGD3 
game comes out with a different disc profile ID (there are several more 
already waiting in dae.bin). 



Media ID shouldn't matter since we always check our data against all foreign 
versions of games in DAE.bin using the targets from the v12 table and several 
unique per-Xbox v8 tables. Again, stay up to date with the latest news in case 
this situation changes. 

P.S. You may be thinking that it's better to use topology data taken from a 
specific title or pressing... and that may be true... but only if you do a 
multitude of iterations and take the average values. You would most likely 
end up with extremely similar data to ours (if your drive and disc are OK), 
with only very small deviations where measurements were right in between two 
integers, and could effectively go either way. 

We certainly don't want to discourage people from doing their own measurements, 
but please be aware that it is very easy for some drives to screw up an angle 
measurement, and even small screw ups or a general bias in timing can have a 
great impact on LT+ responses. 

P.P.S We've included an example of how we process our multitudes of iterations 
in case you think this is all a bunch of BS. It's a massive html file so be 
careful if you don't think your system or browser can handle it.
