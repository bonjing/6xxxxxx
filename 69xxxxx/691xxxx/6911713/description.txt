These files were not ripped by me, chabosun, but by the folks atwho have distributed them throughAccording to the supplied log, they were ripped with EAC and encoded with FLAC 1.2.1. While I can't 100% vouch for the accuracy of this info, the files sound 
excellent and the scarcity of the material in question compels me to upload this rip regardless.

Q: Why are you uploading someone else's rip when their rip is still available?
A: (1) As far as I know, this album is not readily available in FLAC on TPB or other torrent networks. (2) It deserves, imho, as wide an audience as possible. (3) I don't trustto continue to make it available; in the hands of hundreds of seeders, it will be less likely to disappear from the internet than is the single copy on HFS40k.

So: Please seed for as long as you can! --c
