[DESCRIPTION]
I guess i have a bit of compulsive disorder... everything has to be perfect,
if not .. it nags at me until i do it/fix it. Although the 1st version is
perfectly fine.. im a perfectionist... here's a sort of changelog:

1. AdobePSPortable Rev.1
* This is an update to 'AdobePSPortable' i released a few days ago.
* Cleaned up the code for better, faster performance.
* Added PDF, Color, Camera Raw support.

2. Adobe Bridge CS5.1 Portable
* I also decided to add 'Adobe Bridge' :)
* Now these 2 apps. cannot communicate because it requires Switchboard service.
* But 'Adobe Bridge' is still useful for Photographers as it allows you to 
import pictures from your camera. I also added the Camera Raw Plug-in. 
* You can use 'AdobePSPortable' & 'BridgePortable' simultaneously :)

3. Camera Raw 6.6 Camera & Lens Profiles Plugin
* The reason i did not add this into 'AdobePSPortable' because of the size:
it's almost 300MB. 
* This is only for Photographers who really need the additional Camera/Lens 
Profiles. If you're not a Photographer: do not download.
* Due to the enormous size, load time takes longer... so only add this to 
'AdobePSPortable' if you really, really need/use it.
* For a complete listing of all Camera/Lens Profiles:

[NOTES]
* Fonts: install on your computer and Photoshop will be able to use it: i 
highly recommend a Font Manger to avoid installion which leads to a slow
PC. I use 'NexusFont': www.portablefreeware.com/index.php?id=731
* You can add more plugins by installing into:
AdobePSPortable &gt; App &gt; Photoshop &gt; Plug-ins
* make sure you test for 'stealth': many plugins leave trash behind.
* The same applies to Styles, Gradients, Actions, etc:
Install into: AdobePSPortable &gt; App &gt; Photoshop &gt; Presets
* You can greatly enhance Photoshop's performance by adjusting the RAM in 
settings.
* If you experience slow startup, check your plugins, you may have too many.
* This includes the latest updates as of December 23, 2011.
