Plot:
Even though India attained independence from the British, several Maharajas continue with their oppressive regimes including widower Balbirsingh. Living with him in his mansion are his rather subdued children: Pratap, Hemlata, Rajendra and Ashalata. They are instructed to conduct themselves as royals even when alone with their father, who they can only address as 'Your Highness'. For several years Hemlata has lost the use of her legs, is refusing treatment, tasteless food, and wants to die. Balbir then appoints Dr. Sanjay to treat her, he does so enthusiastically, she responds positively, and both are drawn to each other and fall in love. With the Government threatening to dismantle such regimes, Balbir must first deal with Hemlata's romance, and then decides to contest elections, ensure that he wins by hook or by crook, so that he can continue to rule the region with impunity.
