Release Notes:

In the lowest layers of the Dungeons of Dredmor, deeper than any man
or woman has ever previously explored, lies the Realm of the Diggle
Gods: giant, muscular things, created by the First Diggle in days of
old, throbbing with potent gristly muscle and waiting to lay waste to
any adventurer who dares to cross their path

Deep within their underground temples, Lord Dredmor plots the next
stage in his campaign of merciless brutality and world-terrorizing

He s probably sitting on an egg while he does it. There are a bunch of
very large eggs down there, some of which are quite comfortable

With six new skill trees, five new dungeon levels, a dozen new monster
types, over one hundred new items, and a host of new rooms, features
and traps, the Realm of the Diggle Gods will challenge any adventurer
from a novice sword-poker to an advanced master of the arcane arts

The Diggle Gods await your worship. It s a very nice dungeon you have
here, and it d be a shame if anything happened to it
