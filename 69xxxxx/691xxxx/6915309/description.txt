            Plot: Helen Lyle is a student who decides to write a thesis
                  about local legends and myths. She visits a part of
                  the town, where she learns about the legend of the
                  Candyman, a one-armed man who appears when you say
                  his name five times, in front of a mirror. Of course,
                  Helen doesn't believe all this stuff, but the people
                  of the area are really afraid. When she ignores their
                  warnings and begins her investigation in the places
                  that he is rumored to appear, a series of horrible
                  murders begins. Could the legend be true?

       aGGr0 was founded in 2oo2, consisting of only one member.
      Now we're a few more, spreading our love and joy throughout
       the world. At first, we mainly did svcd and mp3, but since
        november 2oo3 we're just into xvid (and a dvdr or two,
         occasionally). Our goal is to satisfy those who like
       movies, and watching them in the best quality attainable
        by xvid, with ac3 sound and vobsubs whenever possible.
       We release a variety of types of movies, both horror and
         comedies, drama and pure b-crap. All our releases are
              made from retail dvd's and we own them all.
                Remember, kids! A movie worth watching
                    a second time is worth buying!

              Let the light of the movie lovers guide you!
