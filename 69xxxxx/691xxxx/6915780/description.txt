Take static pages and turn them into a dynamic website!

Perhaps you know how to create a static website using HTML/CSS, but now you want to learn how to create dynamic, data-driven websites. If you're new to PHP and MySQL, this book-and-DVD package is an ideal introduction to working with website pages that contain a mixture of HTML and PHP/MySQL. Author Andrea Tarr starts with what you knowâ€”an HTML/CSS websiteâ€”and step by step she teaches you how to replace and enhance the site using PHP to create and manipulate your HTML pages and MySQL to bring in your data. You learn how to design, create, and use databases with MySQL, both within PHP programs and using the popular phpMyAdmin program. Explaining the programming principles as you go along, this book-and-DVD combination provides you with a solid understanding of the fundamentals of PHP and the basics of object-oriented programming.
