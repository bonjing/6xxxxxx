A concise yet comprehensive guide to trauma evaluation and management covering the full scope of injuries

    * Extremity Trauma: oriented from hand to shoulder and then from hip to foot
    * Special Groups: focuses on trauma in children, pregnancy, and the elderly
    * Environmental Issues: covers temperature extremes as well as weapons of mass destruction
