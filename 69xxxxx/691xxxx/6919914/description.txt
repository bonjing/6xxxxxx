Shrimad Valmiki Ramayana - Yuddha Kanda Uttarardh [Team Nanban][TPB]



About Valmiki:



"Valmiki" (during Lord Rama's time) is celebrated as the poet harbinger 
in Sanskrit literature. 

He is the author of the epic Ramayana, based on the attribution in the text of 
the epic itself.

He is revered as the Adi Kavi, which means First Poet, for he discovered the first sloka 
i.e. first verse, which set the base and defined the form to Sanskrit poetry.

The Ramayana, originally written by Valmiki, consists of 24,000 verses in seven cantos 
(some say six i.e. excluding the Uttara Ramayana) (Kandas). 

The Ramayana tells the story of a prince, Rama of Ayodhya, whose wife Sita is abducted 
by the demon (Raakshasa) king of Lanka, Ravana. 

The Valmiki Ramayana is dated variously from 500 BC to 100 BC, or about co-eval with 
early versions of the Mahabharata.

As with many traditional epics, it has gone through a long process of interpolations 
and redactions, making it impossible to date accurately.



SHORT DESCRIPTION ON Shrimad Valmiki Ramayana - Yuddha Kanda Uttarardh:




This book describes the battle between the forces of Rama and Ravana. 

Having received Hanuman's report on Sita, Rama and Lakshmana proceed with their allies 
towards the shore of the southern sea. 

There they are joined by Ravana's renegade brother Vibhishana. 

The monkeys named "Nal" and "Neel" construct a floating bridge (known as Rama Setu) 
across the ocean, and the princes and their army cross over to Lanka. 
A lengthy battle ensues and Rama kills Ravana. 

Rama then installs Vibhishana on the throne of Lanka.

On meeting Sita, Rama asks her to undergo agni Pariksha (test of fire) to prove her purity,
since she had stayed at the demon's palace. 

When Sita plunges into the sacrificial fire, Agni the lord of fire raises Sita, unharmed,
to the throne, attesting to her purity.
