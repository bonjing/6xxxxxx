    Eric, a brilliant young German officer, is transfered back to Berlin.    
    His superior officer tells him about his new assignment on the           
    Russian front and then invites him to a luxurious villa. Gathered in     
    the mansion are the most beautiful women: the army's special services    
    could enroll for the pleasure of its returning heroes.Eric is            
    stupefied to recognize Renata among the women, who are all ready and     
    willing to make love with any officer present. Not many years ago,       
    while still students, Renata and Eric had been very much in love.        
    After making love in a room put at their disposal, Renata tells him      
    that she had no choice but to accept joining the army as an official     
    camp follower: her father's survival depended on it. The following       
    morning, Renata leaves in a special women's convoy for Eastern front     
    where they are scheduled to entertain hard-pressed officers and men.     
    Will Eric and Renata's love survive those adventures?
