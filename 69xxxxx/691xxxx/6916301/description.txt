Navigating waters with no visible landmarks or shallow shorelines can be a daunting task for even the most experienced navigator. Pair our HomePort trip planning softwareÂ¹ with your existing BlueChartÂ® data and view map details such as underwater hazards and hidden obstacles so you can plan a route to avoid them.
