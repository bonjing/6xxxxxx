Hybrid laser-arc welding (HLAW) is a combination of laser welding with arc welding. It overcomes some of the shortfalls of both processes. Hybrid laser-arc welding combines deep weld penetration of laser welding with good gap tolerance of gas metal arc welding (GMAW). HLAW can also enhance the metallurgical stability of a finished component, giving welds that are stronger and less brittle. This important book provides a comprehensive account of hybrid laser-arc welding including technological aspects, hybrid welding of metals, applications and future trends.

Key Features: reviews arc and laser welding including both advantages and disadvantages of the hybrid laser-arc approach; explores the characteristics of the process including the properties of joints produced by hybrid laser-arc welding and ways of assessing weld quality; examines applications of the process including magnesium alloys, aluminium and steel with specific focus on applications in the shipbuilding and automotive industries.

Contents: Part 1 Characteristics of hybrid laser-arc welding: Advantages and disadvantages of arc and laser welding; Fundamentals of hybrid laser-arc welding; Heat sources of hybrid laser-arc welding processes; Effect of shielding gas on hybrid laser-arc welding; Properties of joints produced by hybrid laser-arc welding; Quality control and assessing weld quality in hybrid laser-arc welding. Part 2 Applications of hybrid laser-arc welding: Hybrid welding of magnesium alloys; Shipbuilding applications of hybrid laser-arc welding; Industrial robotic application of laser-GMAW and laser-Tandem hybrid welding; Hybrid laser-arc welding of aluminium; Hybrid laser-arc welding of dissimilar metals. Part 3 Hybrid laser-arc welding of steel: Hybrid laser-arc welding of steel.
