OLD TIME RADIO:


THE SOUND OF WAR



The Sound of War is an 18 episode collection. Jay Hickerson's "The Ultimate Guide to all Circulating Shows" states that this is how many were produced.

The series used the tagline "The Actual Sound Record of World War II. A drama preserved for all time through the medium of radio. An era not to be forgotten." The Sound of War contains many sound clips, some rare from such notable figures as Adolf Hitler, Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, Benito Mussolini, Neville Chamberlin, General Douglas McArthur, Charles DeGaulle, Hermann Goering, and many more.

It's not clear when the show was broadcast but they appear to be from the late 1950s or early 1960s. There are three episodes that are all labeled "The Fall of France" but they are indeed unique to each other. The producers seemed to place an emphasis on this period for some unknown reason.

The shows were produced by Bud Greenspan and narrated by his brother David Greenspan, also known as David Perry. The two went on to produce many film sports documentaries largely about the Olympics.
