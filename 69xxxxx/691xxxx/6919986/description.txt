Dragon User Magazine Issues 01-69 (May 1983 - October 1989)

Dragon User was a magazine published by Sunshine Publications for the
users of the niche Dragon 32/64 UK home micros. It ran for longer than
many of it's contemporaries for more successful platforms, and featured
reviews, listings and news. Towards the end of it's life the format
changed towards more of a newsletter than magazine, before ceasing
publication in late '89.

These PDFs are the complied collections of page scans available on
public Torrent trackers. They've been OCR'd to allow text searching and
copying - this should prove very useful for the retro archivist who'd
like to have their own local searchable archive. They look great on most
PDF readers, including the iPad. The OCR software has increased the file
size slightly.

More OCR'd scans will be periodically available - please check
retropdfswordpresscom for more information.

Thanks to all the visitors to RetroPDFs for their continued support.
Please keep this torrent seeded for as long as possible!

90's style "greets" to anyone formally or currently involved in the
Amiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat
Will, mUb and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD
Grapevine. Nostalgia ain't what it used to be ;)
