Writing titles in all lower case, without indicating the release year of the film, is rather sloppy.
A better posting title for this torrent would be: ""The Punisher (1989)""
And the IMDb code for the torrent posting  would be ""tt0098141"", since it is this movie:  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098141/"
