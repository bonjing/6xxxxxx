,diguoemo,2011-12-28T17:16Z,this version is useing a hd camera to shoot .maybe waiting for real dvd is a good choose
because it is a camera recording in a cinema! 

Audio is alright but video not that good. It is quite pixelated. Video does have Chinese (simplified) and English subtitles. 
Also there is an annoying Chinese text commercial on the top of the screen non-stop during the whole movie. 
I am sorry to say, but this is not a worthwhile download because it is a cam! "
