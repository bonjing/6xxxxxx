NOTES:

Ok no bullshit from us,this is a re-ecnode of unknowns release...could have gone and got the russian video but it 
was easier this way as the subs had already been HC :D
Right video is lower Q if honest and looked dark and dull and lacked some colour ...also thought touch too much red.
Audio was nice but abit lifeless and needed some TLC.
Video we did brighten and also increased contrast to keep the black levels decent...but did push up the intes to make it
even brighter.
Chroma was increased and also tweaked the rgb colours ....no sharpness used as it would make it even worse.
Audio ....was a nightmare and guessing to do with how it was synced...but in the end managed to strip it and clean it.We
used a hiss removal,changed all the EQ bands and also levelled out the channels.
Was a pita to remux to our encode,but found a work around ;-)
Please check sample for Q and yes the dark scenes are still dark,but overall watchable on a small screen.
