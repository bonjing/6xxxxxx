Naglfar Discography:

Just picked this up from a friend\\\'s house of mine by way of External Hard-disk and sneaker net (my own two feet).

I wanted to start returning to the torrent community and share the love, I\\\'ve built up quite a collection of metal over the years that has been wiped out and rebuilt more than once.

When I have more time I\\\'ll put together black metal packs of some of my favorite bands but for now I just want to get more black metal torrents up on TPB.

I love these bands, if I had more disposable income to buy CDs I would but I try and go to concerts and send them fan mail to let them know how they affect my life. I do this not just because I want to return to the torrent community but because pirate or not, wrong or right, having access to Black Metal and music in general has saved my life. Even though this stuff is dark and grim as fuck it is a huge release for me, if I didn\\\'t have this I would have fucking done myself in a long time ago. It gives me inspiration it makes me feel powerful it makes me feel like a complete human being.

I want to share that with all of you...

Happy Holidays

Cheers,
