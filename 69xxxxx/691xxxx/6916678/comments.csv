After I examine the health of the torrent at the 48 hour mark I may suspend seeding at night when I go to bed but hang in there I'll make sure that I continue to seed without interruption until the total number of seeders grows so if you have patience it will eventually finish. Please seed if possible! (paranoia has often times kept me from seeding and so I understand that not everyone can always pay it back to the community.) Pass on the gift of good music by seeding! "
