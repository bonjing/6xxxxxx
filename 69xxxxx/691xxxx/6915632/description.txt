The Madison Square Garden performance on July 26, 1972 is one of those fine moments in Rolling Stones live recorded history. Perhaps it's the fact that it was Jagger's 29th birthday that made such a difference. The energy and delivery of the performance is captured in an incredible "line" soundboard stereo recording. The "wide" stereo separation features Richards and keyboards on the left, Taylor on the right, drums and vocal in the middle, and horns split between the two channels.
