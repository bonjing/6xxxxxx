,s4r4hb3th,2012-03-25T03:33Z,You said Tracker Haha
current TPB trackers situation for this torrent is:
http://tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce - No connection could be made because the target machine actively refusing it.
udp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80 - working
udp://tracker.publicbt.com:80 - Connection timed out.
So, 1 of 3 is working, and it could also go down. Good phone books will enable you to start talking faster.
By the way, tracker.publicbt.com is working great over HTTP.
All in all, I want to have list of working trackers in seconds when I need it out of my house and I hope others will find it very useful for fast seeding private torrents."
