A collection of best icon themes,GNOME-shell themes,GTK 3.x themes and x11
cursor themes available on the web. I got these from http://gnome-look.org.

The credit goes to the original developers of these themes.

Tips for installing themes
===========================

1.   Extract the file.

2.a. To make the themes available to all users,
          - Start nautilus as root.
          - Copy contents of 'icons' folder to /usr/share/icons
          - Copy contents of 'themes' folder to /usr/share/themes

2.b. Or you can create '.themes' and '.icons' in your home directory and 
     copy contents of corresponding folders.

3.   You'll need Gnome-Tweak Tool for changing themes...
     Run in terminal.

       sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ricotz/testing
       sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3

     Install gnome-tweak-settings by..
     
       sudo apt-get update
       sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool
       sudo apt-get install gnome-shell-extensions-user-theme


4.   Run the Gnome Tweak Tool
       
       gnome-tweak-tool

5.   Configure Gnome Tweak Tool
     
     In "Shell Extensions" enable "User Themes Extension"
     Now you can change everything  under "Theme" section

6.   Refresh the desktop by..
     Press Alt-f2
     Type r
     Press return.
