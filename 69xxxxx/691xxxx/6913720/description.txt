Before the name Jimmy Page became synonymous with Led Zeppelin and Hard Rock guitar, the guitarist was a much sought-after session player, appearing on an assortment of artists' recordings. Some were well known (The Kinks, The Who, Joe Cocker), others somewhat more obscure, such as this rare album with vocalist Keith The Groot, which additionally features half a dozen of the cream of the crop of British studio musicians. Including future Led Zeppelin bass player John Paul Jones, and Nicky Hopkins, later often found tickling the ivories in the company of The Rolling Stones.
