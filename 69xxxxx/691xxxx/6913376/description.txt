Book Description

How does MongoDB help you manage a huMONGOus amount of data collected through your web application? With this authoritative introduction, youâ€™ll learn the many advantages of using document-oriented databases, and discover why MongoDB is a reliable, high-performance system that allows for almost infinite horizontal scalability.
