,embarreira,2012-02-27T04:20Z,Just adding information to the previous post: I have used TRUNCATED burn with CloneCD. And my xbox region is NTSC-U.
0 - 2.4x on CloneCD, never could, I guess my DVD drive is not able to do it). The DVD midia I have used is the same I always use, Ridata.
My Xbox Slim (Drive Lite-On 0225) with LT+ 3.0 has read the disc. The game works perfectly.
Thanks for the uploader."
