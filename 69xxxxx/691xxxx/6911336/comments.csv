,Phntzm79,2012-01-18T16:09Z,"Lana Del Rey[Elizabeth Grant] is taking a lot of criticism after her Saturday Night Live performance from super ugly, crazy Scientologist actor turned singer Juliette Lewis! This ugly bitch is so crazy she attacks Elizabeth Grant one day then changes her mind the next day! Elizabeth Grant was clearly really nervous about the SNL gig, and it showed! Big Fuckin' Deal! She is human! In defense of Elizabeth Grant, I will upload what I think is her best live performance of the song Video Games from the Corinthia Hotel in London.Peace, Phantazm79 "
