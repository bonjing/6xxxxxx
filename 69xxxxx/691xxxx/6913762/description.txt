Shrimad Valmiki Ramayana - Sundara Kanda[Team Nanban][TPB]



About Valmiki:



"Valmiki" (during Lord Rama's time) is celebrated as the poet harbinger in Sanskrit literature. 

He is the author of the epic Ramayana, based on the attribution in the text of the epic itself.

He is revered as the Adi Kavi, which means First Poet, for he discovered the first sloka i.e. first verse, which set the base and defined the form to Sanskrit poetry.

The Ramayana, originally written by Valmiki, consists of 24,000 verses in seven cantos (some say six i.e. excluding the Uttara Ramayana) (Kandas). 

The Ramayana tells the story of a prince, Rama of Ayodhya, whose wife Sita is abducted by the demon (Raakshasa) king of Lanka, Ravana. 

The Valmiki Ramayana is dated variously from 500 BC to 100 BC, or about co-eval with early versions of the Mahabharata.

As with many traditional epics, it has gone through a long process of interpolations and redactions, making it impossible to date accurately.



SHORT DESCRIPTION ON Shrimad Valmiki Ramayana - Sundara Kanda:



The Sundara Kanda forms the heart of Valmiki's Ramayana and consists of a detailed, 
vivid account of Hanuman's adventures.

After learning about Sita, Hanuman assumes a gargantuan form and makes a colossal leap 
across the ocean to Lanka. 

Here, Hanuman explores the demon's city and spies on Ravana. 

He locates Sita in Ashoka grove, who is wooed and threatened by Ravana 
and his rakshasis to marry Ravana.

He reassures her, giving Rama's signet ring as a sign of good faith. 

He offers to carry Sita back to Rama, however she refuses, 
reluctant to allow herself to be touched by a male other than her husband. 

She says that Rama himself must come and avenge the insult of her abduction.


Hanuman then wreaks havoc in Lanka by destroying trees and buildings, 
and killing Ravana's warriors. 

He allows himself to be captured and produced before Ravana. 

He gives a bold lecture to Ravana to release Sita. 

He is condemned and his tail is set on fire, but he escapes his bonds and, 
leaping from roof to roof, sets fire to Ravana's citadel and makes the giant leap back from the island. 

The joyous search party returns to Kishkindha with the news.
