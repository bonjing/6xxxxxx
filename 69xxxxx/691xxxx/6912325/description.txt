Malliswari (Telugu: à°®à°²à±à°²à±€à°¶à±à°µà°°à°¿) is a 1951 Telugu musical film directed by B. N. Reddi and produced by Vauhini Studios, with songs penned by the famous Devulapalli Krishnasastri. This film is based on Buchi Babuâ€™s radio play Rayala Karunakrutyam.[1]

B. N. Reddy recalls: "When I went to Hampi to shoot my first film Vande Mataram in 1939, I was deeply attracted to Sri Krishna Devarayalu. I wanted to make a film on Sri Krishna Devaraya. Years passed by. But I could not get the right story. Fortunately, Malliswari happened. I think it is the best movie I have directed."[2]


The plot

During the days of the Vijayanagara Empire there was a system to bring willing women to the royal palace and render them official residents. This was called 'Rani Vasam'. According to this royal tradition, they sent palanquins to their houses, after they presented the family with gifts and jewelry. These Rani Vasam women should never have any contact with any man or let any man see them without permission. If any one violated the law, they were beheaded.

Malleswari (Bhanumathi) was taken to this Rani Vasam. She was forced to accept this, for lure of money and jewelry by her parents. But she was already in love with her 'Bava' Nagaraju (N.T. Rama Rao), a sculptor. He stealthily got into the garden of the palace to meet his beloved and was caught. He was to get the death penalty. Krishnadevaraya for once pardoned the hero and allowed Malleswari to go with him.
