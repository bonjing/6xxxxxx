The Sims Medieval: Pirates & Nobles Adventure Pack gives players the sandbox
style freedom to play as they want, without neglecting guided gameplay in
which they will find new quests and one new Kingdom Ambition.

A player\\\'s heroic story begins when the Pirates of Aarbyville and the Nobles
of Tredony arrive in the kingdom, followed quickly by sword fights, love
affairs, grand adventures and mysteries. For those who enjoy the rush of
heroic missions, new exhilarating quests expand upon the original adventures
like finding the fountain of youth or protecting the kingdom from an evil
sorcerer. The war between Tredony and Aarbyville creates the new Kingdom
Ambition and opportunity for players to suit up their kingdoms. Players can
choose to be anyone from a king or queen to a knight or blacksmith, and with
that, prepare for voyage accordingly. Treasure hunting is an exciting new
gameplay feature in the pack with maps, shovels, rare treasures and
surprising dangers, while challenging players to find hidden objects and
search for desirable rewards that will benefit their hero Sims. Other new
items include birds that you can name and train, and interrogation chairs.
