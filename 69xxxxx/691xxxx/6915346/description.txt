Sepultura (Portuguese for "grave") is a Brazilian heavy metal band from Belo Horizonte, formed in 1984. The band was a major force in the death metal, thrash metal and ultimately groove metal realms during the late 1980s and early 1990s, with their later experiments melding nu metal, hardcore punk and industrial. Sepultura have released 12 studio albums so far, the latest being Kairos (2011). Their most successful records are Arise (1991), Chaos A.D. (1993), and Roots (1996).
