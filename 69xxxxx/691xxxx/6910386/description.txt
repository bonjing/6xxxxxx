ReleaseNotes:

America formed in 1970 in England as the sons of Air Force military men. The trio wrote some of the seventies most beautifully crafted songs, merging both elements of folk and rock. Their first hit "A Horse With No Name" became a huge hit in 1972, soon to be followed by "Sandman" and "I Need You" all of which were on their debut top selling album "America". Their second album "Homecoming" again became a top selling album and produced the hits "Ventura Highway" and "Don't Cross The River". America continued to release numerous albums throughout the seventies and into the eighties. This collection gives one a good retrospective of the band's output (with only a few minor deletions) including such hits as "Muskrat Love", "Tin Man","Lonely People", "Sister Golden Hair", "Daisy Jane", "You Can Do
Magic" plus more . Their big hits are all here and the entire collection is beautifully remastered by Rhino Records.  If you enjoy listening to groups such as Bread, Three Dog Night, Steely Dan, The Eagles (to name just a few) then this collection will not disappoint.

We rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.
