ohGr - Hollywood Fallout

El Rey Theatre, Hollywood
Los Angeles, CA, USA
December 11, 2011

Tour Western Fallout 001


Band: Ogre, Justin Bennett, William Morrison, and Jeff Smith.

Special Guests: Bill Moseley, Tim Skold, and Matthew Setzer.


Recorded by bronzebed using: Sony Hi-MD Walkman MZ-RH1; Sound Professionals CMC-4U with 4.7K Low Sensitivity Modification (Audio Technica Cardioid Stereo Microphones); Sound Professionals SB-11 (Micro-Mini Battery Module with Bass Roll-Off, utilized 69Hz Roll-off Frequency).

Sound Info: The audio has been converted to FLAC and is lossless. Modifications: volume has been increased, EQd and slightly compressed. Ogre was singing through a megaphone on Psychoreal & Shhh which is why the vocals sound the way they do for those songs. Sorry about the talking throughout the first few songs of the show. There were 2 guys and a chick talking across me almost directly into the mics. That stopped after a few songs.

Video Info: Sony Cybershot Model DSC-W290 (Digital Still Camera) 12.1 Megapixels. 720p Hi-Def. Audio & Video quality is pretty good for a cheap camera.

Picture Info: Nikon Coolpix S6100 (Digital Still Camera) 16.0 Megapixels. Pics really suck.
