Cultural imperialism and acculturation find close counterparts in many of the policies and attitudes of Napoleonic administrators in their Italian provinces, explored here from the rich archival sources of the Parisian and Italian archives, long neglected by scholars. Broers repositions the context in which the Napoleonic empire can be studied, and reconfigures the political and historical geography of Italy, in the century before its Unification in 1859.
