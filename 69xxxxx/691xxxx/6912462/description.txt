Taking its title as a mockery of U2's self-mocking Achtung Baby, Oy Vey Baby is one last dying gasp of the failed David Bowie's Tin Machine project. Not reaching nearly the appeal that was expected, with many Bowie fans being downright virulent in their dislike of this group, the Machine was unable to support themselves. (Interestingly, the roadies for this group were known to sport T-shirts that read "F*** You, I LIKE Tin Machine"). 
This is a rough record. The polished songs of Tin Machine II do not translate well to a live recording. Static and a noisy energy level are maintained throughout much of the record, causing the songs to meld together. You do get to hear Reeves Gabrels really cut loose in places, and fans of experimental guitar work will find a lot to dig for on this record. And it does have its strong moments as well: Amazing, You Belong in Rock & Roll, and Goodbye Mr. Ed have great treatment.
