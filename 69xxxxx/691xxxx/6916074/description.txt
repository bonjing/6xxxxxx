            Plot: Get Over It tells the tale of a high school boy
                  who is down on his luck. He loses his girlfriend
                  and will do anything to get her back - including
                  quitting the basketball team and trying out for an
                  acting role in a Shakespeare play. But as soon as
                  he stops moping over his break up, he begins to
                  take interest in his best friend's little sister
                  (Kirsten Dunst), and finds that romance is
                  everywhere.

       aGGr0 was founded in 2oo2, consisting of only one member.
      Now we're a few more, spreading our love and joy throughout
       the world. At first, we mainly did svcd and mp3, but since
        november 2oo3 we're just into xvid (and a dvdr or two,
         occasionally). Our goal is to satisfy those who like
       movies, and watching them in the best quality attainable
        by xvid, with ac3 sound and vobsubs whenever possible.
       We release a variety of types of movies, both horror and
         comedies, drama and pure b-crap. All our releases are
              made from retail dvd's and we own them all.
                Remember, kids! A movie worth watching
                    a second time is worth buying!
