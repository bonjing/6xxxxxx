These files were not ripped by me, chabosun, but (ostensibly) by the folks at holyfuckingshit40000 dot bl0gsp0t dot comic-minus-the-ic who have distributed them through M3g@Upl0@d. While I can't 100% vouch for the quality of the ripping process, the files sound excellent and the scarcity of the material in question compels me to upload it regardless. According to ffmpeg, they're 320 kb/s MP3.

Q: Why are you uploading someone else's rip when their copy is still available for download?
A: (1) As far as I know, this album is not readily available. (2) It deserves, imho, as wide an audience as possible. (3) I don't trust M3g@Upl0@d to continue to make it available; in the hands of hundreds (wishful thinking, I know) of seeders, it will be less likely to disappear from the internet than is the single copy on M3g@Upl0@d.

Please seed for as long as you can. Let's keep these hard-to-find rips alive and available to anyone interested.
