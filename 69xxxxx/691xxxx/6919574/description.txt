Resident Evil 2 for PSP with custom firmware. This is proper conversion straight from PSN. Tested on CFW 5.50 Gen-d3, but should work on any CFW. 

Instalation: just copy Resident Evil 2 folder to ms0:\PSP\GAME\

IMPORTANT: in case of game not loading into menu properly, or freezing at the beginning, just set disc loading speed to high.
