If you grew up in the 70\\\'s, you probably had one of these in your kitchen: a plastic box in harvest gold or avocado green. Nestled snugly inside was a treasure trove of over 600 recipes, tested and approved by the culinary geniuses at the Betty Crocker kitchens, guaranteed to make the busy homemaker a master of American haute cuisine. And the food photographs on each card, oh my! I spent hours as a child flipping through the cards just to look at the pictures. 

I scanned all these cards from my personal collection. Enjoy!
