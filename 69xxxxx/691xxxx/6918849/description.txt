This upload is a reseed. The rip was created by an unknown user, and it is currently only available via magnet on T0rr!ndex. It's an excellent rip created with cdparanoia and FLAC 1.2.1; I hope TPB appreciates it and gives it new life. Kudos to the original creator, whoever he/she is.

Tureck's recordings are terrific, and rightfully considered something of a counterpart to Gould's versions. Highly recommended.

Please seed at least 1:1, if possible. --chabosun
