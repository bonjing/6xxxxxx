TABLELAND is a culinary expedition in search of the people, place and taste of North American small-scale, sustainable food production. Director Craig Noble argues for the re-localization of North American food systems, and a return to a fresher, healthier way of feeding ourselves. From the orchards of BC, the inner city gardens of Chicago to the Napa Highlands and everywhere in between, TABLELAND showcases the successful production of tasty, local, and seasonal food from field to plate.
