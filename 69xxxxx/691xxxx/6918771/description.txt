Release Notes
==========================================================================

October 27th 2007 the first ever Full On Ferry was hosted in the Ahoy in
Rotterdam.
The party itself had the theme "Masquerade" mainly referring to the
masks Ferry put aside, but it was also the name of the music theme /
anthem.

More than four years later it FINALLY sees a full release. Enjoy!
