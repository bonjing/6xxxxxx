Notez:
Luckily for all of us, once again someone screwed up and the new orignal animated 
scooby film was put out for rent on one of the Digital VOD suppliers months early. 
The new animated film doesnt hit DVD & BD until March of next year, so enjoy the new
Scooby-Doo original animated film a few months early!

P.S.
Even though the VOD Rental was Standard Definition it still included Dolby Digital 5.1
audio so i being an audiophile included that in the encode aswell for others who
might like it, it is not a custom 5.1 track, it is the real deal included in the wmv
rental file! Enjoy!

SHOUTS GO OUT TO:
