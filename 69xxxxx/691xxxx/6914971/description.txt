            Plot: The graduating class of the local high school is
                  going on a cruise with Jason as a stowaway. The
                  heroine believes she was almost drowned by Jason
                  as a child. Jason eventually sinks the boat and
                  kills many of the students on it, but many of them
                  escape to Manhattan. A long battle with Jason
                  ensues until Jason is washed away in the New York
                  sewers by a midnight flooding of toxic waste.

       aGGr0 was founded in 2oo2, consisting of only one member.
      Now we're a few more, spreading our love and joy throughout
       the world. At first, we mainly did svcd and mp3, but since
        november 2oo3 we're just into xvid (and a dvdr or two,
         occasionally). Out goal is to satisfy those who like
       movies, and watching them in the best quality attainable
        by xvid, with ac3 sound and vobsubs whenever possible.
       We release a variety of types of movies, both horror and
         comedies, drama and pure b-crap. All our releases are
              made from retail dvd's and we own them all.
                Remember, kids! A movie worth watching
                    a second time is worth buying!
