Billy Cox is a legendary musician and is know as the bass player who accompanied Jimi Hendrix. He first met Hendrix in the Air Force and the two became friends. Each one vowed that whoever made it first would call for the other one to join him. Hendrix made it first in Europe with the Jimi Hendrix Experience; however Cox could not join him because of a prior obligation. Billy Cox would officially join Hendrix in his groups Gypsy Sun And Rainbows, the post Jimi Hendrix Experience and the Band Of Gypsys. The Band of Gypsys featured Billy Cox on bass, Jimi Hendrix on guitar and lead vocals and Buddy Miles on drums and vocals. They became the first full black rock band in history. 
Old School Blue Blues contains twelve tracks of good blues music. The title track contains a traditional Blues feel and Cox mentions Bobby Bland in his vocals. The album also contains a recording of the Cox Last Gypsy Standing, which is a psychedelic rock nod back to the Band of Gypsys. Tracks ten and eleven moves slightly away from the Blues, which has a Latin and Smooth Jazz feel. The Blues and psychedelic fan will enjoy this  especially if you are a disciple of the Jimi Hendrix music movement. Billy Cox is the last Gypsy standing and pays homage to old school blues.
