            Plot: The conclusion of the trilogy sends Marty McFly on
                  a rescue mission to the year 1885, where he must
                  save Doc Brown from death at the hands of yet
                  another member of the Tannen clan. However, there
                  are a number of complications preventing a quick
                  return to the future: a lack of gasoline for the
                  time-traveling DeLorean, a band of gunslinging
                  outlaws and a schoolmarm with affections for the
                  smitten Doc.

       aGGr0 was founded in 2oo2, consisting of only one member.
      Now we're a few more, spreading our love and joy throughout
       the world. At first, we mainly did svcd and mp3, but since
        november 2oo3 we're just into xvid (and a dvdr or two,
         occasionally). Our goal is to satisfy those who like
       movies, and watching them in the best quality attainable
        by xvid, with ac3 sound and vobsubs whenever possible.
       We release a variety of types of movies, both horror and
         comedies, drama and pure b-crap. All our releases are
              made from retail dvd's and we own them all.
                Remember, kids! A movie worth watching
                    a second time is worth buying!
