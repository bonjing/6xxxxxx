Shuttie v1.2 MacOSX Retail-CORE

What's New in Version 1.2
Added 'AppleScript' feature (requested in user reviews)
Added 'Alert' feature (requested in user reviews)
Removed garbage collection and optimized code (speedup)
Some user interface tweaks
Fixed a bug causing crashing when a job is done on some machines


With this App you are able to set the time when you computer will shutdown, restart, sleep or logout you by itself. It's pretty useful when your're watching some movies from your bed, and don't have the remote controller. You don't have to stand up from the bed to shut it down, when the movie ends. Downloading some file? Want to go to sleep? Don't want you mac to be turned on all night long? No problem...

To the \"United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users\",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intentionally 
posting fake comments & files. Their meaning is just trying to spread 
confusion and to frustrate TPB and it\'s users. 
Less downloaders = less seeders = less download speed etc = not good! 

It\'s in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intentionally keep posting fake comments & files. It\'s an easy answer against 
those who intentionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That\'s for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let\'s just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what\'s said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the \"United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users\"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
