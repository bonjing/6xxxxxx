Information
------------------------------

Hugh Laurie is on an American road trip that delves into his lifelong passion - blues music. It's a journey that started with a single song. Laurie can remember the first time he heard the blues on the radio. "I said to my brother, 'What is this?' I heard this thing and the hairs on the back of my neck went up. I can only say that, that music, since I was a small boy, has moved me more than any other form: it makes me laugh and it makes me cry and it - how can I put it? - it fills me up." Hugh Laurie: Let Them Talk sees the House actor indulge his passion with a very personal journey to the city that gave him his music, New Orleans - "the most romantic city on earth." As well as telling the story of his enduring love for the blues, the film documents the recording of Laurie's forthcoming album. Entitled Let Them Talk, it features performances from Tom Jones and blues legends like Irma Thomas and Allen Toussaint.

Produced by Sprout Pictures for Warner Music. This is the uncut version of Down By The River shown as part of the ITV Perspectives series. The documentary comes as a DVD extra with the recently released "Let Them Talk" CD.
