The Adventures of Frank Race was a syndicated show produced by Bruce Eells Productions in Hollywood. Each program began with the introduction: "Before the war, Frank Race worked as an attorney, but he traded his law books for the cloak-and-dagger of the OSS. When the war was over, his former life was over too....adventure became his business!"

Although Race ran his investigative business out of a New York City office, he and his sidekick, Mark Donovan, were seldom there. Their pursuit of wrong-doers led them to ex-Nazi jewel robbers in Berlin and Monte Carlo, import thieves in Tunis, etc. Most of his assignments came from international insurance companies thus making the program something of a cross between more familiar contemporaries Dangerous Assignment and Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar.
