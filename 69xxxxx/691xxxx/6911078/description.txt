The album is the culmination of a year filled with change and challenges for the Philadelphia based quartet including the addition of two new band members (Todd Ehrlich/bass and Mike Reilly/drums) and parting ways with their former label, among others .

Leading the creative process independently has been a liberating experience for the band. â€œWe self-produced alongside engineer John Lowe who was a truly great sounding board for us,â€ says songwriter, lead singer Sean Hoots. â€œOur recording sessions allowed us the time to focus, and the freedom to explore and come up with exactly what each song needed. Weâ€™ve been performing several of these songs for over a year now, and had a pretty good read on what needed to happen in the studio by the

time we finally got there. I write songs with a very good idea of how things should sound front to back. We always add a few details here and there, but for the most part, itâ€™s final before we even record,â€ he adds.

The albumâ€™s ten tracks include many new instruments and sonic textures-- bringing electric guitar swells, piano, organ, choir vocals into the mix, along with the bandâ€™s signature banjo, drums, vibraphone, mandolin and acoustic guitar trills.

â€œSaltâ€ was produced entirely with support from Hoots & Hellmouthâ€™s fans via a Kickstarter fundraising campaign that was â€œway more successful than we ever dreamed,â€ says Sean. The album will be at retails beginning in October.

Hoots & Hellmouth is Sean Hoots, Rob Berliner, Todd Ehrlich, Mike Reilly.
