-----------------------------

OS/2 is a computer operating system, initially created by Microsoft and IBM, then later developed by IBM exclusively. The name stands for \"Operating System/2,\" because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM\'s \"Personal System/2 (PS/2)\" line of second-generation personal computers. OS/2 is no longer marketed by IBM, and IBM standard support for OS/2 was discontinued on 31 December 2006.[1] Currently, Serenity Systems sells OS/2 under the brand name eComStation.

Believe it or else, these are disk images from the original
Microsoft OS/2 v1.0!

Images are made using XDFCOPY, which will run in both OS/2 (with
XDFORMAT.FLT installed) and DOS.  They are:

os210_in.dsk -- "Installation Disk"
os210_1.dsk -- "Disk 1" (The actual OS install.)
os210_2.dsk -- "Disk 2"
os210_3.dsk -- "Disk 3"
