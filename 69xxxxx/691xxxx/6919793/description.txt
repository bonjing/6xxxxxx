A remarkable and important insider account of the negotiations that led to the birth of the Coalition.

The Liberal Democratsâ€™ and Conservativesâ€™ decision to form a Coalition government has changed the face of British politics. This book sets out the inside story of how this momentous event unfolded, and how â€“ together â€“ the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives have started to address the challenge of a massive government budget deficit.

22 Days in May is the first detailed Liberal Democrat insider account of the negotiations which led to the formation of the Lib Dem/Conservative coalition government in May 2010, along with an essential description of the early days of the government.

David Laws was one of the key Lib Dem MPs who negotiated the coalition deal, and the book includes his in-depth, behind the scenes, account of the talks with the Conservative and Labour teams after the General Election, as well as the debates within his own party about how the Lib Dems should respond to the challenges and threats of a hung parliament.
