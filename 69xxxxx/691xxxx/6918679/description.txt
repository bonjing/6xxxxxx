How to protect swf files?
It uses a password to encrypt the swf file, then convert the swf to an exe file which can only be opened when a playback password is provided by you. Because the swf file has been encrypted, it has the ability to protect swf from decompile, prevent to extract images, videos, audios from swf files.

How to play password protected swf files?
Because the password protected swf file is encrypted by password, when a user wants to play a password protected swf file, the password protected swf file will pop up a dialog box to request the user to enter a Playback Password. This dialog box will display the machine ID of the user's computer(a unique ID for that Machine and SWF file). The user can send his/her own machine ID to you, and you can create a Playback Password based on the user's machine ID. After that the user can use this Playback Password to open your password protected swf file on his/her computer.

To the \"United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users\",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intentionally 
posting fake comments & files. Their meaning is just trying to spread 
confusion and to frustrate TPB and it\'s users. 
Less downloaders = less seeders = less download speed etc = not good! 

It\'s in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intentionally keep posting fake comments & files. It\'s an easy answer against 
those who intentionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That\'s for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let\'s just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what\'s said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the \"United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users\"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
