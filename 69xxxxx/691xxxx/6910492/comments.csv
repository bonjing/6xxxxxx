Many bands have found a profitable medium between piracy and profit that work for them and usually the band gains loyal followers after they get to listen to the whole album before buying,  i will agree that there are a lot of people who just torrent to add it to there ""collection"" but those people will find it anyway in one form or another.   Basically what I am saying is that the band and the label will get money if people enjoy the music."
