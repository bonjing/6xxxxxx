Heidecker & Wood, is the songwriting and recording duo Tim Heidecker (co-creator of â€œTim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!â€) and Davin Wood (composer on â€œTim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!â€) Their first release, Starting From Nowhere, consists of twelve songs written and recorded at Heidecker and Woodâ€™s home studios over the course of two years, often with months passing between sessions. The recordings evoke the sounds of â€˜70s soft rock (Eagles, Billy Joel, Doobie Brothers), singer-songwriters (Jackson Browne, Seals and Croft), and ace studio rock groups (Steely Dan, Queen).
