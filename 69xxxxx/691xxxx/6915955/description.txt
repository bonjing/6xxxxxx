Hello Everybody!
Today, I uploaded this file for you to use on a computer or laptop.
This is an ISO file, which means that you need a program that will burn this ISO file to a DVD or USB Drive. This is Windows 7 Home Premium Service Pack 1 Retail (x86) Bootable, which means that this has Service Pack 1 for Windows 7, it's able to boot on any DVD or USB, and it's clean. Hacks, cracks, or applications were not added into this ISO. So, you can use a program like, "PowerISO" to burn this on a DVD, and the program, "Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool" or "WinToFlash" to burn into a USB Drive. (Actually, the Windows program, "Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool" can be used to burn this ISO to a DVD or USB Drive.) Remember, always read the system requirements for Windows 7. 
Don't install this on a 64-BIT computer, or else you will face some problems during the setup. Also, don't burn this ISO to a CD disc because it won't fit.
So, please seed and comment me if there is any problems with this ISO file when you install it. Enjoy!
