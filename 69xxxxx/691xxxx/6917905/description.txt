     Synopsis                                                             
 
   On the outside, 10 year-old North appears to have everything - he's the 
 head of his class, a talented actor, and a star athlete. He even has      
 successful parents. However, his problem lies with that last piece of the 
 puzzle. His parents, while successful, are trapped inside their own       
 complicated world, and pay nary a drop of attention to their accomplished 
 son - so little, in fact, that they don't even miss a beat when he        
 simulates a coronary at the dinner table and slumps to the ground.        
   In a huff, North declares himself a "free agent" and embarks upon a     
 globe-trotting adventure, visiting couples from Texas to Hawaii to Alaska,
 as the stunned world watches. He's guided along his path to parental      
 enlightenment by a mysterious stranger who takes forms ranging from an    
 Easter bunny to a beachcomber. Meanwhile, back at home, a seedy lawyer and
 North's megalomaniacal best friend hatch their own nefarious plots to cash
 in on his newfound fame...
