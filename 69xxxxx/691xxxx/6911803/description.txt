Found
injured by rancher Shep Horgan, Jubal Troop is offered a job as cowhand and soon gains Shep's trust. Mae Horgan, feeling
she's been trapped into marriage with Shep, takes a shine to Jubal, although he is more interested in Naomi Hoktor who
is travelling with a wagon train camped on Shep's land. Pinky, until now top hand and used to Mae's favours himself,
doesn't think much of the new deal and trouble is inevitable.
