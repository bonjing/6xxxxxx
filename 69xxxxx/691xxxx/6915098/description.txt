Small Far Away: The World of Father Ted

Arts Documentary hosted by Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews, published by Channel 4 in 2010 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

This documentary follows Father Ted creators Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews as they return to Craggy Island during a road trip across Ireland that takes them back to some of the key filming locations from the series. Father Ted captured a specific Irish humour rarely seen on screen and its impact doesn't seem to have faded. The show is revealed as a product of a pair of ambitious writers, a brilliant cast and the gently confident producer Geoffrey Perkins, whose suggestion of turning a one-off mock documentary into a sitcom helped make it the much-loved show it is today. Ardal O'Hanlon, Frank Kelly, Graham Norton and many others pitch in with their reminiscences of the show, the passion it inspired and their memories of the late, great Dermot Morgan.
