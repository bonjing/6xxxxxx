Hello Everybody!
Today, I uploaded a file for you to use to activate your Windows Vista or Windows 7 as a Genuine. You can use this for my Windows 7 Retail files to activate them. Do this on your desktop, not during the Windows Setup. Also, don't make any changes of this file, or else it won't work. The user, Dmitry911, needed help about the activator from my file, "Windows 7 Ultimate Service Pack 1 Retail (x86) Bootable" because the serial that I gave is incorrect. So, this file is very useful for non-activated Windows Vista or 7, especially Retail ones because they don't include serial keys. So, please enjoy and seed this file. Also, comment me if anything is wrong with this.
