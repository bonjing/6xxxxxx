Technically, Rizzle Kicks was founded in about 1996, when both members, in their miniature form, used to play together round Jordan's(Rizzle)auntie's house. It wasn't until eight years later that the pair reunited after both moving to Brighton and facing each other head-on in a Sunday league football match.
Four years later, they ended up going to the same college and one day Jordan asked Harley to 'Lalala' all over a track. They soon realised how nicely their styles fitted together.
Jordan was just finishing off his own mixtape, rapping over samples of some of their favourite artists (Adele, Gorillaz, Lily Allen, Arctic Monkeys, M.I.A, Cypress Hill etc.) when they officially became Rizzle Kicks....
