It is a well acknowledged fact that virtually all of our modern-day components and assemblies rely to some extent on machining operations in their manufacturing process. Thus, there is clearly a substantive machining requirement which will continue to be of prime importance for the foreseeable future. Cutting Tool Technology provides a comprehensive guide to the latest developments in the use of cutting tool technology. The book covers new machining and tooling topics such as high-speed and hard-part machining, near-dry and dry-machining strategies, multi-functional tooling, â€˜diamond-likeâ€™ and â€˜atomically-modifiedâ€™ coatings, plus many others. Also covered are subjects important from a research perspective, such as micro-machining and artificial intelligence coupled to neural network tool condition monitoring. A practical handbook complete with troubleshooting tables for common problems, Cutting Tool Technology is an invaluable reference for researchers, manufacturers and users of cutting tools.
