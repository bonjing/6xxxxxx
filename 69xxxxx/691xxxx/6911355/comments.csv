,four2wonyblaze,2012-02-09T03:40Z,the audios kinda fucked up but its still watchable. 
angle in an eye = the all seeing eye,
faded out that you can just see at times in the movie,
at around 44:36 it is very clear, it may put you off the movie well just watching it, 

So downloading it they have already got their eye's on you
