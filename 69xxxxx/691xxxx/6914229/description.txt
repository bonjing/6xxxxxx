Plot:
After nearly a decade as one of America's most successful
independent filmmakers, legendary sexploitation auteur Russ
Meyer first reached out for the brass ring of major studio
success with this frantic cult favorite, once described by
Meyer and screenwriter Roger Ebert as "the first
exploitation-horror-camp-musical." Kelly McNamara (Dolly
Read), Casey Anderson (Cynthia Myers), and Petronella
Danforth (Marcia McBroom) are the three members of an
all-girl rock band called "the Kelly Affair" who pull up
stakes for Hollywood in search of stardom; they're
accompanied by their manager, Harris Allsworth (David
Gurian), who also happens to be Kelly's boyfriend. Kelly has
an aunt in Hollywood, fashion mogul Susan Lake (Phyllis
Davis), who takes Kelly under her wing and informs her she's
entitled to a share of a recent family inheritance, much to
the chagrin of Susan's lawyer, the shifty Porter Hall
(Duncan McLeod). Susan arranges for Kelly and her bandmates
to attend a wild party thrown by Ronnie "Z-Man" Barzell
(John La Zar), a flamboyant and very successful record
producer; Z-Man renames the band "the Carrie Nations," signs
them to a record deal, and they're one of the biggest acts
in America practically overnight. However, Harris is pushed
out of the picture as the band's manager by Z-Man, and as
Kelly's boyfriend by actor and gigolo Lance Rocke (Michael
Blodgett), sending Harris into a deep depression even after
he becomes the new boy-toy of adult film star Ashley St.
Ives (Edy Williams). Meanwhile, Petronella finds love with
law student Emerson Thorne (Harrison Page) until her head is
turned by heavyweight boxing champion Randy Black (Jim
Iglehart), and Casey explores her sexual boundaries with
Roxanne (Erica Gavin), a beautiful lesbian designer. This
nonstop train of decadence, drugs, and betrayal finally
comes off the rails during a drug-fueled orgy at Z-Man's
mansion, which erupts into violence when the rock mogul's
darkest secret is revealed. Featuring one-hit wonders the
Strawberry Alarm Clock, supporting performances by Meyer
regulars Charles Napier and Haji, and a bit part from future
blaxploitation icon Pam Grier, Beyond the Valley of the
Dolls proved to be Meyer's biggest box-office success,
though after his next film (The Seven Minutes) bombed at the
box office, he returned to independent production in 1973.
