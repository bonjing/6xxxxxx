                Funny and touching drama. After being caught
                drunk-driving, car dealer Jonathan is sentenced to
                community service at The Moonbeam Club, a support
                organisation for disadvantaged young people run by
                the recently widowed Laura. At the club, Jonathan
                meets 18-year-old Freddie, who is terminally ill and
                will be lucky to see in the New Year. Jonathan's
                attitude to life is transformed as he gets to know
                Freddie and his world. Freddie wishes he could have
                the perfect family Christmas, but his dream is
                unlikely to come true, especially since he has never
                had the courage to make contact with his real mother.
                Against Laura's advice, Jonathan decides to give
                Freddie the perfect Christmas.
