Special End-of-Year review show: "The Plain Truth"

Judge Napolitano has selected his favorite bookending monologues from his show, in which he highlights abuses of government power and promotes the libertarian ideals of minimum government and maximum individual freedom.

[uploader note: 

Being a news-cycle event driven show, I commit to occasionally seeding new postings for three weeks. I then would delete stale posts (until TPB turned off the delete functionality). IMHO, "The Plain Truth" segments at the end of the show are more compelling than most of the rest of the program. If you're new to the show, this is a great way to catch up on the Judge's most prescient pontificating.

Also: this appears to be a re-run/prepackaged specials week for the show, if nothing else interesting presents itself, I'll see you back here after the new year.]
