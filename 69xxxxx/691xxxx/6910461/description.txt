Plot: Archie Williams is a 17-year old media geek who has suddenly found himself the most talked-about kid in school. He has announced that heâ€™s going to kill himself- on camera- for a class project. His classmates, parents, Sierra- the most beautiful girl in school, and a â€œShady Bunchâ€ of shrinks, doctors, pill-pushers, and counselors descend on Archie. Some are hoping to save him, some want to imitate him, others try to push him over the brink. Archie films every moment of his high school experience, hiding nothing from his audience: realities of life, death, violence, sex, drugs, and the intense media overload and hypocrisy that bombard all teenagers.
