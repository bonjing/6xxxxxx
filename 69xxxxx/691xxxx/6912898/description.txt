Offering a new interpretation of the hidden messages and symbols that have ornamented Beatles mythology for years, this examination of the Beatles' recordings and album artwork theorizes that John Lennon's murder was eerily foretold. Following a fascinating and unique trail of sorcery, mysticism, numerology, backwards masking, anagrams, and literary and theological writings, the book posits that John Lennon sold his soul in order to achieve international fame and fortune and subsequently paid the ultimate price for his success.
