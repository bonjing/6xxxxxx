            Plot: Marty McFly helps out his friend Doc Brown, and
                  ends up being taken back in time by Doc's
                  time-machine. Marty, a boy of the 80's, has to
                  come to grips with being in the 50's and get his
                  parents to fall in love to set straight the damage
                  his presence has done to the events of the past.

       aGGr0 was founded in 2oo2, consisting of only one member.
      Now we're a few more, spreading our love and joy throughout
       the world. At first, we mainly did svcd and mp3, but since
        november 2oo3 we're just into xvid (and a dvdr or two,
         occasionally). Our goal is to satisfy those who like
       movies, and watching them in the best quality attainable
        by xvid, with ac3 sound and vobsubs whenever possible.
       We release a variety of types of movies, both horror and
         comedies, drama and pure b-crap. All our releases are
              made from retail dvd's and we own them all.
                Remember, kids! A movie worth watching
                    a second time is worth buying!

            aGGr0 shoutouts to AQUA, ForZa, FFM and all the
           others contributing to the growing iNTERNAL scene
              Let the light of the movie lovers guide you!
