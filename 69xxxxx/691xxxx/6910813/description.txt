Sephiroth Ebonblade (Seph) of macrophile.com produced two art CDs: Sin Thesis in 2004 and Sin Thesis 2 in 2006.  Each contained an archive of his artwork up to that year, his most recent porn, adult flash animations, and a flash project centerpiece.  He shipped the CDs for $23 each, but stopped selling them nearly five years ago with no intention of reissue.

Enjoy this relic of macrophile furry porn.
