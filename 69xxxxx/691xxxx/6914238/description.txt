Book Description

HTML5 is more than a markup languageâ€”it's a dozen independent web standards all rolled into one. Until now, all it's been missing is a manual. With this thorough, jargon-free guide, you'll learn how to build web apps that include video tools, dynamic drawings, geolocation, offline web apps, drag-and-drop, and many other features. HTML5 is the future of the Web, and with this book you'll reach it quickly.

The important stuff you need to know:

    Structure web pages in a new way. Learn how HTML5 helps make web design tools and search engines work smarter.
    Add audio and video without plugins. Build playback pages that work in every browser.
    Draw with Canvas. Create shapes, pictures, text, and animationâ€”and make them interactive.
    Go a long way with style. Use CSS3 and HTML5 to jazz up your pages and adapt them for mobile devices.
    Build web apps with rich desktop features. Let users work with your app offline, and process user-selected files in the browser.
    Create location-aware apps. Write geolocation applications directly in the browser.
