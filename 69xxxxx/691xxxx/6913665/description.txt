      Space, formally Didier Marouani & Space, are a French electronic music band from the city of Marseille active from 1977 through 1980.They are considered as one of the most notable artists of the short lived space disco music scene, and early pioneers of Eurodance electronica subgenre.
     The first three albums - "Magic Fly", "Deliverance" and "Just Blue" - were an immediate success (they sold over 12 million records all over the world). The album Magic Fly, which is widely considered to be their best work, was released in audio cd in 2001, 24 years after its original release. Although Didier Marouani left the band in 1979, the other two members Roland Romanelli and Jannick Top released in 1980 the album "Deeper Zone" under the name of Space. Then Space officially split up in 1981.

     "Supernature" is the title track of Cerrone's 1977 album. "Supernature (Cerrone III)", along with the tracks "Give Me Love" and "Love is Here", hit #1 on the disco/dance charts early in 1978. The single crossed over to both the pop charts, where it peaked at #70 (#8 in the UK) and the soul charts, where it peaked at #72. The lyrics were written by a young Lene Lovich, though she was not credited. The song has an environmental theme, imagining a future in which the use of artificial chemicals in agriculture has caused "creatures down below" to emerge and "take their sweet revenge" against mankind.
