Cafe Del Mar 20th Anniversary 2000 [EAC - FLAC](oan)

The premier purveyors of Ibiza comedown have selected two dozen tracks of laid-back, cozily experimental
music to help celebrate their 20th anniversary, and while it at times feels ungainly, it never seems too
scripted. The first disc has Amalagation of Soundz creating a rustic drum'n'bass mantra ("Enchant Me")
Moodrama mixing tribal beats with flitters of jazz (the appropriately titled "Jazz Tip) and even Deep &
Wide constructing a gorgeously subtle native twinkle along the lines of Dario Gs "Voices. The other disc
tends to go for the more celestial (Jean Michel Jarre, Jon & Vangelis) or the post-sunset reawakening
(Foundland, Christian Alvad), but begins to sag with the drugged-out self-importance of a born-again hippy.
Luckily, with so many tracks on offer, it's easy to sift out the treasures. This is a fine, calming collection
of indigenous, open-door attitude. With a massive booklet and an amusing video file of a Cafe Del Mar sunset,
this is one of the only Cafe Del Mar compilations you'll ever need. ~ Dean Carlson, All Music Guide
