A thrilling and often beautiful concert sitting unseen in a vault for a number of years, Lucinda Williams: Live from Austin, TX is the Louisiana-born singer-songwriter's complete, pre-edited performance from a 1998 appearance on Austin City Limits. With its 16 well-chosen songs, largely culled from Williams's most rewarding material since the 1980s, Live is indispensable for longtime fans and a great introduction to her unique artistry for the uninitiated. Williams's deceptively plain-spoken, sometimes conversational lyrics about losses and passages and elusive touchstones of happiness are marvels of instant resonance, transcending minimalist imagery and fragmentary refrains. Surrounded by a small, guitar army and sometimes hypnotic rhythm section, Williams fills out "Metal Firecracker" with a vintage folk-rock sound, raises the extraordinary "Drunken Angel" and "Greenville" to new heights, and delivers--with a voice as lovely as a bell--a stirring performance on "Sweet Old World." Lest we forget her appreciation of the Doors, "Joy" brings the show to a head with its gritty, shamanic blues and evocative promises ("I'm gonna go to West Memphis and find my joy") that make one want to jump with excitement for 74 minutes in 5.1 Surrounding Sound.
