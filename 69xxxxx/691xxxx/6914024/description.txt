Tim, a failed weatherman, returns to his small hometown to hang out with his high school friends, Rut, a fat jock and Neal, a bald geek. They go camping and sight a UFO landing. They hide in the bushes and watch as a small green alien, Greenie, rummages through their packs and eats their food. With the idea that they could make enough beer money for life Rut shoots Greenie as he is making his way back to the ship. The helpless Greenie has the ability to regenerate though, and Rut has to kill him several more times in various cruel and violent ways. They also torture the alien to try and get it to \\\\\\\'talk\\\\\\\'. A female friend comes to the rescue and convinces Tim that they must let the alien go home.
