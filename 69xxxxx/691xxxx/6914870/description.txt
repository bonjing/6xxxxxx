  A tricky release, Nine decided the news was more important then the   
  cricket, so when the cricket ran overtime they bumped it to one of    
  their secondary digital channels. To complicate matters the second    
  channel was in a different format (HD, 1080i). Funnily enough it      
  looks like it broke their ad system, last 40 mins had zero ad breaks! 
                                                                        
  Its quite shameful though, that in Australia we cannot normally       
  enjoy cricket in HD, and even then when they do use their HD channel  
  for sport it looks crap due to abysmal bitrate. For shame Nine, for   
  shame!                                                                
                                                                        
  Cut: Tea breaks, lunch breaks, rain breaks/delays.
