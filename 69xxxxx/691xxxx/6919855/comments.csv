Quality sucks, a bit dark, but honestly, if you don't know how to work the video controls for your media player to brighten the picture... just turn your pc off and wait for the dvd... because you're an idiot.  Personally, I would have beaten the fucking life out of that moron in front of me if I were recording the second or third time he stood up.  The asshole just stands there in front of the screen, even without a cam it would have seriously pissed me off while I was trying to watch the movie.  As I said, video quality was horrid.  Way too much flicker and noise.  Must have been a pretty cheap camera.  Audio was ok
