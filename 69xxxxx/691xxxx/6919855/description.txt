Note : 
Another day, and another TS :) sadly its not a 720P source lol
it was indeed a RUSSIAN video, which needed ALOT of work to 
UnknOwN did filter it but colours looked way to faded for me so 
heres my rip :) played with hue/sat, brightness, contrast, levels
sharpens, and others... so for me i think it looks better but 
please check sample before downloading as this rip is not for 
everyone :P as for audio i used DTRG V2 which has been filtered :D
