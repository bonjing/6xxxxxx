ONE TWO THREE (1961)

One, Two, Three is a 1961 American comedy film directed by Billy Wilder and written by him and I.A.L. Diamond. It is based on the 1929 Hungarian one-act play Egy, kettÃ¶, hÃ¡rom by Ferenc MolnÃ¡r, with a \\\\\\\"plot borrowed partly from\\\\\\\" Ninotchka, a 1939 film co-written by Wilder.[2][3] The comedy features James Cagney, Horst Buchholz, Pamela Tiffin, Arlene Francis, Leon Askin, Howard St. John, and others.[4] It would be Cagney\\\\\\\'s last film appearance until Ragtime, 20 years later.[5][6]
The film is primarily set in West Berlin during the Cold War, but before the construction of the Berlin Wall, and politics is predominant in the premise.
C.R. \\\\\\\"Mac\\\\\\\" MacNamara is a high-ranking executive in the Coca-Cola Company, assigned to West Berlin after a business fiasco a few years earlier in the Middle East (about which he is still bitter). Nevertheless, Mac is angling to become head of Western European Coca-Cola Operations, based in London. After working on an arrangement to introduce Coke into the Soviet Union, Mac receives a call from his boss, W.P. Hazeltine in Atlanta. Scarlett Hazeltine, the boss\\\\\\\'s hot-blooded 17-year-old socialite daughter, is coming to Berlin and Mac receives the unenviable task of taking care of this young whirlwind.
