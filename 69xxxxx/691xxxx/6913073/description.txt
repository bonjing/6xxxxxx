NOTES:

Ok guys we were sent this cam a while back now and have been sitting on it til they got theirs out ....now they have
heres our encode.
The video was really nice,some noise and dark in places but overall a very nice base to work with.Audio was ok but the
clicking,popping sounds spoiled it.
First we cleaned the video .....we ran a HQ smoother to remove that noise,tweaked the brightness and contrast levels,along with
the rgb colours and chroma.We also resized it and changed the Ar as we thought it was slightly off.
Audio needed alot of TLC,used several filters from noise and hiss removal and then we changed all the EQ bands and we opted to lower
one band right down where most of the unwanted noise was coming from,of course it was a case of saving and remuxing.

Hope you all had a nice xmas :D
