Lets say, Viruses like to use blue boxes to get packaged. It's usually only viruses uses blue boxes, but the insides are different. Virus Detection Coders come to the conclusion that only Viruses use blue boxes, and nothing legit ever uses blue boxes so lets just make things easier and just flag all blue boxes and not worry about what's inside. 

But it just so happens Keygens and Patches use blue boxes too. But Virus Detection coders don't care because Keygens and Patches aren't legit anyways.

That's why they get flagged."
