,dm2018,2012-02-10T20:18Z,i am using windows 7 home edition at the moment. if i install this will i lose all my data? dont really want to lose all my downloads or game saves
n the virtual drive and click 'Install'
it will run on its own and completely install

u will get an error at the end but dont worry it will do that then keep installing
Note: When it ask for a serial number just keep clicking thru it BUT there is a check box on that screen, leave it checked that will activate ur copy for you at the end"
