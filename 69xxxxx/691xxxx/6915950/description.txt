An immensely popular series broadcast on PBS from 1978 to 1992, 
RUMPOLE OF THE BAILEY set a new bar for all courtroom dramas to come. 
Balancing suspense and satire as deftly as the scale of justice, 
Horace Rumpole, tirelessly defends the downtrodden while undressing the upper 
classes. A timeless mixture of comedy and drama, RUMPOLE OF THE BAILEY was 
one of television's most celebrated courtroom dramas. Flawlessly adapted by 
John Mortimer from his best-selling Edgar Award-winning novels, and starring 
the esteemed Leo McKern (A Man for All Seasons), this torrent includes all 42 
episodes from the seven seasons of RUMPOLE OF THE BAILEY. The 1980 bonus film 
"Rumpole's Return," shown between seasons 2 & 3, is also included.
