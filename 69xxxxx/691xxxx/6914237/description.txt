   Rippers notes: We are really sorry for the letterbox widescreen
                  in this release, but the format on the swedish
                  retail DVD is really weird. To make it up to you
                  we did a 2cd release, since 1cd would be too crappy
                  quality with this stupid format. Taxi 2 and 3 are
                  all real WS though. All hail Luc Besson! :) Enjoy!

       aGGr0 was founded in 2oo2, consisting of only one member.
      Now we're a few more, spreading our love and joy throughout
       the world. At first, we mainly did svcd and mp3, but since
        november 2oo3 we're just into xvid (and a dvdr or two,
         occasionally). Our goal is to satisfy those who like
       movies, and watching them in the best quality attainable
        by xvid, with ac3 sound and vobsubs whenever possible.
       We release a variety of types of movies, both horror and
         comedies, drama and pure b-crap. All our releases are
              made from retail dvd's and we own them all.
                Remember, kids! A movie worth watching
                    a second time is worth buying!
