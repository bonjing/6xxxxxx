 PLOT 

 After killing the crazy Mrs. Voorhees, who was avenging her son Jason's
 death, Alice can finally sigh with relief. But there is just one problem.
 Jason never drowned in Crystal Lake and lived in the nearby woods as a
 hermit all this time. The day that Alice beheaded his mother, Jason saw
 everything and his heart filled with thirst for revenge. Two months later
 Alice gets stabbed by an ice pick in the temple and dissapears. Is Jason
 behind this? Five years later a camp next do to Camp Crystal Lake is build
 and the counselors start snooping around the old, abondoned camp ruins. This
 makes Jason very upset, since his shack is next to the remains of Camp
 Crystal Lake and what is inside the shack shall be kept secret forever, even
 if it means killing nine people!

 aGGr0 iNFO 
 
 aGGr0 has been around since 2oo2, at first mainly releasing mp3 and svcd.
 Since late 2oo3 we are only concentrating on quality rips of quality movies.
 We just love AC3 and XViD, and love those movies you won't find elsewhere.
 We are on a quest to widen the minds of those who enjoy film, with lots of
 different types of movies, from lots of different decades. From time to time
 we may release a dupe, but we don't believe that a good release in XViD is
 a dupe on a crappy release made on svcd 3 years ago. If you don't agree,
 then nuke us. We love movies, and we love to spread them for _your_ pleasure,
 not nukers. We are a small group, consisting of friends, ripping the movies
 we love to watch. If you like our releases - spread them. And remember that
 a movie worth watching is a movie worth buying. Stay drunk and stay disco!
