,kartowkxyt,2011-12-28T05:52Z,"Stupid sanctimonious movie made as christian propaganda for the feeble-minded. The only good thing is Malcolm McDowells excellent acting. This movies message is destroyed by just saying that if there was a good god, then he would not tolerate evil in the world and we should all live happy lives. That DOES NOT DENY human freedon and freewill, because even then people could reject that god and go against it with any pretext. The fact that evil exists means that if there is a creator god, he is AN EVIL GOD, bringing tragedy and suffering upon the world for his own enjoyment...  From this steel dilemma no believer can escape with facile excuses and justifications. The reality is: THERE IS NO GOD and suffering comes from the vagaries and random events of nature, thats all. Some pĂÂ¨ople are lucky and some are not. Period. "
