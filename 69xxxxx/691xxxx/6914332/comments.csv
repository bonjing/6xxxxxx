I found your comments to be seemingly written by someone who has no clue what they are talking about. There is this book, the bible...it has these historical facts and other cool stuff that might help you be more educated as opposed to ranting here. No one is impressed by someone who blabbers incoherently about a subject they know nothing about. Good luck to you.. sounds like you need it. Oh yea..and some prayer:)"
 means that if there is a creator god, he is AN EVIL GOD, bringing tragedy and suffering upon the world for his own enjoyment...  From this steel dilemma no believer can escape with facile excuses and justifications. The reality is: THERE IS NO GOD and suffering comes from the vagaries and random events of nature, thats all. Some pĂÂ¨ople are lucky and some are not. Period. "
