Release Notes....: There is a glitch from 13m29s-13m31s causing the loss of 
                   dialog and frozen video.  It is the beginning of a replay 
                   so there is no substantial loss.  I sat on this one for a 
                   few days thinking maybe someone else would pre a clean 
                   copy but that never happened.  Enjoy!
