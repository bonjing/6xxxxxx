The Great Principles of Science - Robert M. Hazen
Taught By Professor Robert M. Hazen, Ph.D., Harvard University,
George Mason University
60 - 30 Minutes Lectures

PLEASE READ: This course was produced in 1999 and was the precursor to the Joy of Science, the course lectures titles are exactly the same, it seems the content is pretty similar as well, but it is in fact a different taping.  If you're interested and would like to have this OOP course for your collection enjoy. 


The great principles of science often reveal surprising connections between seemingly unrelated phenomena. Newtonâ€™s laws of motion and gravity, for example, unified the supposedly separate domains of terrestrial and celestial motions. Similarly, the first law of thermodynamics established the equivalence of such disparate phenomena as heat, motion, light, and mass, all of which are forms of energy.

Part I of our exploration of the central concepts of science begins with an examination of science as a way of knowing, and then considers the overarching phenomena of forces and motions, energy and magnetism and electricity. Of the many ways devised to understand our place in the cosmos, science holds a special place as a method designed to ask and answer questions about tangible aspects of the physical world. Scientific knowledge depends on independently verifiable data  obtained from observations, experiments, and theoretical reasoning.

In Part II of this lecture series we begin with another great unification - electricity and magnetism. Professor Hazen will explore the great overarching principles of physics and chemistry - the laws that describe the behavior of matter, energy, forces. and motions, as well as the nature of atoms, singly and in combination.

In Part III of this lecture series we turn from these general principles to the study of specific physical systems. These principles are manifest in the properties and behavior of materials, notably the variety of electronic materials  as well as in the characteristics of isotopes and their energy producing nuclear reactions.

Part IV of this lecture series focuses on great principles related to plane Earth and its most complex systems-life. Studies of Earth and life differ from physics and chemistry in that deal with extremely complex systems that have a distinctive and contingent history. The present state of a rock or a tree depends on an intricate and irreversible past. Engaging in geological or biological research, therefore, is often akin to detective work, where clues are precious, and imagination plays a vital role.
Part V of this lecture series focuses on the great unifying biological principles of genetics, evolution, and ecosystems.
