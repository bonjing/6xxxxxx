   *  Life ... ?
    * Death ... ?
    * Suffering ... ?
    * Redemption ... ?
    * The origin of being ... ?

Each of these complex issues raises many, many questions.

How do the major religious systems address those questions? And what do their answers tell us?

An Ideal Starting Point for Inquiry

These eight lectures by Dr. Robert Oden are an ideal starting point for pursuing those questions. And if you've been thinking about them for a while, as so many do, you will likely discover he has many fresh insights to offer you.

Dr. Oden, who holds both a doctorate in Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations and a master's degree in Theology (two of the latter, in fact), has taught at Harvard University and Dartmouth College over a long and exceptionally distinguished career as both teacher and college president.
