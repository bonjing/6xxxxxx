****************************************************************
Upon his 1600th birthday, Santa Claus is given a very special gift: a white, fluffy, stuffed toy puppy which is brought to life by the Great Christmas Icicle (turning him into Santa Paws). When Santa loses his memory and becomes lost in New York, Paws and his new friends must find him and his magic crystal in order to restore Christmas. Along the way, they try to brighten the lives of Quinn and Will, a couple orphans whose only wish is to have a family.
