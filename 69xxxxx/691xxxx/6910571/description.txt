Shrimad Valmiki Ramayana - Kishkindha Kanda[Team Nanban][TPB]



About Valmiki:



"Valmiki" (during Lord Rama's time) is celebrated as the poet harbinger in Sanskrit literature. 

He is the author of the epic Ramayana, based on the attribution in the text of the epic itself.

He is revered as the Adi Kavi, which means First Poet, for he discovered the first sloka i.e. first verse, which set the base and defined the form to Sanskrit poetry.

The Ramayana, originally written by Valmiki, consists of 24,000 verses in seven cantos (some say six i.e. excluding the Uttara Ramayana) (Kandas). 

The Ramayana tells the story of a prince, Rama of Ayodhya, whose wife Sita is abducted by the demon (Raakshasa) king of Lanka, Ravana. 

The Valmiki Ramayana is dated variously from 500 BC to 100 BC, or about co-eval with early versions of the Mahabharata.

As with many traditional epics, it has gone through a long process of interpolations and redactions, making it impossible to date accurately.



SHORT DESCRIPTION ON Shrimad Valmiki Ramayana - Kishkindha Kanda:


The Kishkindha Kanda is set in the monkey citadel Kishkindha. 

Rama and Lakshmana meet Hanuman, the greatest of monkey heroes 
and an adherent of Sugriva, the banished pretender to the throne of Kishkindha.

Rama befriends Sugriva and helps him by killing his elder brother Vali 
thus regaining the kingdom of Kiskindha, in exchange for helping Rama to recover Sita.

However Sugriva soon forgets his promise and spends his time in debauchery. 

The clever monkey Queen, Tara, calmly intervenes to prevent an enraged Lakshmana 
from destroying the monkey citadel. 

She then eloquently convinces Sugriva to honor his pledge. Sugriva then 
sends search parties to the four corners of the earth, only to return without success 
from north, east and west.

The southern search party under the leadership of Angad and Hanuman learns 
from a vulture named Sampati that Sita was taken to Lanka.
