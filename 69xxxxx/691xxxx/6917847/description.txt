Pitting farmer against farmer, fireman against fireman, florist against florist, "Best in the Business" is the ultimate battle of job-skill supremacy that celebrates the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me of the American workforce. Each episode showcases three average American jobs -stonecutters, shelf-stockers, sheep-shearers â€“ and turns the spotlight on the not-so-average people who take their profession to the next level. Meet mechanics who can change a tire in less than 10 seconds, grocery baggers who fill a bag in seven seconds flat and big-rig drivers that can parallel park faster than you can throw your minivan in reverse!
