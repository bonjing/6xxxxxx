 power iso about 3 years ago and it seemed like a great idea whose time had come.  After all why waste a blank when you can run it straight off the HD right?  It's faster and you can preview b4 a burn.  I've actually at different times tried more than one ISO mount progs and the result is the same.  For about a month they work great but then any executables on the virtual drive start to crash.  If I burn the same ISO to a DVD the programs work fine.  Then there's the problem of artifacts.  I uninstalled the ISO programs but the virtual drives remained behind.  They don't seem to want to go away but other than that the virtual drives don't really cause any problem.  "
