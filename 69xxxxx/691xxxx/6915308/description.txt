    Game Notes:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~
    You are the commander of a top secret M1A6 experimental tank division in
    the Armor Task Force. Your mission was to lead the northern front of
    Operation Desert Thunder, a secret military operation to overthrow a
    terrorist faction that has taken control of a peaceful Middle Eastern
    country. Your mission has been compromised, your small battalion
    devastated, leaving you as the sole survivor. Left with no alternative,
    you must complete your mission to reach the capital city and rendezvous
    with allied forces. It is a desperate mission, but there is no turning
    back. Satellite guidance from HQ and the advanced technology of your
    experimental M1A6 tank are all you have. Against all odds,
    you must prevail.
