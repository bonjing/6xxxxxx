Burned the video to disk and played on the PS3, until about 20 mins in then it muted the sound and a message popped up on the screen saying something like ""Audio Outputs temporarily muted....message Code 3....reference to Cinavia website.""

Not sure how to get around this. Maybe encoding to a different output and re-burn?"
