The Fraternity of Man is an American blues rock and psychedelic rock group from the 1960s. They are most famous for their 1968 song "Don't Bogart That Joint," which was featured in the 1969 road movie Easy Rider. Its original members included three members from the Lowell George-led group "The Factory" â€“ Richie Hayward of Little Feat, Warren Klein and Martin Kibbee, who joined Elliot Ingber from The Mothers of Invention and Larry Wagner. Blues leads were handled by Elliot Ingber, and psychedelic leads were played by Warren Klein including "Oh No I Don't Believe It" (widely attributed to Elliot due to his association with the Mothers). The band broke up after recording two albums.
