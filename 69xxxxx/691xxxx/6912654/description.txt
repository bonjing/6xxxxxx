   Release Information:

   Set in a mysterious and abstract sterile environment, Q.U.B.E. (Quick
   Understanding of Block Extrusion) is a first-person puzzle game that
   challenges players to navigate each level by manipulating coloured cubes
   that surround them. There's little to go on as the game begins - the
   player is dropped into an all-white room with few instructions, and simply
   has to figure their way out. The tone of game changes as the player finds
   small and big alterations to their environment, supported by an original
   score, inviting each player to let their imagination take over as to where
   they might be. Through experimentation and discovery, players will
   progress through an ever-evolving series of cube puzzles that will
   challenge them with logic, physics, platforming.
