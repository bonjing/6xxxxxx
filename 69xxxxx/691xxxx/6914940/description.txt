What the Romans Did for Us 
Adam Hart-Davis

From frescoes to fast food, bridges to bikinis, the Romans brought us a variety of innovations that changed the landscape of Britain and the lifestyle of its inhabitants for ever. The Romans were mass-producers, capitalists and bureaucrats who during their 400-year stay in Britain built dozens of towns and miles of roads, leaving a fascinating and complex legacy that forms the basis of much of our technology today. Presented by Adam Hart-Davis, "What The Romans Did For Us" investigates the innovations that Romans brought to our shores and assesses their considerable impact on our lives. It features demonstrations and reconstructions of extraordinary Roman devices, and provides an alternative, dynamic history of the people that transformed Britain.
