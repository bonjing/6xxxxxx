A woman orders a suit from a tailor for her young son to wear to her sister\'s wedding. The tailor\'s apprentice, together with two other teenage boys who work in the same building, devise a plan to try on the suit at night to see what it feels like. Things get a little complicated but in the morning, at the last possible minute, they manage to return the suit to its proper place.
