Great Concert! Every thing about movie is unique.It makes history by being the first rock concert after 
the Berlin wall came down.If you are a fan of AC DC,METALLICA,PANTERA,BLACK CROWES and even a russian band 
E.S.T. who sound a lot like AC DC,you are really in for a treat.In my humble opinion,i think it should 
have been an Oscar contender.Bad news is that its out of print. I was lucky enough somewhere along the 
way to have picked up video.Good luck on finding it.

They all put on a great show Enjoy {Blitz}
