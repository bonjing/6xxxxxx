            Plot: Catharine Deane is a psychotherapist who is part of 
                  a revolutionary new treatment which allows her mind
                  to literally enter the mind of her patients.
                  Her experience in this method takes an unexpected
                  turn when an FBI agent comes to ask for a desperate
                  favour. They had just tracked down a notorious
                  serial killer, Carl Stargher, whose MO is to abduct
                  women one at a time and place them in a secret area
                  where they are kept for about 40 hours until they
                  are slowly drowned. Unfortunately, the killer has
                  fallen into an irreversible coma which means he
                  cannot confess where he has taken his latest victim
                  before she dies. Now, Catherine Deane must race
                  against time to explore the twisted mind of the
                  killer to get the information she needs, but
                  Stargher's damaged personality poses dangers that
                  threaten to overwhelm her.

       aGGr0 was founded in 2oo2, consisting of only one member.
      Now we're a few more, spreading our love and joy throughout
       the world. At first, we mainly did svcd and mp3, but since
        november 2oo3 we're just into xvid (and a dvdr or two,
         occasionally). Our goal is to satisfy those who like
       movies, and watching them in the best quality attainable
        by xvid, with ac3 sound and vobsubs whenever possible.
       We release a variety of types of movies, both horror and
         comedies, drama and pure b-crap. All our releases are
              made from retail dvd's and we own them all.
                Remember, kids! A movie worth watching
                    a second time is worth buying!

            aGGr0 shoutouts to AQUA, ForZa, FFM and all the

              Let the light of the movie lovers guide you!
