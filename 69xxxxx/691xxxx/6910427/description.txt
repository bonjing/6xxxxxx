PINK ANDERSON

Pinkney Anderson (1900-74) is today revered as one of the greatest of the Piedmont-style guitar-picking songsters, an inspiration to the British art-rock band Pink Floyd and to such folk-blues troubadours as Roy Book Binder and Paul Geremia. The South Carolina musician spent much of his career traveling with medicine shows and made only a handful of recordings. They offer a a rich sampling of his delightfully diverse repertoire of folk songs, blues, and rags. It is on such plaintive, rhythmically compelling performances that his considerable reputation stands.
