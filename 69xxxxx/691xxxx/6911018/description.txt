  Chris Breaux, who goes by Frank Ocean, is a male R&B singer with male R&B
  contradictions: As much as he wants to listen to his heart, he can't
  completely ignore his dick. He covers a Coldplay ballad about childhood with
  absolute dedication but ends it with the rude sound of an alarm clock: The
  dream is over. A minute later, he's back in a mutually destructive
  relationship, and has the guts to remind himself that he got what he wanted.
  The cover of the album features a striking orange 1980s BMW, but on "Swim
  Good", he's stuck driving a Lincoln Town Car over a cliff. In a skit called
  "Bitches Talkin'", the ladies tell him to cut it out with the damn Radiohead;
  in "Songs For Women", he obliges-- he's an indie kid when it comes to
  alienation but a pragmatist when it comes to sex. The boy in him wails, the
  adult wins out. The victory-- if you can call it that-- is bittersweet.
