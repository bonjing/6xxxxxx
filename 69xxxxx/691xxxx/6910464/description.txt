Serena Blair has not won a regular season match up. She came in late last season and even lost her Tournament match up. However, she has been training off the mat and has some very valuable Tag Team experience. Serena is a completely different wrestler from last season and can be considered a major contender for the Featherweight title this year!

Shae Simone is back on the Ultimate Surrender mat. This tiny blond makes a great addition to the Featherweight roster. What Shae lacks in experience she more than makes up for in grit and perseverance. Shae has one deadly weakness that every opponent eagerly takes advantage of, she cannot stop her self from being made to cum on the mat! 

From brutal submission holds to camel clutch back breakers to making her opponent cum on the mat, Serena kicked ass from the start, physically then sexually dominating poor Shae. How much humiliation can one person take and still fight back?

Ultimate Surrender, the only non-scripted real wrestling league on the net.
