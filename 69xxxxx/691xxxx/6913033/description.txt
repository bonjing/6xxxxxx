This torrent containes nearly 600 best trailers 
from the history of cinematografy, 
including plays and TV series plus 16 of the worst. 
The quality of some clips is poor, 
but it was not possible to find any better. 
I finished the list on the 25th of December 2011. 
Therefore it does not include trailers released after this date. 
I wish you enjoyment watching this charged material, 
that has around 25 hours ;)
