Itâ€™s rare nowadays to see a band blend intelligent songwriting and originality into a neat little accessible packageâ€¦

Enter Wake the Light.

Hailing from the heartland of Tennessee, this five-piece rock outfit is storming the scene in the southeast, rapidly spreading their infectious blend of southern-tinged, mainstream rock backed by an incredible live performance that leaves you breathless and instantly hooked.

Fronted by vocalist T-Jay Tipps, a ROCK STAR: INXS Top 100 finalist and one of only 30 vocalists personally hand-chosen to audition for the band Fuel, and backed by Robb Nightlife (aside from Tipps, the only remaining original member of the band) on drums, Eli Phipps and Steve Augustyn (a Los Angeles transplant who relocated to Tennessee after hearing the bandâ€™s demos) on guitars, and newest addition Ryan Clayton on bass, Wake the Light has already made quite a name for themselves in the southeast and midwest, sharing stages with such acts as Saliva, 12 Stones, Breaking Point, Hot Action Cop, Ligion, Faktion, Machina (ex-Evanescence and Future Leaders of the World members), and many more.

At first listen, something becomes immediately clear: these guys are great songwriters. Their level of maturity shines through on such tracks as â€œMisplaced Heroâ€ - a blazing, pop-infused rocker so catchy youâ€™ll be singing it for days, and â€œSimple Wishâ€ - a straightforward mid-tempo track with a huge, singalong chorus.
