Oh and Tom Six is already working on a Third one. Quote: ""The third film will make the last one look like a Disney film. We're going to shoot the third film entirely in America, and it's going to be my favourite... It's going to upset a lot of people."" So expect The Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence)."
