The More than Complete DC-Now More Completerer!

This fifty-fourth alphabetical installment is:  DC from A-Z Fills!

What's This?
     It's a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh! Â®Â©)â„¢, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and M.C. Gaines among others.
       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those "Pre-DC" comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC super-heroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heroes are Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and among many others. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will be some "Post DC" comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c. 925gb in total. It will take as long as it takes, but it's nearly done. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.

=================================

 This is the first of two fill torrents for  the More than Complete DC - Now more Completerer project. 

     New or improved scans come out nearly every day, even as I was trying to assemble the fills. At some point you have to pick a cutoff date or it goes on forever, never finished, never uploaded. I called it as of 12pm GMT 28 December, 2011. 


     This one is called the "MTCDC-NMC 54 Primary Fills-Penultimate Torrent " (in case you aren't familiar with penultimate, it means next-to last) This torrent of the two is the more "on project mission" fills.

It includes:

New publications since each tittle was originally uploaded

Newly scanned items of titles previously included

improved scans of old items (in my sole and un-questionable opinion - get your own scans, ye bums! )

Items forgotten

Important (says me!) items I  left out before but changed my mind about

Things I found by hunting a bit harder

     The last torrent in the MTCDC-NMC project will include mainly things that came in by broadening the scope of what should be included, or including things I previously said were unjustifiably big compared to the amount of DC comics that are related. A lot of this reflects requests I got a long the way.      It will be  called "MTCDC-NMC 55 Secondary Fills-Part-Plural Zed Alpha, 0,0,0, destruct, zero". This is both a reference to  1A) "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", one of my favorite books plus 1B) the original Star Trek, and 2) by inclusion of plural Zs, and the word destruct, an indication it is the last of my torrents, possibly forever. 

     On the other hand this may turn out to be a "comic book death", so Joshua13 would then turn out to be "not so dead as previously believed", or "dead, but he got better",  or "dead, but it wasn't really him because it was a long lost twin, disguised impostor, doppelgÃ¤nger from earth, doppelgÃ¤nger from a parallel universe, an hallucination (probably induced by a villain), a clone, a duplicate caused by magic or an evil scientist (occasionally by a good scientist), a time loop duplicate, or a different time duplicate - him from the future so he has an indefinite time to live before he must go back into the past and die or  just a random reboot/return with no attempt to explain it." 
     Where will I have really been then, since it would not be in the grave.? Held prisoner, brainwashed, wandering the universe with amnesia, in suspended animation, trapped in the past or future, trapped on another planet, in a parallel universe, on a secret mission, hiding out because I've had a crisis of faith and doubt 1) my ability to be a super-hero, or 2) wether It's right for me to be a super-hero, hiding out because I just got tired and wanted to quit, have turned to e-vil, or lots of other things.
     Why would I hypothetically return? Simple escape, simply finally make it back, renewal of faith, regaining my memory, earth shattering (at least) crisis that calls me back to action, rescued by my comrades to their great astonishment, restored to the good side and so on as appropriate.
     But honestly I think I mean it this time. Joshua13 (at least as far as uploading) will be seriously dead. Deader then Gwen Stacy. Deader than the archetypal woman in the refrigerator, erstwhile girlfriend of Kyle the Green Lantern. (too lazy to look up her name). Deader than Francisco Franco, who I hear "Is still dead". Deader than Jacob Marley who was "Dead, to begin with". Deader than Michelle Bachmann's Presidential hopes. Really, really, really dead.
     As John Cleese of Monty Python put it of a Parrot he had purchased, but was attempting to return, because it was, and had been since before he bought it, dead, DOA, DWOL (Dead without Leave):

          "This parrot is no more! He has ceased to be! 'E's expired and gone to meet 'is maker! 'E's a stiff! Bereft of life, 'e  rests in peace! ... 'Is metabolic processes are now 'istory! 'E's off the twig! 'E's kicked the bucket, 'e's shuffled off 'is mortal coil, rung down the curtain and joined the bleedin' choir invisibile!! THIS IS AN EX-PARROT!!" 

     "Hello, I must be going". Groucho Marks, Animal Crackers, 1930. An hilarious film you ought to see it.  Sung to the tune of "Hello, I must be going" of course

Hello, I must be going.
I cannot stay, 
I came to say
I must be going.
I'm glad I came
but just the same
I must be going.

A list would be huge with such a diversity of titles, I'm not going to do that for this one. You can look in your torrent client to see what's in here. Over 2000 items in 385 folders.  c.1870 of them comics and related books.
 
========================================================================

Feel free to post this to other sites if you know how and are so inclined

========================================================================

Please Seed! Lots of people will start on the series months
or even a year or two from now. You are their only hope to complete
their downloads.

========================================================================
Thanks to the Scanners and editors, and thanks to the seeders, the
anonymous folk that make the work of the scanners and uploaders multiply!
========================================================================
Until we once again don't actually meet,

Cordially,
