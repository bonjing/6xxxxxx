 murderous past, they figure it is a quick way to get quick money and

 in the house they start to think about the mistake they made in coming
 there when mysterious things start to happen.
========================================================================
 aGGr0 is a young swedish group, since 2002 releasing only quality
 movies for a simple reason; we want everybody to be able to enjoy a
 fine flick, both old classics and newer ones. As of late 2003 we took
 the desicion to leave SVCD SWESUB, and instead go with the flow and
 only rip to XviD. SVCD seems a bit obsolete nowadays. All of our 
 releases will of course have swedish subs whenever possible. And yeah,
 you're right. We don't care about the scene and if this movie is a
 dupe or not. We only want you to enjoy a good quality movie...
 If you like this film, please go buy it. Original DVD's are cooler.
