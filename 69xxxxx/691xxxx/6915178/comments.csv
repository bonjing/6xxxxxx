haring ""Top Cat The Movie"".

Audio (English) and video quality is very good. Although the file-size is relatively small it looks high-definition indeed! Probably because it is a cartoon.
(There are no subtitles.)

About the movie itself: 
Too bad this movie is a strange looking mix between ""computer-drawn"" and ""hand-drawn"" animation. The backgrounds look very different from the foreground. This makes the characters look ""fake"". This is a shame and unworthy of Top Cat."
