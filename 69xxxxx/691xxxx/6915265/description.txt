
Buddy Guy and Junior Wells seldom made more effective records than this celebrated album (reissued on CD in 1992). 
There were none of the erratic vocals, questionable song selection or rambling solos that sometimes plagued their live shows. Wells was sizzling and aggressive as lead vocalist, Guy's solos were controlled and disciplined, yet strikingly effective in uptempo and ballad situations, while saxophonist A.C. Reed provided soulful and shattering fills and solos behind the vocalists and during the interludes. 
They were helped by assorted rock luminaries from Eric Clapton, J. Geils and Magic Dick to Dr. John. 
This deserves a place among the other tremendous items in the Rhino/Atlantic R&B; Masters series. (AMG)
