I love watching a film that sounds like it's well written. I couldn't care less if it was religious or not. I don't believe in God, but I like to hear from people who do. Get off your high horse."
just losing their mind cuz there arguing about something that doesnt even exist! Both ways its pretty pathetic Hahaha... Try science it led me to God! Study the facts about evolution and you'll see that its the biggest Religion on the planet! Not one shred of proof yet! Even Sir Arthur Keith admitted evolution will never be proven which shows you how Pridefull he was! GL & Godbless!"
