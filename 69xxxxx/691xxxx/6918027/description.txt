This torrent includes the official podcast mp3s released on the www.glennbeck.com website for the radio show. It includes the "4th Hour" with Pat & Stu which is available only to subscribers (ie. it is not part of the regular radio broadcast).

Sorry these are late again, I'm out of the country, and very busy. I'm sure everyone isn't that worried since these are all guest-hosts, but I still feel badly that I'm not getting the podcasts up as usual. Anyway, Monday had Doc Thompson filling in again for Glenn.
