[excerpted from John Stossel's blog:]

This week, I talk to Sonia Arrison, author of "100 Plus: How the Coming Age of Longevity Will Change Everything, From Careers and Relationships to Family and Faith" She says that future generations will have time to change jobs, change families, and that the first person who will live to be 150-years-old is already alive.

Swedish professor Hans Rosling will explain his video that celebrates the miracle of the washing machine. His TED talk videos have been viewed millions of times online.

"An Idea walked into a bar..." British author Matt Ridley says the world gets better because "ideas have sex." He's on to something. We'll discuss how ideas have sex and then produce better ideas.

Finally, entrepreneur Peter Diamandis offers multi-million dollar prizes for winners of competitions to do things like:

â€¢Land a robot on the moon

â€¢Invent a 100 miles-per-gallon car

â€¢Invent a phone that gives you better medical diagnoses than your doctor might.

His competitions foment more innovation than government central planning ever has.

Please join us tonight to see how ideas having sex give us a wonderful world.
