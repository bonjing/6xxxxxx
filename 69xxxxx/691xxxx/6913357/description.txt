Set in suburban Flatpoint, USA, Strangers with Candy twisted the conventions of the After-School Special to create a completely original comedy series. Each half hour follows the misadventures of Jerri Blank, a 46 year old high school dropout who has spent the last 32 years in and out of prison - a self described "boozer, user and loser." Strangers with Candy commences as Jerri decides to pick up her life exactly where she left it: living at home and starting ninth grade. Faced with classic high school dilemmas every week, Jerri's old habits - as well as the misguided advice of her self-centered teachers - cause her to resolve each crisis by learning the wrong lesson from every scenario.
