Classic Steam Train Collection
Flying Scotsman â€“ AVI 

THE ULTIMATE PICTORIAL RECORD OF HOW THE WORLD\'S MOST FAMOUS EXPRESS LOCOMOTIVE STEAMED TRIUMPHANTLY INTO THE MILLENNIUM, REBORN WITH FAR GREATER POWER THAN SIR NIGEL GRESLEY HAD EVER ENVISAGED.


IT IS A STORY OF FINANCIAL NIGHTMARES AND ENGINEERING EXCELLENCE AND IT\'S TOLD WITH THE HELP OF THREE MEN, HER OWNER, THE CHIEF ENGINEER, AND THE TRACTION INSPECTOR WHO WAS ON THE FOOTPLATE AT KEY MOMENTS.


IN BR DAYS THE ENGINE, THEN NUMBERED 60103, PRODUCED JUST UNDER 33,000 POUNDS OF TRACTIVE EFFORT. BUT HIGHER BOILER PRESSURE, BIGGER CYLINDERS AND IMPROVED STEAM PASSAGES ALL CONTRIBUTED TO THE FLYING SCOTSMAN IMPROVING THAT TO 40 000 POUNDS.


A PROFESSIONAL TV DOCUMENTARY CREW INTENSIVELY FILMED THE ENGINE IN ACTION DURING HER FIRST YEAR BACK ON THE MAINLINE. THE RESULT IS A UNIQUE TWO PART FILM, \'A DAY IN THE LIFE\' AND \'A YEAR IN THE LIFE\' - THE STAR OF THEM BOTH IS â€œFLYING SCOTSMANâ€.


Total running time â€“ 70 Minutes
