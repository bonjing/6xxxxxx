is a 2003 role-playing video game that was developed by tri-Crescendo and
Monolith Soft and published by Namco in Japan, North America and Europe and by
Nintendo Australia for Australia and New Zealand for the Nintendo GameCube.
First released in Japan in 2003, it is the first game in the Baten Kaitos
series, and takes place after Baten Kaitos Origins, a prequel released in 2006.
It tells the story of a young man named Kalas and his companion Xelha, who live
in an aerial island-based kingdom in the clouds. The title, Baten Kaitos, comes
from Arabic meaning "belly of the sea monster" and is also the name of the star
Zeta Ceti.

This game is notorious for its terrible english voice acting, to a point where
a lot of people actually played it with voices disabled. This version of the
game is undubbed: english voices are replaced by the original japanese voices,
but the text is still translated.

The game can be played on a modded Wii or using the Dolphin emulator:
