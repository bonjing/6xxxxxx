The 1940's House
One modern family takes on the challenge of domestic life on Britain's home front in this gritty re-creation of a World War II household, 1940s HOUSE. This time-travel experiment covers the period from the outbreak of the war in 1939 to Victory Day in 1945, compressing six wartime years into nine weeks. The military threat is metaphorical, but the privations are real and the pressure creates surprising tensions nonexistent in modern society.
"This entry in the PBS "House" series is outstanding. Here, a modern British family (husband and wife, their daughter, and two grandsons) experience life during WWII with all of its hard work, deprivation, and fear. Costumed and coiffed in wartime styles, the family certainly looked the part, and their home was outfitted for the period in every detail. They received daily original radio war broadcasts and vintage newspapers and so were able to follow the "progress" of the war. Air raids and rationing contributed to making their nine weeks in the house a sobering and unforgettable experience. The women of the family worked around the clock but never resorted to cheating or actually quitting, as was the case in other "House" programs. The two little boys were adorable and kept everyone's spirits up. An excellent epilogue filmed six months later showed how much the family learned from their time in the 1940s house and how they had grown and become happier as a result. This is a wonderful program; it really recreates the British war experience and is one of the best shows. I was often moved to tears by the radio broadcasts, war statistics, and haunting music; they made it all seem very real. Highly recommended" Harry65.
