Hello Everybody!
Today, I uploaded this file for you to use to your computer or laptop.
It's a Windows 7 Professional Service Pack 1 32-BIT ISO file, which means that you can install this on your computer from a USB Drive or DVD-R or DVD-RW disc. 
Make sure to now burn this on a CD disc because it won't fit. This is a Retail Windows 7 Professional SP1 ISO, which means that there are no cracks, key generator, activator, or hacks. This is included with Service Pack 1, which is the latest for Windows 7. Also, this is a bootable image, so you won't face any problems during the setup. Also again, make sure you read the system requirements for Windows 7 x86. (Note: Don't Install This on a x64 Computer! Something Bad Can Happen.) So, go to the "Windows Family" website: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/system-requirements

So enjoy and please seed. Also, comment me if anything is wrong with this ISO file during the setup like any errors.

PCs with multi-core processors:
Windows 7 was designed to work with today's multi-core processors. All 32-bit versions of Windows 7 can support up to 32 processor cores, while 64â€‘bit versions can support up to 256 processor cores.

PCs with multiple processors (CPUs):

Windows 7 Professional:

Work anywhere more easily and securely

If you use your PC for work, you'll want Windows 7 Professional. It can help you be more productive and protect the critical information you need to work with. Many routine tasks just take a couple of clicks, so you can spend less time setting up projectors, printers, and networks. Enhanced backup options can help you protect your hard work with automatic backups to your home or business network. And with Windows XP Mode, you can use most of your Windows XP programs in Windows 7.
