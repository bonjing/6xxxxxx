Unintelligent Design

Arts Documentary hosted by Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews, published by Channel 4 in 2010 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

A rare opportunity to poke around inside the heads of Father Ted creators Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews and find out who they admire and where they draw their inspiration from. Every comedy writer has been influenced in some way by what came before, and they are certainly no different. By revealing what makes up their own comedy DNA, they show what inspired them to create Father Ted and the rest of the Craggy Islanders. There are clips from some comedy classics that you would expect - such as Fawlty Towers, Only Fools and Horses, Seinfeld and The Simpsons - as well as weird stuff from the real world that inspired some of their favourite characters. They discuss the comedians and stand-ups, the priests, politicians and Irish beauty pageants that have directly influenced their comedy world, as well as their obsession with the feature film The Heartbreak Kid.
