Jules and Ann are young married lesbians who run a successful tattoo shop in LA. Their two-year marriage is showing some strain. Ann loves Jules and Jules loves Ann, but there's something missing, at least for Jules. One day, Jim (Xander), Ann's step-brother by marriage, comes back to California and to Ann's life, after disappearing in New York and Paris for a few years. Ann's history with Jim is complicated. Almost-sex-as-teens complicated... Ann sublimates her feelings for Jim by focusing on Jules. While Jules wonders what wonders might exist on the other side... of Jim's zipper for instance. Can Ann and Jules survive a most dangerous liaison? Will Jim provide sexual healing for Ann and for Jules? Let's just say there are three sides to every story, and it's never been more true than now!
