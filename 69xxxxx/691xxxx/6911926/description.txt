This torrent contains ALL 15 sessions from the american accent training program by Paul Gruber. The official website of the program is www.pronunciationworkshop.com.
All sessions are in mp4 video format and they are of different video quality. For some the quality is not so good but they are the best I cold find on the internet, so please dont complain...
There is another torrent of this program in piratebay, but the uploader doesnt seed, so I uploaded this one.
I renamed all the videos to their corresponding session title for your convenience.
This full program includes the manuals in pdf and the videos, and this torrent contains the full program.
P.S. This is my first torrent, enjoy:)
