,BAshKd,2012-05-31T10:25Z,thanks globe for the time you put in but the compression really destroyed it. The sound is terrible fmvs are awful and the Sandman bug is a huge issue. But a lot of your game rips are good lately such as driver sf and blur however rips like NFS Hot Pursuit were great. Can't you upload like those please and please check the comments on your torrents. much appreciated
