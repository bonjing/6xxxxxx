*****************************************************************************

This authoritative book provides a comprehensive review of the various surface engineering techniques employed to improve the properties of light alloys, focussing on titanium, magnesium and aluminium alloys. It examines surface related degradation of light alloys and covers surface engineering technologies in detail. The book includes chapters on corrosion behaviour of Mg alloys, anodising treatments of Mg alloys, micro-arc oxidation of light alloys, physical vapour deposition of light alloys, PIII/PSII of light alloys; laser surface modification of Ti alloys, plasma nitriding of Ti and Al alloys, duplex surface treatments of light alloys and biomedical devices using Ti alloys.

Key Features: discusses surface degradation of light alloys considering corrosion behaviour and wear and tribological properties; examines surface engineering technologies and modification featuring plasma electrolytic oxidation treatments and both thermal and cold spraying; reviews applications for engineered light alloys in sports equipment, biomedical devices and spacecraft; explores the role of laser surface modification including current methods and processing conditions as well future trends.
