,tyecita,2012-01-11T03:32Z,@mreid75 Someone already upload season 1 (COMPLETE) of the bubble guppies as a direct download go to a top warez site. I won't because it isn't my upload & I haven't asked for permission to put it in a torrent. I'll see about the bubble guppies. Right now I'm looking for Oobi!! That torrent died and my kid is begging for that show and there are no episodes I could download! it's just so frustrating when torrent die!
