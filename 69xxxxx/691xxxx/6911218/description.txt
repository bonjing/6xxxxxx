RELEASE NOTES

Although you can patch our releases with the .bin files that were
released, we thought we'd also provide a pack of AP2.5 Topology Data
PPF patches that can be quickly applied directly to the original ISOs
of all our XGD3 releases to date for you to use with the new iXtreme
LT+ v3.0.

Apply the .ppf patches with the included ppf-o-matic3 to the original
release ISO. Burn and enjoy!
