Since I got into Photoshop  Assassins Creed has been one of my favourite images to make Photoshop things from. 
And this pack has the Wallpapers Ive collected and the Renders that Ive cut from them as well as a couple of Avatars etc Ive used and 1 I always will.

Im one of the strange people on the WWW who doesnt actually play games so the interest I have with the Assassin is just artistic lol

I hope that these will come in handy for you and has saved you some hours in Googling and the cutting of renders for your use.

I would like to take time to thank all the wallpaper posting and games sites that these have been taken from. If not for you peeps it will have been a very hard task for us grafix and signature makers to do our pastime.


Im sure you will find this pack well worth the downloading and if you need ANY other Photoshop resources (Renders Stocks C4Ds Fractals Vectors Brushes Textures Brushes etc etc)
Or you need help or advice with anything grafix related or just fancy joining a photoshop forum to be with like minded peeps who have a laugh while making things then come and see us 
at one of the sites below. You will be more than welcome to join in. Just leave your ego at home but to bring your imagination.

Love and peace
