Description:

This book explains healthy male sexuality, written by, for and about men. It is for men and their partners as they negotiate their sexuality around healthy practices. The work is organized around three main topics -- awareness and enhancement of sexuality, dealing with sexual problems, and lifelong healthy sexuality. A multidimensional model for a comprehensive understanding of sexual health and sexual problems founded on current biological, psychological, and medical research is discussed in terms appropriate for the general reader.

The authors explore the barriers and problems that limit sexual practice, discuss how to pursue sexual and relationship health, enhance sexual satisfaction.

Problems such as premature ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, inhibited sexual desire, ejaculatory inhibition and compulsive sexual behavior are examined in terms of their causes and prescriptions for treatment are offered.

Exercises and activities engage the reader to highlight important points, provide skills training, and stimulate healthy sexual practice.
