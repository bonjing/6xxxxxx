Source Used





Unknown...............Thanks/


V2 as i thought i would have a crack at this wonderful vid ;-)




One for 100% cam lovers around the world :-) 


Vid is not great at all not a great deal can be done with it so hopefully a better source shows 


Done what i can with this but not gonna be good enough for most.Vid had loads of noise/flicker/glare/scroll denoised heavily then slight sharpen back up

Added more saturation .........played with the levels filter (no not like that) to try and brighten it up abit......rest is blah blah ....probs abit like this release


Check out the sample included its needed 



One last thing i noticed this seems to get playback errors in vlc player towards the end if you skip abit but media player plays it fine so lets hope you learned to read descriptions 

Lets face it this is hardly one to watch on a big TV
