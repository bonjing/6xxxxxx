Age of Mythology Gold Edition is a double-pack that includes both the original game and the Age of Mythology: The Titans expansion. The game has proven to be quite popular since its initial release, winning many awards and continuing to appear among top-selling PC games.

Developed by Ensemble Studios, the tactical strategy game--a spin-off of the Age of Empires series--eschews historical accuracy for mythological fantasy, pitting the earliest civilizations from world history against classic monsters of ancient fables. Greek, Norse, Egyptian, and even Atlantian armies face off against--or partner with--creatures like cyclopes and medusas.
