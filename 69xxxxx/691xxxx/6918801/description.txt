This is Holy Quran which is revealed by Allah Subhana ho Wataala on His last Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUM). Quran is a complete Law for Peace, Humanity, Justice and Social Morals. It is never changed since it is revealed on the Holy Prophet and will never be changed because the responsibility of it Protection is Guaranteed by Allah Almighty. I also strongly recommend you to read The Quran with concordance approach and afterward you may read It with conflict approach.
