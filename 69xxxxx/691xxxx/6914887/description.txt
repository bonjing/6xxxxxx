 PLOT 

 Originally filmed in 3-D, Friday the 13th Part 3 presents another chapter in
 the life (or should I say after-life) of Jason, a boy who drowned in the
 waters of Crystal Lake. Camp counselors have proven to be no match for Jason
 in the earlier films of this series, but this time he encounters more
 formidable opponents in the form of members of a motorcycle gang. The action
 takes place on a rustic farm that provides both the serene setting and the
 privacy Jason desires when stalking his prey.

 This would be alot nicer in 3D. But Jason gets his mask, that's kinda kewl :)

 aGGr0 iNFO 
 
 aGGr0 has been around since 2oo2, at first mainly releasing mp3 and svcd.
 Since late 2oo3 we are only concentrating on quality rips of quality movies.
 We just love AC3 and XViD, and love those movies you won't find elsewhere.
 We are on a quest to widen the minds of those who enjoy film, with lots of
 different types of movies, from lots of different decades. From time to time
 we may release a dupe, but we don't believe that a good release in XViD is
 a dupe on a crappy release made on svcd 3 years ago. If you don't agree,
 then nuke us. We love movies, and we love to spread them for _your_ pleasure,
 not nukers. We are a small group, consisting of friends, ripping the movies
 we love to watch. If you like our releases - spread them. And remember that
 a movie worth watching is a movie worth buying. Stay drunk and stay disco!
