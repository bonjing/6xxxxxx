|   +--------+                                                                 |
|   French pianist Samson Francois enjoyed a special, innovative role in the   |
|   history of piano music in the second half of the 20th century. Francois    |
|   was the son of a French consul and led a cosmopolitan life even as a       |
|   child. He was discovered by the master of Italian verismo, Pietro          |
|   Mascagni, won his pianistic spurs at the Belgrade Conservatory and met     |
|   up in Nice with Alfred Cortot, who eventually sent him to the famous       |
|   Paris piano teacher Marguerite Long.                                       |
|                                                                              |
|   His success in the first Concours international de piano et violon         |
|   Marguerite Long -- Jacques Thibaud in 1943 smoothed the nineteen-year-     |
|   old's way to a great career -- partly as a pianist, partly as a            |
|   composer. International stars of the rostrum such as Leonard Bernstein,    |
|   Charles Munch, Dmitri Mitropoulos or Andre Cluytens soon noticed the new   |
|   French piano genius, and Francois was one of the very first Western        |
|   artists to appear in China.                                                |
|                                                                              |
|   Maybe it was his heightened interest in composing that turned Francois     |
|   against the tradition of the Romantic and late-Romantic piano school       |
|   exemplified by Horowitz, Rubinstein or Godowsky. He was keen to present    |
|   Classical-Romantic music in the expressive language of the latter half     |
|   of the 20th century. And although he soon made a name for himself as a     |
|   brilliant Chopin and Liszt interpreter, critics were equally quick to      |
|   find fault with his modernist readings of familiar works.                  |
|                                                                              |
|   His interpretations of the great Classical and Romantic composers from     |
|   Mozart and Beethoven to Brahms were in the spirit of the early 1950s --    |
|   radical, unconventional and sometimes disturbingly different. Francois     |
|   had more of a fundamental affinity to composers of the late 19th and       |
|   early 20th century -- Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel and Sergey             |
|   Prokofiev.                                                                 |
|                                                                              |
|   They not only made the most of his extraordinary technical virtuosity;     |
|   they served as a primer of modern form and expression. He premiered his    |
|   own piano concerto in 1951; the critics, while respecting Francois's       |
|   interpretative achievement, found his work too close to that of            |
|   Prokofiev.                                                                 |
|                                                                              |
|   Audiences always loved Francois. Indeed, his personal and artistic         |
|   versatility may still be witnessed in a film portrait shot by Claude       |
|   Santelli three years before Francois's early death. A pupil of the great   |
|   Alfred Cortot, Samson Francois took from his master the special            |
|   spontaneity in his playing which distinguished him from other French       |
|   pianists of his day. The elegance of his playing, coupled with great       |
|   technical fluency and a fiery temperament, made him a great interpreter    |
|   of the music of Chopin. Together with Cortot, Francois recorded one of     |
|   the best Chopin's piano concerto Op.21.                                    |
|                                                                              |
