   Rippers notes: Not much to say about this one..its one of
                  the best movies made in the 90:s with great
                  acting and a sizzling plot.

       aGGr0 was founded in 2oo2, consisting of only one member.
      Now we're a few more, spreading our love and joy throughout
       the world. At first, we mainly did svcd and mp3, but since
        november 2oo3 we're just into xvid (and a dvdr or two,
         occasionally). Our goal is to satisfy those who like
       movies, and watching them in the best quality attainable
        by xvid, with ac3 sound and vobsubs whenever possible.
       We release a variety of types of movies, both horror and
         comedies, drama and pure b-crap. All our releases are
              made from retail dvd's and we own them all.
                Remember, kids! A movie worth watching
                    a second time is worth buying!
