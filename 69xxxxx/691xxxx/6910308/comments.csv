,thanksforallthefish,2012-03-20T01:05Z,"Okay here is my true final gift, and it's a big one: The file ""silvya1ntsc.avi"" in the torrent is broken and unplayable in every player. Well, not really. After lots of investigating, I found that it wasn't actually broken at all, but it contains the wrong ""media code"" (fourcc). So, how do you make it playable? Well, just download search Google for a tool called the ""avi fourcc code changer"", then load the file into that tool, and type ""MPG2"" into BOTH fields, and hit Apply. That's it. The file will then be properly marked as Mpeg-2 and will be playable! ;) As for what is in it? Well, it's actually mislabeled, and it contains: Sylvia's entire first DVD (she made two), which in turn contains all content from the later separately-release Sylvia Videos 1 to 4. That should answer the uploader's request for video 4. ;) Other videos in this pack have some minor errors like lacking indexes, but they can be played with VLC. This information is my second contribution as gratitude for this torrent! :) Have fun!"
