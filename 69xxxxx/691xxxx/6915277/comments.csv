o Copy at CBR[Constant Bit Rate] 320Kbps or VBR[Variable Bit Rate] V0[~245Kbps]. V1[~225Kbps]
These encoder settings produce transparent encoding which means most people can't distinguish the mp3 from the original audio track in an ABX blind test! Audible differences between these settings exist but are rare! With a few exceptions... ie for dogs and some other animals, quality is rarely superior or detectible to the highest VBR settings described above! What this means is that FLAC is a waste of space and effort as the human ear cannot distinguish the audible differences between CD, FLAC and HQ CBR 320 and VBR 245 or 225! End of Discussion!
