CONRAD
"2012 INVASION"
Hosted By Tapestars, 
DJ Illmatic & DJ Skullator


With an addictive, pop-accessible hook-laden sound, inspired by Tupac, Eminem, T.I., Chamillionaire and  more, Conrad is poised to take the radio and the streets by storm. His vision for unmatched success, which  is bringing the attention of Hip-Hop fans and industry alike, is balanced by his intense love for struggling communities and dream to elevate the spirits of other kids hoping to defeat hardships of the streets. Rather than express anger and frustration over the circumstance he faced as a youth, he serves as an example that crime and gang culture are not the only way out: positive attitude can defeat negativity at the end of the day. Watch out for Conrad, with his buzz, infectious songs and work ethic, he will be a force to be reckoned with for some time to come.
