The movie poster says ""The best British thriller in years"". I would say, luckily for the British movie industry, this is just an opinion, and a very wrong one.
On the other hand, I would say it's not fair to blame froggie100, or the 26K Team, for the worst movie I had seen in years. If you want to blame someone, than blame Ben Wheatley Director/Writer of this monstrosity.
Do yourself a favor, and skip this one, you won't miss anything. "
