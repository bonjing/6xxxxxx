So this is a v2. What is different?
The v1 was badly muxed and the subs got desynced. Also this fixes an issue with 10bit encoding which made a very very slight color shift towards red. If you dont want to redownload (and you normally shouldnt), remux the v1 in mkvtoolnix with a delay of -360ms, and thats it.
