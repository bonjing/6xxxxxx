"Bad TV makes for good Soup."
This Emmy-winning show, hosted by comedian Joel McHale, serves up a wickedly funny, fast-paced smÃ¶rgÃ¥sbord of the most titillating -- and at times tasteless -- segments on talk TV. From The Tonight Show to Jerry Springer, the show covers the gamut. Shortly after Talk Soup ended, this updated program was originally named "The What the ? Awards," but soon after the premiere changed to its current name and format.

The success of the show is evident in the number of spin-offs it has spawned. These include The Dish, Sports Soup, Web Soup, and the UK counterpart Celebrity Soup.
