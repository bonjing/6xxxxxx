Description

Plot: Scooby and the gang have their first musical mystery in â€œScooby Doo: Song of the Vampire.â€ It begins when they take a sing-a-long road trip into bayou country to attend the â€œVampire-Palooza Festivalâ€ â€“ an outdoor fair dedicated to all things Draculian. At first it looks as if theyâ€™re in for some fun and lots of Southern snacks, but events soon turn scary when a real live vampire comes to life, bursts from his coffin and threatens all the townsfolk. On top of that, this baritone blood sucker seems intent on taking Daphne as his vampire bride! Could the vampire be a descendant of a famous vampire hunter who is trying to sell his book? Or perhaps heâ€™s the local politician, who has been trying to make his name in the press by attacking the vampires as downright unwholesome. The answers are to be found in a final song-filled showdown in the swamp in which our heroes unmask one of their most macabre monsters yet.
