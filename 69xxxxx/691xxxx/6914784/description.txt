MERCY DEE WALTON  TROUBLESOME MIND
Label Arhoolie
Original Released: 1961
Format: Mp3@320cbr

Fine 16-song selection from the California-based pianist's 1961 sessions for Chris Strachwitz's Arhoolie logo. A trio of sympathetic cohorts (harpist Sidney Maiden, guitarist K.C. Douglas, and drummer Otis Cherry) give the music a rough-edged barroom feel as Dee pounds out "After the Fight," "Call the Asylum," and a nice remake of his dour "One Room Country Shack." ~ Bill Dahl
