Jasc Paint Shop Pro 8, PSP8, full version with crack.

This will run on XP, Vista and Windows 7.  

It is more "intuitive" than Photoshop and easier to learn to 

use.  

Ideal for photo retouching or making pictures for a website.  

It has a size reducer to minimize the KB of jpg, gif and png. 

 

You can even make transparent pictures for websites - 

see

The only problem it may give you is when you crop a picture 

on Vista or Windows 7:

Just click on the "Crop" icon.  Place the curser in position 

in the lower right of picture.  Click.  Then move up to the 

top left.  After that you are okay.  You can adjust the sides 

of the cropped area. Then double click to actually crop the 

picture.

If you crop downwards, for example, the program doesn't like 

it.

Apart from this small issue Paint Shop Pro is ideal for those 

who want to get to work quickly - without reading a manual.

By the way Jasc was taken over by Corel.  The Corel Paint 

Shop Pro is rubbish compared to this Jasc version.
