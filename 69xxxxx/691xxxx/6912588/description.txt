Elizabeth Barnard was found dead at her parent's property at Phillip Island on the 23rd of September 1986. The 23 year old had her throat cut and the letter "A" carved into her chest. The alleged... more killer Vivienne Cameron disappeared without a trace on the same night. At the time of her death, Beth was having an affair with Fergus Cameron, Vivienne's husband. On the night of the murder Vivienne accused her husband of having an affair with Beth Barnard. They agreed to separate immediately with Vivienne moving to Melbourne and Fergus remaining on Phillip Island with both the children. Vivienne drove Fergus to his sister's house. She was never seen again. Early the next morning Beth Barnard's body was discovered and Vivienne's deserted car was found near the San Remo Bridge on the island. After an extensive three day land and sea search, Vivienne's body was never found.
