            Plot: The second part of the trilogy begins as Doc, Marty
                  and Jennifer take the time-traveling DeLorean into
                  the year 2015 to straighten out the future of the
                  McFly family. But Biff Tannen steals the time
                  machine and gives his younger self a book
                  containing 50 years of sports statistics, which
                  the young Biff uses to amass an enormous gambling
                  fortune and transform idyllic Hill Valley into a
                  living hell. To restore the present, Doc and Marty
                  must return to the events of their previous
                  adventure in 1955 and retrieve the book.

       aGGr0 was founded in 2oo2, consisting of only one member.
      Now we're a few more, spreading our love and joy throughout
       the world. At first, we mainly did svcd and mp3, but since
        november 2oo3 we're just into xvid (and a dvdr or two,
         occasionally). Our goal is to satisfy those who like
       movies, and watching them in the best quality attainable
        by xvid, with ac3 sound and vobsubs whenever possible.
       We release a variety of types of movies, both horror and
         comedies, drama and pure b-crap. All our releases are
              made from retail dvd's and we own them all.
                Remember, kids! A movie worth watching
                    a second time is worth buying!
