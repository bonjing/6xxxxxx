History Channel Documentary from way back about the Mauntain Men

From Amazon:

Join us as we trek across America's vast wilderness with the fur trappers who helped open up the unknown and savage land, and risked everything for a life of adventure, money, and wanderlust. Although their era (1807-1840) lasted little more than generation, their impact was enormous as they blazed across the west.
