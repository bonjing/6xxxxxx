 This documentary tells the heart warming story of Christian, 
 a lion cub purchased from a London department store in the late 
 60's and successfully released into the African wild three years 
 later. Featuring original archive footage and photographs of Christian's 
 life in London and Kenya, the story is told by all the key players in 
 interviews filmed in 2009.
