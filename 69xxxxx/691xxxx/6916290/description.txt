Tipped as the most exciting British magician to emerge in decades and with a list of celebrity fans that reads like a 'who's who' of the Hollywood elite, Dynamo: Magician Impossible is the story of an ordinary boy from Bradford living an extraordinary life. Like his dear grandfather before him, Dynamo grew up practicing precision card-handling and developing powerful magical skills.

The series sees the 28-year-old travelling the globe as the unassuming anti-hero who just happens to astound everyone he meets, whether it's an international footballer or Hollywood actor.

In episode one, Dynamo performs his spectacular matrix style levitation, physically moves a girl's tan line on the glamorous Miami Beach and performs magic with Manchester rock legend Ian Brown.

Other highlights in this mind blowing series include; transporting a mobile phone into a glass beer bottle, magically transforming snow into diamonds in the Austrian mountains and bringing a flutter of butterflies to life in Hollywood's famous Chateau Marmont.

Throughout the series, Dynamo: Magician Impossible will take viewers on his magical journey before stunning them with incredible, headline-grabbing stunts beyond the realms of possibility.
