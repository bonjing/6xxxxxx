Zach Anner, an internet favorite when he auditioned for the show last summer, is the host of Rollin' with Zach, a travel show aimed at people who enjoy adventure. His funny and unique take on travel will focus on unusual places around the country and provide tips on how to cope when things go wrong when travelling. According to Zach, "the adventure is in the attitude." Zach, who has cerebral palsy, became a fan favorite with his audition tape calling himself the "the sexiest palsy," even drawing the attention of John Mayer, who composed the show's theme song.
