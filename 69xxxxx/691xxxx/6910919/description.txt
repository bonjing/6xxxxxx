Death in its prime!
Denial of life, zombie ritual, 
pull the plug, left 2 die. One of the best death metal concerts I've never 
been to - I was only 12 at the time and on the other side of the planet. Video 
quality 5-6/10, sound 7/10, camera work 6/10 (semi-pro, missed most solos, 
though still fun).
Digitized from VHS by Lombard Butterfly Society (LBS). Bringing to u obscure 
classics only, since 1999.
