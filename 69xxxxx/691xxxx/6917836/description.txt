Ron and Amy Shirley primarily repossess vehicles and machinery. Their clients are lien holders. Ron's role is to locate and repossess property, while Amy deals with irate owners who come demanding that their property be returned. Ron opened "Lizard Lick Towing" in 1998 with one truck. With Amy's help, the business grew over a period of 10 years to become a successful company with a staff of 15 and a fleet of 20 trucks. Ron, who is an ordained minister with a soft spot for people who have fallen on hard times, prepares a huge barbecue meal each year to help some of the people who have had their property repossessed by "Lizard Lick Towing".
