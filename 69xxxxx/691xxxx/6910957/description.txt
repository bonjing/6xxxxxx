Here are some key features of "ESET NOD32 Antivirus":

Smarter Scanner:
Â· Threats don't always enter your network in ways you expect. ESET NOD32 Antivirus inspects SSL-encrypted communication channels
like HTTPS and POP3S and intelligently scans compressed files to find hidden threats other products miss. Proactive protection begins at
the earliest point in system startup to ensure your computer is always secure.

clients, ensuring your email is free of viruses and other threats.

Removable Media Security:
Â· Threats can enter your PC from removable media such as USB thumb drives. For self-running media, ESET NOD32 Antivirus scans
autorun.inf and associated files when the medium is inserted, in addition to scanning any file on any removable device when it is accessed,
or during a full-scan of the media. Power users can adjust ESET NOD32 Antivirus to perform additional levels of scanning on removable
media.

System Tools:
Â· ESET SysInspector and ESET SysRescue simplify diagnosing and cleaning of infected systems by allowing deep scans of system
processes to find hidden threats, and creating bootable rescue CD/DVD or USB drives to help you repair an infected computer.

Self Defense:
Â· ESET NOD32 Antivirus has built-in technology to prevent malicious software from corrupting or disabling it, so you can rest assured
your system is always protected.
