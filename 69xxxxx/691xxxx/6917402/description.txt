 You'll need a program to mount the ISO image. I use daemon tools. Here's a list of programs you can use:


    Daemon Tools         http://www.filehippo.com/download_daemon_tools/
    Virtual CloneDrive  
    PowerISO             http://poweriso.com/
    MagicISO            
      
     you can find their cracks or serials on youtube
