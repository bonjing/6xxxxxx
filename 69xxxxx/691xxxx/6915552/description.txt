├óΓé¼┼ô7/7 What Did They Know?├óΓé¼┬¥ is a new documentary from WideShut.co.uk, exploring the intelligence that was available to the police and security services prior to the July 7, 2005, London Bombings.

Officials claim they had no inkling of what was to befall London, but using newspaper reports, testimony and evidence from the inquest, the film reveals that Britain was warned continuously about threats to the Underground, actively planned to prevent them and had specific knowledge that two of the alleged bombers were involved in terrorist related activities.

More shocking is the evidence that during the 90s there was a semi-secret Government policy to allow extremists to operate in Britain and even send young men to terror training camps in Pakistan, when it suited Blair├óΓé¼Γäós foreign policy in the Balkans. Furthermore there├óΓé¼Γäós a possibility that extremists who surrounded the alleged bombers before the attacks had all at some point worked for British or allied intelligence agencies.

With the limited scope of the inquest, family members are still calling for an independent public inquiry to get to the bottom of this devastating event.
