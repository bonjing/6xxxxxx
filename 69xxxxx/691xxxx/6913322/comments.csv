mend this torrent. I'm using Windows 7 Ultimate X64 SP1 and the instalation of this torrent fucked up with my system. After every the instalation my system freezes every restart of my machine. I could just resolve this problem restauring my system to a point before the instalation of PowerDVD. Hope PirateBay removes VIP status of this user cause i think no one can have a VIP status releasing bugged software at PirateBay...
