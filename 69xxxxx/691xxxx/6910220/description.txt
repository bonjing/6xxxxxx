Since this was not released commercially you can support Yves by purchasing his solo albums that have been released under his pseudonym, \'Apjiw\'.  You can find his albums \"Think Over\" and \"Things\" on iTunes.  Send some support his way to show thanks for producing this phenomenal soundtrack to a great movie.  Your support will help him develop and produce more tracks in the future.  

Don\'t forget to help me seed.  I can\'t do this alone and you\'re obligated to put back what you took from me.  Theoretically I\'m only supposed to upload this torrent one time.  So do your part and help out!  There would be nothing to download without people giving back what they took.
