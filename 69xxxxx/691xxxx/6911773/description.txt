=============================

The X-Men anime is written by famed English comic book writer/creator Warren Ellis, and borrows story elements from famed Scottish comic book writer Grant Morrisonâ€™s early 2000s story arch for New X-Men, as well as Joss Whedonâ€™s mid-2000s run on Astonishing X-Men.

"Countdown - Shinjitsu" (Countdown-çœŸå®Ÿ)  June 10, 2011
 
The X-Men menage to defeat Rat, but Mastermind and Mash escape. As they head inward, they discover a machine for tracking mutants, similar to Cerebra. When Riko and KÅichi recover and catch up, Yui is forced to admit that she built the mutant tracker for the U-Men because her medication is made from mutant organs and necessary to protect this mysterious power source, and the U-Men could supply them for her. The X-Men are horrified and Beast surmises that the medicine is weakening and this power source is leaking from the lab, causing the accelerated Damon-Hall Syndrome in mutants living near Tohoku. Entering the center, they discover Mastermind next to a near-comatose young man who Yui reveals to be Takeo (the still-living son of her and Charles). Mastermind reveals that Yui allied with the U-Men to save her son, an Omega-class telepath with the uncontrollable power to warp reality, which Mastermind wishes to use to change reality to one with mutants in power. He also reveals that he initiated the U-Men into the Inner Circle to get closer to Takeo, supporting the U-Men 
this entire time. In disguise as Jun, he purposefully withheld power suppressants from Takeo for the past three months and gradually destroyed his mind with telepathy, leaving him ripe for use. The Inner Circle's White Bishop Neuron appears and kills Riko and KÅichi by overloading their sensory input. He then subdues Logan and Beast while Mastermind causes Takeo to unleash his powers. Meanwhile in the dimensional rift, Charles is able to break free after hearing Jean Grey's voice encouraging him not to give up.
