Whether you're an Elements newbie or an experienced veteran, this book will teach you all you need to know--from adjustments to bring out the best in your photos, editing in five easy steps, and repairing color and lighting, to working with raw files--and much more! The chapter structure has been completely revamped, with more emphasis on the features that users request to get up and running quickly. This includes a new introductory chapter on editing in five easy steps and more comprehensive coverage on handling Camera Raw images from DSLR shooters. This fully updated edition includes: concise, step-by-step instructions; hundreds of carefully edited full color photographs; screen captures of program features; supplemental tips and sidebars; and a thorough table of contents and index. This guide for both Windows and Mac OS X follows the integration of the Elements 10 software with parallel features for both platforms.
