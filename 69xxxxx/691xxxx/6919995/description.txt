After you've uncovered the basics in Lion, Mac Kung Fu is your next step. You'll learn how to master everyday tools such as the Dock, Spotlight, Mission Control, Launchpad, and Dashboard. You'll discover other amazingly useful tools and built-in add-ons that you never knew existed. You'll customize the OS X interface, refine your workflow, learn valuable security tricks, work better with photos, movies and documents, and test your Mac hardware. You'll wow friends with your insanely great Mac knowledge!

Mac Kung Fu details things even Mac Geniuses don't know. And why should they? Many of the tips in this book exploit settings or experimental features never officially made public.

Each tip in this unique book is deliberately short and readable, and you can dip in and out whenever you want. Most take less than a minute to complete, yet the results last for a lifetime of better computing.
