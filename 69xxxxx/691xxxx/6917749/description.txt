"Creepers" A fantasy feature abduction film
Man terror breaks into coed's apartment after class.

Welcome to another installment of the Hogtied feature movie series. These movies are real life fantasies of the girls who appear in the films, played out in a safe and sane environment for your viewing pleasure. This month's installment is "Creepers" starring Kaylee Hilton.

Kaylee attends a private all girls college. Her future looks bright, she is among the wealthiest and prestigious of the social classes that attend the university. In just her freshman year she has made the Deans list and looks to be one of Universities brightest students.

The two men who lurk in the bushes outside of her apartment almost every night know her schedule and know it well. They have been watching Kaylee since she moved in. They have seen her study, eat, bathe, dress, undress and even masturbate. They are Creepers, men who get off on watching. They are harmless in the sense they are not dangerous, but violate one's most private moments. A heinous but non-violent crime.

On a ordinary night during an ordinary week, the creepers are there, but terror joins them. A man follows Kaylee home and breaks into her house. The Creepers could give warning, could call the police, could even bust in and help. However their perversion forces them to watch, and watch they do. 

They see something they never dreamed in a thousand years they would see. The object of their perversion, stalked, attacked, overcome, chloroformed, bound, stripped, face fucked, ass fucked, and sexually used and tormented to a level they knew not existed. They like it, it turns them on. It is sick and twisted but they watch, and they watch till the end.
