Note : 
Well another 720p source :) this time for Sitters 
video needed alot of tlc. filters were used to fix
Darkness, contrast, levels, colours etc...
to me source had WAY to much red and yellow so 
tweaked them to my liking... Also changed Hue/sat 
alittle followed by a light sharpen... fixed AR to 
what i thought looked good... Audio is nice, so enjoy 
and remember it FREE so no complaining children :P
