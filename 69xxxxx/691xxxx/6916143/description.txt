====Zeitgeist Moving Forward (2011)==== 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1781069/plotsummary
A feature length documentary work which presents a case for a needed transition out of the current socioeconomic monetary paradigm which governs the entire world society. This subject matter will transcend the issues of cultural relativism and traditional ideology and move to relate the core, empirical \"life ground\" attributes of human and social survival, extrapolating those immutable natural laws into a new sustainable social paradigm called a \"Resource-Based Economy\"


====Zeitgeist Addendum (2008)==== 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1332128/plotsummary
Zeitgeist Addendum, attempts to locate the root causes of this pervasive social corruption, while offering a solution. This solution is not based on politics, morality, laws, or any other \"establishment\" notions of human affairs, but rather on a modern, non-superstitious based understanding of what we are and how we align with nature, to which we are a part. The work advocates a new social system which is updated to present day knowledge, highly influenced by the life long work of Jacque Fresco and The Venus Project.
