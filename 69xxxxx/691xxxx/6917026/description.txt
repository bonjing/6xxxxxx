With a fresh start, trying to
escape an abusive past, Vance
and his mother have just moved
to a new city. Searching for
a way to support his family
while continuing his education
he joins forces with Jules, who
is looking for a highly skilled,
basketball duel partner. With their
impressive talent these two start
cleaning the streets, winning
every duel in town. Once word
spreads they're invited to enter the
ultra-violent, competitive duel
championship. With high hopes for
the win they'll do whatever it takes
to walk off the court the new champions.
