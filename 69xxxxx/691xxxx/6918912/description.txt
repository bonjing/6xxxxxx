                Comedy duo Ben Miller and Alexander Armstrong star in
                their brand new sitcom Felix and Murdo. This one-off
                Christmas comedy, written by Simon Nye, is set in
                Edwardian London in 1908, the year the Olympic Games
                first came to the city. Murdo and Felix are 'modern'
                men and best friends who indulge in a drink and drugs
                spree while simultaneously competing in the
                Olympics... with no training whatsoever.
