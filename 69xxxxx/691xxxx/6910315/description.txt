Criterion Synopsis

A conniving father and daughter meet up with the heir to a brewery fortuneâ€”a wealthy but naÃ¯ve snake enthusiastâ€”and attempt to bamboozle him at a cruise ship card table. Their plan is quickly abandoned when the daughter falls in love with their prey. But when the heir gets wise to her gold-digging ways, she must plot to re-conquer his heart. One of Sturgesâ€™s most clever and beloved romantic comedies, The Lady Eve balances broad slapstick and sophisticated sexiness with perfect grace.
