Wiener Symphoniker, Conductor: John Lanchbery


IMDB: 8.2/10 | Choreography by Rudolf Nureyev | Director: Truck Branss; Writers: Vladimir Beghitchev, Vasili Geletzer
"One of the Best Nureyev DVD! This Swan Lake is one of the best I have ever seen. Though the Nureyev staging is very different from the "typical" staging, his performance is unrivaled. He carries the Pas de Cinq in Act I and does an amazing job in the Black Swan Pas de Deux of Act III. Fonteyn is also very good, though she is admittedly past the peak of her career. For all Nureyev fans, this is his best commercially available performance."
