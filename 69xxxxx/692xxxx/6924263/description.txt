**Link2Sd is an amazing app which gives android 2.1 users the ability to install apps on memory card(Without upgrading to android 2.2- also available in market for free).

**Your phone must be rooted in order to install this app.(Universal andro root is included in the package here).

**You also need to partition your memory card-using software such as MiniTool--at least two partitions and both must be primary.

**After rooting your phone and partitioning your memory card, install the Link2SD 1.9.9_60.apk on your phone and njoy the fun of unlimited apps..without bothering about the internal memory.
