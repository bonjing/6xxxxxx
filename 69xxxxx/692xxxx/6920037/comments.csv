Question:
I had previously downloaded the Cut version, which ran for a total of 88:01 minutes (including the credits and stuff)...The one I bought from this site runs only 87 minutes? I thought the fully uncut ran for 90 minutes?

Answer:
The key difference here is the frame-rate at which the video is displayed. The UK Blu-ray runs at 24 frames per second so has a slightly longer run time although the film itself is actually shorter. The online version runs at 25 frames per second so the film plays slightly faster (for the record the film was shot at 25 frames a second, but this does not transfer to DVD/Blu-ray as well as 24).
