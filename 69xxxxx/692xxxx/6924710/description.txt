Toxicologic pathology integrates toxicology and the disciplines within it (such as biochemistry, pharmacodynamics and risk assessment) to pathology and its related disciplines (such as physiology, microbiology, immunology, and molecular biology).
Fundamentals of Toxicologic Pathology 2e updates the information presented in the first edition, including five entirely new chapters addressing basic concepts in toxicologic pathology, along with color photomicrographs that show examples of specific toxicant-induced diseases in animals. The current edition also includes comparative information that will prove a valuable resource to practicioners, including diagnostic pathologistis and toxicologists.

NOW FEATURING:

. 25% brand new information, fully revised throughout

. New chapters: Veterinary Diagnostic Toxicologic Pathology; Clinical Pathology; Nomenclature: Terminology for Morphologic Alterations; Techniques in Toxicologic Pathology

. New color photomicrographs detailing specific toxicant-induced diseases in animals

. Mechanistic information integrated from both toxicology and pathology discussing basic mechanisms of toxic injury and morphologic expression at the subcellular, cellular, and tissue levels
