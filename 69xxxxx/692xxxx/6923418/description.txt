  Shankar Narayana is an honest politician     
  who meets with a near-fatal accident.        
  Some years later, Shankar's son Ajay has     
  grown up to become a police officer.         
  Ajay's mission to bring down the trade of    
  drugs and weapons, takes him to Istanbul.    
  It's while there that he first meets         
  fashion student Prashanthi. Ajay is          
  smitten with her. Back in India, Shankar     
  finally awakes from a long coma. Ajay        
  creates an elaborate home-life charade       
  to shield his still-fragile father from      
  any stress or shock. While out on the        
  streets, it is time to hunt down Don Nayak   
  and his criminal associates who tried to     
  kill his father all those years ago.
