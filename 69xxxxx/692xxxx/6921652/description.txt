Produced by Grammy-nominated Howard Bilerman (Arcade Fire), If I Don't Come Home You'll Know I'm Gone is the second album from the Canadian collective fronted by Gavin Gardner, the Wooden Sky. Previously known as Friday Morning's Regret, their 2009 follow-up to When Lost at Sea continues to develop their experimental alt-country/folk-rock sound and includes the single "Oh My God (It Still Means a Lot to Me)".
