                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Living with the Amish follows a group of British teenagers as they live with  
 the private Amish community who open their doors for the first time. The      
 teenagers have to leave their mobile phones, Facebook accounts and partying   
 behind, as they travel to Ohio and Pennsylvania to learn about hard work and  
 living the simple life.                                                       
                                 Enjoy!
