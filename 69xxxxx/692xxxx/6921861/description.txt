Season 17 Episode 7


This episode was a mission to promote Britain to the Indian public. The opening sequence of the show shows the Top Gear team in Downing Street opening a letter by David Cameron refusing their request to go to India on an official trade mission (he actually appears for a one-line cameo - \"Stay away from India!\"). Despite this, they still go to India.
