In this fine family film 'En Som Hodder', we share the sorrows of Hodder Emanuel Jacobsen: he barely remembers his late mother, and when she comes to him in his dreams, he doesnâ€™t even know her and thinks she is a fairy. All his classmates treat him with detached contempt, eventually trying to lure him into suicide. His father works nights, and the man can scarcely relate to his son at all, try though he might.
Hodder doesnâ€™t quite realize that he misses his mother terribly and that he is desperately, desperately lonely â€“ though we can see this all too clearly.
Fortunately for him, his irrepressibly charming innocence enables some people with problems to see that Hodder can be a true friend, in a land and time where true friends are rare and valuable.
A wonderful film, excellent cinematography, music, and direction. Hodder is so sweet and full of life you just want to hold him and â€˜make it all betterâ€™, but he does that for himself. Frederik Christian Johansen is nearly perfect in his performance as â€˜Hodderâ€™.
