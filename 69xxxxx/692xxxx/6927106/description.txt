The Legacy of Islamic Antisemitism: From Sacred Texts to Solemn History

"Andrew Bostom has performed a rare and welcome service with the publication of The Legacy of Islamic Antisemitism. He has patiently assembled an enormous body of primary sources that document the brutal Jew-hatred that has characterized much of Islamic culture from its earliest days. The book's importance goes far beyond the historical record, for it shows convincingly that the fledgling movement--and widespread Western hopes--to reform Islam, and imbue it with anything approaching true toleration, faces enormous obstacles."--Dr. Michael Ledeen, author of Universal Fascism (1972), and most recently, The Iranian Time Bomb (2007)

"Andrew Bostom's book is timely and instructive in educating all who wish to learn the roots of Islamic Antisemitism. It is one of the most important books of our time and should be read by all."--Ayaan Hirsi Ali, author of Infidel (2007), and The Caged Virgin (2006)
