Authoritative and reliable, this superb reference contains more than 3,000 alphabetically arranged entries, providing clear jargon-free definitions of even the most technical mathematical terms. Ranging widely from Achilles paradox to zero matrix, the dictionary uses graphs, diagrams, and charts to render definitions as comprehensible as possible, offering an ideal introduction to subjects such linear algebra, optimization, nonlinear equations, and differential equations. The Dictionary covers both pure and applied mathematics as well as statistics, and there are entries on major mathematicians and on mathematics of more general interest, such as fractals, game theory, and chaos. The volume also contains valuable appendices of useful and relevant extra information, including lists of Nobel Prize winners and Fields medalists and lists of formulae. Fully revised and updated, this edition features many entry-level web links, which are accessible and continually updated via the Dictionary of Mathematics companion website, making the book indispensable for students and teachers of mathematics and for anyone encountering mathematics in the workplace.
