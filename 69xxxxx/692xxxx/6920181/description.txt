When you glance at West Texan artists that have made a significant impression on music, the likes of Buddy Holly and Waylon Jennings are almost synonymous. Therefore, when you find an artist that is relevant and capable of joining that Ã©lite company, you canâ€™t help but take notice.

Consider this as your formal introduction to ESTELLINE. 

Initially a lone endeavor by their charismatic lead singer Kenny Paul Harris, it has since evolved into a quartet and resulted in ESTELLINE, a self-titled debut full-length that is distinctive and captivating.

For Harris, this album is more than just a collection of songs â€“ they are a form of self-preservation and existence. â€œI write my songs with the intent of letting people into my mind, my creativity, and my craftâ€, says Harris with his uncanny Southern drawl. â€œI voice things that provoke thought and question, yet have the words to bring peace among the ignorance of the world as well as for myselfâ€ 

Harrisâ€™s approach resonates throughout the record. From the cinematic â€œHopefully, Maybeâ€ to the delicate nature of â€œIâ€™m Not Leavingâ€, ESTELLINEâ€™S sense of charm and nostalgia is evident in spite of their relative young age. 

Even more apparent is their potential of becoming one of Texasâ€™s finest â€“ ESTELLINE is rewriting the soundscapes of West Texas. 

ESTELLINE is scheduled for a summer release and a regional tour to support the release will be announced shortly.
