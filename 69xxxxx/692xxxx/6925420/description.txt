RELEASE NOTES

With the new Ashampoo Snap 4 you can capture just everything on
your screen!

Ashampoo Snap 4 enables you to create high-quality screenshots,
videos and demos of your screen content. Edit, save and share
your excellent results with others. This new version offers lots
of innovative features and improvements, especially in the areas
of video capture and editing tools.

The new video mode:

Use the video mode to create videos and demos tailored to your
needs. Capture film sequences or computer games (in a window) and
save them as high-quality video files. You can also produce demos
like video tutorials for software or presentations of websites.
Videos and demos can be saved in different formats using various
codecs. New fantastic features, like cursor and zoom effects, are
available during video capture. Furthermore a recording can be
paused and resumed anytime, in order to, for example, switch
between applications or prepare the screen content. Of course,
you are not limited to the main screen anymore, because Ashampoo
Snap 4 also supports multi-monitor environments.

Even more editing tools for your screenshots:

Create perfect-looking screenshots of your entire screen content
or specially selected parts. After making a screenshot, an
intuitive editor opens automatically and provides you with
extensive editing tools, with which you can make your shots even
more individual and original. Enhance your screenshots with, for
example informative hints, arrows, texts, graphics, shapes,
stamps and lots more, in order to convey facts or other topics in
your shots easier and more illustrative.

Whether for work, for school or in your spare time - create
screenshots and videos in no time and fill your colleagues,
classmates or friends with enthusiasm for your amazing results.

New and improved features at a glance:

Improved editing of objects
All objects, like texts, arrows, shapes etc., can now be edited
as often as you want. In Ashampoo Snap 4 objects have their own
edit panel at the bottom of the screen.

Higher display quality of objects
The display quality of objects was also improved
(anti-aliasing, transparency and high quality shadow effect).

New features in the editing mode
In Ashampoo Snap 4 the highlight tool is not limited to a
single area anymore. You can now highlight multiple areas.
Create great screenshots by adding stamps or graphics, which
the program provides for you.

Different video capture methods
In the video mode you can choose between two video capture
methods. You can either save your recording on-the-fly or you
can save the recording in the buffer first, and then create a
video file (WMV or AVI).

More video codecs and formats
The new Ashampoo Snap 4 supports even more output formats for
video encoding. The following codecs: Windows Media Video 7, 8,
9, Screen / Advanced (VC1) and all on the system installed
codecs for AVI files (for example Xvid, DivX etc.) are
supported.

New cursor and zoom effects in the video mode
During a video recording you can now use the new cursor and
zoom effects. You can decide whether to show or hide the
cursor. Furthermore you can highlight the cursor, for example
by using a colored circle. Make use of the new zoom effect and
zoom into a particular area while recording.

Improved auto-scrolling screen capture
Capture the entire contents of a text document or web page,
which you would have to scroll down, to a single graphics
image. Ashampoo Snap 4 also offers improved capture of Java
applications. The program automatically scrolls the window and
captures everything, including the part of the document not
visible in the window.

Support of multi-monitor environments
Capture content not only on your main screen, but also on other
screens. Capturing areas that share parts of two monitors are
supported, too.

Send by e-mail
Now you can send your screenshots in a single PDF file by
e-mail.

Import/export of configurations
Import or export the complete configurations of Ashampoo Snap 4
in one INI file.

More cool features:

Quickly available
Ashampoo Snap 4 is always ready to hand as a toolbar at the top
of the screen, which allows access to all functions.

Different screenshot capture modes
Use the different modes to capture different areas in the best
possible way. Capture a window or dialog box, including
non-rectangular shapes. Or select a free region by drawing the
shape you want to capture on the screen with your mouse Â– itÂ’s
like the lasso function in a graphics program. Moreover you can
select a predefined area, by specifying width and height of the
capture rectangle. For scrolling websites just use the
auto-scrolling functions.

Multi-capture
You can perform multiple captures without restarting.

Seamless integration with Windows functions
Ashampoo Snap 4 auto-monitors the Windows built-in print screen
key for quickÂ’nÂ’easy capture. With the print screen key full
screen content capture is possible

Apply effects on-the-fly while capturing
While capturing screenshots, you can add effects, like for
example smooth-graphical drop shadows, capture the cursor,
apply cool shape effects etc.

Add audio comments
Use your microphone to add your own comments and instructions
to videos. Sound settings are configured automatically.

User assistance wizard
In the improved assistant mode, which is activated by default,
Ashampoo Snap 4 shows you step by step where everything is and
explains how to do everything directly in the program.

Automatic filenames
You can configure the format of the automatically generated
filenames. For example, you can include the current date and
time in the filename. The new Ashampoo Snap 4 supports a
multitude of formats.
