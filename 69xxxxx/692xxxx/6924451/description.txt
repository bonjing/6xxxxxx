CleverCache Professional Edition x32 & x64, Build 7.1.2737
Even with the latest hardware, the processing of digital pictures, videos, games and constant server loads can often lead to longer answering times or â€œfrozenâ€ programs. In fact, itâ€™s often not the lack of main memory capacity thatâ€™s at fault, but the file cache management of your Windows operating system. O&O; CleverCache makes sure that the file cache is reset while the computerâ€™s running: something that otherwise usually requires a restart of the computer. O&O; CleverCache will let you continuously maintain maximum levels of performance on your computer â€“ no new start required, and with just a few clicks of your mouse.

O&O; CleverCache prevents those infamous program and application â€œfreezesâ€ where usually only closing the program with the Windows Task Manager can help. Simply install O&O; CleverCache and let it take care of your computer or servers memory management.
