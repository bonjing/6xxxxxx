Riding Great Britain

Travel Documentary hosted by Henry Cole, published by Travel Channel UK broadcasted as part of TC World's Greatest Motorcycle Rides series in 2010 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Henry Cole sets off on a cathartic ride aboard one of the new Norton 961 Cafe Racers from John O'Groats on the north east coast of Scotland for some 1200 miles to Lands' End on the south west tip of the Cornish coast. Great Britain is home to some of the most stunning landscapes to be found anywhere in the world, an array of unbelievable roads, a heady mix of true British eccentrics and a long illustrious history of motorcycle manufacturing. But is Great Britain truly a World's Greatest Motorcycle Ride? Henry sets off to find out if the UK really is up there with the likes of Route 66, The Nullabor Plain in Australia or the Deserts of America. Starting from John O'Groats Henry heads west hugging the entire length of the northern coast of Scotland. He then rides south passing Loch Ness and Loch Lomond across the border to The Yorkshire Dales. From the Dales it's only some eighty miles to the Peak District and one of the most dangerous roads in the UK, The Snake Pass. From The Peaks Henry rides on further south into the picture postcard perfect Cotswolds and then the delights of Dorset and Somerset before heading west into Devon and finally on into Cornwall. Will this ride really be a revelation? Surely one of the greatest rides on the planet can't be in Henry's own backyard? Well it just might!
