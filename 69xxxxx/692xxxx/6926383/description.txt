1989 sophomore album from Wendy James and her Transvision Vamp mates. Produced by Zeus B. Held, the album is a blend of Pop, Glam, Bubblegum and Garage Rock. Wendy James gets all the attention, and her seductive vocals certainly do stand out... but the real hero is songwriter NC Sayer. The opening cut "Baby I Don't Care" rocks with the best of them. "Falling for a Goldmine" and "Bad Valentine" are hauntingly lilting, quite unlike anything else. And the title cut "Velveteen" is a sweeping, mind-blowing rock opera.
Call it "pop" if you must, but listen to it with an open mind.
