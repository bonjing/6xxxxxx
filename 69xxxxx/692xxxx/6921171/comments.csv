And it's a very obvious cutoff, music cut is abrupt, no fade out, no end credits and if the ending is faithful to the book... actually missing dialogue.

Thanks for the up though! I hope there will be a truly complete version of this last episode eventually, and I'm not complaining... I genuinely appreciate all the effort put into this."
