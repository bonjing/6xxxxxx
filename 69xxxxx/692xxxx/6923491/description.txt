NOTES
============
As far as I'm aware, this is the file that appeared (or WOULD have appeared) alongside the other 720p iTunes rips (following the filename format "My.Little.Pony....AC3.5.1.mkv") on the now-defunct PonyArchive.org.  File retrieved from WuploadSearch.com (thanks, Google!) and now preserved in torrent form... FOOOORRRREVERRRRRR!! (hopefully)

It also seems that this file is a straight remux to MKV from the iTunes file, WITHOUT colour correction -- the colours are slightly muted compared to the "official" colour palettes and to other videos that are definitely colour corrected.  (At least Dash's red hair isn't so pixelated, though...)

**MKV files are compatible with media players such as MPlayer, VLC, ALLPlayer, foobar2000 and PowerDVD.  For other compatibility, consult the website of your preferred media player.

PLEASE SEED LIKE CRAZY (upload at least 20% more than what you download... that is, um, if you don't mind...)  I expect to compile a torrent of the first half of season 2, and another for the full season as the episodes come out; until then, I will continue to seed this and the other single-video torrents.

Enjoy your ponies, and don't forget to support the show and its community!  :D
