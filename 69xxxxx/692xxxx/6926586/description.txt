Leverage.S04E16.480p.WEB-DL.x264-mSD [MKV 253MB]

[/b][/color] "Get ready to get even." Meet Nathan Ford, a former insurance investigator who spent his professional career dedicated to the company that he recovered millions in stolen goods for.
This same insurance company would refuse a medical claim for his son that would take the life of the innocent child.
Unemployed and teetering on the edge, Nate is approached about a Robin Hood-like scheme.
He enlists the help of the best thieves and grifters in the business, and with their help, he steals from the rich and gives to the poor to help balance the crooks in high power positions.
He and his team help provide... leverage.
Leverage is produced by Electric Entertainment.
