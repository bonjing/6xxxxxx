Note: This one is a weird app - download it and see if you like it - otherwise, just download for the fun of looking at what developers are doing out there!

3D fileSpace brings you the new possibilities and larger spaces of tomorrow's 3D displays, on your Mac today:

* Instead of having to navigate through folders, rise above them and
  directly see the icons you are looking for!

* Keep on hand the contents of all the Finder folders you often go to, all
  at once, in multiple 3D panes in a single window.

* Get point-and-click access to each of hundreds of items, drag and drop
  and perform Finder-like tasks, all in one place.

Because 3D views show depth and distance as in the real 3D world, the same visual and spatial skills you use to get around town, and to know where things are in the home, now also make it easier to get to your files and applications in the computer.

Easy visual access to your files and applications

* Rise above the labyrinth of folders and see all the icons in the whole
  landscape at once

* Just click to open files and applications, no need to remember names or
  navigate file lists

* No need to remember the exact location of each item, "it's around that
  group in the back" or "near that one there" is enough

* Rearrange files and folders in the landscape as you wish, which at the
  same time makes them more memorable

* Compose multiple Finder folders into a single window, to have fewer
  "places" to keep track of

Unlimited desktop space

* Let your desktop extend into the distance instead of being limited by the
  edges of the screen

* Add new items easily, the desktop just grows to accommodate them

* Existing items stay where they are, new items create their own space in
  front

* No more clutter; no more having to make room for new items; no more
  having to decide what to throw out

* As older items recede in the back you can always go back to them, or
  bring them to the front again

* Clear your desktop by putting desktop items in a drawer, they'll stay
  close at hand without taking over the whole screen

* Keep a miniature view of your desktop items in a corner of the screen,
  if you prefer to always see them

Fast file/folder browser

* See the contents of dozens of folders and their sub-folders at a glance,
  without having to visit each sub-folder

* Enlarge any item by simply pointing at it

* Get full-size Quick Look previews without having to click or press
  keys

* Zoom, pan and tilt with simple gestures

* Expand folders into platforms with one click

* Stacked platforms keep the big picture in view so you can always see
  where you are

* Drop any Finder folder on 3D fileSpace's icon in the Dock to view that folder as a 3D landscape

Use drawers for instant access

* Drawers stand by along the edge of the screen, out of the way

* Use a drawer as a convenient visual launcher for all those applications
  that don't fit in the dock

* Change any window into a drawer

* Open a drawer at any time with just a flick of the finger or mouse

Arrange and customize landscapes

* Drag items and folders to create groups and other visually meaningful
  arrangements

* Make key icons larger so they stand out from afar; shrink icons that you
  don't need to see but don't want to remove

* Resize folders to have them show more or less of their contents

* Make 3D views small and use them as status panels, or make them
  extra large to immerse yourself in the landscape

Perform file management tasks directly in the 3D view

* Drag and drop items to/from the Finder and other applications

* Copy, move, rename, delete items and folders as with the Finder

* Multi-pane windows make copying, moving or rearranging items faster
  and easier

System Requirements: Intel Mac, OS X.6.6 or later
