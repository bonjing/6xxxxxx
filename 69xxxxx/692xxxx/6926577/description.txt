Crash Magazine Issues 01-98 (February 1984 - April 1992)

** Note: This is a rework of a collection previously available. Content
** is essentially the same, but image quality should be improved.

Crash was the UK's best-selling computer magazine, dedicated to the
Sinclair Spectrum. Mainly focussed on gaming, it also carried some
technical content (mostly by the legendary Simon N. Goodwin) and
industry news.

These PDFs are the complied collections of page scans available on
www.worldofspectrum.org . They've been OCR'd to allow text searching and
copying - this should prove very useful for the Sinclair archivist who'd
like to have their own local searchable archive. They look great on most
PDF readers, including the iPad.

The OCR software has done it's best, but has struggled with some of the
more unusual fonts and layouts used (especially in later issues), and by
the relatively low DPI of the source images. Also, paragraph formatting
is a bit random at best; again, this is worse in the later issues.

The file size is a bit larger than the combined size of the original JPG
images; I've done my best to make the PDF's as compact as possible
without losing image quality. Be grateful for cheap storage :)

More OCR'd scans will be periodically available - please check for more information.

Thanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum site
(www.worldofspectrum.org), and all the visitors to RetroPDFs for their
support.

90's style "greets" to anyone formally or currently involved in the
Amiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat
Will, mUb and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD
Grapevine. Nostalgia ain't what it used to be ;)
