Experience a brand new way to play on Wii as Skylanders Spyro's Adventure transports real-world action figures into the game environment before your eyes!

Every copy of Skylanders Spyro's Adventure comes with a set of action figures and a special platform called the Portal of Power. Placing the figures on the surface of the Portal of Power causes them to appear in the game world for you to control â€“ turning your action figures into interaction figures in an instant!

The ability to switch between characters via the Portal of Power adds a new level of interactivity to play, and allows you to tap into the unique attributes of over 30 different Skylanders heroes (sold separately). Just grab the figure of your choice, place them on the Portal of Power and take control of them to tackle the game's challenges. Breathe fire with Spyro, hammer enemies into submission with Stump Smash and slice and dice as Chop Chop. The more Skylanders figures you collect, the more powerful you become!

In the game world of Skylanders Spyro's Adventure, players will enjoy a story-driven quest in which they assume the role of a powerful Portal Master. Using the Skylanders at your disposal, you'll journey across the Radiant Isles in a quest to conquer the maniacal Hektore and his minions. Challenges await at every turn, with varied environments to explore and enemies to conquer.

Along the way, you'll have to strategically tap into the unique skills of your Skylanders heroes based on their element type. Skylanders could fall into one of eight element types, namely; Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Life, Undead, Magic, and Tech. Choosing the right character for the right task will make life easier in battle, grant you access to new areas and help overcome puzzles and obstacles.

As you play, all the experiences your characters have in the game affect the real-world action figures sitting atop your Portal of Power. Each Skylander action figure stores data about everything from the latest special moves they have learned to any increases in skill and strength they make â€“ so even if you take your figure and place it on someone else's Portal of Power, its attributes will remain true to what youâ€™ve achieved in your own copy of the game. Whether you're working together with a friend in cooperative play, or competing against one another in arena battles, you can rest assured the attributes of your Skylanders action figures will be based on your in-game achievements and progress with them in your own copy of the game.

Get into the game in an innovative new way as Skylanders Spyro's Adventure for Wii gives you a new level of power to play with!

|What Is This?|
+-------------+

This torrent contains a Nintendo Wii Game in WBFS format, which is actually just a compressed ISO image. It is important to note that your Wii reads this file directly from a hard drive (there is really no need to convert it). However, this game can easily be converted back to a full-size ISO faster than it takes to extract a ZIP file using either of these programs for Windows or Mac:
 
http://sourceforge.net/p/wiibafu/home/Wii%20Backup%20Fusion/ 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6216909

In order to play this game on your Nintendo Wii, you will need a special chip installed that allows it to play backed-up games, or you will need to perform a soft-mod and install The Homebrew Channel. Here is an excellent source for everything you need to know about soft-modding your Wii and installing The Homebrew Channel:

|Instructions|
+------------+

To get Wii games onto your console after you have bought a chip or performed a soft-mod, you will need to put them on an external hard drive or burn them to a disc. Whenever you burn a Wii ISO image to a disc, always burn at a slower speed (2x or 4x) for best results and use a dual-layer disc if the ISO exceeds 8 GB in size. You can use one of these programs for Windows or Mac:

http://burn-osx.sourceforge.net/Pages/English/home.html

If you own an external hard drive and want to play Wii games directly off of it, use one of the following programs for Windows or Mac to format the hard drive to WBFS and transfer games:

http://sourceforge.net/p/wiibafu/home/Wii%20Backup%20Fusion/ 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6216909 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6216931

To play the Wii games after transferring them to an external hard drive, you will need what is called a USB loader of some sort. It is important to note that some USB Loaders can read games from an NTFS or FAT32 partition (just copy the WBFS file to the main root of the device), but there are limitations to each of these and you will generally have more success formatting to WBFS.

You can use one of these USB loaders to play your games, just follow the instructions located on the site to install it via The Homebrew Channel (basically put any Homebrew program in a folder called "apps" on the root of your SD card and make sure the DOL file is named "boot.dol"):

Every game that I upload is in NTSC-U (North American) format, but many can also be played with PAL (European) or NTSC-J (Japanese & Korean) Wii hardware.

The reason this Wii game might be smaller in size than the original ISO file is the result of super-compression only. I have not taken out anything but empty data, and if converted back it will be a full-sized ISO.

|Wii Emulator for PC|

In order to play this game on your PC, you will need a very fast CPU and a high-performance graphics card. A special tip: Press Control-Shift-Escape to open the Task Manager, and end the process explorer.exe while running the Dolphin Emulator. When finished playing, go back to the Task Manager and press File, New Task and type in explorer.exe and click OK.

Here is the only successful Wii Emulator for PC:
