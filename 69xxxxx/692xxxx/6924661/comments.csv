,x30001wtm,2012-01-25T01:02Z,"Virustotal results are below: 31 out of 43 virus scanners say the keygen is dirty, including McAfee, Micrsoft, and Symantec.  12 say it's clean, including Kaspersky.  If it's so clean, how about you run it and post a couple dozen keys for us?  How about posting ONE?  Which is what these asshole keygen writers should do in the first place.  Give a few result codes for people named Retail Purchase or Student Trial, who simply don't want to run keygens. Writing code that generates text characters based on math functions does not trigger virus scanners.  Embedding some unnecessary bullshit code does.

Please don't take this personal manhide.  I'm not bitching at you.  My beef is with the assholes who expect us to trust them with our bank accounts just because they're keWl WareZ G0dZ.  Fuck them if they can't write keygens that don't trigger virus scanners.

Here are the results from VirusTiotal.
