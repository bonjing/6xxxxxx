         The SAiNTiNK source has was realy good. But has strong videonoise
         and bad aspect ratio.
         We fixed the aspect ratio, removed the noise and do many other
         things with our magic stick.

         Look our great encode, with more sharpen, more details, less
         noise. Maybe we do a 720p recode too. :)


                           QUALITY IS PRIORITY!!!
