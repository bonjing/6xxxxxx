UnHackMe v5.99. Build 395
UnHackMe is specially designed to detect and remove Rootkits.

A rootkit is a program that a hacker uses to mask intrusion and obtain administrator-level access to a computer or computer network. The intruder installs a rootkit on a computer using a user action, by exploiting a known vulnerability or cracking a password. The rootkit installs a backdoor giving the hacker full control of the computer. It hides their files, registry keys, process names, and network connections from your eyes.

Your antivirus can not detect such programs because they use compression and encryption of its files. The sample software is Hacker Defender rootkit.

UnHackMe allows you to detect and remove Rootkits. 

Examples of the viruses that use the rootkit technique
# Morto Worm
# Popureb.E Rootkit
# Zero Access Rootkit
# TDL4 rootkit
# TDL3 rootkit
# Srizbi
# Haxdoor Removal
# HUY32-Rustock.B Removal
# and more
