Ronnie B.'s Swan Song

Back again for one very last extra special Christmas
outing, the Two Ronnies bring you their favourite treats
from their many classic Christmas shows. Look out for
The Milkman's Christmas Message, Christmas Day in the
Yukon and a lavish interpretation of Alice Through the
Looking Glass - Ronnies style. Music comes courtesy of
Katie Melua singing Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.

Messrs Barker and Corbett reunite to delve into the
backstage stories behind some of their classic moments
as they reveal their own personal memories of The Two
Ronnies.

They make each other laugh with their observations while
delighting the studio audience with their trademark news
lines, brand new musical performances, and the best
sketches from almost 100 episodes of their hit sketch
show, originally broadcast between 1971 and 1987.
