s idea that seems plausible. None of the articles about the SOPA legislation discount the notion that SOPA is a ""hot topic issue"" that was raised just before Congress started winter recess. Generally, such topics are used to generate controversy and if you think about it, it kind of masks the fact that they take a month off for Christmas. These ""hot topics"" are identified by their inherent inability to be solved easily, like abortion or gay marriage: lots of ideas with no simple solutions. Often, hot topics dissolve in light of new issues that inevitably arise during a month without lawmaking, they serve only to make it look like Congress is ""hard at work"" while they are actually vacationing.
 We can hope and watch for these new challenges as the ""year-the-Mayan-calendar-ends"" commences."
