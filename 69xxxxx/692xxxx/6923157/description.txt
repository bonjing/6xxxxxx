Beavis and Butt-head is the creation of Mike Judge. It started as a clip on MTV's "Liquid Television" - a show that featured brilliant and unusual animation. Beavis and Butt-head debuted as its own series in March of 1993 on MTV, introducing the world to their own special brand of humor. This is a world where parents are nearly non-existent, grasshoppers are punished by chainsaw, where cockroach-infested nachos are a delicious treat, and two bored young teens can get into a world of trouble.
