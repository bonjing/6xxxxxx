About Peter

 â€œBuried here, with a stake drove through his body, is the wicked murderer, John Proctor, who cut the throats of his wife and child and then poisoned himself, July 6th, 1765.â€ The opening lines of my History of Whitton essay in 1951 show a morbid fascination with crime even at age 15. My first payday as a writer. 
Forced Start
 
I was born at home, a suburban semi in Whitton, Middlesex, in 1936, â€œwith instrumentsâ€, as my mother used to say, and it didnâ€™t mean violins playing. In midwife-speak, I was turned down, a salutary experience for a future writer. 

Earliest significant memory is a wartime one from 1944: being collected from an air-raid shelter at school and told our home had been destroyed by a V1 Flying Bomb. Miraculously my family escaped â€” brothers John and Andrew crawled out of the rubble, having survived under a Morrison table-shelter â€” although our neighbours in the other half of the house were killed. 

After the bombing we were billeted with a farmer and his family in the West Country, an episode that influenced Rough Cider, my book about the memories of an evacuee.
