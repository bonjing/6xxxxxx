The War in Space a.k.a. Wakusei Daisenso - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076902/

Classic Japanese sci-fi flick from Toho Ltd. made in 1977, directed by Jun Fukuda. Hard to find!
Also known as: Battle in Outer Space 2, Uchu Daisenso 2, Planet Wars, etc.

There also was a German release by UFA called "Der grosse Krieg der Planeten" with German audio, which was even released as a 45-minute cutdown version on super-8 film. Not video...real film. :-)
(I wish I could find that German audio...anyone?)

Technical stuff:

This is a proper DVD rip in XviD/MP3 .avi format with (rather nice) English audio. Sorry, no Japanese audio or subtitles included...

Resolution: 720x304
Frame rate: 23.976 fps
Sound: MP3 stereo, 48000 Hz, 128 kbit/sec

Enjoy!!! And seed, dammit ;-)
