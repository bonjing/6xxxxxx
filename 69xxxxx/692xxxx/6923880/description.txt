After a year of quality releases, Dank 'N' Dirty Dubz is celebrating its 1 year anniversary with a massive 18 track compilation focusing on the deeper, darker, and melodic side of bass music. This release showcases a wide variety of bass-heavy sounds by some brand new up and comers as well as some long-time veterans.

Previews from the compilation will be uploaded periodically, so keep an eye on this set for the latest updates! To help promote this release, we will be giving out 7 Free Downloads between now and the day of the release! Please be sure to spread the word about this massive project and support the release when it hits all online stores on December 30th, 2011.

BIG UP TO ALL THE SUPPORTERS!!!
