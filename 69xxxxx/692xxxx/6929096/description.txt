This is a wonderful film for those of us who enjoy unique footplate views of steam engines actually working for the their keep as 4-6-2 \'Clan Line\' does here. The film shows shots of the range of the many Bulleids that are still part of the preserved rail scene but \'Clan Line\' IS the undoubted star - and a credit to the team of volunteers who keep her in track worthy condition.

Watch this if only to see coal being actaully sucked off the fireman\'s shovel into the engine\'s fire grate!! -and the action of the \'drawing\' on the coals in the fire â€“ marvellous.
