This is such a great TTC Video series, I've extracted the audio and converted to mp3 for portable listening. You can find the video here:

For those who would also like some light reading as an introduction to these ideas, I recommend the book "Thich Nhat Hanh: Essential Writings".

Also, lol at my screen name, I played Tribal Wars under it years ago :P

Be well, and have a great New Year!!
