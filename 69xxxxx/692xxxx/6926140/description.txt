Your Spectrum Issues 01-21 (Jan 1984 - Dec 1985)

** This is a rework of a previously-released collection - files are
** slightly larger but with better image quality

Your Spectrum was a hobbyist publication, originally published
bi-monthly in 1984, before quickly turning into a monthly magazine.
Although strongly centred around technical content, it did carry gaming
reviews and features, although with a technical slant. Your Spectrum
changed it's title to Your Sinclair in 1986 and became a more
gaming-oriented magazine, with a decreasing amount of technical content.

These PDFs are the complied collections of page scans available on
www.worldofspectrum.org . They've then been OCR'd to allow text
searching and copying - this should prove very useful for the Sinclair
archivist who'd like to have their own local searchable archive.

The OCR software has done it's best, but has struggled with some of the
more unusual fonts and layouts used (especially in later issues), and by
the relatively low DPI of the source images. Your Spectrum didn't count
the front or inside covers as page numbers, so therefore "page 1" is
usually the contents page - this throws off the page count inside PDF
viewers. If in doubt, add two to the page number :)

More OCR'd scans will be periodically available - please check for more information.

Thanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum site
(www.worldofspectrum.org), and all the visitors to RetroPDFs for their
support.

90's style "greets" to anyone formally or currently involved in the
Amiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat
Will, mUb and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD
Grapevine.
