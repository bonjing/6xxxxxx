BBC Question Time - Aired: Thursday 21st June 2007
--------------------------------------------------

Question Time, the BBC's premier political debate programme chaired by David Dimbleby, was in Aldershot on 21 June.

David Dimbleby was joined by Minister of State for Policing, Security and Community Safety Tony McNulty, shadow higher education spokesman Boris Johnson and veteran politician Baroness Williams.

Also appearing on the panel together for the first time were brothers and fellow journalists, Christopher and Peter Hitchens who have argued about everything from the war in Iraq to the existence of God.

The video was ripped from YouTube then re-encoded into a single avi file.
It's not the greatest quality, but I used the top settings when converting.


Enjoy and Seed!!
