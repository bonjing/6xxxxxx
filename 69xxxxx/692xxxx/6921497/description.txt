n L.A.â€™s pop music scene, the influence of Fleetwood Mac is rarely more than a vocal harmony away. Itâ€™s uncommonly (but not offensively) close on Belle Brigadeâ€™s debut, a collection of sunny pop songs that take their cues from the â€œCalifornia soundâ€ of yesteryear. Fronted by the brother/sister combo Ethan and Barbara Gruska, the group blows through 11 tunes in an economical 39 minutes, evoking everyone from CSNY to Linda Ronstadt along the way. The siblings harmonize the way family members often do, flanking each otherâ€™s melodies during the verses and double-tracking their voices into thick chords during the choruses. With help from a rotating roster of backup musicians -- mostly Barbaraâ€™s cohorts from her days as a touring drummer for Inara George and Jenny Lewis -- the siblings cast a wide net, riding a country-rock groove on â€œMy Goodnessâ€ and resurrecting the breezy charm of Rumours-era Lindsey Buckingham on â€œWhere Not to Look for Freedomâ€ before drifting into the Los Angeles smog with the albumâ€™s hazy closer, â€œFasten You to Me.â€ Like Jenny and Johnny, another SoCal harmony duo, they rarely sing without the other personâ€™s help, and this pastoral pop record sparkles whenever the two lock together in close harmony.
