This year the game in question is Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 3: Defiance, a shooter with a unique storyline set during the same time period as that of the console games.
 
As with the other DS Call Of Duty games it pushes the hardware to its limits with detailed environments and oodles of in-game speech. The limitations of the DS are made more apparent when you start playing however as the AI is fairly atrocious and enemies don\'t react very realistically when shot.
 
Air support areas - where you move around with the D-Pad and tap on the touch screen to tell ground units where to move - are sluggish and limited, but these niggles aside it\'s a half-decent DS shooter with some fun online multiplayer for up to six players.
