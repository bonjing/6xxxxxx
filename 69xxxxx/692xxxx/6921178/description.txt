 All signs point to this being the pilot for a possible new series to air
 later on SyFy. Similar to the UK system where a pilot is comissioned and
 then later ordered to series. We went with labelling this S01E01 because
 it doesn't look to be a movie. If it were a Syfy movie or miniseries
 they'd advertise the shit out of it and air it constantly. This appeared 
 on the schedule just once.
