ARIOUS - for one reason.

One hilarious fucked up reason.

Drugs Inc, for whatever retarded sensationalistic bullshit reason, never directly discuss the fact that HASH = MARIJUANA!!! HAHAHAHA!!! 

It seems like they want to pretend that it's a totally different drug: one that is so much more harsh than good ol ""pot"". 

The little trichombs are what that powder is. They call it ""pollen"", haha geeks. Anyone who's ever handled bud before knows that if you get your fingers sticky enough, you can rub em together to get ""hash"". 

That's it, geniuses. Stop trying to alarm people by pretending it's something else - they could've just combined this episode with the marijuana one if they were being real about it.

Now it's just gone and lost credibility."
