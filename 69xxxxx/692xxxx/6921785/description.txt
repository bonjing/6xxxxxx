Shrimad Valmiki Ramayana - Uttara Kanda [Team Nanban][TPB]



About Valmiki:



"Valmiki" (during Lord Rama's time) is celebrated as the poet harbinger 
in Sanskrit literature. 

He is the author of the epic Ramayana, based on the attribution in the text of 
the epic itself.

He is revered as the Adi Kavi, which means First Poet, for he discovered the first sloka 
i.e. first verse, which set the base and defined the form to Sanskrit poetry.

The Ramayana, originally written by Valmiki, consists of 24,000 verses in seven cantos 
(some say six i.e. excluding the Uttara Ramayana) (Kandas). 

The Ramayana tells the story of a prince, Rama of Ayodhya, whose wife Sita is abducted 
by the demon (Raakshasa) king of Lanka, Ravana. 

The Valmiki Ramayana is dated variously from 500 BC to 100 BC, or about co-eval with 
early versions of the Mahabharata.

As with many traditional epics, it has gone through a long process of interpolations 
and redactions, making it impossible to date accurately.



SHORT DESCRIPTION ON Shrimad Valmiki Ramayana - Uttara Kanda:


The Uttara Kanda is regarded to be a later addition to the original story by Valmiki.

and concerns the final years of Rama, Sita, and Rama's brothers. 

After being crowned king, many years passed pleasantly with Sita. 

However, despite the agni pariksha (fire ordeal) of Sita, 
rumors about her purity are spreading among the populace of Ayodhya.

Rama yields to public opinion and banishes Sita to the forest, 
where sage Valmiki provides shelter in his ashrama (hermitage). 

Here she gives birth to twin boys, Lava and Kusha, 
who became pupils of Valmiki and are brought up in ignorance of their identity.

Valmiki composes the Ramayana and teaches Lava and Kusha to sing it. 

Later, Rama holds a ceremony during Ashwamedha yagna, which the sage Valmiki, 
with Lava and Kusha, attends. 

Lava and Kusha sing the Ramayana in the presence of Rama and his vast audience. 

When Lava and Kusha recite about Sita's exile, Rama becomes grievous, 
and Valmiki produces Sita. 

Sita calls upon the Earth, her mother, to receive her and as the ground opens, 
she vanishes into it.

Rama then learns that Lava and Kusha are his children. 
Later a messenger from the Gods appears and informs Rama that the mission of 
his incarnation was over. 

Rama returns to his celestial abode.
