ACE (Advanced Computer Entertainment) Magazine 
Issues 01-55 (October 1987 - April 1992)

** This is a rework of a previously-released collection - files are
** slightly larger but with better image quality

Advanced Computer Entertainment was a multi-format UK publication,
originally one of Future's launch titles before being sold to EMAP. It
covered all contemporary machines for the era, with the emphasis on the
emerging 16-bit computers and consoles; it's often said that ACE was the
precursor to Future's EDGE magazine. Regular features included game
reviews (with an innovative "Predicted Interest Curve") and industry
news and gossip.

These PDFs are the complied collections of page scans already available.
They've been OCR'd to allow text searching and copying - this should
prove very useful for the retro archivist who'd like to have their own
local searchable archive. They look great on most PDF readers, including
the iPad.

The OCR software has done it's best, but has struggled with some of the
more unusual fonts and layouts used. Also, paragraph formatting is a bit
random at best.

The file size is a bit larger than the combined size of the original JPG
images; I've done my best to make the PDF's as compact as possible
without losing image quality. Be grateful for cheap storage :)

More OCR'd scans will be periodically available - please check

Thanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum site
(wwwworldofspectrumorg), and all the visitors to RetroPDFs
for their support.

90's style "greets" to anyone formally or currently involved in the
Amiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat
Will, mUb and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD
Grapevine. Nostalgia ain't what it used to be ;)
