                           DESCRiPTiON 

 British couple Liz and Michael Callis emigrated a year ago to buy a 14-bedroom 
 guest house in the Swiss Alps, but their hopes of a stress-free retirement have 
 been ruined by a heavy workload. Alex Polizzi outlines her vision for the future 
 of the hotel, including smart uniforms for the staff, a drop in food prices and 
 a transformation for an unused formal dining room - but is unimpressed with the 
 results when she returns a month later.
                                                                
                                 Enjoy!
