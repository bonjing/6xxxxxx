These are some software and ideas I\\\\\\\'ve been developing with the ruby language
These works are partially complete, so I put them here for you to take apart, 
look at, and improve upon

I\\\\\\\'m going to release my work under a C.C. license

For anyone just downloading my stuff to use for themselves and who not wants do further research, this work is given to you under:
 
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/

if you do decide to research ruby and create a significant modification of this work
(defined as such on you own direction or preferably by majority consensus in a team)
then I\\\\\\\'ll agree to waive the \\\\\\\"non-commercial\\\\\\\" clause and give you:
 
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/

Your gonna need a code editor, should use Rubymine for windows or Aptana for mac osx



game.rb-- in this file i try to explore closed-loop feedback systems while infringing
on the authors of x3 reunion. I thought about reverse engineering some aspects of this game in my Game.rb, but i was thinking of replacing some factory names
and make it more of a earthly based model. I don\\\\\\\'t claim the x3 object names under the C.C.

encrypt.rb-- pretty heavy code for a single man to type a project like this in a 
2 month period. not stable, still plenty of room for improvement with development goal notes 

... a some of the other files are just scratch ideas
