 Album Info..: 
 
 Lynyrd Skynyrd's Double Trouble collects some of the band's career highlights into a  value-priced CD, including: "Gimme Three Steps," "You Got That Right," "Comin Home,"  and the title track. "One More Time," "Down South Jukin'," and "Am I Losin'" are some  of the other worthwhile tracks on this brief compilation. Though it's not even a full greatest hits collection, its budget price may interest some casual fans.
