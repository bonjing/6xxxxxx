                           DESCRiPTiON 

 MC Arthur Smith hosts a bespoke evening of dynamic and intelligent comedy, ably 
 assisted by Alex Horne and his five-piece jazz band, The Horne Section. Filmed 
 earlier in 2011 at the BBC's purpose-built venue at the Edinburgh Fringe, 
 Edinburgh Comedy Live showcases a high energy mix of the best emerging and 
 established comics on the circuit, featuring no fewer than three previous 
 Edinburgh Comedy Award winners in Tim Key, Josie Long and David O'Doherty. Plus 
 Nina Conti, American stars Hannibal Buress and The Pyjama Men and Australia's 
 Sam Simmons and Sammy J.
                                 Enjoy!
