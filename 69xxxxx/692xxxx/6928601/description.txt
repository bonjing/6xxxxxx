Micosoft Office 2010 Professional Plus x86 and x64, with SP1

Included 2 different methods for activation, both proved to be succesfully working for me.

You might have to disable your AV temporarily, or make an exception in your AV for the KMService.

If you want to use the Office 2010 Toolkit's EZ-Activator (is provided with the torrent), make sure you have .net framework 4 installed, or it won't work!

Unpack, mount or burn the ISO, run the setup and after install use one of the provided cracks to activate. (mini-KMS activator or Office Toolkit)

I forgot to include an Install.txt file, just copy/paste the instructions posted here.
