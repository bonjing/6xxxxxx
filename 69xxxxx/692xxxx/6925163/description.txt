Synopsis:
=========
Im not a big PDF user.... mainly for viewing e-books/comics/etc... I use
freeware \'PDF-XChange Viewer\' as my default PDF Viewer. It works great but lacks
certain features avaialbe with Acrobat/Premium PDF Software:
i.e. extract, edit, and compile PDFs.

This is where Acrobat becomes handy: i can extract PDFs as single files, 
convert the extracted files into other formats, edit the extracted files,
and compile back into a PDF file. 

Ever download a PDF and it\'s been watermarked with some lame website or 
noob scene group? Ever download an e-Comic book only to realize it\'s not a PDF 
but separate image files? With Acrobat, i can remove the lame watermarks, and 
compile the individual e-Comic image files into a single PDF file for easy 
viewing. 

Im sure Acrobat has many more uses, but like i mentioned earlier.. im not a big 
PDF user.

What\'s Included:
================
This is sort of a \'lite\' version.. 
* Only plugin included is \"View Adobe PDF\".
* Asian Language Support: Japanese, Korean, Chinese (Trad), Chinese (Simp).
* Extended Language Support: Hebrew, Arabic, Thai, Vietnamese
(#) Everything else has been left out/removed: if you\'re a hardcore PDF user,
