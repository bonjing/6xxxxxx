   Christine Penmark seems to have it all: a lovely home, a loving husband                                                                        
   and the most "perfect" daughter in the world. But since childhood,    
    Christine has suffered from the most terrible recurring nightmare. And     
    her "perfect" daughter's accomplishments include lying, theft and     
    possibly much, much worse. Only Christine knows the truth about her     
    daughter and only Christine's father knows the truth about her
