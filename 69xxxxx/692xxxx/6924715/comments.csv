[V],psspss,2012-01-06T02:11Z,"this nightly build.. ive tried many skins and i like the
default of these new builds. where it hi-lites blue the progress
and makes it easier to see on the eyes then the gray knob

so no far skin is good ive tried many have equalizer but does not
include the video filters and i cant figure out how to reedit them

its a shame the default native skins is just built in but was
a real skin then could use it on the alpha builds

The problem with this build 1.3  and with 1.2 re3 beta is they have a new
web interface which doesnt come up in browser for me properly
it have missing icons and graphics which makes it hard to use
like missing play button.. ive  tried ie8 firefox etc

also the remote controls for android and streaming to android wont work with
the new nt serice/web but works fine on 1.1.11 build
alpha

so looks like some coders have much rewritting to do
to make it work with the offical release of 1.2 when its
out

what Ive done to get around the problem is copied a install of 1.1.11
to a new folder and installed the vlc.exe service from there

and install the betas to standard vlc folder and so everything works
with the nt service/web interface and I get to use the new player"
