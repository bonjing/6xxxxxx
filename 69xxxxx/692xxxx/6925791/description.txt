                           =============================





1) The myth of Atlantis was first told by the Greek philosopher Plato in two stories entitled Timaeus and Critias which were written around 355 B.C.

2) Plato describes Atlantis as being larger than Libya and Asia combined, not just a city, but an entire continent.

3) Possible locations for the lost city of Atlantis have been suggested in each of the worldâ€™s four oceans (Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic) as well as in several locations on mainland Europe and in the Mediterranean Sea.

4) Many theories have been put forward to explain how Atlantis was destroyed. These range from volcanic eruptions or Tsunamis, to a meteor strike and even nuclear war.

5) The story of Atlantis has become ingrained within popular cultures around the globe. The "lost city" has been featured in a host of comics, films, TV programs, and songs, and even has its own LEGO building-blocks series.

6) Troy was once thought of as a mythical city until a city believed to be Troy was found by Heinrich Schliemann in the late 1800s.

7) People using Google Earth thought they spotted the remains of Atlantis off the west coast of Africa, but the series of parallel lines are an artifact of something more modern: the data collection process.
