To succeed as a contractor in New York, you have to do a few favors - and in this episode, licensed contractor Stephen Fanuka helps his friends, designers Ed Ku and Etienne Coffinier, as they design and build a room for the 2010 Kips Bay Decorator's Show House. With only two weeks to transform a featureless room into an elegant living space, Fanuka Inc. pulls out all the stops to execute Ed and Etienne's vision and in doing so, impress the world design community. At the same time Stephen pushes his crew harder than ever to get a Central Park West Apartment done in time for the family to move in.
