Neil Young's 1973 Time Fades Away is one of the most remarkable live albums ever recorded. Certainly at the time of release, it was almost unprecedented for an artist to release a live concert recording of previously unreleased material. Long out of print on vinyl, still unavailable on CD in the early 21st century and widely bootlegged, the album is considered to be the "Holy Grail" of all Neil Young albums.
The Time Fades Away tour took place in the aftermath of Crazy Horse guitarist Danny Whitten's death. Whitten had been trying to kick a heroin habit and was fired by Young, who gave him an airline ticket home and fifty dollars. The next day Whitten was dead of an overdose and Young was devastated by the news. As the stress of the tour and grief over Whitten's death sank in, Young's concerts became more and more ragged and raw.
