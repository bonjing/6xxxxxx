OK this is my first attempt at uploading a torrent, so it may blow.  I download films dailly from tpb and convert them in xilisoft video converter to watch on my sony nwz-1060 media player for work commute.  And with nobody uploading torrents for handhelds thought iÂ´d try it.  In xilisoft i litterally just click on the option that says "optimized for ipods". Ive also added english subtitles for this one, plus made them readable

not sure what else to write really.
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1183276/

run time   1hr.37mins.37sec

resolution 320x240

file size  506mb


if im going to start doing this dailly, some feedback could be good.

also ive noted imdb says 2009, im guessing this rip was released in 2010, hence the discrepancy
