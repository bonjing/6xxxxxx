This epsiode comes from North America where a flock of millions of snow geese find out what it is like to be on the number one prey of America's national bird, the bald eagle. In Alaska, bald eagles swoop among some brown bearsthat are fishing for salmon. On the Great Plains, cowbirds dive under the feet of some fighting bison.
