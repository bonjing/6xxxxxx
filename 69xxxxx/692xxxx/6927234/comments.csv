It happens, because this version isn't force close & crash proof. Just restart the app & if it doesn't ask for update then go to the options & update it manually. If it keeps force closing & crashing & you cannot even open it then download the updated version of Blackmart Alpha (it has bug fix: force closing, crashing) from here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6946582/BLACKMART_ALPHA_0.49.93_%5BCheckOutEr%5D 

Enjoy! Have fun! Peace!
