77 Shadow Street â€“ Dean Koontz

Enter the world of the Pendleton: The original owner became a recluse â€“ and was rumored to be more than half mad â€“ after his wife and two children were kidnapped in 1896 and never found. The second owner suffered a worse tragedy in 1935, when his house manager murdered him, his family, and the entire live-in staffâ€¦. Craftsmen and laborers working on renovations disappear or go madâ€¦. For years, the Pendleton is a happy place, until a bad turn comes againâ€¦. Voices in unknown languages are heard in deserted rooms, everywhere and nowhereâ€¦.
Disturbing shadows move along walls but have no sourceâ€¦. Images on security monitors show strange places that exist nowhere in the building or its groundsâ€¦. A young boy talks of an imaginary playmate â€“ who turns out to be terrifyingly realâ€¦. A figure like a man but clearly inhuman is glimpsed in the courtyard gardens at night and in other locales, perhaps a hoaxer of some kind, seemingly oblivious of those who see it â€“ until it suddenly takes an interest in one of themâ€¦.
