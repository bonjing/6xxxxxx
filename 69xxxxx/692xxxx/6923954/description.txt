Roots of Resistance: A Story of the Underground Railroad is a 1989 for-television documentary on the Underground Railroad. It was produced by the Public Broadcasting Service as part of the American Experience series.

The documentary was directed by Oliver Bagwell.

Before the Civil War broke out, and during it as well, the "Underground Railroad" operated as an effective, secret network for African-Americans to escape the bonds of slavery. It will give modern viewers get a sense of what it was actually like to risk life to make a dash for freedom in the darkness. The "passengers" on this railroad placed their faith in guides such as the remarkable Harriet Tubman (a former slave) and with the people whose homes formed the stations along the route. Highlights include daguerreotypes, commentary by historians and interviews with descendants of slaves and slave owners of a plantation in North Carolina. It is misleadingly titled, however, and lacks the exhaustively researched detail that usually marks American Experience documentaries.
