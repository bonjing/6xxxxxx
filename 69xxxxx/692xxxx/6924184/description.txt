Synopsis

Finding true love is easier than ever thanks to a revolutionary bio-technological wrist implant called the TiMER. This innovative device counts down to the exact moment when people will lay eyes on their soul mates. Except that love-starved 30-some Oona's clock has not even started counting down - her destined mate has not gotten himself hooked in just yet. Meantime, all the people around her are literally set on their unshakable paths to true love, from her mom, her younger sister, and even her 13-year-old brother. What is worse is that Oona's falling for a barely twenty-something rocker who is set to meet his true love in only four months.
