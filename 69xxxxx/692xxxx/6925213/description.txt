 Album Info..: 
 
 Busta Rhymes takes his charismatic style of rapping and applies it to a new 
 production style on Genesis, his fourth solo album. This time around the beats seem darker and more synth-oriented, giving it an edge reminiscent of the bass-heavy G-funk sound. "As I Come Back" is a good example, featuring a sustained keyboard note droning on throughout the chorus with Busta rapping in his raspy style. On the other hand, Rhymes can still make a good dance song, like the hypnotic "What It Is," a fractured funk anthem that features robotic female vocals from Kelis and a slow beat consisting of clicks and snaps. Other guest appearances include P. Diddy's turn on the dramatic "Pass the Courvoisier," Mary J. Blidge on "There's Only One," and the occasional appearances by the Flipmode Squad, as well as production work from Pete Rock and Dr. Dre, among others. The only questionable track is a remake of Public Enemy's classic "Shut 'Em Down" that may leave some fans cold due to its different feel and message. But outside of the one track, this is another solid release from a consistent hip hop artist who can still make relevant, interesting albums long after his days with the Leaders of the New School.
