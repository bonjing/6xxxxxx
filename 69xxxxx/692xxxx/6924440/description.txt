TweakRAM v7.1 Build 05.31
TweakRAM is designed to clean your PC memory. It can Optimize RAM to make your computer run faster and crash less often. and Increase your system performance by cleaning the content of your RAM. and lets you know the CPU information, memory usage, processes, and applications running on your computer.

This tool optimizes your RAM in adjustable, systematic periods and removes from RAM already closed programs which still occupy memory, thus making more free memory available to your system. While working with Windows XP (i have 512MB of RAM) i used to have only 100MB of free RAM before launch of this program and over 300MB after it. Yet again when some people may cry and write that it does nothing, Iâ€™m using it one or two times per day!â€œ- wrote WinFuture.de about TweakRAM.

TweakRAMâ€™s main feature is memory defragmentation (it solves the problem of scattered programâ€™s code, so that your CPU doesnâ€™t have to waste time on code lookup). Many programs, including Windows, accumulate huge amount of libraries, but not all of them are necessary. TweakRAM finds such blocks and unloads them to swap. When some of this data becomes necessary it is loaded back to RAM again. Sometimes it happens that when program exits not the whole memory it allocated is released. Thus the program is not running any more, but some memory canâ€™t be used by other programs. TweakRAM finds such memory leaks and flushes them to swap file, thus increasing size of free RAM.

The program shows a detailed information about total size of physical RAM, free memory and the percentage of its usage by the system. The same information is given about swap file and the business of the CPU.

Since version 2.0 TweakRAM is supplied with its Application Startup Wizard which will help you configure optimal launch parameters of your applications. Now TweakRAM will automatically free needed size of RAM before/after program's launch.
