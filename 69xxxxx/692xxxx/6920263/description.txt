Here's the Ghoulies Soundtrack in 320kbps MP3 format.  I would have uploaded this

torrent in FLAC or WAV but my computer doesn't currently have a functional optical 

drive.  I ripped these files off the original soundtrack CD using a PS3 and then 

transferred the files to my computer via USB flash drive.  Richard Band composed this

music for the film "Ghoulies", directed by Luca Bercovici, which was very successful 

in its day, grossing over $35,000,000 on a $1,000,000 budget.  The soundtrack was 

released by Intrada records along with Band's score for the film "Re-Animator."  This 

limited release is limited to only 1000 copies so it is definitely a rare item.

Richard Band's score for this film is quite good and it has been beautifully 

preserved.  The soundtrack is mixed in stereo with great separation and the fidelity

is fantastic.  These tracks, as far as I know, are the only ones specifically 

composed for the film.  The rest of the music heard in "Ghoulies" is borrowed from

some of Band's other soundtracks, "Parasite" and "The Alchemist."  There were also

a couple of tracks by an artist named Fela Johnson used in "Ghoulies" during the

party scene.  I hope you enjoy this music as much as I do.
