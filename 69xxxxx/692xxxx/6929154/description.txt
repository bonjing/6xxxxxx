Format:Mp3@320cbr


Invited by Love\'s Arthur Lee to contribute to his band\'s album, Hendrix returned to Olympic Studios, the recording facility where he had recorded Are You Experienced and Axis: Bold As Love. Hendrix and percussionist Remi Kabaka joined Love in recording \"The Everlasting First\", which came out in December of 1970 as part of Love\'s album False Start. The three musicians recorded sixteen takes of before a basic track met approval. Two clean, complete takes of Hendrix\'s own \"Ezy Rider\" followed next. Hendrix then took part in an extended instrumental jam session before departing.
