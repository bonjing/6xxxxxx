,Feenixx,2012-05-23T02:14Z,"Well, after running it through MKVTools (which, under the PS3 preset, only converted the audio), Batman now plays almost perfectly smooth in VLC, but the audio seems like its out of sync by a frame or two. If it were audio drift, I'd say it was probably caused by MKVTools, but it seems consistently out of sync throughout. It might still be from MKVTools, but I've never seen it cause any sync problem besides audio drift. 

And it still only plays the audio on the PS3, with a blank screen. I'll try converting it, but if it takes significantly longer than 5 hours, I'm just gonna have to abandon YIFY downloads, as you seem to use a compression/conversion method that doesn't agree with my computer or PS3. "
st getting a bad file. Has anybody else had issues with this? Any suggestions on fixes?

Right now, I'm running it through MKVTools with the PS3 present, but according to MKVTools, the video is fine. It's just converting audio. 

If that doesn't work, I might try ditching the PS3 preset and force converting both audio and video (did that once to fix a sync issue that was only happening during PS3 playback on a movie). I don't know though, cause I already have this on DVD and I'm not sure the incredibly length conversion times are worth a very slight sharper picture. 

Anyway, any suggestions are welcome, and if anything changes in playback I'll report back for the sake of any other PS3 users out there. "
