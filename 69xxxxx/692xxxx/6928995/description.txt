Heartland S01E01: Coming Home 

In the series opener, Amy grieves for her mother and tries to help an abused horse named Spartan.

There is a season 1 torrent on thepiratebay.org, but the files have a variety of problems: bad aspect ratios, missing sections, grainy video etc. It is great that there was anything at all, but it is nice to have something a bit better.
