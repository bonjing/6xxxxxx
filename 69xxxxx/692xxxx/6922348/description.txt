About Valmiki:



"Valmiki" (during Lord Rama's time) is celebrated as the poet harbinger 
in Sanskrit literature. 

He is the author of the epic Ramayana, based on the attribution in the text of 
the epic itself.

He is revered as the Adi Kavi, which means First Poet, for he discovered the first sloka 
i.e. first verse, which set the base and defined the form to Sanskrit poetry.

The Ramayana, originally written by Valmiki, consists of 24,000 verses in seven cantos 
(some say six i.e. excluding the Uttara Ramayana) (Kandas). 

The Ramayana tells the story of a prince, Rama of Ayodhya, whose wife Sita is abducted 
by the demon (Raakshasa) king of Lanka, Ravana. 

The Valmiki Ramayana is dated variously from 500 BC to 100 BC, or about co-eval with 
early versions of the Mahabharata.

As with many traditional epics, it has gone through a long process of interpolations 
and redactions, making it impossible to date accurately.




SHORT DESCRIPTION ON "Shrimad Valmiki Ramayana":



The Ramayana is an ancient Sanskrit epic. 

It is ascribed to the Hindu sage Valmiki and forms an important part of the Hindu canon, 
considered to be "itihaasa".

The Ramayana is one of the two great epics of India and Nepal, 
the other being the Mahabharata.

It depicts the duties of relationships, portraying ideal characters like the ideal father, 
ideal servant, the ideal brother, the ideal wife and the ideal king.

The name Ramayana is a tatpurusha compound of Rama and ayana ("going, advancing"),
 translating to "Rama's Journey". 

The Ramayana consists of 24,000 verses in seven books (Kandas) and 500 cantos (sargas),
 and tells the story of Rama (an avatar of the Hindu preserver-God Vishnu), 
whose wife Sita is abducted by the demon king of Lanka, Ravana. 

Thematically, the Ramayana explores human values and the concept of dharma.

Verses in the Ramayana are written in a 32-syllable meter called anustubh. 

The Ramayana was an important influence on later Sanskrit poetry and Indian life 
and culture. 

Like the Mahabharata, the Ramayana is not just a story: it presents the teachings of 
ancient Hindu sages in narrative allegory, interspersing philosophical 
and devotional elements. 

The characters Rama, Sita, Lakshmana, Bharata, Hanuman and Ravana are all fundamental 
to the cultural consciousness of India and Nepal.

There are other versions of the Ramayana, notably Kambaramayana in Tamil, 
the Buddhist (Dasaratha Jataka No. 461) and Jain in India, and also Indonesian, 
Philippine, Thai, Lao, Burmese and Malay versions of the tale.
