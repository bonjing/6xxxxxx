Intro:

Around the year 2000, fueled by the dot-com boom, people suddenly seemed to realize
the potential of the Web as a useful medium to find information; the number of visitors using it
grew rapidly. Organizations started to think about fundamental questions such as â€œWhat is the
purpose of having a website?â€ and considered how to build relevant content for their online presence.
With that, user experience improved. Then, when widespread broadband adoption began,
those organizations wanted to attract the huge audience that was now online, hence the reason
for the rapid growth in search-engine marketing that followed.

Now, with businesses accepting the growing importance of their online presence, they are
prepared to invest. But how much money and resources should an organization put into this? For
example, should the site cater to ten languages, accept five currencies, and run in four browser
types from visitors with six different operating systems, including mobile? How should the site
be marketed, which channels are most effective, and can we predict the return on investment for
the next campaign?

Answering such questions requires data and hence a measurement tool. Put simply, this is
what web analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, allow you to doâ€”study the online experience, in order to improve it.

But what can be measured, how accurate is this, and how can a business be benchmarked?
In other words, how do you measure success? Using best-practice principles I have gained as a
professional practitioner, this book uses real-world examples that clearly demonstrate how to
manage Google Analytics. These include not only installation and configuration guides but also
how to turn data into information that enables you to understand your website visitorâ€™s experience.
With this understanding, you can then build business action items to drive improvements in visitor acquisition (both online and offline), conversion rates, repeat visit rates, customer retention, and ultimately your bottom line.
