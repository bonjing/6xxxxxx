If you just put all the files in one folder, do not RAR the folder, and upload it as one torrent,  it will be easier to seed and easier for everyone to download just what they want if they are not interested in the whole season. Especially since they all were uploaded at about the same time. JMHO. Thanks for all the work and keep posting."
