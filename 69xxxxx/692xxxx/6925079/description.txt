Icon Collection Pack 2012 [by InterlinkKnight] for Windows (ICO), no PNG files

All kinds of icon images (computers, laptops, phones, printers, brands, recycle bins, cars, sports, flashdrives, etc.) for windows (ICO), no PNG files.

What is new compared to the previews version? 1899 new icons (most of them HD), dozens of icons re-named for corrections, and also a few repeated icons have been deleted.

Every year I upload a new version with more icons and corrections so you can report any mistake to make the next version better.


If you like it, please comment and seed. I always enjoy reading all the comments.

Enjoy.
