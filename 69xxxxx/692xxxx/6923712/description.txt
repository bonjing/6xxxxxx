******************************************************************************

A distinguished military history scholar, Boyne is the former director of the National Air and Space Museum, and Air Warfare complements Ground Warfare [RBB N 15 02] and the earlier Naval Warfare [RBB S 15 02]. It covers its subject from the beginning of World War I to the present. Coverage is international in scope, and, according to the introduction, the intended audience is scholars and general readers.

A-Z entries are accompanied with an introduction; an alphabetical list of entries; a list of contributors; a list of abbreviations, terms, and acronyms; a select bibliography; and an index. Each signed entry is one-quarter to several pages in length and concludes with a short bibliography and, in most cases, cross-references. Scope encompasses biographies, battles, wars, raids, and weapons. The more than 900 entries are heavy on particular kinds of aircraft (Bell AH-1 Cobra, Grumman F4F Wildcat). There are also entries for treatment of air warfare in the arts and for the roles played by women.

The set is enhanced by appropriately placed black-and-white maps, illustrations, and photographs. Information is fairly current, with treatment of Enduring Freedom, the U.S.'s post-9/11 bombing campaign in Afghanistan. Interestingly, there is an entry for Scott O'Grady but none for the air war in the former Yugoslavia.

Other military reference tools, whether more general, such as The Oxford Companion to Military History [RBB Ja 1 & 15 02], or more specific, such as Encyclopedia of the Korean War [ABC-CLIO, 2000], may treat some of the same topics but do not offer the same perspective. This unique survey of aerial combat would be a useful addition to reference collections in academic, public, and high-school libraries. RBB
