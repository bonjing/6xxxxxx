Have I Got News For You is a half hour BBC programme that takes a satirical look at the weeks news. Regular Team Captains are Ian Hislop and Paul Merton, with Angus Deayton as host. Since Angus Deayton got fired the programme has had alternating hosts, which proved to be just as successful by raising viewing figures by a million.
