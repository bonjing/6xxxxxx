ImpOSCar2 is  the successor  to our  multi-award winning  impOSCar software 
   synthesizer. If you're not familiar with the impOSCar then you're in for  a 
   real treat.  However, if  you fell  in love  with it  first time around, be 
   prepared to fall in love all over again.  
             
   Thatâ€™s because, while  the original impOSCar  was a component  emulation of 
   the rare and classic OSCar synthesizer with a few added bells and whistles, 
   such  as  polyphony and  on-board  effects, impOSCar2  soars  to new  sonic 
   heights via  steroid injections  of innovative  features and  enhancements, 
   each  designed  around  the  wishes  of  those  musicians,  programmers and 
   producers who loved the original. 
             
   Since the original impOSCar release we've carefully compiled user  feedback 
   and over the  course of eighteen  months, in another  true labour of  love, 
   we've incorporated the best of these within impOSCar2 creating a synth that 
   positively oozes more character, more playability, more expression and more 
   detailed sound sculpting opportunities than could have been imagined a  few 
   years ago.
