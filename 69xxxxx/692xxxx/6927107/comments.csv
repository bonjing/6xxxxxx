I use Requiem to remove the DRM of iTunes HD purchases and it takes justa few seconds since all it does is remove the DRM... no conversions. So you get a perfect file, in perfect HD all the time.

If you have bought the show, i can show you how to remove the DRM if you agree to post the real, perfect files in HD."
