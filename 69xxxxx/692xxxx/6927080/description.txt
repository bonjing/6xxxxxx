Plot: Alec, a courageous but impetuous knight, returns to his home village having been summoned by his older brother to see their dying father. Their reunion is short-lived as a terrified traveler wanders into the village saying that a monstrous winged creature attacked him. The onlookers scoff in disbelief but at once The Jabberwock descends upon them with the body of a dragon, the head of a gruesome insect and deadly claws. Alec and his brother draws their swords and charges the beast, but to little effect. At dawn the next day, the men of the village arm themselves and go off in search of the terrible scourge. While his brother crafts a new type of weapon, the prophecied Vorpal Sword, Alec steals one of the Jabberwockâ€™s eggs, evidence that this monster wonâ€™t be the only one of its kind for long. Now the brothers must stand together, wield the Vorpal sword and fight to save their home and loved ones
