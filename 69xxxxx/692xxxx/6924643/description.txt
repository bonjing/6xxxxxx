ELECTRICAL WIRING COMMERCIAL, 14E has been extensively revised for the 2011 National Electrical Code. Full-color drawings and product photographs illustrate difficult concepts of the Code to increase the reader's understanding of the application in the wiring process. There is an emphasis on "going green" with electrical design and installation. To provide further practice, updated back of the book blueprints include plans that incorporate handicapped accessibility in commercial structures. For planning a commercial space there are panel board worksheets, load calculation forms, and panel board schedules provided for each of five tenant spaces plus the owner's space. Expanded coverage on Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) demonstrates an emphasis on safety throughout.
