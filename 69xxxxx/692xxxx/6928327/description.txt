Carolina Blues (1937-1947)

Containing the complete recorded works of Piedmont guitarists Floyd Council and brothers Richard and Welly Trice, Carolina Blues features gentle melodic blues pieces that clearly show the pervasive influence of Blind Boy Fuller in the region. Council's major claim to fame is that his first name was taken by Syd Barrett and combined with the first name of another bluesman, Pink Anderson, to make the moniker Pink Floyd, although the British group has never had much, if anything, in common with East Coast blues. Richard and Welly Trice aren't a performing duo, and their selections feature each of them playing separately, with Welly emerging as the more interesting of the two. The real treat here may well be the eight tracks by Eddie Kelly's Washboard Band, a jug band-like ensemble featuring harmonica, kazoo, acoustic guitar, and washboard. The sheer messy joy in the group's playing makes the band a complete delight. ~ Steve Leggett, All Music Guide
