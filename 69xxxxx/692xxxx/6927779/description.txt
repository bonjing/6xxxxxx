[/b][/color] Long before banks, ATMS and check-cashing services, there were pawn shops.
Pawning was the leading form of consumer credit in the United States until the 1950s, and pawn shops are still helping everyday people make ends meet.
PAWN STARS takes you inside the colorful world of the pawn business.
At the Gold   Silver Pawn Shop on the outskirts of Las Vegas, three generations of the Harrison family--grandfather Richard, son Rick and grandson Corey--jointly run the family business, and there s clashing and camaraderie every step of the way.
The three men use their sharp eyes and skills to assess the value of items from the commonplace to the truly historic, including a 16th-century samurai sword, a Super Bowl ring, a Picasso painting and a 17th-century stay of execution.
It s up to them to determine what s real and what s fake, as they reveal the often surprising answer to the questions on everyone s mind,  What s the story behind it ? and  What s it worth?
