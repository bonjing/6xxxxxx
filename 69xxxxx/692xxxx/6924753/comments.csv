@ DutchLikeMe - You can watch these on xbox by streaming them through TVersity. When adding the file/ICarly folder to TVersity, click advanced, and set 'transcode' for the file to always, and it will then transcode it on the fly.

 I think you are supposed to be able to do the same thing with vuze now, but it seems a bit hit or miss for me, and I don't think it can do it on the fly. TVersity works every time."
