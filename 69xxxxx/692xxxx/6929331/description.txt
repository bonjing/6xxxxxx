Fully revised for current practices and medication, this MEDICAL DOSAGE CALCULATIONS: A DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS APPROACH, 10/e remains the fieldâ€™s most complete, user-friendly and accessible drug calculation text and workbook. Using the dimensional analysis format it pioneered, students begin with simple arithmetic, progressing to the most complex drug calculations. As they develop mathematical skills for accurate dosage calculations, they also gain a thorough professional understanding of safe drug administration. Compared with competitors, our text contains deeper, more realistic problems, incorporating actual dosages and requiring real critical thinking. Coverage includes titrations, IV push, VCC, and other complex calculations. Updates include: revised safety recommendations and insulin coverage; new equipment and labeling photos; and 0.5 mL and needleless syringes. Pedagogical aids include case studies, self-tests, and a website for student resources.
