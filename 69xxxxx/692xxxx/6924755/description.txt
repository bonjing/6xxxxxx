HISTORICAL GEOLOGY, Sixth Edition, presents a balanced overview of the geological and biological history of Earth as a continuum of interrelated events that reflect the underlying principles and processes that have shaped our planet. Students are taught the basic geologic principles as well as how scientists apply these principles to unravel Earth's history.
