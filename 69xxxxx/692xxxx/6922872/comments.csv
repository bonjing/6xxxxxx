How to spot an (paid?) Anti-Pirate Bay Troll:

1) Claims everything is a virus and with very creative descriptions of it's effects.  So creative, in fact, that they completely throw reality out the window and claim viruses can do stuff that only happens in movies.  Like putting taunting pop-up messages on your screen to announce that you've been infected.  Real viruses haven't worked that way since the 1980s, if ever.  Real viruses don't like to announce their presence, after all.  But if all someone knows about computers is what they've see on TV, well then that's the kind of poetry you'll get from them when they go into detail of what they image a virus infection to be like.

2) ""I registered just to warn you all""  Translation: I am a bot program who registers just to access comments & spread lies.  Said account will go around & poop on as many pages as possible before getting deleted & banned.  I will then immediately re-register under a different name.  Wash, rinse, repeat.

3) You will often notice random gibberish mixed into to their comments, such as ""Ã¢â€Å’Ã¢Ë†Â©Ã¢â€Â(Ã¢â€”Â£_Ã¢â€”Â¢)Ã¢â€Å’Ã¢Ë†Â©Ã¢â€Â""   This is due to either the limitations (read:bugs) of the bot software, or the limitations of the meth-addled wastrels that Big Software hires to do this crap in person.

I hope that this information has been helpful to everyone, and that you'll join me on Liberator sometime."
