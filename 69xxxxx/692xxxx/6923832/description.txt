
  Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner

Cunninghamâ€™s classic introduction to Wicca is about how to live life magically, spiritually, and wholly attuned with nature. It is a book of sense and common sense, not only about magick, but about religion and one of the most critical issues of today: how to achieve the much needed and wholesome relationship with our Earth. Cunningham presents Wicca as it is today: a gentle, Earth-oriented religion dedicated to the Goddess and God. Wicca also includes Scott Cunninghamâ€™s own Book of Shadows and updated appendices of periodicals and occult suppliers.
