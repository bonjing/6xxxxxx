MahaBharata - Retold By C.Rajagopalachari [English][Team Nanban][TPB]


About Veda Vyasa:


Vyasa is a central and revered figure in most Hindu traditions. 

He is also sometimes called Veda Vyasa , 
(the one who classified the Vedas in to four parts) 
or Krishna Dvaipayana (referring to his complexion and birthplace). 

He is the author as well as a character in the Mahabharata and 
considered to be the scribe of both the Vedas, and the supplementary texts such as 
the Puranas. 

A number of Vaishnava traditions regard him as an Avatar of Vishnu.

Vyasa is sometimes conflated by some Vaishnavas with Badarayana, 
the author of the Vedanta Sutras. Vyasa is also considered to be one of the 
seven Chiranjivins (long lived, or immortals), who are still in existence according to 
general Hindu belief.


The festival of Guru Purnima, is dedicated to him, and also known as Vyasa Purnima 
as it is the day, which is believed to be his birthday and also the day he divided 
the Vedas.




SHORT DESCRIPTION ON MahaBharata:



The Mahabharata is one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India, 
the other being the Ramayana. 

The epic is part of itihasa.

Besides its epic narrative of the Kurukshetra War and the fates of the Kauravas and 
the Pandavas, the Mahabharata contains much philosophical and devotional material, 
such as a discussion of the four "goals of life" or purusharthas (12.161). 

The latter are enumerated as dharma (right action), artha (purpose), kama (pleasure), 
and moksha (liberation). 

Among the principal works and stories that are a part of the Mahabharata 
are the Bhagavad Gita, the story of Damayanti, an abbreviated version of the Ramayana, 
and the Rishyasringa, often considered as works in their own right.

Traditionally, the authorship of the Mahabharata is attributed to Vyasa. 

There have been many attempts to unravel its historical growth and compositional layers. 

The oldest preserved parts of the text are not thought to be appreciably older than 
around 400 BCE, though the origins of the story probably fall between the 8th and 
9th centuries BCE.

The text probably reached its final form by the early Gupta period (ca. fourth century CE).

The title may be translated as "the great tale of the Bharata dynasty". 

According to the Mahabharata itself, the tale is extended from a shorter version of 
24,000 verses called simply Bharata.

The mahabharata in its longest version consists of over 100000 shloka or 
over 200000 individual verse lines (each shloka is a couplet ), long prose passages, 
or about 1.8 million words in total, the Mahabharata is roughly ten times the length of 
the Iliad and Odyssey combined, or about four times the length of the Ramayana.

W. J. Johnson has compared the importance of the Mahabharata to world civilization to 
that of the Bible, the works of Shakespeare, the works of Homer, Greek drama, 
and the Quran.
