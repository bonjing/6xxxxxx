Prealgebra, by definition is the transition from arithmetic to algebra. Miller/Oâ€™Neill/Hyde Prealgebra will introduce algebraic concepts early and repeat them as student would work through a Basic College Mathematics (or arithmetic) table of contents. Prealegbra is the ground work thatâ€™s needed for developmental students to take the next step into a traditional algebra course.

According to our market Julie and Mollyâ€™s greatest strength is the ability to conceptualize algebraic concepts. The goal of this textbook will be to help student conceptualize the mathematics and itâ€™s relevancy in everything from their daily errands to the workplace.

Prealgebra can be considered a derivative of Basic College Mathematics. One new chapter introducing the variable and equations is needed. Each subsequent chapter is basic mathematics/arithmetic content with additional sections containing algebra incorporated throughout.
