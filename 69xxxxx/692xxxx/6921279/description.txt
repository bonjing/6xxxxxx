NOTES:

First off thanks too 26k for the files and to whoever cammed this nice looking cam
Right to clear up why not use unknowns line .....well started off doing it and it was missing a 1 or 2 here and there and got
to around 13mins in and there was like a 11-12 sec jump and it carry on this way ...almost 1min missing in total,but when its secs
here and there it ends up being butchered to death....
Now if someone wants to give me full audio untouched then ....there can be a TS,otherwise i guess unknown as the line and could always
sync it to this better video.

Now onto the source ...video was nice but had some camera movement specially in the first 2mins 38sec and also was cammed at an angle.Colours were
nice and so was the brightness and contrast for a cam really.There is a slight pulse to the video aswell but nothing major at all.
Audio for cam is really nice but did have a hiss and the levels needed a tweaking and it was also slightly oos.

Workdone ...shitloads.
Firstly took the audio stripped it and dropped that into adobe and removed the hiss and then changed all the bands in the EQ settings to make it sound
pretty dam good for cam audio.And then finally save and remuxed.
Now the video was 3.5gig and for some reason at the end it repeated itself,so had to find the end and cut the rest off and also remove the trailors ( batman
looked good ) from the start.
Once done it left me with roughly a 2gig file give or take ...hence the size of this file as i didn't want to lose any bitrate.
Now i had to cut the first 2mins 38secs and crop and rotate that differently ....so the AR is slight off for this part,but not badly.Also changed all the brightness,
contrast,colours etc....and saved it.
From there i used a quad filter to level the video up and used the same filter settings as i did for the first 2mins 38secs minus the cropping and then once done
appended both files together.

Now the subs are not homemade but original so now we have the correct subs in the right places

Overall a nice looking and sounding cam ...v 8.5 a 8 based on 10 being best ever.
