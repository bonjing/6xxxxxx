A/V (on VLC): 10/10
On WDTV Live, 50"" plasma, no surround sound with 7.1, 5.1 etc: a/v: 0/10

But, never fear. Download this and download ""FLAWLESS"" 720P version.

Download and install MKV toolnix, put both files into program and disable 720P video, disable 1080P version audio (or put to 2nd audio for future surround sound use!!), and enable 720P audio, under options for 720P audio force audio! Make it the go-to audio that starts. Works great! Looks great, sounds great.

Enjoy!"
