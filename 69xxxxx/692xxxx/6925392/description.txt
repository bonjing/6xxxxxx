Keep your Mac in shape

MainMenu helps you maintain your Mac. Run daily, weekly and monthly maintenance scripts. Fix common disk problems by repairing disk permissions and volumes.

Clean your system

The pro version puts you in full command of your Mac. Free up disk space by cleaning the system cache, font cache and the caches of all users on your system. Free up even more space by emptying the trash of all users.

Reclaim your disk

Are you running out of disk space? With MainMenu you can free up disk space by cleaning the cache and browser data that's piling up on your disk. MainMenu can also find large files eating away at your precious disk space. And if your Desktop is cluttered you can let MainMenu archive it in a single sweep.

Optimize

Bring your Mac up to speed with MainMenu. Rebuild Launch Services to fix common problems when launching applications. Tune searching by rebuilding the Spotlight index. And speed up Apple Mail by rebuilding its mail index.

Fine-tune your Mac

MainMenu lets you dig into the Mac OS X treasure chest to fine-tune your Mac. Change the screenshot output format to PNG, TIFF or even PDF. Remove window shadows when taking screenshots. Disable the Dashboard to save memory. And let Finder show hidden files so you know what's on your system.

Secure erase

When you delete a file its data may not immediately be physically removed from your disk. Use MainMenu to securely and immediately remove files and their contents. MainMenu also offers you to securely erase all the free space on a disk, and so wipe contents from previously deleted files.

Custom tasks

Do you find yourself running the same set of tasks repeatedly? Save time by grouping your favorite tasks so you can run them in a single action. You can also set MainMenu to restart or shutdown your Mac automatically after completing a custom task.
