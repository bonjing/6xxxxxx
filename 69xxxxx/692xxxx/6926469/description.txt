Londonistan

The suicide bombings carried out in London in 2005 by British Muslims revealed an enormous fifth column of Islamist terrorists and their sympathizers. Under the noses of British intelligence, London has become the European hub for the promotion, recruitment and financing of Islamic terror and extremism--so much so that it has been mockingly dubbed Londonistan. In this ground-breaking book Melanie Phillips pieces together the story of how Londonistan developed as a result of the collapse of traditional English identity and accommodation of a particularly virulent form of multiculturalism. Londonistan has become a country within the country and not only threatens Britain but its special relationship with the U.S. as well.

"Londonistan is a courageous exposÃ© of what is happening in Britain as well as a last minute wake up call for the British to act now before it is too late."--Isi Leibler, Israeli Insider

"Londonistan ... is an eloquent warning of the dangers of 'multicultural paralysis' and appeasing what Miss Phillips calls "clerical fascism."--Washington Times
