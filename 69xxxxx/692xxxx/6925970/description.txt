Samurai II: Vengeance v1.01 [Offline Crack]
Requirements: Android 2.0.1
Overview: The long-awaited Samurai II: Vengeance has arrived on all Android devices!



Samurai: Way of the Warrior was featured in Best Games of 2009 by Apple â€“ Samurai II is a true successor, aided by over a year of focused development. Overall production values and vicious action put Samurai II on par with console 3D brawlers. Screenshots donâ€™t do Samurai II justice â€“ the fluid action has to be seen running at 60 frames per second.

But looks alone wonâ€™t carry a game â€“ the developers listened to fan feedback and improved gameplay throughout. With a new virtual d-pad, dynamic camera, environmental puzzles, traps, and vicious new enemies, Samurai II is brand new experience for hack â€˜nâ€™ slash gamers on the go.

Samurai II sends Daisuke on a quest for revenge across the war-scorched countryside. From a seafaring village to a flying fortress to the legendary Isle of the Dead, the samurai will stop at nothing to hunt down his arch-enemy Orochi. Will he get his Vengeance?
