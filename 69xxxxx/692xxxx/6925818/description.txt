0 A.D. (pronounced "zero ey-dee") is a free, open-source, cross-platform real-time strategy (RTS) game of ancient warfare. In 

short, it is a historically-based war/economy game that allows players to relive or rewrite the history of Western civilizations, 

focusing on the years between 500 B.C. and 500 A.D. The project is highly ambitious, involving state-of-the-art 3D graphics, 

detailed artwork, sound, and a flexible and powerful custom-built game engine.

The game has been in development by Wildfire Games (WFG), a group of volunteer, hobbyist game developers, since 2001. The code and 

data are available under the GPL license, and the art, sound and documentation are available under CC-BY-SA. In short, we consider 

0 A.D. an an educational celebration of game development and ancient history.

Top new features in this release:
* Bartering system: Buy and sell resources in exchange for other resources. Resources are traded at exchange rates that vary with 

each deal. For example, to purchase 100 Food, the player may have to spend 100 points of another resource type (Wood, Stone, or 

Ore). By the next deal, however, Food will become 1% more expensive. Over time, the exchange rate automatically gradually resets to 

the default rate.
* Saved game support: Single-player games can be saved and reloaded.
* Multiplayer reconnection support: If you are disconnected when playing (by an unreliable internet connection, or perhaps by the 

game crashing), you no longer have to abandon the match - you can simply connect to the server again, and it will launch you back 

into the match in a few seconds.
* 45Â° Field of View (FOV): The FOV was changed from 20 degrees to 45 degrees. This means the view of the camera was changed from a 

nearly isometric angle to provide a deeper, more immersive look, which is standard in other 3D video games. You can see the 

difference easily by toggling back and forth between these two screenshots: 20Â°, 45Â°.
* AI improvements: The default AI engine is now qBot, kindly contributed by WFG programmer Jonathan Waller, also known as 

quantumstate. qBot is still having trouble learning how to fend off attacks, but it runs a tight ship economically, and it can be 

very sneaky militarily. In fact, qBot has been observed rushing a human opponent just a few minutes into the game.
* An all-new and unique Persian civilization
* Music and Sound: Several new tracks, all composed and directed by Omri Lahav. They feature live percussion, as well as a flute 

segment by a professional musician (Thanks, Marta Mc'cave!).
* New map: Zagros Mountains.
