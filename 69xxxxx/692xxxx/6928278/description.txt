MUDDY WATERS SINGS BIG BILL BROONZY
Released Originally as  Chess LP 1444 (1960)
Format: Mp3@320cbr


In 1960, when Muddy Waters recorded this album as a tribute to Big Bill Broonzy two years after his death, he could be sure of Broonzyâ€™s approval. Â»Oh yeah, Muddy is a real singer of the BluesÂ«, Big Bill, that Mississippi foundation stone, was heard to say early on in Muddy Watersâ€™ career, although the sound of the man 15 years his junior could be likened to new shoots coming out of the gnarled root named the Blues.
Full of confidence after a â€œBest Ofâ€ compilation released on the Chess label in 1959 and his legendary appearance at the Newport Folk Festival, Muddy set down his own Broonzy songs. It goes almost without saying that such successful numbers as â€œI Feel So Goodâ€œ and â€œTell Me Babyâ€œ are overflowing with a â€˜Chicago feelingâ€˜ which gets right under your skin. Pulsating with the metallic heartbeat of the electric guitar and the gyrating licks which James Cotton conjures out of his harmonica, the cover title amalgamates the individual styles of two top-notch Blues musicians to produce a highly emotional mixture. And letâ€™s not forget the band formed around keyboarder Otis Spann, their fellow musician of many yearsâ€™ standing. Just listen carefully to this small but excellent ensemble and you will certainly forget the banal term â€˜rhythm groupâ€˜!
