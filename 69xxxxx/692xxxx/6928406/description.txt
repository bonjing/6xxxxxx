  Stage 1 - Beginning in Argentina and finishing in Peru fifteen days   
  later, the 2012 Dakar Rally will play host to 465 competitors as      
  they race across more than 8000 kilometres of unforgiving terrain.

  Note: Not a great start for SBS, there was peak noise throughout the  
  broadcast, and they dropped the feed at one point. Sorry but this is  
  the best we have!
