Subtitled, Dedicated to Phil Lynott, this CD features two Thin Lizzy tunes plus the Sykes/Lynott joint composition, Please Don't Leave Me and Whitesnake's Still Of The Night. To say that Blue Murder makes these songs truly come alive can only begin to describe the brilliance of their live performance. One of the few bands who truly do sound better on stage than on record.
