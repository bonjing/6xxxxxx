s some jerky picture effect now and then as the converter analyzed the content as good for 720 x 540 whereas it should have been 720 x 480 
also we should have used divx author 1.5 as it does best with quality where it otherwise wouldn't be the same likely. That said, it is usable and it isnt a series that would have lasted forever I would venture to add. I hope its worth the download in any event. thanks for being a sport about this.  Michael"
