As I Die Lying - Scott Nicholson


Product Description
Richard's life is a horror story. And it's all the fault of that evil, soul-hopping spirit that took over his head. Or maybe the other four people in there.

Richard Coldiron journeys through a troubled childhood, where he meets his invisible friend, his other invisible friend...and then some who arenâ€™t so friendly. 

Thereâ€™s Mister Milktoast, the protective punster; Little Hitler, who leers from the shadows; Loverboy, the lusty bastard; and Bookworm, who is thoughtful, introspective, and determined to solve the riddle of Richardâ€™s disintegration into either madness or genius, and of course only makes things worse. They reside in the various rooms of his skull, a place known as the Bone House. And the people outside his head aren't so comforting, either--little Sally, his hapless mother, his cruel dad, and a misfit teen named Virginia who also hears voices.

Richard keeps his cool despite the voices in his head, but heâ€™s about to get a new tenant: the Insider, a malevolent soul-hopping spirit that may or may not be born from Richardâ€™s nightmares and demands a co-writing credit and a little bit of foot-kissing dark worship.

Now Richard doesnâ€™t know which voice to trust. The bookâ€™s been rejected 117 times. The people he loves keep turning up dead. And here comes the woman of his dreams.
