NOTES :

First of all, thank you to Mesquite for originally providing this gem to us.
For this remastered edition, I first rectified the speed which was slightly too fast
and corrected the balance between the channels.
Then I restored the bass and high ends, cleaned some parasite noises in
the middle freqs and boosted Janis vocals and the brass a little.
The whole thing sounds a lot clearer now. VG+ at least, I'd say.

ARTWORK INCLUDED

Enjoy and blow all your blues away...
