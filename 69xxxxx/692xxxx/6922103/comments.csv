@BitchMovies - I don't recognize the kind of PS3 problem you're experiencing, but if you're having issues I suppose I should stay away from it as well. I delete downloads unless I can play them on my PS3. All toprrents are pointless otherwise. 1TB ps3 hdd w/ tv playback ability ~vs~ 240gb laptop hdd w/ 16"" screen...hmmm. you get the idea. I currently have about 400 movies on my ps3 XD"
