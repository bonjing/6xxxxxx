The stakes are high as "Fear Factor" teams must crawl around a car suspended in the air by two helicopters while trying to retrieve a set of flags. In the second stunt, the remaining contestants will enter the "Fear Factor" coffee shop and drink a concoction of insects. In the final stunt, one team member will dangle high above a tower while a second teammate sends him/her crashing down through the structure and then releases him/her to soar 125 feet up through the tower for a chance to win the $50,000 cash prize.
