@ all:

Along with ""The Authority"" this is probably Warren Ellis's best work in ""alternative"" Superhero comics. It's one of the few series that manages to provide contained and satisfying single issues, while at the same time furthering a bigger plot. Beneath Ellis's trademark dry humor, the comic's concepts are deceptively smart. It's maybe not the easy, care free read you might expect, but it's well worth it.

For the sake of completeness, you might also want to search for the ""Planetary/Authority"", ""Planetary/Batman"" and ""Planetary/JLA"" crossovers.

For more of Ellis's work, well, there's really not much of his more recent work NOT to be recommended, but among the best are ""The Authority"", ""Freak Angels"" (free webcomic at www.freakangels.com), ""Gravel / Strange Killings"", ""Ultimate Galaktus"" Trilogy and, maybe most of all, ""TRANSMETROPOLITAN""."
