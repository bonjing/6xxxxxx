Storyline: Britt Reid is the party-animal son of LAâ€™s most distinguished media magnate and perfectly happy to maintain a directionless existence - until his father mysteriously dies, leaving Britt his vast media empire. Striking a friendship with Kato, one of his fatherâ€™s more inventive employees, Reid sees his chance to do something meaningful for the first time in his life: fight crime as the masked vigilante The Green Hornet with Kato at his side.
