::Plot::
The film begins with a business man in a hurry to get into his car. He appears to be stressed and somewhat distraught. He gets in and starts down the city streets, suddenly screaming "Fuck!" at the top of his lungs before a truck running a red light crashes into him. As he falls unconscious, he dreams of playing with his little girl Emma (Quinn Hunchar). At first he is stern and hesitant to play with her, but he gives in when she pretends to be taken away by monsters, and he runs to save her from them. The dream then fades to black.
