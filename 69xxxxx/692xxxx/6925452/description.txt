Picking up where Subspecies II leaves off, Bloodlust: Subspecies III (1994) finds Michelle deep in the catacombs with Radu\\\\\\\'s mother, who brings her son back from the dead with Michelle\\\\\\\'s blood and the enchanted dagger that killed him; Radu, his mother, and Michelle return to Castle Vladislas. Michelle promises to obey Radu if he teaches her everything that he knows. Radu takes Michelle out hunting so she can enhance her powers, while Mel contacts a former operative of the CIA for help. While trying to rescue Michelle, Radu\\\\\\\'s mother quickly kills Mel\\\\\\\'s CIA friend, and knocks Mel unconscious. In an effort to get Michelle to stay with him forever, Radu kills his mother when she attacks Michelle. Becky arrives to save Michelle, but before everyone leaves, Michelle takes a gun from Becky, which contains silver bullets, and shoots Radu. The rising sun slows Michelle, so she is placed inside a body bag that was brought along; the delay allows Radu time to catch up to the group. Wanting the Bloodstone, which was taken by Michelle, Radu attempts to barter the group\\\\\\\'s lives in exchange for it. Becky throws it over the roof\\\\\\\'s edge, and when Radu attempts to follow it he is engulfed in the rays of the Sun. Radu\\\\\\\'s body bursts into flames and falls from the castle wall. Becky and the group make it to their car and drive off. Radu\\\\\\\'s burning corpse is left smoldering and impaled on tree brances, with his burning blood dropping to the ground; the flames go out and the blood morphs into new subspecies.
