Dementia is a brain disorder that seriously affects a person's ability to carry out daily activities. The most common form of dementia among older people is Alzheimer's Disease (AD), which involves the parts of the brain that control thought, memory, and language. Age is the most important known risk factor for AD. The course the disease takes and the speed at which changes occur vary from person to person. On average, AD patients live from 8 to 10 years after they are diagnosed, though the disease can last for as many as 20 years. This book presents research in the study of Alzheimer's Disease, including diagnosis, testing and treatment of this condition.
