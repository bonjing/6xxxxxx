So some fucking idiot uploaded an executable version.  This is the pdf inside the exe that I unpacked, the password was 'lollol777' and was pretty visible in the .data section of the PE; the executable wanted you to "Pay by SMS" to unlock the pdf.

Hopefully now that faggot doesn't profit off of someone else's work.
