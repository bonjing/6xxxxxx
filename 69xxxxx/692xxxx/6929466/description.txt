Scott Cooper writes and directs this drama based on the 1987 novel by Thomas Cobb, starring Jeff Bridges, in a Golden Globe and Oscar-winning performance, as burned-out country singer Bad Blake. Blake has lived his life hard, fast and recklessly. With several marriages in tatters behind him and too many years spent drinking one more for the road, his life has become a parody of the bittersweet songs on which his once-promising career was built. When divorced journalist Jean (Maggie Gyllenhaal) persuades the reluctant singer to give her an interview, a relationship develops between them that gives Blake one last chance for redemption. The song 'The Weary Kind' gained the film its second Oscar at the 2010 awards.
