 	 PROPER NOTES: ELiTEMEDiA released a rip in 12/00 which had a framerate
                  of 29.97. Considering its 100% film material it needs to                                                         
                  be IVTC'd to appear correctly (the jitter you can see in 	                                                         
 		       EM's sample) Also the source they used was mono but   
 		       encoded as stereo. It wasn't until 5/01 until this  
                  remastered DVD with 5.1 DD hit the stores. The picture is                                                           
                  exactly how Kubrick film it with an AR of 1.37:1, so the                                                          
                 resolution is a little strange. Enjoy this classic horror!
