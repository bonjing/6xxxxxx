DESCRIPTION ON "HINDU DHARMA":

Hindu Dharma or Hinduism (is often referred by its practitioners as Sanaatana Dharma; 
Vaidika Dharma; or Vedic Tradition) is the spiritual, philosophical, scientific and 
cultural system that originated in Bharatavarsha (the Indian subcontinent), 
that is based on the Vedas, and it is the oldest of all living religious traditions 
still practiced today. A Hindu, as per definition, is an adherent of the 
spiritual practices, yoga, philosophies and scriptures of Hindu Dharma.



The Hindu tradition is solely responsible for the creation of such original concepts and 
practices as Yoga, Ayurveda, Vastu, Jyotish, yagna, Puja, Tantra, Vedanta, Karma, Chakras,
Brahman, Atman etc.


ORIGIN:


The Hindu Dharma or Sanatana Dharma has its origins in such remote past that 
it cannot be traced to any one individual. It is the only religion, that is not founded 
in a single historic event or prophet, but which itself precedes recorded history. 
Some scholars view that Hinduism must have existed even in circa 10,000 B.C. and 
that the earliest of the Hindu scriptures â€“ the Rigveda â€” was composed well 
before 6,500 B.C. Yet, in spite of the fact that it first evolved more than 5,000 years ago,
 Hinduism is also very much a living tradition.

The word 'Hindu' has its origin in Sanskrit literature. In the Rigveda, 
Bharat is referred to as the country of 'Sapta Sindhu', i.e. 
the country of seven great rivers. The word 'Sindhu' refers to rivers and 
sea and not merely to the specific river called 'Sindhu'. In Vedic Sanskrit, 
according to ancient dictionaries, 'sa' was pronounced as 'ha'. 
Thus 'Sapta Sindhu' was pronounced as 'Hapta Hindu'. 
This is how the word 'Hindu' came in to being.

The term was used for those who lived in Bharatavarsha1 (the Indian subcontinent) on or 
beyond the "Sindhu". Since the end of the 18th century the word has been used as 
an umbrella term for most of the religious, spiritual, and philosophical traditions of the 
sub-continent, that includes other sampradaya (spiritual lineages) of Sikhism, Buddhism, 
and Jainism. It generally denotes the religious, philosophical, scientific and 
cultural traditions native to India.
