Every available film by BBC political documentarian Adam Curtis, in the highest quality available, was my goal. (I compared every version of each I could find.) 

The highest quality versions of many of Curtis' films are in this torrent. The only exceptions are the following films whose highest quality versions are available via simple download from archive.org, so these are not included in this torrent:

Finally, details on all of Curtis' films available for download (whether or not in this torrent, chronologically): 

1984 Inquiry: The Great British Housing Disaster 

On Britain's system-built housing of the 1960's. There's nothing wrong with the film, but I can't recommend it unless you want to watch everything you can of what he's done. There's little hint of the signature depth, brilliance, and composition of his later work. He did not narrate it. 


1992 Pandora's Box: A Fable from the Age of Science 

With this film, Curtis' familiar 'voice' and narration arrives. As do some threads and substance which appear much later in his best work. It lacks the strong unifying themes of his later work, but it contains much that is very interesting and not repeated later, so Curtis fans such as me will enjoy it. 

The broad theme is the tragicomic consequences of political and technocratic rationalism. Over six hours it examines: 

1. the establishment of economic systems in the Soviet Union, 
2. the systems and game theory of the Cold War, 
3. the 1970s UK economy, 
4. DDT, 
5. Ghana in the 1950s and 1960s, and 
6. nuclear power.

1995 The Living Dead: Three Films about the Power of the Past 

Each part examines an example of the impacts of manipulation of history and/or memory, both national and individual. Over three hours it navigates: 

1. False narratives imposed upon WW2, 
2. Brainwashing and mind control, and 
3. UK Prime Minister Thatcher's invocation of an imperial past to enhance her power.

1996 25 Million Pounds 

Very interesting story of a derivatives trader whose $1.3 billion loss through massive fraud caused the 1995 collapse of one of Britain's oldest and most prestigious banks. 
 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/25_Million_Pounds 

1997 Modern Times: The Way of All Flesh (a new, first available complete version) 

The interesting story, subsequently told in a 2010 book, of the uncommon, immortal cancer cells of Henrietta Lacks. 
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0796719/ 8.0  
http://www.archive.org/details/AdamCurtisTheWayofAllFlesh 

None of the versions of this film which I downloaded were complete (or in high quality). So I joined a pair of partial versions to make this new, and only available complete, version of this film, at 58 minutes 45.64 seconds. 

(Some versions were missing the first 2 minutes 20 seconds. The other versions had the initial 2 minutes 20 seconds, but for some reason a total of 4Â¾ minutes had been edited out of them in multiple spots. Before joining the files at the 2 minutes 20 seconds point with AviDemux 2.5.5, I used it on the first 2 minutes 20 seconds to match the resolution, audio bitrate, and codec of the remainder. Then I used VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 and mp3DirectCut 2.13 to remove a little audio noise created at the join point.) 

1999 The Mayfair Set 

Engaging film on damage to the UK economy by predatory capitalists during the Thatcher years. 
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283201/ 8.5  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mayfair_Set 

2002 The Century of the Self 

Curtis' most important and most fundamental film. About how corporations and governments throughout the 20th century used Freud's theories to profoundly manipulate the masses by controlling their unconscious minds. This film has my very highest recommendation.
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0432232/ 8.9 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Century_of_the_Self 

2004 The Power of Nightmares 

The second of Curtis' three most important films. On the use of fear to gain political power. Compares the rises of the US Neo-Conservative, and the radical Islamist, movements. Argues that the threat of radical Islamism as a massive, sinister organized force of destruction, specifically in the form of al-Qaeda, was a myth perpetrated by the Neo-cons.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_Nightmares 

2007 The Trap: What Happened to our Dream of Freedom 

The third of Curtis' three most important films. Explores how a simplistic model of human beings as self-seeking, almost robotic creatures led to today's warped idea of freedom. 
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0979263/ 8.9  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trap_(television_documentary_series) 

2007 Television Journalists (3 minute 51 second Short from "Screenwipe" S04E03) 

On television news reporters. 

(Thank you tofor the file included in this torrent. An alternate version at http://www.archive.org/details/AdamCurtis-TheRiseAndFallOfTheTVJournalist has lower video quality.) 

2009 It Felt Like a Kiss 

Unique. No narration, only some onscreen text. A cross between an Adam Curtis political documentary, and a music video. In other words, it's often a rather avant-garde video collage, which asks for less logical engagement than his other work. I enjoyed it very much. 
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1590078/ 8.1  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Felt_Like_a_Kiss 

2009 Oh Dearisms (6 minute 16 second Short from "Screenwipe) 

On the rise of "Oh Dear"-ism. ("â€¦ television newsâ€¦night after night we are shown terrible things which we feel we can do nothing aboutâ€¦civil wars, massacres and starving children which leave us feeling helpless and depressed and to which the only response is: â€œOh dear.â€ There is a name for this. Itâ€™s called â€œoh-dearismâ€") 

(Thank you tofor the file included in this torrent. An alternate version at http://www.archive.org/details/AdamCurtis-OhDearism has lower video quality.) 

2010 Richard Nixon: Paranoia and Moral Panics (6 minute 30 second Short from "Newswipe" S02E04) 

On paranoia and moral panics . Begins with: "all of us have become Richard Nixonâ€¦paranoid weirdos".

(Thank you tofor the file in this torrent. An alternate version at http://www.archive.org/details/AdamCurtis-RichardNixon has lower video quality.) 

2011 All Watched Over By Machines of Loving Grace

Very interesting, though I think Curtis' most flawed film. Ventures a parallel between Ayn Rand's ideology and the Internet, despite how undemocratic the former is. Tends to oversimplify, for example in contrasting self-regulation with change; in practice systems both evolve and self-regulate. Claims that computers have failed to liberate us and instead have "distorted and simplified our view of the world around us".

Note: I know "Adam Curtis Ultimate Collection" sounds very egotistical. But I didn't know what to call this torrent. It isn't "complete" since it doesn't include the files one can get from archive.org. It isn't "best" since it aims for compatibility too. So I picked "ultimate" because that doesn't actually mean anything specific.


Enjoy and Seed!!
