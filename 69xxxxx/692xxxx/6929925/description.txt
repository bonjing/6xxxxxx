This torrent includes the official podcast mp3s released on the www.glennbeck.com website for the radio show. It includes the "4th Hour" with Pat & Stu which is available only to subscribers (ie. it is not part of the regular radio broadcast).

Ok, I'm finally back home and posting again.  I will catch up on the last few days for whoever wants them, but today is Glenn's first day back, so the previous days were all either Joe Pags or Mike Broomhead filling in.

RESIST WE MUCH!
