                        = THE PHOENIX LIGHTS WE ARE NOT ALONE =
                        =======================================





In light of the recent spectacular sighting in Phoenix on April 21st and the bogus explanation of a layman deploying road flares attached to helium balloons one minute apart creating geometric figures in the sky (ie. an equidistant straight line of four lights changing into a perfect square and then a triangle), this excellent Documentary only strengthens the case for these anomalous events coming from out of this world.


Add the other similar 2008 sightings in Stephenville Texas, Kokomo lights in Indiana and the Oswego Lights seen in Illinois, as well as unexplained lights appearing in the skies over Granville, Massachusetts on April 18, 2008 and it is about time that we explore this fascinating and important topic in a professional and non-threatening way.



Producers Dr. Lynne Kitei and Steve Lantz have done just that. With credible scientific evidence from University based experts, stunning photographic evidence, impressive witness, military, pilot and even Astronaut testimony, in addition to a comprehensive overview of the subject matter, this film is a MUST SEE for everyone, every age.
