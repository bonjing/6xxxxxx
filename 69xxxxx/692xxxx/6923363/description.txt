    One of the era's most staggering cinematic achievements, this highly 
    effective telling tightens the story somewhat, yet maintains its epic 
     feel. Director Fred Niblo emphasizes the novel's religious aspects
     more than Wyler (but keeps preaching to a minimum), and creates a
     chariot race that equals if not surpasses the 1959 remake. Given the
     more primitive filming techniques of the 1920s, the sequence remains
     an unqualified marvel, both breathtakingly intense and unnervingly real.
     Ramon Novarro makes a noble if somewhat stiff Judah, while the hulking
     Francis X. Bushman exudes evil as Messala. With marvelous restored
     tinting, brilliant Technicolor sequences, and a rousing score by Carl
     Davis, this exceptional film proves Ben-Hur really is a story for the 
     ages, and silence can be as thunderous as sound.

    Counting the 29.97fps interlaced end credits, there were 5 different  
    framerates I spotted when going over this one. About all I could do 
     was to make it for the highest movie framerate of 22.037fps. Most
     of the movie is at that framerate or just under (21.87fps). However,
     there are some small parts at 19.98fps (the chariot race), and a
     few small sections at 18.293fps. Those parts have duplicate frames,
     but I don't think you'll notice them unless going over it frame by
     frame. This is one of the greatest silent films of all time, and in
     some ways is even better than the 1959 remake. The sea battle is 
     way better, and the chariot race is at least as good. There's also 
    an excellent Carl Davis score in the original AC3.
