Rain DeGrey has become a serious threat. She trains 2-3 times a week off the mat. She has a personal wresting trainer who coaches her in a collegiate style. Her washboard stomach is testimony to her dedication to the sport. This girl takes wrestling seriously - very seriously.

Izamar Gutierrex is a trained JuJitsu fighter. After her very first US match she was ranked 1st. She has a lot to learn here, and a lot of her skills and techniques are not permitted at Ultimate Surrender. Sex wrestling is much different then the submission wresting she does other places. 

This was a brutal match up from the start. Crushing leg scissors and devastating head locks. It was a technical bout that was decided literately in the final 2 minutes of competition! This match is as competitive as it gets; two warriors going head to head to see who will be ranked number one!!
