Sure.. it may sound great but the picture is horrendous !

Compare episode 5 dvd vs tv rip
and look at the 1 minute mark where the cars pan down and you'll see what i mean.

And i should mention i am viewing the videos
in a 1080p screen but both video sources have the same resolution etc except for the dvd rips have about %33 less video quality and that saved space is used on the audio to fill in the size cap they are aiming for..

I wouldnt mention this at all but its getting really common with scene dvdrips and its sad because
i doubt the public will get anything else.. you get what you get, except for those rare cases we get a proper, but i won't be holding my breath

I''ll be looking for an alternative dvd rip for this season as well as many others recently released..
Its a safe bet the video quality will be crippled and shitty if the scene group went with 6 ch AC3 audio"
