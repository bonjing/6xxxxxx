BBC Ones much praised, multi-award-winning drama Sherlock, starring Benedict Cumberbatch 
and Martin Freeman, returns for an eagerly awaited second series of three, 90-minute films 
A Scandal In Belgravia, The Hounds Of Baskerville and The Reichenbach Fall.

The contemporary re-imagining of the Arthur Conan Doyle classic, co-created by Steven Moffat 
and Mark Gatiss, caused a sensation in the summer of 2010, delivering an audience of more 
than nine million viewers who tuned in to watch Sherlock and John Watson navigate a maze of 
cryptic clues and lethal killers in three thrilling, action-packed adventures.

In episode one of this new series, compromising photographs and a case of blackmail threaten 
the very heart of the British establishment but, for Sherlock and John, the game is on in 
more ways than one as they find themselves battling international terrorism, rogue CIA agents 
and a secret conspiracy involving the British government. But this case will cast a darker 
shadow over their lives than they could ever imagine, as the great detective begins a long duel 
of wits with an antagonist as cold and ruthless and brilliant as himself: to Sherlock Holmes 
Irene Adler will always be THE woman.

Benedict Cumberbatch returns as Sherlock Holmes, with Martin Freeman as John Watson, 
Mark Gatiss as Mycroft, Rupert Graves as Inspector Lestrade, Una Stubbs as Mrs Hudson, 
Andrew Scott as Moriarty, Louise Brealey as Molly Hooper and Lara Pulver as Irene Adler.
