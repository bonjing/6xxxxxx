Twenty years ago the world was introduced to Edina (aka Eddy), Patsy (aka Pats) and Saffron (aka Saffy). It has never been quite the same.  Eddy PR\\\\\\\'d things. She was into every new fad and fashion imaginable and was often to be found at the bottom of a champagne glass, actually more likely a bottle. Not much has changed. Her best friend Patsy worked in magazines and lived the high life. She still does. Eddyâ€™s daughter Saffy was hard-working, all but ignored by her mother and hated by Patsy. Eddyâ€™s mother was and is, well, her mother.

In the first of three episodes, thereâ€™s a homecoming for one of them whoâ€™s been â€˜awayâ€™ for quite some time. She arrives at the Edina Monsoonâ€™s household with a new - slightly scary - best friend. Her presence could be either a blessing or a disaster, raising questions of identity that could even involve a certain person owning up to her real age ... if she can remember it. Warning: A Royal Wedding is re-enacted by Bubble.

Jubileumsspecial med Edina och Patsy

Tjugo Ã¥r senare Ã¤r Patsy och Edina en liten aning Ã¤ldre, inte ett dugg klokare men definitivt i hysterisk hÃ¶gform. Champagnen flÃ¶dar lika ymnigt och sjÃ¤lvklart Ã¤r bÃ¥de Saffy, Bubble och mamma fortfarande med i leken.
