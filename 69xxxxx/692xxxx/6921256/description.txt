Note:
So here we are, decent video, nice audio blah blah, you already heard that like million times.
Anyway, synced LiNE audio to v. good video [and expect better videos cause some ppl got sources ], nope it wasn`t easy at all, UnKnOwN made more that 100 cuts in his release [better luck next time?], but yeah it`s synced pretty well. Might go oos in 2 or 3 scenes for ~200ms, nothing to worry about. Watchable as hell, check samples and have fun.
Eng subs hardcoded where needed.

Tech:
V: INSPiRAL [thx bro, and also thx to 26K for source files ]
A: UnKnOwN [thx, next time do more cuts lol].
