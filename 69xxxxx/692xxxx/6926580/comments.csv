e clinicians at my medical school. I have an early edition so getting my hands on this one would be very handy. I believe it may make it easier if you convert your Kindle book into a PDF for others to use.

To do this you first need to remove the DRM/protection on the Kindle file. There are programs around to help do this, and I believe only you can do it because you have to enter the serial number of the Kindle device the book is associated with. Try googling 'Kindle DRM Removal'.

Next you can use a program such as Calibre to convert the .azw file into a PDF.

Hopefully that is all you'll need to do (except for maybe posting a link in the comments here to the new torrent). Thanks very much for making this available. There were quite a few people seeding this so I'm sure there's more than a few people getting good use from it. Cheers!"
