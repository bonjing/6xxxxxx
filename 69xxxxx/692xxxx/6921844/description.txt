SUMMARY......: Engineer Kevin Cook heads to the City of Light to put a price tag on one of worlds most iconic structures: the Eiffel Tower. At just over 1,000 feet, the iron tower has stood on the Left Bank since 1889, and was the tallest building on the planet for 40 years. More than six million tourists visit this famous Parisian landmark annually. But how many have ever stopped to wonder how much its actually worth?

RELEASE NOTES: Worst conversion I have ever seen NatGeo do.  1 clean frame and 5 blended frames loop the whole way.  I deblended it back to 25 FPS and it came out excellent but unless you want to spend lots of time tweaking by hand for drift it will never be perfect.
