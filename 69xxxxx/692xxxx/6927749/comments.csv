I see some frackwit commented spoilers, but TPB admin/mods must have been straight on it, and have swiftly removed said spoilers which of course would have irked so many more people than the few who already saw them prior to removal.

Fantastic work TPB Admin/Mods!
The sensibilities of many wrestling fans have been spared the frustration and disappointment of the spoilers, splendid stuff.

Happy New year!!!
