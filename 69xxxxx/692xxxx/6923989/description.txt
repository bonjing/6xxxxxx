WriteRoom - Distraction free writing

For Mac, iPhone, iPod, & iPad users to write without distractions. WriteRoom is a full screen writing environment. Unlike the cluttered word processors you're used to, WriteRoom lets you focus on writing. Requires Mac OS X 10.7+ or iOS 4.0+


Why WriteRoom?

WriteRoomâ€™s full screen writing environment gets your computer out of the way so that you can focus on your work. The result is a subtle clearing of the mind that I think helps you write better.

Simply get words on the page

WriteRoom won't do page layout or insert tables and graphs. WriteRoom's focus is just to help you get words on the page. Stay focused with WriteRoom's distraction free environment. Stay on track with word count. Stay safe with autosave.
