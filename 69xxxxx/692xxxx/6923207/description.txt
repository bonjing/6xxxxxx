This is part of season 7 i found online released by group aAF
I'm not sure if the group released the full season but i noticed
the 7 episodes that were put out happen to be the only episodes
missing as DVD rips in the following torrent.

So if you have already downloaded the vol.1-7 torrent
then you may have noticed a few episodes from season 7 are TV rips
and may be looking for a DVD rip source for the missing dvd version of those ep's

so here ya go..

and please bear with me i have a slow upload and am just trying to help people out here
