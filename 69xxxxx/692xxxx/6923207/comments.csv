,xpmule,2012-01-05T17:30Z,"had another look around and aAF hasn't released this full season and i think i found why..
The group VCDVAULT released 1,2,3,4 and 8
so aAF released the rest probably according to scene rules or something

So if people want the other ep's as scene released ?
search for VCDVAULT
but 1-4 and 8 ARE included in the torrent i mentioned in my first comment, Vol.1-7"
