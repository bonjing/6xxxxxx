Jimmy Page - Playin' Up A Storm (2011) [FLAC]








14 track collection of late 60's recordings (pre-Led Zeppelin) of Jimmy Page, Includes guest musicians Albert Lee, John Paul Jones and Nicky Hopkins. This CD will be of interest to more serious Led Zeppelin fans as it brings JPJ and Page together for the first time, and the team-up of blues legend Albert Lee with Jimmy is indicated for the faithful. More casual fans can give it a pass, there's very little on display here by Mr. Page that indicates the "Shapes Of Things" to come, but it gives props to Mr. Page's blues chops. Those looking to hear clearer precursors to Led Zeppelin are directed to the Yardbirds "Where The Action Is" and/or "Live Yardbirds! Featuring Jimmy Page" instead.
