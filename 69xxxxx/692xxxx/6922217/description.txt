Metallica is an American heavy
metal band from Los Angeles,
California, formed in 1981. The
band was founded when an
advertisement posted by
drummer Lars Ulrich in a local
newspaper, was responded to by
James Hetfield. Metallica's line
up has primarily consisted of
Ulrich, rhythm guitarist and
vocalist James Hetfield and lead
guitarist Kirk Hammett, while
going through a number of
bassists (Ron McGovney, Cliff
Burton, Jason Newsted). The spot
is currently held by Robert
Trujillo. The band's original lead
guitarist, before Hammett, was
current Megadeth guitarist and
lead vocalist Dave Mustaine.
Metallica's early releases
included fast tempos,
instrumentals, and aggressive
musicianship that placed them as
one of the "big four" of the
thrash metal subgenre alongside
Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax
during the genre's development
into a popular style. The band
earned a growing fan base in the
underground music community
and critical acclaim, with the
1986 release Master of Puppets
described as one of the most
influential and "heavy" thrash
metal albums. The band
achieved substantial commercial
success with their eponymous
fifth album (also known as The
Black Album), which debuted at
number one on the Billboard
200. With this release the band
expanded its musical direction
resulting in an album that
appealed to a more mainstream
audience.
