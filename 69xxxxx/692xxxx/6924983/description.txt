Around the world, black handprints are appearing on doorways, scorched there by winged strangers who have crept through a slit in the sky.
 
In a dark and dusty shop, a devil's supply of human teeth grown dangerously low.
 
And in the tangled lanes of Prague, a young art student is about to be caught up in a brutal otherwordly war.
 
Enjoy!
