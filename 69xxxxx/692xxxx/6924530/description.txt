                           DESCRiPTiON 

 TV illusionists have been sawing ladies in half, catching bullets between     
 their teeth, reading minds and performing feats of escapology for decades.    
 Channel 5 counts down the best, including the astonishing set-pieces of Penn  
 and Teller, the mind-bending of Derren Brown and the street magic of David    
 Blaine. It features spectacular illusions, such as making the Statue of       
 Liberty disappear, intimate card tricks and the lighter side of the business, 
 thanks to the inclusion of comedy great Tommy Cooper. Paul Daniels and new kid
 on the block Dynamo also feature in this magic compendium, with contributions 
 from Joe Pasquale, Dick and Dom, and Stephen Mulhern.
                         
                                 Enjoy!
