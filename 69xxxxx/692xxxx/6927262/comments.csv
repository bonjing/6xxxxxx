Anyway, real worshipers of the supreme being that many people call Allah are hard to find, let alone muslims, real muslims; believe it or not, Allah is and remains Lord of humans, King of humans, God of human, as well as the Creator of humans, and the Life-Giver, and the Life-Taker; and please be very aware that true knowledge about Islam is in the Quran, a book which is often mistranslated by fake muslims, and a book which is often contradicted by Hadith.
