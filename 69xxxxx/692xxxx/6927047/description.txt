Robert Heinlein\'s most famous work. Originally published in 1961 and won the Hugo award that year. This original publication was a heavily edited version; from wikipedia- \"The resulting edited version was, according to Heinlein, 160,067 words. (He joked about sending in the last 67 to the publisher on a postcard.)\" This is the original ~220,000 word unabridged version.

I uploaded this book ~2 years ago as a .txt file, but it was missing the first 3 chapters. There are other torrents out there but this one has a cool introduction and is definitely unabridged.
