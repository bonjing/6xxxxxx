 Album Info..: 
 
 Most of the merits of the Rembrandts' third album, LP, were overshadowed by the 
 massive success of "I'll Be There for You," the infectious theme from the hit 
 Generation X sitcom Friends. Included on LP at the last minute -- the first pressings didn't list the song on the album cover -- "I'll Be There for You" received saturation radio airplay, topping the adult contemporary charts, yet it was never released as a single, forcing fans of the song to buy the entire album to own the song. While the Monkees guitar riffs and layered harmonies are not entirely representative of the Rembrandts -- it makes them out to be a bubblegum band -- the record is filled with smart, hook-laden guitar pop that won't disappoint old Rembrandts fans or listeners attracted by the hit. -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine
