When she dies of asthma Nigel is left with a distant father but worse is to come when the â€˜commonâ€™ Mrs. Joan Potter arrives as the Slatersâ€™ cleaner. Nigel fears,rightly,that her aim is to be the next Mrs. Slater and soon he has a new stepmother and is whisked away to the country. Joan is,however,a superb cook but this only makes for rivalry as Nigel,the only boy in his cookery class at secondary school,competes with her to find the way to his fatherâ€™s heart.
