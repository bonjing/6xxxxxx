 Album Info..: 
 
 Gold and Platinum was compiled by Gary Rossington and Allen Collins, the two 
 surviving members of Lynyrd Skynyrd, after the band\'s tragic plane crash of 1977. Though many years have elapsed since its 1979 release, the double-record set remains the best, most concise compilation of the ground-breaking southern rock band. Over the course of two albums, all of Skynyrd\'s hits -- \"Sweet Home Alabama,\" \"Free Bird,\" \"Saturday Night Special,\" \"What\'s Your Name,\" \"You Got That Right\" -- are featured,  as well as essential album tracks like \"That Smell,\" \"Down South Jukin\',\" \"Gimme Three Steps,\" \"I Know A Little,\" and \"Tuesday\'s Gone.\" Some great songs like \"Working for MCA\" are missing, and the four-disc box set may be more comprehensive, but it\'s hard to imagine a better, more concise greatest hits collection than Gold and  Platinum. -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine
