    The idea behind the Transient Former TDESIGN is to give the user direct     
                                                                                
  control over the attack and sustain characteristics of natural sounds, and    
                                                                                
  though this sounds less than revolutionary, you only have to play with the    
                                                                                
  unit for a few minutes to realise that the Transient Former is a very         
                                                                                
  powerful creative tool. For example, you can take a recording of an           
                                                                                
  unremarkable drum kit and dial in some really hard-hitting attack or take a   
                                                                                
  very percussive sound and soften the attack. You can also use the sustain     
                                                                                
  control to work on the decay portion of sounds, and with drums you can        
                                                                                
  tighten up the sound to give a fast, dry decay or you can make them ring as   
                                                                                
  though you'd taken the dampers off the kit. It's just like having remote      
                                                                                
  control over the amount of damping tape stuck to the drum heads, but after    
                                                                                
  the recording. Other than a compressor this process is independent of level

    Unique to TDESIGN is the ability to shape the transient not only amplitude

  resonance control. This gives you the opportunity to change the sound in a    
                                                                                
  way which normally is only possible if you recreate it with a synthesizer!

  with other input sources...
