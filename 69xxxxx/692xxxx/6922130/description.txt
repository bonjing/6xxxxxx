     Stars: Helen Mirren, David Morrissey and David Suchet

   

     Helen Mirren gives a searing performance alongside David Morrissey in this
     powerful adaptation of Terence Rattigan's radio and stage play. 

     Based on the true story of a crime of passion that shocked 1930s Britain,
     Cause Celebre features support from Harry Andrews, David Suchet, Oliver
     Ford Davies, Clive Swift and Geoffrey Bayldon, and is adapted for
     television by Ken Taylor (Lady Chatterley) and directed by the
     BAFTA-winning John Gorrie. 

     Alma, the unhappy young wife of distinguished architect Francis
     Rattenbury, a man in his mid-sixties, begins an aff air with the couple's
     eighteen-year-old handyman, George. As the affair grows in intensity, the
     naive and inexperienced George finds himself possessed by an
     uncontrollable jealousy; the result is murder, and a harrowing courtroom
     drama that will scandalise a nation and engulf Alma in despair.
