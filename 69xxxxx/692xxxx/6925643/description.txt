Weâ€™ve been fans of Chuck Inglish for as far back as we can remember. With some of the best sounds in hip-hop, this dude has provided bangers for almost every new rapper in the game, not to mention his work with countless heavy hitters and his group The Cool Kids. To kick the new year off right, Chuck has dropped a beat tape featuring twenty instrumentals that heâ€™s been working on for the past few months. This shit will make your brain explode.
