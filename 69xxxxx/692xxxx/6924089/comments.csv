it is complete , and it is a TS. I guess you just dont have a clue what a TS is. TELESYNC, means a video source, usually a cam, with a direct line audio source synced onto it. But offcourse you can always go and shout about, for reasons unknown whilst you don't have a clue what you are talking about."
