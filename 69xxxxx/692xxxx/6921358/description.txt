      The General is generally considered to be Keaton's greatest film, and he was 
      quoted as saying that it was his personal favorite. It ranks #95 in the IMDB 
      Top 250, #7 in their list of the Top 50 Comedies, and is ranked by
      silentera.com as the greatest silent film of all time.
 
      The ripper of the VCDVault release of The General was saddled with a bad NTSC
      to PAL DVD. About all he could do was to deinterlace it, and about a third of
      the frames are blurry blends. In addition, either the film source was very
      soft (not likely, since it was the same as my NTSC version, complete with the 
      same music), or (as I suspect) the ripper used a heavy spatial smoother to 
      make it more compressible. In any event, all texture and detail was lost.
      Samples of the same scenes from both releases are included for comparison.
      The General holds up well, even in this day and age, and I hope that the
      Keaton and silent film fans among you will enjoy this release.
