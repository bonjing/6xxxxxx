VinylStudio is the best way to convert records and tapes to digital format. Taking your old 

LP albums and transferring them to your computer could not be easier. Now everyone can rip 

their vinyl records in a few easy steps. Works with both Windows and Macintosh computers.

Key Features:
- An all-in-one solution for digitizing your record or tape collection
- Automated click and scratch removal
- Filter out tape hiss, hum and rumble
- Look up track listings and album art over the Internet - no typing!
- Burn both audio and MP3 CDs
- Save tracks as MP3 (or AAC) and copies them to your player
- Integrates with iTunes on the Mac
- Multi-level undo/redo
- Uses less than half the disk space of most competing programs
- Instant load times when opening files
- There's no need to save your changes as you work, which can also save a lot of time
- Multi-level undo (and redo) of just about any editing operation
- Real-time sound-cleaning filters ('what you hear is what you get'); if you don't like 

what you hear, click a button or drag a slider until you get the sound you want
- It's much easier to backup your work (to DVD, say) as the files you need to copy are 

smaller and there are less of them
