NOTES:

Right video is same as our cam release and no work done more too it....this release is all about the audio.
We took bidas "synced" audio and resynced it the best we could.Fair to play to bida for even tempting to start it,but
after we grabbed it,we found it oos in 66 parts ranging from -200 - +600ms ...
Being the dumbasses we are we thought what the hell lets sit here for 8hr fecking hrs cutting this audio to pieces and resyncing it
Got too say there might be some slips ....hope we got them all,but don't want to say defo we did .Also there is some slight repeats of
words a couple of times,but until we get the original line audio ....this is the closest your getting to a sync'd release.
Oh and never again and i now hate fecking sherlock holmes !!
