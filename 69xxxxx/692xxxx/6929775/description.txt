           The story is set in the latter days of World War 2,            
           against the backdrop of fierce combat on the eastern           
           front. Brother's War is based on real events. The western      
           Allies push into Germany and the Red Army is fights its        
           way towards Berlin. Churchill is worried about Russia's        
           post-war plans for Europe but most not endanger the            
           increasingly threatened alliance between the west and          
           Russian A British military attached to the Red Army            
           discovers a Russian war crime against the Polish               
           government in exile and is seized by Stalin's feared           
           intelligence service. He finds unexpected help from an         
           enemy and fellow prisoner a German Captain. They discover      
           a common bond in freemasonry and are bound by honor, oath      
           and secrets. They are joined by Anna, a beautiful Polish       
           nurse cast adrift on the tides of war. The three are           
           pursued by A Ruthless Russian commander through Germany        
           caring a secret that can change the outcome of the world       
           and the fate of millions. Brother's War was produced with      
           strict attention to historic accuracy and military detail      
           and portrays the horrors and heroism of desperate              
           battles. The film also opens the door into the ancient         
           order of the freemasons and presents unmatched insight on      
           the real histories of these men, brothers all, who have        
           fought in every war for hundreds of years.
