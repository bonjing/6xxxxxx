ReleaseNotes:

One of Neil Young\'s softest and most striking albums in ages, Silver & Gold recaptures the peacefulness of Comes a Time and Harvest Moon. At one point (\"Buffalo Springfield Again\"), Young even goes so far as to imagine the reunion of the band he left in order to pursue a solo career. It\'s a moment that almost overtakes Young\'s songs of husbandly devotion in sheer sweetness. --Rickey Wright
