Hardline, is a 1996 Old School Action/Adventure/Shooter  that takes place sometime in the near future (assumed to be America in the year 1998), a helicopter pilot named Ted Irvin becomes a psychic as he battles a strange cult known as The Sect.

Best played with keyboard & mouse. The graphics are nothing to write home about, but the game is fun to play.

Xpadder is also included with an Xbox 360 profile for this game (Playing with game pad will make this game harder to play, but still alot of fun).

Scanned with Comodo Internet Security, compressed with 7zip.

Extract & play, worked on several PCs including my Dell laptop, using Windows 7 32bit.


                Enjoy the game, & please seed at least 1:1, Cheers.
