Three Inches features Walter Spackman, a professional slacker who is struck by lightning and develops super human powers. That is the ability to move any object there is by using just his mind. However, it can only move three inches. He journeys out to find extraordinary people who have powers too and realizes that being "super" is not as fun and exciting as it is portrayed as.

Although originally scheduled as a 30-minute series by SyFy, reluctance by the network to "compete" with their other superhero series, Alphas, led to them declining to pick up the show for series. The 2-hour pilot was aired without fanfare on 12/29/11.
