                           DESCRiPTiON 

 The comedian takes over the Channel 4 basement to throw a New Year's Eve party 
 to remember, passing the drinks round to guests including Jonathan Ross, Micky 
 Flanagan, Gok Wan, Olly Murs, Bruno Tonioli and Alesha Dixon - who proved 
 herself fond of a glass or two when she appeared on Chatty Man just a few weeks 
 ago. The show promises a mixture of chat, games, music - by JLS and the Ting 
 Tings - and sketches, including parodies of The King's Speech, Made in Chelsea 
 and a spoof of the royals with the host and David Walliams as William and Kate. 
 Other guests helping the festivities go with a swing are Heston Blumenthal, 
 Kirstie Allsopp, Melanie Sykes, Paddy McGuinness and Rachel Riley, while famed 
 astrologer Shelley von Strunckel will be looking ahead to 2012.
                                                                 
                                 Enjoy!
