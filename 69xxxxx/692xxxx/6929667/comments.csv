Or:
1) Search Japan setting E-books under the pulldown. You'll find it and much more.

2) If you want documentaries search 'Japan' under TvShows and sift.

I'd recommend Paul Merton in China. I don't think there's one for Japan. There seems to be one from Samantha Brown.

Also try the documentary, around the world in 80 treasures by dan cruickshank. it is an interesting well presented series.


Arigato !"
