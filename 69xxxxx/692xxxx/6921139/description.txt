THIS IS THE SECOND DISC OF THE 2-DISC CD/DVD SET BOB SEGER - FACE THE PROMISE, RELEASED IN 2006. I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE DVD POSTED AND IT CONTAINS SOME REALLY GOOD SEGER TUNES AND A NEW INTERVIEW WITH BOB DISCUSSING THE PAST 15-20 YEARS OR SO OF HIS LIFE. ENJOY

FROM THE CD/DVD COVER:

BONUS DVD includes career retrospective and a \\\"making of\\\" Face The Promise interview segment with studio footage. Also includes previously unreleased historical concert performances of STILL THE SAME, and HOLLYWOOD NIGHTS recorded live in San Diego, 1978 and classic music videos for LIKE A ROCK and THE FIRE INSIDE.

Remember, SHARE THE MUSIC! Leave your client running so others can enjoy, too!
