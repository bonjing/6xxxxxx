The Dark Side Of Nature.

The house rips apart piece by piece. A bellowing cow spins through the air. Tractors fall like rain. A 15,000-pound gasoline tanker becomes and airborne bomb. A mile-wide, 300 miles-per-hour force of total destruction is coming at you. Twister is hitting home. In this adventure swirling with cliffhanging excitement and awesome special effects, Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton play scientists pursuing the most destructive weather front to sweep through mid-America's Tornado Alley in 50 years. By launching electronic sensors into the funnel, the storm chasers hope to obtain enough data to create and improved warning system. But to do so, they must intercept the twisters' deadly path. The chase is on!
