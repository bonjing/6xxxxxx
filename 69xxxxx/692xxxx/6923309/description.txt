   HBO movie about the behind-the-scenes network politics responsible for
   for the changes in late-night talk-show hosts, after the retirement of
    Johnny Carson from the Tonight Show on NBC. Jay Leno and David
    Letterman were both vying for the position, but Leno's tough manager
    Helen Kushnick got him the spot. In the wake of her 'stepping on the
    toes' of powerful network executives and 'playing hardball' tactics
     with guest bookings, she found herself being pushed out of her job as
     Tonight Show Executive Producer and Jay's manager. Letterman,
     devastated by his being passed over, brought in superagent Mike Ovitz
    to negotiate on his behalf, resulting in his move to CBS.
