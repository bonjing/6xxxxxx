    Yes, there are few crappy frames - blame Alpha Video bad mastering -     
    as they always do - this is the best encode possible out of this dvd.    
    Alpha Video sucks butt, if you didnt already know.

    A young woman is driving alongside a lake. She has an accident and       
    the car plunges into the water. Her body is then possessed by the        
    spirit of an 18th-century witch who was killed by local villagers,       
    and is bent on avenging herself on them.
