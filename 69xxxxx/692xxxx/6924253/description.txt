The double-edged nature of the harvest season can be both a blessing and a burden; a vision of superabundant excess than canâ€™t possibly be consumed before it rots. Our pre-industrial forebears expended considerable time and energy on conserving some of autumnâ€™s bounty against the scarcity of winterâ€¦ yet somehow, people would survive to till their fields again the following spring. The compilers of the first â€˜John Barleycorn Rebornâ€™ compilation, released in 2007, faced a similar embarrassment of riches â€“ a testament both to English folk heritage and the health of the contemporary folk music scene. So here we have the second crop from that original sowing. Originally released for download only, now finally available as a stunning double CD, with every track completely remastered to the highest quality. 33 tracks from the cream of current dark British Folk music.
