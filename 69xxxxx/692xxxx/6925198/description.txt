  chart-topping Price Tag, Sandie Shaw reprises two of her number-one   
  singles, including 1964's (There's) Always Something There to Remind  
  Me, and soul star Aloe Blacc returns to the studio with material      
  from Good Times, including smash-hit single I Need a Dollar.          
  Singer-songwriter James Morrison performs a tune by Stevie Wonder,    
  and there are also appearances by indie band the Vaccines, soul       
  singer Betty Wright, Dutch jazz star Caro Emerald, pianist Buddy      
  Greco, Dublin songstress Imelda May, blues group Pokey LaFarge and    
  the South City Three, Hootenanny regular Ruby Turner and Jools' own   
  Rhythm & Blues Orchestra. As always, the New Year is rung in by the   
  Pipes and Drums of the 1st Battalion Scots Guards.
