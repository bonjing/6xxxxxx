Before I Go To Sleep - S.J. Watson,Mobi


Memory is to modern sensation novelists what madness was to their Victorian forebears â€“ an anxiety of the age, ripe for exploitation. Perhaps recognition of the internet's infinite capacity is forcing us to consider the limits of our own. Or perhaps the domination of a key strain of popular culture by Philip K Dick has created an ideas vortex from which no one can be bothered to climb free. Whatever your view, the war against clichÃ© desperately needs more troops on the front scattered with blurbs along the lines of "HIS MEMORY IS ALL HE HAS â€“ AND NOW HE WANTS IT BACK".

Enjoy!
