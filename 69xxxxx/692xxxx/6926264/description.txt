Rachel White and Darcy Rhone have been best friends since childhood. Rachel is used to being the good girl, the hard worker who exists in the shadow of flashyâ€”often selfishâ€”Darcy. However, on her 30th birthday, Rachel drinks too much and sleeps with Darcy's fiance, Dexter. The fling turns into an affair, and Rachel is forced to decide which is more important, friendship or true love.

The sequel to Something Borrowed, Something Blue tells the story of Darcy Rhone, who thought she had it all figured out: the more beautiful the girl, the more charmed her life. Never mind substance. Never mind playing by the rules. Never mind karma. But Darcy's neat, perfect world turns upside down when her best friend, Rachel White, the "good girl," steals her fiancÃ©, while Darcy finds herself alone and pregnant. Trying to recover, she flees to her childhood friend (Ethan) living in London and resorts to her tried-and-true methods for getting what she wants. But as she attempts to recreate her glamorous life on a new continent, Darcy finds that her old ways no longer apply.

When his reappearance ignites long-dormant emotions, Ellen begins to question whether the life she is living is the one she is meant to live.

Tessa Russo is the mother of two young children and the wife of a renowned pediatric surgeon. Despite her own motherâ€™s warnings, Tessa has recently given up her career to focus on her family and the pursuit of domestic happiness. Valerie Anderson is an attorney and single mother to six-year-old Charlie, a boy who has never known his father. After too many disappointments, Valerie has given up on romanceâ€”and even to some degree, friendshipsâ€”believing that it is always safer not to expect too much. Although both Tessa and Valerie live in the same Boston suburb, the two have relatively little in common aside from parenthood. However, a tragic accident causes their lives to converge.
