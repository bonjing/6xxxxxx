Trailer: 


    Written and directed by then-newcomer Rolfe Kanefsky, THEREâ€™S NOTHING OUT THERE is the original self-referential horror-comedy cult classicï»¿ that planted the seed in Kevin Williamsonâ€™s egg-head for SCREAM! The flick combines campy and sometimes terrifying humor with gore, boobs galore, and one errant cat. Guaranteed to get your juices flowing!
