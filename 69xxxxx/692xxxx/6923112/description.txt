"Pricing the Priceless" Just how much is the Eiffel Tower worth? Or what about the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt? And could you put a cash value on New York's Grand Central Terminal? In this new series, US engineer and television personality Kevin Cook decides to answer these very questions, taking a trio of iconic structures and valuing each in three ways in order to obtain an accurate cash sum. First of all, Cook assesses the scrap value of his chosen structure: how much cash could he raise if he broke up each building and sold off the pieces? Then he utilises his engineering background, looking at the construction of each selected monument, discovering how each was put together and how much the cost of rebuilding would be today. Finally, he examines the profit and cost margins of each building as if he were a Wall Street trader purchasing a company.
