Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

Alex talks with Dr. Doug Rokke on the military's continued use of depleted uranium. Rokke is a career army officer who was the Pentagon's most senior DU expert during the first Gulf War. Doug earned his B.S. in Physics at Western Illinois University followed by his M.S. and Ph.D. in physics and technology education at the University of Illinois. 

Alex also talks about the escalation of war rhetoric in the Middle East as Iran conducts a military exercise and warns it will shut down the vital Strait of Hormuz in response to crippling sanctions while the U.S. moves warships into position.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
