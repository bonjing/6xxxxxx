  It has long been a Philharmonic tradition at the New Year to present  
  a program consisting of the lively and at the same time nostalgic     
  music from the vast repertoire of the Johann Strauss family and its   
  contemporaries. These concerts not only delight the audiences in the  
  Musikverein in Vienna, but also enjoy great international popularity  
  through the world wide television broadcasts, which now reach over    
  50 countries.                                                         
                                                                        
  Originating during a dark period of Austria's history, these          
  concerts were initially conceived for a local audience as a reminder  
  of better times and a source of hope for the future. Today millions   
  of people throughout the world are similarly encouraged by the        
  light-hearted yet subtly profound character of this music, and draw   
  joy and optimism for the New Year ahead.                              
                                                                        
  It is the desire of the Philharmonic not only to provide musically    
  definitive interpretations of the masterworks of this genre, but at   
  the same time, as musical ambassadors of Austria, to send people all  
  over the world a New Year's greeting in the spirit of hope,           
  friendship and peace.
