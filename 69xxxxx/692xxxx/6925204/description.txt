 Album Info..: 
 
 Clay Walker is a good journeyman singer. He has a strong voice, knows how to twist clichs to his advantage, and knows that straying too far from the clichÎ˜s will lose his wide audience. In turn, that means that he\'s enjoyable, but a little predictable, which is an accurate assessment of Live, Laugh, Love, his fifth album. The album never really distinguishes itself from its predecessors. Like those records, it\'s a safe blend of pop ballads, mild rockers, and polished honky tonk, all delivered in  Walker\'s twangy tenor. Even if the ballads occasionally touch on adult contemporary (witness \"Once in a Lifetime Love\"), it\'s considerably more country than, say, Tim  McGraw, but the music doesn\'t show enough imagination and isn\'t organic enough to  stand apart from the neo-traditionalist pack. That said, it\'s hardly bad -- the material may be uneven, but \"She\'s Always Right\" has a good sense of humor and \"Lose Some Sleep Tonight\" is quite good, while the title track is an amusing twist on Faron Young\'s \"Live Fast, Love Hard, Die Young,\" a calypso-ish number that is designed for yuppies into hat music. Ultimately, Live, Laugh, Love drags a bit too much to rank  among Walker\'s best, but it has its moments. -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine
