On their debut EP, Baby John the Fox, each song offers its own personality. â€œGone Awayâ€ introduces the band in a southern-tinged thunderstorm, sweeping by all blustery and foreboding. â€œA Woman is a Wellâ€ is my favorite track, a beautiful tribute to the fairer sex. It wails, lovesick and wanting, and is simultaneously gentle and wrenching. â€œInterludeâ€ is a catchy, quick-paced number with some soulful harmonica playing. â€œSummer Songâ€ brings it down a notch, winding lazily through peaceful images, and â€œMatches and Woodâ€ closes everything out the way it began â€“ in minor chords and stomp-alongs.
