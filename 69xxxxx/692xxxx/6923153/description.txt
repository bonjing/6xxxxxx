"ALASKA: THE LAST FRONTIER" introduces viewers to the Kilcher family and their isolated community outside Homer, Alaska. The Kilchers, lead by patriarch Atz Kilcher, have cultivated and lived on their homestead for generations. These men and women of the wild live off the land, spending the limited months of summer and fall gardening, hunting and fishing for food, gathering supplies from the land and preparing their animals' safety in preparation for surviving the harsh Alaskan winters. Most live completely off the grid, with no running water and no electricity - and are proud of it.
