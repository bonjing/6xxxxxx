I have converted Tri-Stat d8 to enable a GM who is familiar with the books and world to run a game in it. It is in no way complete and exhaustive. Most of the context and details of Erikson/Esslemonts world is missing.

If you are unfamiliar with the world of Malaz then this definitely wonâ€™t help you. Go out and read the Malazan Books of the Fallen by Steven Erikson. They are excellent and I guarantee you will not regret it. Then read Ian C Esslemonts Malazan Empire novels, they will fill in even more of the background and help tie off some loose ends.

If your players are unfamiliar with the world, it is up to you to familiarise them with it enough to play. Give them a bit of an overview. Explain the geography, the politics, the history, the magical lore, the religion. If possible, cajole them into reading some of the books themselves. Ultimately, you, as the GM, need to make sure they know enough to operate within this world.

I am led to believe that there is actually a Role Playing Game in the works for the Malazan universe. This is not meant to supersede that, merely tie you over until it arrives. By all means, play this in the mean time, but buy their version when it comes out. It is bound to be better than mine.

Why Tri-Stat? Because somewhere I read that was what they are planning to use for the official Malazan RPG. Correct or incorrect, by the time I had familiarised myself with this system I could not be bothered to learn another one.

Why d8? Because d6 is designed for human games, and the World of Malaz has plenty of other races that, in at least one way, are just better than humans. It also makes it easier to encompass ascended beings.

Do you disagree with how I have done something? Great. Change it. I will be the first to admit that this is a bit of a bodge job. I have done the best I can with the knowledge and time I have. There were some things I could not figure out (i.e. the Deck of Dragons and its use by seers); there were bits where I had to make judgement calls (the relative strengths and abilities of the non-human races); there were even bits where I turned the rules on their head (use of magic). Just do what you must to make it work.

What are aspects? I have stolen them from the Fate system; specifically the Dresden Files incarnation of Fate RPG. Why? Because I love the way character creation for the Dresden Files leaves you with a strong impression of who your character is. I also love how the aspects reward and encourage you to play in character. Yeah, I have pretty much grafted them on, but I plan to make it work. If you donâ€™t like it, just remove them.

Lastly, this is not meant to entirely replace the TriStat dX core book. In fact, I would actively encourage you to have it to hand. I am eminently fallible, and may have left something important out. Something may come up in your play that my material cannot cover. In retrospect, I just cannot be bothered typing out anything beyond the Character Creation parts, so you will definitely need the TriStat dX book to hand.
