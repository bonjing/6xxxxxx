 Album Info..: 
 
 The most delightful aspect of the Charlie Daniels Band's music is the way in which Daniels uses his fiddle to liven up his music, customizing it to the drums and guitar. Most of the tunes on this album contain a feisty mix of instruments that gives the band a different feel and a slightly unique sound. Not the typical country norm, this collection of the Charlie Daniels Band's best songs will satisfy anyone who is interested.
