BettySoo's third studio release, Heat Sin Water Skin juxtaposes gritty Americana rockers and beautiful melodic ballads in a refreshingly mature presentation. 

A little gospel, some straight-ahead folk, a couple of twangy moments, a Hank Williams song (reinterpreted), and some heartbreaker ballads make up this strong collection of songs sure to be a welcome addition to any music fan's library. 

Unfortunately, due to restrictions on licensing and streaming audio, the final track on the album (Lonesome Whistle, written by Hank Williams & Jimmie H Davis) is not included as a stream but IS included in the download.
