Split wide open is a \\\'seedy underbelly of the city\\\' kind of movie (think 1970\\\'s New York as shown in Scorcese\\\'s Taxi Driver) set in Bombay. Themes include urban Indian sexuality (a largely taboo topic), water mafia and paedophilia. This is a dual language film (English & Hindi)

Rahul Bose plays KP, or \\\'Kut Price\\\', a smalltime hustler who works alongside the water supply mafia in the city, and meets Nandita (Laila Rouass), a TV presenter who has just started a reality show called Split Wide Open, that openly discusses sexuality in the city.

This film was controversial on release for the subject matter, and hence is rare to find.
The original torrent I found was a 2 part VCD rip, which I\\\'ve combined into a single AVI.

Apologies in advance for the low resolution (352x288), and lack of subtitles. The film uses both English and Hindi, but I think non Hindi speakers can sort of figure out what\\\'s going on during those sequences.
