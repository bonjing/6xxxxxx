On May 31-June 1, 1968, the Yardbirds played two consecutive nights in Los Angeles, CA. The shows were taped by David Cole. The second night recording is obviously incomplete, but I find it interesting the amount of variation between the two nights. The highlight for me is their cover of the Velvet Underground's "I'm Waiting for the Man." With so few live Yardbirds recordings, this is the only known version. In 1979, the taper released a 3 LP bootleg box set with the highlights of the shows; basically every song minus the duplicates played both nights. Tapes of both shows including duplicates also circulate. These were made into a CD on the Goldtone label with inferior sound quality.

This material has been seeded previously at Dime from tape source but I like the sound of the vinyl bootleg 3 record set better. Since it is incomplete, I have filled in the missing portions from the previous torrent. All tracks have been carefully remastered and edited for the best possible sound, but it's still fairly bad. It appears that the LPs are made from the master tape, and the extra songs are from a copy tape of ~3rd generation. The LPs have a crisper sound with better stereo separation, and unfortunately more tape hiss.

Presented in FLAC 1.2.1 with cue sheets for playing or burning. Includes photos from the show and scans of the "Apologia" included with the bootleg LPs, in which the bootleggers apologize for the sound quality and explain the circumstances behind the recording.

Thanks to David Cole for taping and Thomas aka DocDondy for the earlier upload. (I also had the complete tapes; Doc's are better). Uploaded to Dime by watchit, 1/1/2012.
