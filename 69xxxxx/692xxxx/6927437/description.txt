    Nigel Slater has been a good cook for as long as he could remember,
    far surpassing his mothers dire culinary skills. Sadly, Nigel's
    mother loses the battle against a chronic illness and his father
    soon begins to spend more and more time with newly-divorced
    cleaner Mrs Potter (Helena Bonham Carter). Mrs Potter's cooking
    proves to be very popular with Mr Slater and the two are quick
    to embark on a relationship, moving to the countryside despite
    Nigel's dislike of his father's new partner. As Mr Slater piles
    on the pounds, becoming more temperamental, Nigel lands himself
    a job in the local pub hoping to avoid Mrs Potter. 

    In a bid to rescue a failing relationship, Nigel must now use
    his culinary skills to gain his father's affections, forming
    a fierce rivalry with Mrs Potter.
