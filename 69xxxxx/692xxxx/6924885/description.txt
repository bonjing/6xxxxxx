In Bus Driver, your job is to transport passengers around an attractive and realistic city. You must drive to a timetable on a planned route, whilst obeying traffic rules, and taking care not to upset or injure your passengers. This makes Bus Driver unlike any other driving game - the experience of driving a bus is very different from blazing through a racing circuit as in most driving games.

12 different models of bus to drive, such as double-decker and schoolbus.
30 routes with varying weather conditions set at differing times of day.
An expansive city environment with various districts.
