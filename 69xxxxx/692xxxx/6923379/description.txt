Death Benefit (2011)
 A novel by Robin Cook - Epub-Mobi
 

The New York Times-bestselling author and master of the medical thriller returns with another crackling tale of unchecked greed and medical malfeasance.
 
Behind the prim gates of the Greenwich, Connecticut, McMansions, Wall Street whizzes turn their attentions from mortgages to another possible profit source: the $25 trillion life-insurance industry. By securitizing the policies of the old and sick, they hope to make another financial killing.
 
At the same time, Natalie Savondnik and Ronald Goodall-two exceptional yet aloof medical residents-are working closely with their medical center's premier scientist on cutting-edge diabetes research. When their mentor dies suddenly, they launch a quiet investigation. As they dig deeper, it becomes clear that the scientist's death was not from natural causes. Is it possible someone is manipulating private life insurance information to allow investors to benefit from the deaths of others?
