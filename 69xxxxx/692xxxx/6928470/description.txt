MORNING INTERVIEW IN STUDIO AND AFTERNOON INTERVIEW ON THE PHONE

"Uncle" Russ Gibb (born 1931) is a former concert promoter, and media personality from Dearborn, Michigan, probably most famous for his role in the Paul is Dead phenomenon,
a story he broke as a DJ on WKNR-FM.
After a visit to the Fillmore and a talk with promoter Bill Graham, he operated Detroit's Grande Ballroom and was a major player in the late sixties/early seventies
Motor City music scene. He was instrumental in giving the MC5, Ted Nugent and Iggy Pop their start.
The Grande Ballroom also was where the Who played their rock opera, "Tommy," for the first time in the United States.
Gibb also owned or leased other live music venues around the Mid-West including the Eastown Ballroom, Michigan Theater and the Birmingham Palladium.
He expanded his music endeavors when he invested in Creem magazine.From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
