Seasick Steve  Man From Another Time 
Released: 16 Oct 2009 
Label: Warner Bros
Format: Mp3@320CBR


There arenâ€™t many artists around who can get a groove out of a one-stringed guitar, but Seasick Steve can. Itâ€™s not so much a guitar as a piece of two by four with a string nailed to it. He calls it his Diddley Bow, and the resultant groove is exactly that as laid down by the bloke who (almost) had that name, only in reverse.
