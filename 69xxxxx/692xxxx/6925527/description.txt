WBCQ's William Cooper Archive (1992-2001)

Attention, attention, attention! America is a nation in grievous peril now. A once great land has been occupied from the inside by diabolical anti-constitutional forces. These forces are as hostile to the American people's freedoms and the American way of life as communism and fascism ever were. 

Bill Cooper has been fighting for many years to save this great country but people wouldn't listen. And now Bill is dead, murdered by the Illuminati, and the freedom of a great nation has died too - almost. 

The American people still believe what once happened to the Weimar Republic in Germany could never happen to America - how wrong they are. It HAS happened, the tyrannical police-state is here, illegal wars are waged everywhere, the Bill of Rights is dead and the US-Constitution is breathing its last breath. Yes indeed, it HAS happened. 

America wake up, America wake up now - or you will die in your sleep and you will sleep forever and ever and never wake up again!
