Walter Elbertson is a young, shy asthmatic who lacks direction in his life and the confidence to tackle his future. His father, in an effort to instill some spirit into his son, sends him on a biking holiday in Spain. Walter goes to Spain but finds the bike riding torturous to his asthma and lags behind the rest of the group. Meanwhile, Lila Fisher is also touring. She too is awkward with people and keeps to herself, and looks uncomfortable when a Spaniard tries to woo her with bird noises.

Soon the two tours coincide and, seeing the bus about to depart, Walter decides he has had enough of the bike tour and joins the bus tour. He ends up alongside Lila on the rear bus seat, and is wheezing terribly from the ordeal of running for the bus.
