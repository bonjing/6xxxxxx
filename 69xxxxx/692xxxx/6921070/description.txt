Release Notes: 
	In our digital age of smartphones and an app for everything, the idea of homesteading may seem like a quaint throwback from our countrys distant past. But now the new series Alaska: The Last Frontier gives viewers a firsthand account of what its like to like off the land. Youll meet two generations of the Kilcher family, whose 600-acre homestead sits outside Homer, Alaska. Experts of self-sufficiency, these men and women of the wild spend the limited months of summer and fall gardening, hunting and fishing for food, gathering supplies from the land, and safeguarding their animals in preparation for surviving the harsh Alaskan winter.
Following the Kilchers provides a look into life off the grid, where going without running water and electricity and having limited contact with the outside world is part of the daily routine. While capturing the spirit of pioneer living is never easy, Alaska: The Last Frontier transports you to a place where day-to-day life is truly different from what we know.
