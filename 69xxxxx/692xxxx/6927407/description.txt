PLOT
In This Must Be The Place, Sean Penn plays Cheyenne, a bored, retired,
wealthy American goth rock star living in Dublin (and looking a lot like
Robert Smith). He's a complex character, bumbling around town with friends
and living in an enormous mansion with his down-to-earth wife of 35 years,
Jane (Frances McDormand.) When he learns of the death of his father - who
he has been estranged from for over 30 years - he returns to America to
embark on a road trip that will change him forever. His quest is driven by
the revelation that his father was humiliated in Auschwitz at the hands of
an SS officer, who may still be alive and living in America. Cheyenne's
search takes him across the heartland of a country now foreign to him,
encountering some great people as he is reawakened to the possibility of
reconciliation and self-discovery. This is a rare film that is able to mix
stunning originality and elegance with real humanity. Penn is riveting,
beguiling and downright perplexing in a performance that reminds you why he
is one of the greats. Featuring a terrific soundtrack with music and lyrics
by David Byrne and Will Oldham, This Must Be The Place is a genuinely
unique film full of warmth, humour, profundity and lots of eye-liner.
