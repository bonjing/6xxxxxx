Super Smash Bros Brawl [USA] [Wii] [English][Hacked]

This is the original game with some modifications, this ISO contains several new characters. It includes: Roy over Marth, a new model for Zelda, Impa over Sheik, Mewtwo over Lucario, Pichu over Pikachu, PokÃ©mon Trainer from Pkmn Colosseum over the original Pkmn Trainer and a new moveset for Ganondorf, making him a faster and more useful character. This Torrent also contains a 100% save file for Dolphin.

Works perfect on Dolphin, may freeze on Wii (haven't tested it yet..)

Enjoy!
