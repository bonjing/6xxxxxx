. I myself am on Comcast and I have seen their system in action. They seem to have quit informing us of the violation and are just blocking it. I haven't tried any kind fo IP redirects or Anonymizers yet, but I'd thought I'd let you all know about the issue. Thus far, it's limited in scope, but HP is BIG on the list of things to be blocked from illegal downloads. Considering how much they spent on this movie's budget, I'm not sure I blame them. Even Netflix doesn't have it for streaming view yet...and HP:SS has been out for like 10 years."
