FIS Tour de Ski (2011-12-31) Oberstdorf Stage 3 Sprint PDTV x264

31th December 2011
13:30-13:45 sprints (live) part 1 from British Eurosport 1
14:05-15:10 sprints (live) part 2 from British Eurosport 2

The mens and ladies sprint events at the 2011-12 Tour de Ski Stage 3 from Oberstdorf Germany.

A bit of a cock up at Eurosport on this one. Only partially captured at the start due to unannounced channel swap. It was meant to be on Eurosport 2 for the first half then Eurosport 1 for the second half. It was actually the other way around so if you set your Set Top Box from the EPG you're likely to have captured nothing but various ski jumping events instead. By luck I found it on Eurosport 1 but after 7 minutes they swapped to Eurosport 2 but there was no announcement of this. Luckily I found it on Eurosport 2 where the announcers were talking of swapping back to Eurosport 1 again but this didn't happen. This also screwed up the MotoGP event which was meant to be on Eurosport 2.
