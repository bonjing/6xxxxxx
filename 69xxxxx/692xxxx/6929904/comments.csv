1. Download torrent
2. Copy 401NEU.apk to phone memory card
3. Install navigon apk using an app installer 
4. Allow download from Navigon.
5. Exit Navigon.
6. Place desired map file(s) from ""Maps"" folder in archive into ""Map"" folder on memory card in folder ""Navigon"".
7. Copy NFS files in NFS folder in archive  to ""Navigon/data"" folder on memory card. Skip files already in the ""Navigon/data"" folder.
8. Copy gta folder from archive to ""Navigon"" folder on memory card(Not sure what this does but thats how I've done.)
9. Drive safely!"
