Woods of Ypres are a blackened
doom metal band from Ontario,
Canada.
Woods of Ypres were formed in
2002 by David Gold, Aaron
Palmer and Brian McManus. The
trio released the first Woods Of
Ypres demo, Against the
Seasons: Cold Winter Songs from
the Dead Summer Heat, the
same year. In 2003, David Gold
moved to Toronto to begin
working on a full-length album.
In 2004 the band's first full-
length album, Pursuit of the Sun
& Allure of the Earth, was
released on David Gold's record
label, Krankenhaus Records. The
third Woods of Ypres album
Woods III: Deepest Roots &
Darkest Blues was released at
the end of 2007. Contrasting the
two albums, critic Laura Taylor
wrote, "While Pursuit of the Sun
verged on metallised Pink Floyd,
Woodsâ€™s latest unearths more of
the bandâ€™s black and dark metal
inspirations". In 2008 the band
was featured on the cover of
Unrestrained! Magazine.
The fourth Woods of Ypres
album, Woods IV: The Green
Album, was released in
November 2009. Exclaim! called
it "the band's most amorphous
and powerful creature so far."
All of the band's albums have
been released on independent
labels.
Woods of Ypres were thought to
have broken up in 2010 due to
frontman David Gold's move to
Kuwait for financial and
occupational reasons. However,
that was negated by words from
Gold himself. Their next album,
Woods 5: You Were The Light,
was recorded in August 2010
and will be released in January
2012. Gold stated that it may be
just a digital download and not
pressed to CD.
In October 2010, it was
announced that Woods of Ypres
had signed to Earache Records
and that all rumors of the band
being split up were false.
On December 21, 2011, David
Gold died at age 31, in a car
accident near Barrie, Ontario.
