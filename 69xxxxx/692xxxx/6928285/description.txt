PREY tells the story of Nathan (BEAU TRAVAIL'S Gregoire Colin) who is at a countryside retreat for a Fall family reunion that he expects to be particularly stormy. Claire, his wife, has to announce her pregnancy and there are tough decisions that need to be made to prevent the family's pesticides business from closing down. But on the first night that the family gathers, a terrorized deer mysteriously attacks Claire's father. The men decide to venture into the surrounding forest to find the reasons for the animal's odd behavior.

Now they've become the prey. Marking the debut film for Antoine Blossier, PREY brings together a special effects team from some of Hollywood's best films.
