Believe it or not, this book is useful for kids in school! My gf's son cannot spell for jack shit and the school does not correct him or mark his papers for misspellings. He is a teen and still spells school skhool or skool. Seriously! I am now tutoring him every day to make up for what the school isn't doing!"
