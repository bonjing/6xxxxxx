Big Boy Henry is often called "the patriarch of Carolina blues." Big Boy learned to play and sing the blues on the streets of eastern North Carolina, from the traveling musicians of the day in the late forties. During the blues revival of the 80's he was "discovered" and has gone on to inspire a whole new generation of blues musicians. His prolific songwriting and poetic sensibility seem boundless. Pickin' protege Lightnin' Wells and members of the Ministers of Sinister serve as his backup band here. This is Piedmont style country blues at its best.
