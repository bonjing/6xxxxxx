It's quite possible your idea of fun isn't wrestling alligators. Well, that's the kind of thinking keeping the "GATOR BOYS" busy! Paul Bedard and Jimmy Riffle are two fearless peas in a pod, and they've become Florida's go-to guys when locals find themselves crossing paths with deadly 1,000-pound reptiles in shocking locations - like master bedrooms, swimming pools or outdoor cafÃ©s! The goal of "Gator Boys Alligator Rescue" is for the team to capture nuisance gators with their bare hands and move them to safety before trappers, who kill and sell the animals for their skin and meat, get to them. Viewers can follow every crazy adventure and sticky situation these death-defying partners encounter in the all-new, six-part, one-hour series GATOR BOYS, premiering Sunday, January 8, at 9 PM (ET/PT).
