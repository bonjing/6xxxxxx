ks a bit washed-out but that's how it was shot (see the original on BBC iPlayer). 

To those who want to know about the abrupt ending, YES IT ENDS TOO SOON! True, in the original screening it fades to black and the credits start to roll but the music continues. That might sound insignificant to some but without that simple continuity, the ambience of the final scene is rendered impotent. It doesn't ruin the whole story but it is clumsy and it effectively ruins the denouement. "
