Veteran tea experts Gold and Stern share over 150 unusual recipes certain to delight creative cooks, from novice to connoisseur. The medical benefits of tea-drinking are legion, yet, while "Health can pique an interest," the authors know that "taste can create a devotee."

Equally at home on coffee table or countertop, this handsome book begins with a thorough history and "flavor profile" of every tea type, visiting estates in Japan, India, Sri Lanka, and points between.
