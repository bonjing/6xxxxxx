PROPER NOTE: 
The DEFACED release has a parental warning at the beginning.Unfortunately we didnâ€™t notice that before or we would have released this months ago. Oh and donâ€™t forget to check Proof folder.
Plot: Voldemortâ€™s power is growing stronger. He now has control over the Ministry of Magic and Hogwarts. Harry, Ron, and Hermione decide to finish Dumbledoreâ€™s work and find the rest of the Horcruxes to defeat the Dark Lord. But little hope remains for the Trio, and the rest of the Wizarding World, so everything they do must go as planned.
