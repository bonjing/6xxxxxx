60fps is a perfectly valid HDTV frame rate."
t back to the proper frame rate and file size.  You're either stuck with a huge file and a crazy framerate, or you delete the file.

As far as the quality goes, A10/V9.  Thanks for the upload, but please rip to the proper frame rate in the future (29.97FPS for NTSC video, 25FPS for PAL video, 23.976FPS for film, everything else is non-standard)"
