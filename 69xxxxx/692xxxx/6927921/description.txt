"It has been just last year that I AM OAK released their debut, the melancholic folk album n Claws', to much critical acclaim.

The band formed around Dutch songwriter Thijs Kuijken have since played over 65 shows in tours and festivals through the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxemburg and Switzerland, all while simultaneously working on a new album called asem', which will be released via Midsummer Records in Germany, Austria and Switzerland on June 10, 2011.

asem' (a word in Dutch dialect for reath', pronounced like wesome') is the perfect soundtrack for sunrises and sunsets.

"Raise your fists like you ought to, raise your voice like mine", I AM OAK sing in the percussion-driven "Curt", but couldn't be farther from revolutionary pathos and moshpit aesthetics musically.

Instead, Bon Iver's quirkiness meets the clever, elaborate minimalism of The Black Atlantic and Beach House's dreamlike other-worldliness.

Oasem is a quietly floating, uplifting, yet at times gloomy listening experience that is destined to impact not only our summer of 2011."
