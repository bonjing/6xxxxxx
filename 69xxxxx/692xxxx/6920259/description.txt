This is a vinyl rip from the legendary LOUD CUT copy, the very first copy from December 3rd who get into the record stores and was quickly withdrawn from the market because of the pressing. EMI tried a new dynamic sound pressing (called loud cut) but this was to much for the cheap record players at this time. But today, there is no problem. This loud cut copy plays louder as any other Rubber Soul copy from the sixties, with more dynamic, more bass and a warm and full sound. The loud cut copy MUST have the 1 and 1 matrix numbers and ofcourse this rip has the matrix number XEX-579-1/XEX-580-1

Let me tell you how I came across this and 10 other Beatles records in top condition, including Revolver wih Dr. Robert, Capitols White album in white vinyl with poster etc, Abbey Road as picture disc, A Hard Days Night 1 press, Magical .... 2 EP edition with blue songbook etc. I know I am going to piss some Beatles collectors off by telling you this. But there was a time (not so long ago) when people either through there vinyls away or tried to sell them on the flea market. Well I found them on a local flea, well hold on to it, for 0,5 Â£ each. Couldn't realy bealive myself. Once in a lifetime.
