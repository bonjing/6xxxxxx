Nate Berkus has bought the apartment of his dreams in Greenwich Village. The famous designer and television host has enlisted Stephen as he renovates, redesigns and rushes to finish the space for Nate to move in. The team focuses on the first-floor library, which boasts 11-foot-high bookcases, custom-fabricated steel doors and an antique French fireplace, in addition to the upstairs dressing room with massive built-in cabinetry. At the same time, Fanuka is also hard at work building a custom study for a Long Island mansion.
