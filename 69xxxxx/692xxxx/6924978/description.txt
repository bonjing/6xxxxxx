Advanced 2D/3D Architectural Design

Choose from 1,000 included pre-designed floor plans, or start from scratch with the help of our Drafting Assistant. TurboCAD Macâ€™s self-healing walls auto-dimension as they are drawn, auto trim wall vertices, and allow for assignment of a hatch pattern and color. 

When parametric doors and windows are added to walls, the built-in intelligence automatically creates the needed openings. New version 6 lets smart wall, windows and doors be drawn and displayed in both 2D and 3D simultaneously with additional enhancements for exceptional architectural design.
