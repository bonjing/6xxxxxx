  Here is a rare widescreen Japanese DVD of Arabian Knight, the terrible Miramax
  edit of Richard Williams' masterpiece The Thief and the Cobbler.

  Williams is the three-time Oscar-winning animation director of Who Framed Roger
  Rabbit? and A Christmas Carol. The author of the book The Animator's Survival
  Kit, he is considered one of the greatest living animators.

  He spent 24 years on his masterpiece The Thief and the Cobbler, which was never
  completed as intended. This terrible Miramax version inserts song numbers, bad
  voiceovers and generally spits all over Williams' intentions.

  This is the only time this film, in any form, was released on DVD in widescreen.

  Please watch The Thief and the Cobbler Recobbled Cut, which restores Williams'
  original intention as seen in his workprint.

  You can see all of Richard Williams' work on a certain Tube video site at
  the channel thethiefarchive.
