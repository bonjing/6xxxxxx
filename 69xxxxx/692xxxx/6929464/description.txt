The tongue-in-cheek film noirish opening is the first clue that this will not be typical National Geographic fare. Writer-director-narrator Allison Argo manages to keep up the light tone throughout the 56-minute documentary despite the serious subject matter (feline interference with wildlife) and a prodigious amount of small carcasses. Argo uses dramatization to introduce the ills of unaltered cats run amok, but she also takes cameras to areas as diverse as the Galapagos Islands, Antarctica, and Dade County, Florida, to show what happens when domesticated cats forge a life in the wild. In Australia she documents the anti-cat movement, with Aborigines making dinner of them and at least one activist making a hat of one. A British survey pinpoints a tabby named "Missy" as responsible for a vast amount of missing wildlife, and infrared cameras catch kitties raiding the nests of rare New Zealand shorebirds to the point of near-extinction. While this documentary ultimately slips back into joke mode rather than reaching a conclusion, it certainly raises many valid questions. --Kimberly Heinrichs
