BETHESDA PRESENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The next chapter in the highly anticipated Elder Scrolls saga arrives from
the makers of the 2006 and 2008 Games of the Year, Bethesda Game Studios.
Skyrim re-imagines and revolutionizes the open-world fantasy epic, bringing
to life a complete virtual world open for you to explore any way you choose.

Instead of giving everyone an .ISO file, I decided to extract the files from the ISO directly to a folder that can run the files directly, without forcing you to extract the files to a specified folder or to a temp folder. This contains the razor1911, which bypasses steam by downloading the game through its own program. 

INSTRUCTIONS:
Once downloaded, put the file onto your desktop, and open it. Run the razor install application (370kb) and download the game to the predestined folder it creates. When the download is finished, find the folder it installed the game to (Computer/Local Disk/Program Files/The Elder Scrolls V). Open [The Elder Scrolls V], go back to SKRM folder, open razor1911 folder, highlight all 4 files and copy, go back to The Elder Scrolls V file, and paste+replace the files in the folder. Then the copy your new icon named SkyrimLauncher to your desktop. Double-Click and have a great time! If you encounter an installation error, please follow the directions again. This is a step by step instruction manual for you!

Thanks for downloading. Please seed, this is the only Skyrim torrent that contains the actual files directly for the game. I would appreciate very much if you all could get this torrent up and running. If you don't normally seed, please do at least for a day. This torrent needs seeders to begin it's journey. I will personally seed until 12/28/2011, until a week from now. I cannot stress it enough, please seed!!!
