Impossible Creatures is a real-time strategy game released on December 29, 2002 developed by Relic Entertainment in conjunction with Microsoft Game Studios. 
Its unique feature is that the armies used are all created by the player. 
The armies consist of 9 creatures; each one is a combination of any two animals from a list of 76 (51 with no downloads).
