Yup, I'll probably try encoding them."
 video, 96 or 128 Kbps audio?
Then 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3992397/X-Files_-_All_9_seasons_in_h264 is for you
I downloaded it two years ago when it was the best available rip
Seasons 1-5 are 4:3 624x464 Baseline@L3.0 FS Rips with an average bit rate ~650 kbps (VBR)
Seasons 6-9 are 16:9 Main@L3.1 WS 720:400 Rips with a bitrate of 650, audio for all is around 96 kbps AAC LC VBR.
After I finish Quantum Leap I'll be getting meech's rips for my library :)

ps. you can always get meech's rip and reencode it"
