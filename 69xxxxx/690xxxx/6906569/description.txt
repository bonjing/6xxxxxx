A pretty extensive collection I have compiled for a few friends.. I cant by any means seed for long, but as soon as its up and out there, Ill back down.. 

Itll up to you wonderful pirates to keep it afloat from then on.

I organized it in a way that made sense to me. And in iTunes, too.



I know that MANY artists contributed and are directly involved in the majority of this music.. But I figured it was a lot easier to keep track of the SkrilleX with it all named under one artist.



Please, no complaints.. Take it or dont. :D

ENJOY.
