Billion Records also proclaim that this CD contains 22 alternate Christmas songs, well, in a way they are right. But, I don't think we can rate "re-mixes" as an alternate song? For the collectors there's nothing on this CD that hasn't been released before, but it is a nice compilation CD, for we have all the "Christmas" alternate takes (that has been released on other Import and BMG releases) on one CD. 
 
Thanks to Isabelle!!

Merry Christmas!!
