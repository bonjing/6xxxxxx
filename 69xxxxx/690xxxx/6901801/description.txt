Uploaders Notes: I am well aware of false positives. Are you? The patcher this torrent comes with may flag ur antivirus with Trojan.Gen.2 or other name variants but please understand that it is a FALSE POSTIVE. Avast, AVG, Microsoft Security Essentials (which is what I use and trust), and the Bitdefender quickscan Firefox add-on ALL TEST CLEAN.


Enjoy! Upload anywhere else you like. :)
