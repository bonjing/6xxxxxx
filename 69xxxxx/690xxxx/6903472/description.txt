Plot:
During Akbar's rule over Hindustan, the Mughal's considered Pathans their enemies and vice versa. As a result there was a war-like relation between Mandva's Sultan Sujat Khan and Akbar. But Sujat's son, Wajid, was a peace-maker and a lover of the arts. He befriended a Hindu Kshtriya, Rajkumari Rupmati, of Mandhavghar, and despite protests from her parents, brothers, and to-be husband, Baldev Singh, she re-located to Mandva, where Wajid build her a tower so that she could view and seek blessings from holy river Narmada, who had gifted her to Mandhavghar. She became instrumental in diverting Narmada to bring water to her drought-stricken hometown. After Sujat passes away, Wajid becomes the Sultan and is called Baaz Bahadur. Akbar hears about this and sends Sangeet Samrat Tansen to check out Rupmati as well as find out if they wanted peace or war. Tansen was welcomed, and assured that Wajid wanted nothing but peace.

The movie has some of the most melodious, superhit gems of the 50s era. My personal favourite - "Aa Laut Ke Aaja Mere Meet" - both the Mukesh & Lata versions.

All these gems are listed in the above poster.
