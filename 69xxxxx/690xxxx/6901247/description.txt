World Gone Sour sees gamers taking on the miniature role of a lost
Sour Patch Kid in a stylized human-sized world, guiding the hero
through the sticky floors of a movie theater, across the counter of
a convenience store, and other unique and oversized environments
Joining forces with fellow lost Sour Patch Kids, players will use a
combination of jumps, twists and puzzle-solving to negotiate and
overcome larger-than-life obstacles. Along the way, they will
battle unusual candy enemies, escape from deranged humans, and face
off against bizarre creatures, including one very angry wad of
sticky chewing gum

Players will be able to team up with one friend for local co-op play
