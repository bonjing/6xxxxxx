A lovely album of evolved alt.country from Singing Skies, the songwriting project of Sydneyâ€™s Kell Derrig-Hall. He might be from Oz, but this music is Americana, make no mistake, with a classy yet bleary-eyed Nashville vibe that really reminds us those recent Mickey Newbury reissues, and of course more modern standard-bearers likes Lambchop, Evan Dando and Whiskeytown. The songs are rooted in tradition, but buck convention and predictability: Derrig-Hallâ€™s guitar playing is nicely elliptical and digressive, the downhome chamber instrumentation that accompanies him â€“banjos, piano, strings arranged by Biddy Connor, crystalline vocal harmonies from the wonderful Tsamoglu â€“ sparse and haunting, if oddly reassuring too. Refreshingly honest, beautifully written, performed and recorded music for all the broken-hearted cowboys and cowgirls among you.
