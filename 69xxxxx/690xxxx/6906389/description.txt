A very interesting and useful set of survival books.

Topics include:
-Dangerous Plants and Animals
-Food and Water
-Navigation
-General Urban and Wilderness Preparedness
-Evasion Techniques
-Much more.......


I recommend you download this one (along with people you care about), and store it away.  Such information will eventually be outlawed, and eventually impossible to get.  I know I am being preachy, but seriously, download this torrent (along with my others) while you still have the chance!
