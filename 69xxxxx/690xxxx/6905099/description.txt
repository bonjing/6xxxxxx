After a dramatic chase, Mumbai Police finally catch up with a severely wounded Sohail Ansari, a terrorist, who assassinated Udyog Mantri Vishwajeet Rana, and hospitalize him. When doctors inform them that he is in a vegetative state, they move him to Neurological Research Institute in Panchgani where his condition is closely monitored by medical staff and Nurse Nupur Chauhan, while the person entrusted with security is Inspector Siddharth Sharma. When Sohail's journalist girl-friend, Surabhee Patel, breaks-in the hospital, they arrest her, hold her in a cell, but subsequently let her go with a warning.
