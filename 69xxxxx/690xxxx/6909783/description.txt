
101 Ways to Say I Love You

Often, we can remember to say â€œI Love Youâ€ and show it when we are young and first â€œfall in loveâ€ with each other, but when it gets to the point that youâ€™ve been together for years, what you do and say that are not those three words mean more than saying them. Thatâ€™s not to say that you shouldnâ€™t tell your spouse you love them, but let me suggest (for the man and the woman) some ways that you can say I love you without saying it.

Husbands

Connect Physically

Hold her hand
Giver her a back/neck massage
Play with her hair
Massage her feet
Open her door
Give her a hug
Offer your arm
Cuddle next to her while sitting down
Put your arm around her neck
Offer your shoulder for her head
Around the House

Make the bed, before she gets to it
Cook her a meal
Vacuum the house
Play her a songâ€“ a favorite of hers
Do that project sheâ€™s been asking you about
Do a project that you know needs to be done without her asking
Change the infantâ€™s diaper
Go to sleep with her at night
Let her sleep in while you watch the kids
Buy her some flowers for display
Ideas

Leave notes around the house telling her how much you love her
Write a message on the mirror with soap while sheâ€™s in the shower
Call them from work just to talk (not during her nap
Send her an e-mail card (but not too often)
Write her a snail-mail letter and have it delivered to the house when youâ€™re not there
Call the grandparents to watch the kids for the night and surprise her by taking her out.
Take the children out and let her have the day off
Let her have a ladies night out
Writer her a poem
Help your kids to write her a banner or note
Wives

The problem I have here is that I know that wives are so often showing their love that it would take something out of the ordinary to be different, and yet I will list some things (and theyâ€™re probably dual purpose ).
