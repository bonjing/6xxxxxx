A blizzard has hit England. In the tiny village of Sittaford, on the fringes of Dartmoor, a party of six is gathered in Sittaford House, home of Captain Trevelyan. He has rented the house out for the winter and is staying in a nearby village. As evening draws in, a seance is proposed. But it reveals more than they had anticipated - Trevelyan Dead, spells out the board. Slowly, the table begins to rock again, spelling out the word M-U-R-D-E-R. Is it true? And who would kill a man who doesn't have an enemy in the world?
