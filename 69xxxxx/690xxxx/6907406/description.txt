The Reverend Adam Smallbone is an Anglican priest who has recently moved from a small rural parish to the \"socially disunited\" St Saviour in the Marshes in East London. Unable to turn anyone away from his new appointment, Smallbone is faced with a collection of moral challenges as he balances the needs of genuine believers, people on the streets, and drug addicts, as well with the demands of social climbers using the church to get their children into the best schools.[5]

Adam has an impossibly difficult job being a modern city vicar and his wife, Alex, who has her own career as a solicitor to worry about, provides fantastic support for him as an individual - seeing through his life as a priest, whilst not being involved with his work. He is also supported by lay reader Nigel who believes he should be running the church. In immediate supervision is Archdeacon Robert putting pressure on Adam to increase the congregation and church income.

Parishioners include Colin, a heavy drinking, unemployable lost soul who is Adam\'s most devoted parishioner, and Adoha, well known for her romantic intentions towards the clergy.
