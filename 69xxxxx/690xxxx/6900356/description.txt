For generations the French Foreign Legion has been romanticised as a refuge for men seeking a second chance in life. But what is the Legion really like? In this series, adventurer Bear Grylls sets off for the Sahara desert to find out. Along with eleven other volunteers, from ex-criminals to struggling businessmen, Bear puts himself through a month's brutal training at an ex-Legion fort in the Western Sahara that is designed to replicate the rigours of the Legion's own basic training.
