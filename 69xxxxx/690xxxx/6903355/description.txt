The 9/11 Mastermind
The bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 sets off one of the biggest manhunts the world has ever known. The CIA and its intelligence partners around the world follow a chain of evidence from the Philippines to rural Pakistan to capture the man behind the plot: Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, or KSM. The 9/11 Mastermind is a dramatic story of the CIA's quest to find this once-shadowy figure piecing together fragments of intelligence from around the world. But before they can find him, he engineers the biggest terrorist strike on America in history - the attacks of 9/11. Now, the CIA will have to use every trick in its handbook - eavesdropping, satellite imagery, informants and paramilitary undercover ops to hunt down al Qaeda's military leader before it's too late. Teaming up with Pakistani Intelligence and the FBI, the CIA follows a frightening trail of evidence to the ultimate showdown.
