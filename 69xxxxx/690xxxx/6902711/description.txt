"Til I Forget About You"

Get a call on a random afternoon
I pick it up and I see that it's you
Like my heart, you were breaking the news, you say
It's over, it's over, it's over.

Heading out, cause your not on my mind
All my friends are gonna see me tonight
Staying here until the sun starts the rise,
and I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna...

Dance hard, laugh more, turn the music up now
Party like a rockstar! Can I get a what now?
I swear I'll do, anything that I have to
'til I forget about...

Jump up, fall down, gotta play it loud now
Don't care, my head's spinning all around now
I swear I'll do, anything that I have to...
'til I forget about you!

'til I forget about you!

And you thought, I'd be here on my own
Waiting for you to knock on my door
Since you left I don't wait by the phone
I'm moving, I'm moving, I'm moving
Found a place where I can lose myself
And just leave your memory on the shelf
See I'm fine, no I don't need nobody else
Cause I'm, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going...

Dance hard, laugh more, turn the music up now
Party like a rockstar! Can I get a what now?
I swear I'll do, anything that I have to
'til I forget about...
Jump up, fall down, gotta play it loud now
Don't care, my head's spinning all around now
I swear I'll do, anything that I have to...
'Til I forget about you!

Spending money like you don't mean a thing
Going crazy, now don't even think
I'm losing my mind, It's all I can do
'til I forget about you

Dance hard, laugh more, turn the music up now
Party like a rockstar! Can I get a what now?
I swear I'll do, anything that I have to
'til I forget about...

Jump up, fall down, gotta play it loud now
Don't care, my head's spinning all around now
I swear I'll do, anything that I have to...
'til I forget about you! (you)

'til I forget about you
'til I forget about you
'til I FORGET ABOUT YOU!

seed pls
