Big Time Rush - The city is ours

        lyrics
City Is Ours

(Big Time Rush)
The city is ours (2x)

(Kendall)
Rolling past graffiti walls
Billboards lighting up the block
Everyone one of us on a mission (Oh yea)
Got a whole crew by my side
Cars beep, beep when they pass us by
We ready to get down to business (mm, mm)

(Carlos)
We pull up, open the door
All the girls, scream there they are
It's packed from wall to wall
And, everybody is calling
Here we come, it's almost time
Feel the rush, now hit the lights
We gonna get it all started

(Chorus)
Because the night is young
The line is out the door
Today was crazy but
Tonight the city's ours
Live it up
Until the morning comes
Today was crazy but tonight
The city is ours (2x)

(James)
My, my look how we roll
Was it only a month ago
Everybody said we were dreaming (ooh ooh)
Now we're here like, yeah we told ya
Still far, but we're that much closer
And there ain't no way that we're leaving (oh no)

(Logan)
We pull up, open the door
All the girls, scream there they are
It's packed from wall to wall

And, everybody is calling
Here we come, it's almost time
Feel the rush, now hit the lights
We gonna get it all started

(Chorus)
Because the night is young
The line is out the door
Today was crazy but
Tonight the city's ours
Live it up
Until the morning comes
Today was crazy but tonight
The city is ours (2x)

(James)
We gotta believe
Its destiny calling
So night after night
We rock the whole place out
As hard as it seems
I know if you want it
Then it's gonna happen some how

(Chorus)
Because the night is young
The line is out the door
Today was crazy but
Tonight the city's ours
Live it up
Until the morning comes
Today was crazy but tonight

Because the night is young
The line is out the door
Today was crazy but
Tonight the city's ours
Live it up
Until the morning comes
Today was crazy but tonight
The city is ours (4x)

(Kendall)
The city is ours
