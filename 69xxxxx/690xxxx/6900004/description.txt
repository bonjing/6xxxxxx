                             The Complete Season 1


Terra Nova is an American science fiction drama television series.

The show begins in the year 2149, a time when all life on planet Earth is threatened with extinction due to worsening air quality and overpopulation worldwide. It has become virtually impossible for humanity to survive, and almost no vegetation remains. At Hope Plaza, a massive ring shaped structure in Chicago, scientists discover a rift in space-time that allows people to travel 85 million years back in time to the late Cretaceous period of an alternate prehistoric Earth. The Shannon family (father Jim, his wife Elisabeth, and their three children Josh, Maddie, and Zoe) join the Tenth Pilgrimage of settlers to Terra Nova becoming part of the first human colony on the other side of the temporal doorway.

The Shannon family starts a new life in Terra Nova while dealing with carnivorous dinosaurs and the Sixers, a splinter group of colonists from the Sixth Pilgrimage who are trying to transport all of Terra Nova\'s resources back to 2149.
