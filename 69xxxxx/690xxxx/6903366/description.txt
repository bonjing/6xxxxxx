The iPhone Dev-Team has updated RedSn0w for iOS 5.0.1 and added some new useful features.

What\'s New::

* native support for 5.0.1 (no need to point redsn0w at 5.0 IPSW or use
  command-line args). Support automatically extends to all of redsn0w\'s
  various functions: \"Jailbreak\", \"Just boot\", \"Fetch blobs\", \"Stitch
  blobs\", \"Recovery Fix\"

* iBooks fixed in 5.0 and 5.0.1. This is a targeted fix that doesn\'t remove
  entire sandbox mechanism. 5.x users already using redsn0w \"Just
  Boot\" can just use the new version without redoing entire jailbreak
  again

* 3GS old-bootrom owners can now create custom IPSWs without
  blobs

* ultrasn0w compatability update (i.e. same baseband requirements) for
  5.0.1 will be available on Cydia Monday

* support for newer 8GB iPhone4 (which until now had problems with
  \"Fetch blobs\"). Thanks to @JKjeepnJeff for loaning us one of these
  newer i4 units for testing!
* allows Windows users (not just OS X users) to use the \"Custom\"
  button to create IPSWs without baseband updates

* accommodates APTickets in 5.x (until next Apple countermove).
  APTickets are crypto-verified before submitting to Cydia, just like the
  main blobs. Cydia server support for sending back the APTickets is
  upcoming. For now, use stitched IPSWs for 5.x. Due to APTickets,
  stitched 5.x IPSWs now require user to start in \"Pwned DFU\" mode

* Support added for stitching 4.x blobs to iPad2-GSM IPSWs. Similar
  to @notcom\'s TinyCFW but doesn\'t require lots of RAM or a TSS
 -assisted restore. Won\'t work for iPad2 5.x blobs (or iPhone4S at all)
  until a bootrom-level exploit is out

* top line now shows whether (and where) a redsn0w update is
  available, or if the version being run is the latest. Uses DNS TXT
  record to alleviate any concerns about snooping

* no 5.1 beta support at this time (major apps like Cydia are not yet
  compatible)

* @pod2g has been doing a great job porting his 5.x untetherâ€¦check his
  blog for updates!

* Owners of newer 3GS iPhones must not flash the iPad baseband. The
  iPad baseband will not work on 3GS iPhones built later than 2011
  week 35.
