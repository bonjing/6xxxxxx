Oak and Gorski :-

Oak and Gorski (formerly known as Ken Oak Band) is an American folk-rock music group based in California.
Described by Billboard Magazine as "soulful" and "calming", Oak and Gorski are an acoustic duo composed of Ed Gorski and Ken Oak. Commonly billed as a 'cello rock' act, they consistently captivate audiences with their unique combination of cello and acoustic guitar providing a minimalist backdrop for deceptively sincere songwriting.
