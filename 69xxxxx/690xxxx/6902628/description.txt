\"Marshall Mathers LP\" 2000- This album received more critical acclaim than the previous one. The albums biggest hits included \"The Real Slim Shady\"  and \"Stan\".

This is something that appears in almost all of Eminem\'s albums.
\"Encore\" 2004- Although \"Encore\" was a commercial success, the album took criticism not for its violent or sexual content, but because of its simplistic lyrics. Many people felt this album had simpler lyrics than albums in the past. The albums singles included \"Ass Like That\" and \"Just Loose it\".
\"Relapse\" 2009- In this album, Eminem talked about his last drug overdose. He drew criticism because the album contained lyrics about killing pop stars. The album was a commercial success but did not get very many positive reviews.
