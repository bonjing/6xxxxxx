[b]Thx Hive

CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D


Source: 720p Illuminati
thx


Encode:
Another 2 days work on this great movie with very decent video.
Still wasnt happy on lots of things on this one.
a.) too dark throughout
b.) colours not right
c.) slightly oos throughout, nothing too major but annoying.
d.) a bogus 5.1 line upmix (no disrespect - just my opinion)


Work done:
Video was too dark, needed brightening up on various places.
Had to cut the video in more than 20 pieces, and treated every piece differently. 
There are 2 spots in almost total darkness around 3 mins each, which needed extra brightness
to let you see whats going on. So brightness is adjusted from +20 - +50% and on that total
darkness scenes +120% with additional noise filter to hide the now brightened up videonoise.
Colours are adjusted now and video is sharpened and denoised as needed.

To the audio as mentioned above the line was upmixed, front-rear and center all identical audio
and the lfe was empty. Dont see the need to include a bigger audiotrack that isnt any better in
my version, so its stereo as it should be. Cleaned the audio through from all kind of noises.

I synced all parts again, should be lipsync now.

A longer sample is included where you can see a light and darker scene.

Enjoy
