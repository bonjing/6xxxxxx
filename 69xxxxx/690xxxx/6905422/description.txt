The Dawn of the Tiberium Age is a stand-alone Tiberian Sun to Tiberian Dawn (C&C 95/Gold) total conversion which aims to allow people to both play and mod TD, while having all of the benefits of the TS engine. With version 1.11 of DTA the \\\"enhanced mode\\\" was also introduced; you get to pick whether you want to play the classic or enhanced mode when you start the game. The enhanced mode aims to improve/enhance the gameplay you\\\'re used to from TD by adding new features (like the XO Powersuit, the \\\"Spawn visceroids\\\" super weapon and naval battles) and refining the game balance (prices, speeds, damage, range, etc.).
