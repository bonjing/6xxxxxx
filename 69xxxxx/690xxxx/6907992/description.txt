So Called "Blue Album"

Second part of the Acoustic Works set again sees Mike Peters with acoustic guitar and harmonica this time concentrating on the later works of The Alarm and reworking some of the highlights from the albums Eye Of The Hurricane, Change and Raw and hits like Rain In The Summertime, Rescue Me and Sold Me Down The River.
The test of the quality of any song is how good it sounds when stripped down to the bare minimum, and here Mike Peters demonstrates what excellent songwriters The Alarm became.

There has been a revival of interest in the music of The Alarm recently due to Mike Peters reforming the band as The Alarm MM and also the relentless touring schedule that Mike keeps up - this year he has played with The Alarm MM, acoustic solo dates and also as a member of Dead Men Walking alongside Glen Matlock (Sex Pistols), Pete Wylie (Wah Heat) and Kirk Brandon (Spear Of Destiny / Theatre Of Hate) â€“ he has never been so busy!!.

These albums are a must for The Alarmâ€™s legions of fans.
