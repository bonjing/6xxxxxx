CD Description
It had been over 15 long years since the mighty FM released any brand new songs. Thankfully that all changed the moment lead track \\\"Wildside\\\" was released in October 2009. Taken from the blistering new album METROPOLIS, \\\"Wildside\\\" blew away the cobwebs with a piece of classic in yer face rock. Now the hugely anticipated release of METROPOLIS, an album packed full of brand new, soon to be classic FM songs will see them propelled back to their rightful place as the darlings of the British melodic rock scene. Steve Overland once again proves he is undoubtedly just about the finest rock singer the UK has ever produced. He\\\'s joined by the original rhythm section of Merv Goldsworthy (bass) and Pete Jupp (drums), Jem Davis on keyboards and newly recruited, guitar hero in waiting, Jim Kirkpatrick. METROPOLIS was produced by the band and recorded at various studios including world renowned Metropolis London, where famous clients include Queen and more recently The Who and The Black Eyed Peas.
