Some Words about Google Gravity..


Google Gravity is an experiment project by mrdoob.com 
In Google Gravity all the web pages would behave as if 
it is subjected to Gravitational Pull. So all the web pages would be falling down . 
To test Google Gravity , go to Google.com . 
Go to settings and uncheck Google Instant Option. 
Now search for Google Gravity in search bar. 
Click on Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¼Ã´IÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³m Feeling LuckyÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¬Â¥ Button and youÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³ll be redirected to Google Gravity page. 
As soon as the mouse enters the web page, all the objects would fall , 
try searching for something and press enter . 
It can be better experience especially when you are bored with plain Google Search.
