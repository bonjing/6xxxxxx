Storybook was one of those dream projects that you never thought you would get to do but actually did! I was tremendously happy that the Gothenbourg Symphony Orchestra wanted to make this album with me. The recordings were made at the Gothenbourg Concert Hall during five days in the early summer of 2004. Me and 110 musicians! As I recall, it actually was on my birthday (June 4th).
I had asked some of my favorite arrangers to arrange some of the most beautiful songs I know. Songs like Charles Aznavours She and Michel Legrands Windmills Of Your Mind.
Anders Neglin co-produced together with me, and Bernard LÃ¶hr made an excellent sound mix.
Storybook became a popular album not only in Sweden but also in Norway where it even sold more than in Sweden with almost 40 000 copies sold. I made a fun version of Lee Hazlewoods and Nancy Sinatras duet Summer Wine for the album together with Isa Norberg. (peterjoback.com)
