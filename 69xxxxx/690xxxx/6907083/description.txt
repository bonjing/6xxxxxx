Hank Snow - The Singing Ranger Vol. 2 [1953-1958] 4CD

Bear Family Records. Release: 1990. With Covers & Discography 

In the 1950s, Canadian performer Hank Snow, the Singing Ranger, became a full-fledged country star, and had a remarkable string of hits during the decade. Following in the footsteps of his ever-travelin' hero, Jimmie Rodgers (aka the Singing Brakeman), Snow issued twangy tales of wanderlust such as "The Golden Rocket," a fast-paced tune about riding the rails, and the lovelorn "Big Wheels," both presented on this massive four-disc Bear Family box set.

The incredibly thorough 112-track collection also features Snow's forays into Hawaiian music, including the lilting "Hula Rock" and the laid-back "Sing Me a Song of the Islands," proving that he was willing to venture down a number of stylistic paths (see also "La Cucaracha" and "Brahms' Lullaby" as well). With his deep voice and bold delivery, Snow also excelled at ballads, and there are many on this compilation, including the wistful "Born to Lose" and the blissful "Memories Are Made of This." Although THE SINGING RANGER VOL. 2 is geared toward Snow completists, listeners willing to dive way deep into his '50s material will be richly rewarded with these wonderfully dynamic songs.

Volume 2 features 112 tracks 1953-58 plus 16-page booklet. 4-CD deluxe box, priced as CX-4
