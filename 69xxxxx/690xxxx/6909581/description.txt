Sometimes, the best way to advance is in reverse

If you want to know how something works, you take it apart very carefully. That's exactly what this book shows youâ€”how to deconstruct software in a way that reveals design and implementation details, sometimes even source code. Why? Because reversing reveals weak spots, so you can target your security efforts. Because you can reverse-engineer malicious code in order to neutralize it. Because understanding what makes a program work lets you build a better one. You'll learn how here.

    * Learn to read compiler-generated assembly language code for IA-32 compatible processors
    * Decipher an undocumented file format or network protocol
    * Understand when reverse engineering is legal, and whenâ€”and whyâ€”it may not be
    * See how hackers use reversing to defeat copy protection technology
    * Find out how to pull the plug on malicious code
    * Determine how to prevent others from reversing your code, and find out how effective such steps can be
    * Explore reverse engineering on the .NET platform and its assembly language, MSIL
    * Observe the dissection of a real-world malicious program and see how the attacker used it to control infected systems
