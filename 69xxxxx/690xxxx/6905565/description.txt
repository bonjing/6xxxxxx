Active@ Disk Image â€“ a PC backup solution for an entire computer or any sets of PC disks, including operating system, applications and user files. Active@ Disk Image is software that makes an exact copy of any PC disks (HDD, SSD, USB, CD, DVD, Blu-ray etc. . . ) and stores it into a folder. The disk images may be used for backups, PC upgrades or disk duplication purposes. In case of computer failure, a backup image may be used to recover your computer system or find & restore any necessary files from within an image. Active@ Boot Disk Lite is a rescue disk available as a bootable CD-ROM or USB stick for restoring your system completely. Active@ Disk Image allows you to create an image of the data stored in selected partitions of a hard disk or an image of the entire hard disk. Active@ Disk Image is partition-oriented and not file-oriented. In a file-oriented system, you must select all the files that you want to archive. In a partition-oriented system, all files on the selected disk partition are saved into the archive.

A partition-oriented approach offers two major advantages:
- There is no risk that you will overlook important files when performing the backup.
All files on the disk are saved into the image file.
- The folder structure and all hidden system files are saved, guaranteeing reliable partition restoring.
If the original partition is completely corrupted and unrecoverable, it is still possible to restore system partitions, data and installed software.
