Swedish import from 1998 and full of the classic elements of such Swedish band as later era-This Perfect Day and Wannadies with a dash bit more crunch added to the proceedings. Fans of the Swedish sound should not miss as long a bit more volume is okay with them. An excellent debut and full of loud, but purely poppy tunes. Very Highly Recommended.
