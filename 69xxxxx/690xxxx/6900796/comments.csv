,nine_dragons,2012-05-12T12:07Z,Also the audio sync is off about half way through until the end.
ativize my former comments but i just checked bits here and there, some parts seemed ok and others didnt. but after watching half through the movie i had to stop. even with noise reduction on, still not bearable. downloading another version now.
just be advised, if u r not deaf this download will make u wish u were.
plz consider fixing your audio settings in the future starting with the bitrate: 128kbps would be so much better as kickasstorrents' rips  proved."
