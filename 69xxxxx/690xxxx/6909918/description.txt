Off the Grid, Million Dollar Manhunt, new on the History Channel, pits two regular Americans 
  against an â€œA-teamâ€ of surveillance experts in a race to stay hidden. The catch for this reality 
  TV show is that the two contestants win a million dollars if they can remain hidden from the 
  surveillance experts for a single day, while completing a few essential tasks in downtown 
  Los Angeles.Itâ€™s a real-life game of cat-and-mouse for the biggest purse prize in cable TV history.

 Armed with only very basic information about the two contestants, a team of surveillance experts
  led by human tracking expert Kevin Reeve, is tasked with learning enough about the contestants 
 .to find where they might be and then to go out and actually bring them in. At Kevinâ€™s disposal are
  Rob (an experienced hacker) and Matt (a proven corporate security IT specialist). These guys 
  can infiltrate your cell phone, gain access to public records information and generally put the 
  digital eye on you. Also on the team is Dave, a former Navy SEAL who works a day job training 
  SEAL teams in California. Theyâ€™re exactly the four guysyou wouldnâ€™t want tracking you in an
  urban environment.
