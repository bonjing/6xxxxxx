Lady Sings the Blues is the fiercely honest, no-holds-barred autobiography of Billie Holiday, the legendary jazz, swing, and standards singing sensation. Taking the reader on a fast-moving journey from Holidayâ€™s rough-and-tumble Baltimore childhood (where she ran errands at a whorehouse in exchange for the chance to listen to Louis Armstrong and Bessie Smith albums), to her emergence on Harlemâ€™s club scene, to sold-out performances with the Count Basie Orchestra and with Artie Shaw and his band, this revelatory memoir is notable for its trenchant observations on the racism that darkened Billieâ€™s life and the heroin addiction that ended it too soon. We are with her during the mesmerizing debut of â€œStrange Fruitâ€; with her as she rubs shoulders with the biggest movie stars and musicians of the day (Bob Hope, Lana Turner, Clark Gable, Benny Goodman, Lester Young, Coleman Hawkins, and more); and with her through the scrapes with Jim Crow, spats with Sarah Vaughan, ignominious jailings, and tragic decline. All of this is told in Holidayâ€™s tart, streetwise style and hip patois that makes it read as if it were written yesterday.

The book was  re-released in late July. Expanding on the original, the publisher has added a foreword and a complete listing of Holiday's discography, both by writer David Ritz
