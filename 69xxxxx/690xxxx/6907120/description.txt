Hank Snow - The Singing Ranger Vol 3 - 1958-1969 12CD Box

Bear Family Records. Release: 1992.



This is the third collection of Hank Snow\'s recordings issued by Bear Family, and covers a period not generally considered to encompass his biggest hit-making years (1958-1969, with some tracks from 1974 added for perverse measure). Yet he still managed to record some 320 songs, own two radio stations and two publishing companies, and open a music store and a music school! This third box set in the Snow legacy is staggering in scope. It contains 12 CDs, packed full, a book of rare interview dialogue with Snow, complete session works, and so many rare photographs they will leave the prospective buyer agape. The sound is pristine and painstakingly mastered, and the presentation is sublime. This is one of those sets that Bear Family does -- like the other two -- that makes a music fan wonder why other companies even bother to reissue archival material at all. As for the music itself, along with some of the most adventurous material Snow ever recorded, there are 14 completely unissued tracks --12 from the years that span the time frame of the box and two from a 1974 session added as a bonus. These were the years that Snow felt perhaps the most conflicted about the changes in Nashville, but nonetheless tried to ride the countrypolitan wave without selling his soul. By the sound of these masters, he was very successful. Along with his entire second tribute to Jimmie Rodgers called Hank Snow Sings Jimmie Rodgers Songs (with clarinet and trumpet to add to the author\'s jazz arrangements, from which, fantastically, no singles were ever issued), there are also two year\'s worth of material, from both 1959 and 1960, where Snow never recorded anything but singles! These tracks include Leon Payne\'s \"I Heard My Heart Break Last Night,\" J.D. Loudermilk\'s \"Father Time and Mother Love,\" Ted Harris\' \"Chasin\' a Rainbow,\" \"The Last Ride,\" \"The Tramp\'s Story,\" and Cowboy Jack Clement\'s \"The Man Behind the Gun,\" as well as some stunning instrumentals for B-sides, like \"Hawaiian Sunset\" and \"Casey\'s Washerwoman Boogie\" (with the Rainbow Ranch Boys). Also included is one of the most moving of Snow\'s originals, co-written with M.I. MacIntyre, called \"My Nova Scotia Home.\"
