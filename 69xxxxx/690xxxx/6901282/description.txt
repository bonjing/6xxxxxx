Plot: The storyline focuses on the animals, and it is from their point of view that the story unfolds. Some of the characters are: Jess, Jockâ€™s mom, who is fiercely loyal and protective; Fitz, Jockâ€™s human partner and friend; Pezulu, the colourful rooster, a comic character whoâ€™s over the top, noisy and who â€˜shoots from the hipâ€™; George, the antagonistic baboon â€“ a villain with a mission to destroy Jock; Basil, a flamboyant, gossiping monkey whose one-liners epitomise his wit; Jim, a powerful Zulu warrior who respects and admires Jockâ€™s loyalty and bravery; Snarly, an opportunistic witty mongrel; and Polly, a beautiful French poodle who, although she can be rather snobbish, is the apple of both Jock and Snarlyâ€™s eyes.
