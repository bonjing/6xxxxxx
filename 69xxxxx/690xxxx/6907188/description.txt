 DO YOU HAVE LOOK FOR THE CHILDREN?

 Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle, The Ballad of Jack and Rose) have found the perfect job as a babysitter.

 The parents are gone. The fridge is full. Children are omstoppade in their beds. But then the phone rings and a threatening voice saying: Have you looked to the children?''.

 Jill panic and lock all doors, turn out the lights, pull down the blinds and call the police. The track talks, which appear to come from inside the house!

 Then the frightened teenager goes upstairs to watch the kids, it changes who seemingly was a quiet evening babysitting service into a nightmare of
 excitement, fear and horror.

Enjoy the movie folks! =)
