The producers of Life, Galapagos and Yellowstone bring us The Great Rift. Visible from space, Africaâ€™s Great Rift Valley runs four thousand miles from the Red Sea to the mouth of the Zambezi â€“ a diverse landscape of erupting volcanoes, forest-clad mountains, spectacular valleys, rich grasslands, vast lakes and mighty rivers. 



Home to the greatest concentration of animals on earth â€“ lions, crocodiles, elephants, hippos and flocks of flamingos â€“ and pastoralists such as the Maasi â€“ this is a land of constant geographical turmoil. It will take you to another world â€“ a world of exotic extremes, where the forces of nature have shaped the landscape and so created a hotbed of evolution. It is the very cradle of mankind.
