    Low rent semi-remake of Blood Feast (1963) - the movie that broke the    
    barrier in showing gore on screen. In this version of the same story,    
    instead of an Egyptian character we have a deranged Aztec high priest    
    as the main character. A serial killer in a welder's mask stalks the     
    streets of New Orleans during the Mardi Gras festival. He is a           
    strange intense-looking guy who shows up at a bar which is also home     
    to the town's prostitutes. He tells the chicks that he wants the most    
    evil woman in the bar. The head ho points him into the direction of a    
    fat breasted brunette. She tells him, 'I could win first place in any    
    evil contest', and away they go. The Aztec priest takes her back to      
    his place and makes her strip. He then ties her to a table in his        
    basement and begins doing some magical ritual with baby oil that         
    makes her nipples rise. He then proceeds to torture her by amputating    
    hands, then feet, then 'the part that you use for evil'. These are       
    then sacrificed to Coatla, the Goddess of the Four Directions and        
    Queen of Evil. The sacrifice involves removing the victim's heart, in    
    one victim after the next until the final prostitute is dispatched.      
    After hearing of the crime, a police detective who sleeps with a         
    whore and gets all the inside tips from her, becomes involved with       
    trying to catch the murderer. One interesting gore scene is where one    
    of his victims has her stomach split open and bloody organs pulled       
    out from within.
