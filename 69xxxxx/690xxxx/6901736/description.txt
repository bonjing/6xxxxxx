Jay Leno follows in the footsteps of legendary NBC late-night hosts Steve Allen, Jack Paar and Johnny Carson. Having celebrated the showâ€™s 11th anniversary in May 2003, Leno has created his own unique late-night style with a combination of humor, talk and entertainment each night at 11:35 p.m. ET - the wee hours when viewers want to wind down with a few laughs before drifting off to dreamland.

Considered by many to be a â€œvarietyâ€ show, The Tonight Show features a nightly monologue and news-making guests, as well as ongoing comedy segments including Headlines, Request Line, Tonight Show Side Show, Jaywalking, and Battle of Jaywalking All-Stars.

The result is a unique look at todayâ€™s pop culture.

Conan O'Brien took over as host in June 2009.
However, after Jay's 10pm show was canceled and an attempted time slot change for 'The Tonight Show', Conan O'Brien decided to quit hosting & leave NBC on January 22nd, 2010.
Jay Leno returned as 'The Tonight Show' host on March 1st, 2010.
