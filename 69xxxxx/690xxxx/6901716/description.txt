[/b][/color] The Wyatts are your typical suburban family... who just happened to own one of the premiere firearms facilities in the world.
Rich Wyatt and his wife Renee own Gunsmoke, located outside Denver, Colorado, where they buy, sell and trade guns - from hand canons to hunting rifles.
And if you don't see what you want, they'll build one for you - from nothing more than a block of metal.
Gunsmoke has the largest and most experienced group of gunsmiths in the state.
When the Wyatts aren't building or selling guns, they're shooting them.
No gun leaves their shop without being test fired by the family first.
