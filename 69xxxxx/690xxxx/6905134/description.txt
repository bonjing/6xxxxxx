The adventure in Heroes VI, starting 400 years before events in Heroes V,
catapults a family of heroes into a fast-paced epic story where Angels plot
to end -- once and for all -- an unfinished war with their ancient rivals,
the Faceless. A legendary Archangel General is resurrected, but with his
powers crippled. Plagued by horrible memories of the Elder Wars, he plots
to recover his powers and take control of Ashan while destroying both
Faceless and Demons in a series of carefully orchestrated attacks and
betrayals. He underestimates, however, the power of the all-too-human
Griffin dynasty
