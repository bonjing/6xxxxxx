ining about the inferior quality of Yify's ups:
Please stop and consider something.  If the quality is indistinguishable on our small devices, why would we want to lug an extra 4-8 gigs of data around per movie?  Yify is an absolute bloody hero to those of us who actually venture outside our home theatre's from time to time.

Sorry I've never taken the time to properly thank you Yify but props m8.  Your ups are the best!!"
