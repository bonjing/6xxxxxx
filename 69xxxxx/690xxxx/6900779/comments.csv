The reason for smaller collections is the ability to download each group separately instead of waiting for the entire collection to download. In other words, if it's in two batches instead of one, I can download the entire collection twice as fast. 

Thanks again."
st download what you want. I'd actually release each movie as a separate release, but as most titles in the site are in Japanese i can't write out the title to the torrent so batch dl's with random names are the only option :x"
