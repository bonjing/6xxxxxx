As we like to watch american and english movies in english we also like to watch other movies in their own language, it adds an extra flavour and reading the subs shouldn't be a problem, imagine what an horrible exprience would be to watch an indian movie in english, completely destroys the mood.
But again, it's a personal preference to watch movies in their original language."
