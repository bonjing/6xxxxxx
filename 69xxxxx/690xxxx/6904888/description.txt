My first album in English. Im really pleased with the outcome of this album. It pretty much reflects where I was in life at the time. My manager and me had been traveling all over the world to find songs, but in the end we decided to go for the Swedish songwriters instead.
I had three hit singles with this album: Higher, Tonight and my favorite Under My Skin. I was chosen as best male artist both on NRJ and Tracks. I was nominated for a RockbjÃ¶rn as best male artist of the year. The album sold more than 80 000 copies and was awarded a Platinum album.
The songs were written by, amongst others, JÃ¶rgen Elofsson, Christer Sandelin and Tommy Ekman and American songwriter Ty Lacy who I met in Los Angeles when traveling across the USA. Ty has written songs for Faith Hill and others. (peterjoback.com)
