Maybe one of my most important albums.
A very exciting recording and writing period preceded this album. Mauro Scocco wrote me songs after the two of us having long discussions about life. So did Niclas Frisk and Andreas Mattson. I recorded a beautiful translation of Dont Give Up (Peter Gabriel) - Jag BÃ¤r Dig (Tomas Andersson Wij) in a duet with Sara Isaksson.
The album received fantastic reviews, which made me very happy and one may say that I got a true recognition as a recording artist with this album.
Lars Halapi was the producer of the album. (peterjoback.com)
