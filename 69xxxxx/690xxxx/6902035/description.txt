*ip filter updater 0.4*

If you've been using uTorrent to download for a while you may have found yourself receiving lots of wasted data.
 
This is data that has been discarded after being deemed corrupt or invalid by uTorrent.

This usually happens because Anti-P2P organizations are polluting P2P networks with fake peers, which send out fake or corrupt data in order to waste bandwidth 
and slow down file transfers. 

There is also a more serious side to this, once you've established a connection to one of these fake "peers", your IP has been logged and will most likely be sent to 
the RIAA, MPAA or your ISP to inform them what you have been downloading.

You can easily block these bad IP ranges in uTorrent by enabling the IP filter and using a simple script to update the IP block list each day.

enjoy this and happy downloading :)
