DLG (Dark Latin Groove) is a salsa band that mixes salsa, reggae, reggaeton, and hip-hop. The group was brought together in New York by producer Sergio George (who also signed them to his record company Sir George Records) and included Huey Dunbar, Fragancia, and James "Da Barba" de Jesus.

There is no doubt that DLG was a revolutionary salsa group that mixed salsa, rap, raggae and other rythyms, but most of the songs on this cd are mediocre. With the exception of "No Morira," "Me Va Extranar," and the up-beat "Sueltame," the rest of the songs are nice but get mundane after a while. The fusions of rap in the songs are nice and the improvisation parts of the songs are also well done, but the body of some of the songs are rather un-interesting. Huey has a great voice, and while his high notes add energy to the songs they can be a little annoying sometimes. The follow up album was considerably better.
