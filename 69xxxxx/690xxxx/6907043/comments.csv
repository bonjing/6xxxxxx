Something in Arabic that looks like a description google translates into: Exclusively ALLINA PRD SUP.rar video images 2012 to explain details of the load directly youtube 2011

I have no idea if that is a real description or just marketing garbage. I thought that these torrents might have something to do with Tor, The Onion Router. It's quickly gaining popularity in the Middle East."
