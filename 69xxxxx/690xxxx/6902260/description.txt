The runaway best-selling storyline that propelled DC\'s Scarlet Speedster to new heights of excitement is now available in one sensational volume. THE FLASH: TERMINAL VELOCITY trade paperback reprints Wally West\'s most astounding adventure from issues #0 and #95-100, redefining the true nature of the Flash and super-speedsters throughout the DC Universe.

As a result of the events in ZERO HOUR, Flash achieved the speed of light, and in so doing was flung headlong on an odyssey of self-rediscovery. He encountered, for the first time, the mysterious force on the Other Side of Light, a strange energy that in time would cause him to transcend all previous limits, transforming Wally West into the quintessential fusion of humanity and velocity.

Written by fan-favorite writer Mark Waid (IMPULSE, LEGION OF SUPER-HEROES, UNDERWORLD UNLEASHED), with the sensational art of Mike Wieringo, Salvador Larroca, Oscar Jiminez, Carlos Pacheco Jose Marzan Jr., and Sergio Borjas, TERMINAL VELOCITY is a fast-paced story driven as much by its well-developed characters and shocking revelations as it is by the explosive action in every chapter. Co-starring Impulse, Max Mercury, Johnny and Jesse Quick, and the Golden Age Flash, TERMINAL VELOCITY has everything you\'re looking for: a great story with great art, uniting DC\'s rich history with its current continuity. The collection also includes an introduction by Waid and editor Brian Augustyn, and a new cover by Wieringo and Marzan, Jr.
