You can even choose to publish to ISO CD/DVD images or to a hard drive folder for packing it up with an installer/setup builder.

Professional Templates
Choose from a variety of ready-to-use projects and then modify them to fit your needs. We include examples of software installer menus, electronic business cards, marketing brochures and many others. It's also easy to make your own project templates or to add-in templates made by others.
