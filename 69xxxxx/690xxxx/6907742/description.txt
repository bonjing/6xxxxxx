On their second album, Hang-Ups, Goldfinger wisely decided to expand their ska-punk base, adding stronger melodic elements drawn from '60s pop and '70s punk. As a result, the record is stronger and more varied than its predecessor, which helps put their ska workouts in sharper relief. They still have a bit of trouble putting together a consistent set of material, but on the whole, Hang-Ups is evidence that the band is starting to mature and improve.
