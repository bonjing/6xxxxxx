you could look at the cover of this album, see a white woman with blonde hair and an acoustic guitar, and think, "from 1959, huh? this has a high probablity of being hokey." you could think that. but i want to chase such thoughts from your mind. this is the real deal. powerful, down to earth folk music, sung by a woman with an amazing voice that's rich in tone and full of confidence. tom paley, from the new lost city ramblers, is the lone accompaniment here, playing acoustic guitar on all but two tracks ("little maggie" and "the danville girl" are decorated by wonderful banjo work from mr paley). these are stark and beautifully done recordings. "greensleeves," in particular, is rendered here in a glorious heartfelt performance. anyone with an interest in folk music should pick up a copy of this fantastic recording from 1959
