I haven't downloaded this torrent myself (because of the screenshots) but I downloaded a DVD ISO instead. My conversion program identified it as a 16:9 DVD but it is in fact 4:3, so I guess the correct aspect ratio for this torrent should have been 4:3 as well.

For those who've downloaded this torrent, the MKV file can be opened using MKVToolnix and then resaved with the correct aspect ratio (no conversion required).
The picture appears not to have been cropped at all to specifying 4:3 (or 960x720 etc) should fix the aspect ratio."
