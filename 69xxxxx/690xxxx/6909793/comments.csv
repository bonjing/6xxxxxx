ast thing, lol... The subs linked above are eng for eng speaking parts only. Sheepish apologies for the eng-centric assumptions of my previous post. 

If it will help those seeking non-eng subs, the sub release that worked with the aTlas release upped here by TvTeam is for: 

'Colombiana.UNRATED.2011.BRRip.XviD.AC3-SANTi'. 

Might not work as well as they did for the eng release, but it's a starting point at least."
