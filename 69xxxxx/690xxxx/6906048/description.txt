Review 

Oh my God...If you go to church, pick flowers, smile at babies, pet kitties, or generally think people are kind and good, then HEADER is not for you. I left the theater in NYC with a pit in my stomach. I couldn't believe what i saw. what a story! I had to talk to my friends about it the rest of the night just to cope with what I saw. I still tell people about it, which is why i'm here now typing this comment. It's got to be seen. Very original plot. The acting was great, good film-making for an indie. I read a bunch of great reviews on the film too since i saw it, and these reviewers are as excited as i am about it. A desperate ATF officer, drug running, violent hillbillies, a sadistic legless old man in a wheelchair, the brutal act of Headers and a conclusion that surprised me and the gang I was with...It had to be the craziest flick i've ever seen. Edward Lee and Archibald Flancranstin are both going to hell.
