     Originally from India, Tamil-speaking Shekar Subramaniam lives a middle-classed life abroad along with his wife, Sonia, and a school-going son, Prateek. While Sonia is busy writing a book on converting all female-related expletives to male, her husband is employed with Barron Industries, where the owner insists his staff come up with a plan to launch the ultimate video game or else he will change his organization to a restaurant and hire them as waiters. Hoping to create a super-hero, Shekhar instead faces criticism from Prateek â€“ who hopes to instead see a kick-ass villain. This conversation does change Shekharâ€™s thinking and he sets about to create an indestructible villain, calls him Ra.one (pronounced as in Lankeshwar Ravan) and its arch-enemy G.One (Jeevan). Prateek will have to regret passing on this idea on to his father â€“ for soon their lives will be shattered when the shape-shifting Ra.One will find a way to enter the real worldâ€¦
