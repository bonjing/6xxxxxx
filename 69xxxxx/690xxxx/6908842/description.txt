But all hell breaks loose when charming Jerry Dandridge (Colin Farrell) moves in next door.  Charley thinks there's something odd about him, although no one - including his mom (Toni Collette) - seems to notice.  But after too many of his classmates vanish under bizarre circumstances, Charley comes to an unmistakable conclusion:  Jerry is a vampire preying on his neighborhood!  Get set to sink your teeth into this thrilling, modern-day re-vamp of the wickedly entertaining horror classic.  Featuring a star-studded cast and crawling with bonus, Fright Night will captivate you from the very first bite!
