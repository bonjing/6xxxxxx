This book offers a radically new and definitive reappraisal of Allied responses to Nazi human experiments and the origins of informed consent. It places the victims and Allied Medical Intelligence officers at centre stage, while providing a full reconstruction of policies on war crimes and trials related to Nazi medical atrocities and genocide. The analysis of the Medical Trial considers the prosecution, defense, judges and observers to present a rounded picture of the court and its context, and the aftermath in terms of Cold War politics, compensation and research ethics.
