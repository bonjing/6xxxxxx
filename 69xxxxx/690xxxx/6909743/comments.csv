,summaira,2012-02-11T19:36Z,This is just a feedback. I have dled 2 so far and both ran with a jerky motion or stall. Different segments were tested. The whole files are like that. Have you tried it after the conversion. And which media player did you use. The rips are good but there is something wrong.
