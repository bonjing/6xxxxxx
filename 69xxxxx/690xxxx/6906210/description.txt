Warrior Graveyard: Navy of the Damned 
Archaeological digs reveal the working conditions of 18th and 19th-century Royal Navy sailors, some of whom were just 13 years old. A forensic archaeologist studies the injuries on bones discovered at the site of an ancient battle and suggests how these people may have died. These deaths were re-created in a large studio set in which actors hanging from wires fought in mid-air other scenes involved multiple stuntmen, and battles in which CGI elements will feature strongly. Green screen was also widely used.
