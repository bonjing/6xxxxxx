Toby Walker has returned to his roots by diving into the depths of the music that first inspired him... all the various styles of the blues. You'll hear Piedmont, Ragtime, Delta, Texas and Chicago here, all deftly played by a person that Happy Traum has called a 'Fingerpicking Guitar Wizard.
' 
All of the songs were played on a wide variety of vintage guitars - ranging from a 1900 Columbia Parlor guitar, a 1930 National Steel, a rare 1960 electric Stratatone, a 1935 Gibson L-00 and some old Harmony guitars that are what Toby calls 'cosmetic train wrecks.
' However old or beat up, these instruments sure bring out sounds that the old time blues calls for. 
Backing Toby on a number of tracks is his wife, Carol Walker, who plays the upright bass in a style reminiscent of the great Willie Dixon.
