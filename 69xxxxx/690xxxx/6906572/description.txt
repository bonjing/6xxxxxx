Leaked emails - from 
----------------------------------------------------------

The Climatic Research Unit email controversy (also known as \\\"Climategate\\\")[2][3] began in November 2009 with the hacking of a server at the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia (UEA).[4] Several weeks before the Copenhagen Summit on climate change, an unknown individual or group had breached CRU\\\'s server and thousands of emails and computer files were copied to various locations on the Internet.

The story first broke in the climate sceptic blogosphere,[5] and columnist James Delingpole popularised the term \\\"Climategate\\\" to describe the controversy.[6] Climate sceptics alleged that the emails revealed scientists manipulating climate data and suppressing their critics.[7] Climate sceptics said the documents showed evidence that global warming was a scientific conspiracy.[8] All these accusations have been denied by CRU spokepersons, and the CRU\\\'s researchers stated that the emails had been taken out of context and merely reflect an honest exchange of ideas.[9][10]

The mainstream media picked up the story as negotiations over climate change mitigation began in Copenhagen on 7 December, with Fox News and some other media outlets giving the controversy increased coverage.[11] Because of the timing, scientists, policy makers, and public relations experts said that the release of emails was a smear campaign intended to undermine the climate conference.[12] In response to the controversy, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the American Meteorological Society (AMS) and the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) released statements supporting the scientific consensus that the Earth\\\'s mean surface temperature had been rising for decades, with the AAAS concluding \\\"based on multiple lines of scientific evidence that global climate change caused by human activities is now underway...it is a growing threat to society.\\\"[13]

Six committees investigated the allegations and published reports, finding no evidence of fraud or scientific misconduct.[14] The Muir Russell report stated, however, \\\"We do find that there has been a consistent pattern of failing to display the proper degree of openness, both on the part of CRU scientists and on the part of the UEA.\\\"[15][16] The scientific consensus that global warming is occurring as a result of human activity remained unchanged at the end of the investigations.[17]
