Seventeen of these eighteen tracks have been selected by the vocalist from his catalog of
albums and compilation appearances on Snowfall: The Tony Bennett Christmas Album (1968)
The Playground (1998), Our Favorite Things (2001), Christmas with Tony Bennett (2002) and
A Swingin' Christmas (2008). The album's one previously unreleased title is a Marion Evans
arrangement of the traditional "What Child is This. Bennett appears in orchestral, big
band and small combo settings, and though the original albums can still be found, this
provides a nice sampling across forty years of his stylish takes on holiday standards.
Bennett sings with a jazzy cool unparalleled by his peers or followers, and together with
some hot charts (particularly those for the Basie band) he gives new life to these holiday
chestnuts. The Bennett fanatic in your family may be expecting the monumental 73-CD Complete
Collection under the tree, but the rest of the family will be satisfied by this warm collection
of classics. 3-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings.

Tony Bennett's voice is amazing -- smooth, understated elegance. This is a holiday CD that wont
disappoint you. Almost seems a pity to listen to it only in the month of December!
