Jeppesen Data Cycle 1126.

Includes coverage codes and an airportlist.bin files inside the
torrent, as well as PDF files of the manuals.  Drop the manuals
directly into iTunes and sync to iBooks, the manuals do NOT install in
JeppFD.

This torrent provides everything you need to update your Jeppesen
Navdata on a Windows PC running JeppView or to load this data into an
iPad.  *NEW* See the documents inside the torrent for installation
instructions. I would appreciate any feedback on these instructions.

If you have the ability to seed for a long period of time, please
download and reseed

even if you do not need it.  This torrent is needed to do an initial
install of Jeppview and it is not being well seeded.  It is important
that we keep that torrent alive and well seeded!

This was a group effort, special thanks to rogerwilco for his help
producing the airportlist.bin file and to Capt_Minus for the area
manuals.  You can help keep these downloads fast and available to
others by seeding this torrent until the next cycle (2 weeks) and
seeding the above torrent forever!

Happy Holidays!
