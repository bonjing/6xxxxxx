I installed the game correctly, and autoupdated it. When i clicked the CSS file, it worked. Now 2 problems occurred. 

1. It says ""no internet connection"" when im trying to find a server on the internet tab.

2. when i tried to play it alone, the program suddenly black out and closed itself. after that, window box appeared and says ""resolving problems"" this happens always.

im using windows 7 64bit.
