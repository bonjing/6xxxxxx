RELEASE NOTES:

Zend Studio is the only Integrated Development Environment (IDE) available
for professional developers providing the capabilities needed to develop
business applications. Features like refactoring, code generation, code
assist and semantic analysis combine to enable rapid application
development on both the server side (in PHP) and the browser side
(in JavaScript). Zend Studio also makes it simple to develop in a
production-like environment by integrating with VMware Workstation for
running and debugging PHP applications.

Zend Studio provides comprehensive debugging and testing support that
helps you analyze and resolve problems quickly. Through support for both
local and remote (on server) debugging, integrated PHP and JavaScript
debugging, profiling, code inspection & quick fix, test generation &
reporting, you have the tools you need to diagnose and resolve application
problems quickly while ensuring your code starts out correctly.  Tight
integration with Zend Server speeds root cause analysis of problems
detected in testing, staging or the production environment.

Zend Studio was designed with cloud development in mind. It allows you to
code using the Zend Developer Cloud on phpcloud.com as your development
runtime - now you can use an instantly available, consistent PHP
environment that delivers superior debugging, increased productivity and
collaboration in the cloud. It's also easier than ever to deploy PHP
applications into any of several supported clouds.

And if you work with Amazon Web Services, you'll find it easier than ever
to leverage services like EC2, S3, and others using the AWS toolkit built
into Zend Studio 9.

Zend Studio enhances productivity with team-oriented development features,
such as support for source configuration management (Git, GitHub, CVS,
SVN) and shared project settings. These features help improve
collaboration between project members.

Enjoy another fine release from HERiTAGE!
