Reviews
~~~~~~~
By Stef

In my latest review of "Mostly Other People Do The Killing", I wrote "And when
you hear some of their soloing in the wildest parts of their performance, you
think : "why do these guys put themselves in this self-constructed cage?", you
think "what if they let things loose?", you think "what if they just played what
they truly felt instead of just performing an act to amuse the audience?", you
think "they could be the Chicago Bulls, but they act like the Harlem
Globetrotters", you think "it is show rather than art, but then performed by
artists rather than showmen".

Now, when hearing their new double live album, I have the same sentiment. The
playing is even more superb, jaw-dropping and spectacular and fun, with changes
of style, tempo, rhythm, arrangements, with tunes flawlessly merging into one
another, with a band of equals that is fully at the same high level, throughout
the album, diving and reworking jazz history, swing, blues, full of fun and
drive and enthusiasm and raw and rebellious wildness of modern music, fully
enjoying themselves in the process ... with little jokes and quotes and throwing
balls around for the other player to catch and pass on flawlessly at breakneck
speed to the amusement of the audience.

The band is Peter Evans on trumpet, Jon Irabagon on sax, Moppa Elliott on bass
and Kevin Shea on drums.

The downside of all the fun is the same as with all humor, it creates an
emotional distance that needs to be bridged in true artistry. It is somehow
non-committal, not the expression of real feelings of anger or madness or sorrow
... but that is clearly not the intention either.

Great stuff, great fun.

(and did you expect a comment on the Keith Jarrett KÃ¶ln Concert art work
ressemblance?)
