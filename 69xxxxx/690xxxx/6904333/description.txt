This lesser-known Canadian B & W  1/2 hour adventure series from 1959 called 
" Hudson's Bay " starred 2 familiar American TV actors: reliable Barry Nelson 
in his only regular weekly leading role (as Jonathan Banner) and George Tobias 
as his French business partner Pierre Falcon.   George was best known for 
playing neighbor Abner Kravitz for all 8 years of " Bewitched "!!

The action takes place in the early 1800s.

The series was sponsored by Hudson Bay Fur Company, which started in Canada in 1670. They're still in business today, but were purchased from the British by Americans in 2005.
