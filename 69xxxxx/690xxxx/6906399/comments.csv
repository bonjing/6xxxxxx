days episode but what happened was I was listening to it and started noticing they were replaying alot of the same clips from the previous episodes and I thought it was  Best Of the week so I stopped the recording.

I'm still not sure what it is because there is repeats like Will Ferrall and Tracy Morgan but there's also clips that they didnt play yet.

Whatever it is I had to wait for a replay to get the end of it and by that time I was super busy for Christmas weekend.   So I focused on Best OF 2011 first and I will post fridays SNL special soon."
