eTextbook of "Vertebrates: Comparative Anatomy, Function, Evolution, 6th Edition" by K. Kardong (c2012). Large bookmarked, page-numbered PDF file (139 MB) complete with table of contents, glossary and index.

NOTA: With almost all illustrations/diagrammes being streamed contents in the PDF structure, lossless compression of the file (to reduce data transfer and download time) produced only infinitesimal results. The original PDF file is therefore the one torrented.

Once your download has finished, _please_ seed this torrent as often and for as long as you possibly can.
