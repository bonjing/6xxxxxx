Storyline
Louis C.K.'s new video released Dec. 10 for $5 though his website
www.louisck.net

Louis CK: First of all, this was a premium video production, shot with six
cameras over two performances at the Beacon Theater, which is a high-priced
elite Manhattan venue. I directed this video myself and the production of
the video cost around $170,000. (This was largely paid for by the tickets
bought by the audiences at both shows). The material in the video was
developed over months on the road and has never been seen on my show
(LOUIE) or on any other special. The risks were thus: every new generation
of material I create is my income, it's like a farmer's annual crop. The
time and effort on my part was far more than if I'd done it with a big
company. If I'd done it with a big company, I would have a guarantee of a
sizable fee, as opposed to this way, where I'm actually investing my own
money.
