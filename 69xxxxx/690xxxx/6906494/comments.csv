,derce927,2011-12-29T06:44Z,thanks for the info.. looks like it played perfectly.. vuze converted automatically into another format.. i tried a few other mkv video files and looks like only larger files like movies 700mb to several GBs and certain hd resolutions didnt work on my xbox after being converted.
tandard"" format.

I make these MKV's into a PS3/X360 ready MP4 in a minutes time using YAMB and it doesn't convert anything; only takes the audio and video tracks from the MKV and puts them in an MP4 container. It's the exact same A/V quality and size. It's marvelous.

Simply run YAMB.
In the Creation section double-click on the create MP4 selection.
Drag & drop the MKV into the Input are of the window.
If there's any subtitles uncheck them since they won't work on a PS3 or X360.
Click Next...
YAMB will extract the h264 video and AC3 audio
and mux them back together in an MP4 container.

Finished in a minute for short shows like this up to 10 minutes for full length movies.

Note YAMB is freeware. Google it. No need to search for it on TPB.
MP4's only work for X360 if the audio is 2 channel.
PS3 can have up to 5.1 audio in an MP4 (neiner neiner :P).
If using Win7/Vista YAMB will have to be Run as Administrator.
Using large fonts for you display is not recommended.
MKVToolnix is required for extracting.
If uninstalling YAMB people have reported losing ALL Start Menu icons.
Make a back up copy of them before uninstalling.
