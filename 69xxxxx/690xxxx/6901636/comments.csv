an QC fan, started reading it circa 2009, but never started from the very beginning, and since I wanted to read it on my tablet, without being online, I downloaded all the comics with a might recursive wget. Anyways, my point is those who might find these torrent will certainly already know the website and read it every day, or, if not, will want to (because it's already near #2100 comics)."
