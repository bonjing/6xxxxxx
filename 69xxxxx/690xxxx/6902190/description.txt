I downloaded the complete, 6 episode, 1st season in .mkv format but it 
would not play properly for me. My VLC player usually plays .mkv files okay 
but not these ones for some reason. 

So (after a lot of trial and error) I managed to convert them to .avi and 
make them very watchable. 

For anyone else having the same problems, enjoy!


PLOT:
     A Cold War relic returns amid fears of terrorism but turns out to be  
     a forgotten Soviet space mission. What it brings back will have      
     implications for the entire world. (IMDB)
