1: Mount ISO with mounting software such as a Daemon tools (http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/products/dtLite)

2: Install it.

3: Install the patch included!

4: Extract the crackarchive(ASSASSINS.CREED.V1.02.ENG.VITALITY.NOCD.ZIP).

5: Copy the crackfiles to the assassins creed folder and replace the files that are 
already there. You should find the folder under ubisoft in your program files.

6: Play, and if there are any problems, just ask on tpb or google it!

Hope it works as well for you as it does for me! If it doesn't please don't rage and leave a comment instead!

Thank you.
