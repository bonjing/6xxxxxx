Gutter Rainbows is the fifth solo album from American hip hop artist Talib Kweli, released January 25th 2011.

REVIEW extract from ology.com
"The free early net release says enough about Talib's philosophy at this point in his career, and the quality of the album is a statement on his endurance as an artist in a highly competitive and changing industry. Though the test of time has not been set, I'll take the chance of saying that Gutter Rainbows contains ready-made classics that will undoubtedly become highlights of Talib's career. It's album you can listen through without skipping a track, and a sound that resonates so powerfully that it's difficult to enter a new song without first exiting the last. 

Sumology: an undeniably colorful album that is rife with diversity; on par with the solo Ear Drum, and an applaudable follow-up to last year's Reflection Eternal collab Revolutions Per Minute."

I downloaded this one orriginally in FLAC format, and when I looked at the time I couldn't find any in mp3 format so I converted it and made the torrent enjoy. I should be doing more of these.  Enjoy.
