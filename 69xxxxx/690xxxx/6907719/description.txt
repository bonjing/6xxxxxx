XBOX World Magazine (UK) - February 2012 

The ultimate unofficial magazine for all Xbox gamers with the latest news, best reviews 

and features. Plus every issue comes with a double sided DVD packed full of HD content. 

Sister title to the Official Xbox 360 magazine. We do things differently. We finish games 

before we review them. We never forget how much games cost. We don t approach 

sections like news, and communities like Xbox Live, in the same way as everyone else. 

Oh, and we make better jokes than the competition. Some might even make you laugh.
