Synopsis:
Dil Deke Dekho, a 1959 romantic comedy film, was Nasir Hussain\'s second film as director. His first directorial venture was Tumsa Nahin Dekha (1957), which became a big hit and which gave star Shammi Kapoor a new image as a comedic, dancing hero. Husain and Kapoor reteamed here. Asha Parekh, a former child actress, made her film debut as a heroine. This was also the debut film of comedian Rajendranath (younger brother of Premnath.) This is also music composer Usha Khanna\'s first film.

The film became a hit at the box office. Husain, Kapoor, and Parekh would reteam again for Teesri Manzil (1966), which also became a big hit. Husain would also cast Parekh as his leading lady in five other films. Shammi Kapoor had said that he had initially wanted Waheeda Rehman to play his leading lady in the film, but the producer had already signed Asha Parekh, and he encouraged her during filming.The film was released on Asha\'s 17th birthday.

Plot:
Neeta is a heiress, the only daughter of U.K. based Industrialist, Jagat Narayan. She is of marriageable age, and is presently wooed by Kailash, Chandra, and Raja. She prefers Chandra over Kailash and Raja, but subsequently changes her mind and falls in love with Raja. Things take a dramatic turn when Jagat and Neeta find out that Raja is not who is claims he is. When Raja defends himself, and calls himself Roop, his very own mother denies this claim, and instead states that Chandra is Roop, her only son. Raja alias Roop must now make attempts to prove himself, and realizes that this is indeed an uphill task.
