Release Notes for the Release Candidate of siduction 2011.1 - One Step Beyond
Where it comes from
We are excited to present to you the first release candidate of siduction, a new distribution based on our great mother Debian's Unstable branch and forked from aptosid. As the logo suggests, this is a community approach. Filled with life, that means for the community as well as with and from the community.
When we set out in July of 2011 to fork aptosid, we were not quite aware, how much work lay ahead of us. The first part of the way was setting up a new infrastructure, before we could actualy start working on the packages. Most of us had to learn many new things to pull this through, and here we are.
