  Captain Paul Watson has been on a crusade to save the oceans for 40   
  years and he isnt about to stop now. Through the life and            
  convictions of this notorious activist, Trish Dolman crafts an epic   
  tale of the birth of the modern environmental movement, and the       
  founding of Greenpeace and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society.     
  Part high-octane adventure, the film follows Watson and his crew as   
  they hunt down a Japanese whaling fleet in the vast expanse and       
  stunning beauty of Antarcticas Southern Ocean, and seamlessly        
  segues in and out of a wealth of archival footage from decades of     
  confrontational activism around the world. In-depth interviews with   
  Watson, Bob Hunter, Patrick Moore and Farley Mowat, among others,     
  capture the heroics, the ego, the disputed tactics and the urgency    
  of Watsons mission.
