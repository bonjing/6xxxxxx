Far beneath the majesty and splendour of the Paris Opera House, hides the Phantom in a shadowy existence. Shamed by his physical appearance and feared by all, the love he holds for his beautiful protÃ©gÃ©e Christine DaaÃ© is so strong that even her heart cannot resist.

In celebration of 25 glorious years, The Phantom of the Opera marked the occasion with 3 sell-out performances at the Royal Albert Hall. This lavish, fully staged production of Phantom of the Opera at the Albert Hall stars Ramin Karimloo as The Phantom and Sierra Boggess as Christine. They are joined by Barry James as Monsieur Firmin, Gareth Snook as Monsieur AndrÃ©, Liz Robertson as Madame Giry and Wynne Evans as Piangi together with a cast and orchestra of over 200 and some special guest appearances. Complete show with special finale.
