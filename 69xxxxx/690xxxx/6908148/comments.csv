And, I Think There would be Two Possible Reasons Why They Choose ""Marylin Theme"" As:

EITHER,

The Photographer(s) Is Not So Smart & Having Lack of Insights To Imagine New Themes. Well, I Know That's Just a Busted.

OR,

As, Everyone Knows Marylin Monroe as The All Time Great Actress & To be In Her Pose(for Such A great Magazine ) is Worth Honor For Every 'other' Actress/Model .

And Abut Pussy Shots,

I Can Only Say If There Would be Pussy Shots in It Then I Would Never Upload It Under My Name Instead I'd Share It As an 'Anonymous'.

  { It's Actually Not A PORN Stuff That's just NUDE Pics. Instead }

Thanxx Again. For Your Feedback thats' Really Very appreciated.

y shots.  That's to be expected, I suppose, but it's still disappointing.  

I really wish she'd gone to FTV instead.  At least then we'd have some beautiful, natural pictures that bring out Lindsay's personality.  Of course, there's no incentive for her to do that -- I doubt that FTV would have paid her close to $1 million."
