Life's Too Short - Series 01 - TVrip - Xvid




Mockumentary written by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant in which Britain's pre-eminent dwarf actor Warwick Davis plays a spoof version of himself.

 With his career on the slide, a massive tax bill caused by his useless accountant, and a wife who's divorcing him, the showbiz actor has no choice but to open his doors to a film crew 24/7. Maybe living his life like an open wound will get him back on top? The film crew charts Warwick's every move as he tries to maintain his pride and self-respect in some very unusual situations.

 Warwick plays a fictional version of himself where he is desperate, conniving, fame-hungry and self-centred, but always gets his comeuppance.

 He runs a talent agency, Dwarves For Hire, for small people but is always taking the best jobs for himself.

 Being a "showbiz dwarf" creates many an unusual situation for Warwick and he is constantly trying to use this to his advantage - it's just a shame that nobody recognises him without his costumes...

 Gervais said at the Banff World Television Festival earlier this year: "It's the funniest thing we've ever done." He added this comedy is "pure funny" without the pathos of The Office or the drama of Extras. "Warwick, in real life, is an actor and runs a company so we are taking that and skewing it. We are giving him small man complex, making him jealous, manipulative and self-obsessed."
