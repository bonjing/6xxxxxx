There are various snapshots including one with only sql server, another including  Share Point Server, another including Visual Studio, other with all prerequisites for AX, another with AX, and finally with al post instalation steps of AX


As i see the license code for AX will work until 31 Dec 2011 but i am sure you can find another license file on internet to activate the installation.


You can run this with open source VirtualBox.
