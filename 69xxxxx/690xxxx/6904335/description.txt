PLOT:
For Tes (Akerman) and her two cohorts Kara (Nikki Reed) and Dawn
(Deborah Ann Woll), the job sounded simple enough: intercept a
double-cross drug shipment for their crime boss Mel (Willis) at an
isolated diner. But when an unstoppable chain of events unfolds
everyone soon realizes no one is who they seem and the job may be
something other than eliminating the competition. What started as
simple instructions has now turned into a deadly cat-and-mouse game
with large guns pointed at everyone
