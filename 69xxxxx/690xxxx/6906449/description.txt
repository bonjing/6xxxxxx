This is Blackstreet's "No Diggity" track in FLAC with the following modifications:

The track's beginning and endings have been corrected for individualization purposes. A process to rebuild lost dynamic range due to digital clipping has been applied. This process halves the volume of the original. In addition, backmasked censorship has been reversed, causing a noticable artifact at the end of one instance.
