Late, Late Show host Craig Ferguson heads to the Bahamas for the adventure of a lifetime: swimming with sharks! But as he gets closer to actually jumping into the water, he starts to worry.He has always loved Shark Week.But when he gets the chance to get off the couch and be in the show, he gets in way over his head. Discovery wants him to go to the Bahamas to swim with, touch and if he has the guts feed sharks.


Ferguson starts to have second thoughts about getting close to the apex predators of the sea.Especially since he will not have the protection of a cage. Everything Ferguson sees and experiences reminds him of what he has learned from watching the Discovery Channel. 


Woven into Fergusonâ€™s journey are clips from the scariest, most exciting moments of the last 20 years of Shark Week. The results are funny, scary, and ultimately very moving. Terrified of getting in the water and too proud not to, Ferguson makes the leap into an ocean full of hungry sharks.He's in for a surprise when he finally gets underwater.
