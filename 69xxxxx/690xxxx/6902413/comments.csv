Overall very nice footage underwater and superb quality.Stories from different people that encountered the Great White.Though it's a scary predator that Craig Ferguson has to meet,he manage to make me laugh hard with his jokes,(simply hilarious).A well worthy download,which i'm sure you will enjoy:) "
