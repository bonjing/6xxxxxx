,darkmanmd,2012-02-23T22:07Z,"Agree, the Up is great! But am having trouble convertiing the M4V's into any other format suitable to burn to DVD. I lose the English Subs in any Program I have tried. 

Note, I can see and hear all of the original M4V with perfect quality using VLC. When using VLC under ""video option-select track -english. But when the M4V is converted .avi using Xilisoft Ultimate Converter, or DVDFAB QT8 the once available VLC Option to Select trach English goes Poof. The option is no longer there. Thinking were the subs not able to be seen in VLC I have not gone further to try to burn to DVD. So that result remains unknown. Using WinXP SP3.Attempting not to overload by trying to convert one file at a time. Any clues from the original poster or anyone else that might find the time would be greatly appreciated. BTW looked all over for correct subs as well (no joy) Sooner would be better than later as my wife is aqq bit over weight and I'd like to place her on the couch instead of my lap! (nah not really, but there must be a solution to be had. As I said, any help at all .... thanks heaps..dmr"
