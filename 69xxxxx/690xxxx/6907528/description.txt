Storyine: Vacationing college students fight a shiver of sharks after traveling to an island getaway and being surrounded by the ferocious man-eaters in this sun-soaked shocker from director David R. Ellis (Final Destination 2, Snakes on a Plane). The moment Sara (Sara Paxton) and her friends arrive at her parentÃ¢Â€â„¢s Louisiana lake house, the party is in full gear. Everyone is swimming in the salt-water lake and having a blast until Malik (Sinqua Walls) loses his arm in what initially appears to be a tragic wake-boarding mishap. Determined to get him to the nearest hospital as quickly as possible, MalikÃ¢Â€â„¢s friends fire up the speedboat and hit the water full throttle. It isnÃ¢Â€â„¢t until theyÃ¢Â€â„¢re far from shore that the reality of the situation finally dawns on them â€” the lake is teeming with hungry sharks, and a tiny speedboat isnÃ¢Â€â„¢t about to stop them from getting their next meal. Suddenly, a severed arm is the least of their worries. As the feeding frenzy begins, Sara and her pals realize that their only hope for survival is to swim for their lives and reach the beach without becoming fish food.
