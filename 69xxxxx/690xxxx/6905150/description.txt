Drumkick! Radio Complete Recordings


This is my first torrent!

I stumbled upon Drumkick! Radio shortly after it came to air.
I'm from Canada and the radio station is both posted online in German as well as broadcast locally.
I would download all the latest mixes the same way I would weekly listen to Essential Mix back in the day.

It's a beautiful mix of Alternative, Hip-Hop, Jazz, Funk, Downbeat, Techno and Drum'n'Bass

Recently Drumkick! Radio went off the air. I decided at that point to collect and post 100% of there content.

In this package you will find all of Drumkick! Radio's sets that I downloaded from: 
http://www.drumkick.de/
They're in a rar that's been split every 100mb.
This way if there is a problem, you can only re-download the rar that's messed up. Also the files have a bit more integrity as a result.
Also the files stopped being seperated with the 57th show.
This is how they were released.

They were from between 14.11.2003 and 17.07.2010.


You can listen to everything on here first to get an idea: 
http://www.mixcloud.com/brayaz/


You will also find Brayaz own music in it's own rar file.
His music can be freely obtained from: 
http://www.brayaz.de/
Other sites: 
http://soundcloud.com/brayaz 
http://www.discogs.com/user/Brayaz


All of this music is/was freely available at the two above websites, but I've collected it as a torrent.
MP3/128KBs bitrate for the most part.

Sorry if you don't like this torrent, but I wanted to post this awesome music.


Ignore the ugly filenames, I've taged everything by hand in mp3tag for iTunes :)


I've included a tracklist.txt to know what's in this collection before downloading.
