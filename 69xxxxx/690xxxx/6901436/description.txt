Release Information

In World Gone Sour, gamers will take on the miniature role of a lost Sour
Patch Kid in a stylized human-sized world, guiding the hero through the
sticky floors of a movie theater, across the counter of a concession
stand, and other unique and oversized environments. Joining forces with
fellow lost Sour Patch Kids, players will use a combination of jumps,
twists and puzzle-solving to negotiate and overcome larger than life
obstacles. Along the way, they will battle unusual candy enemies, escape
from deranged humans, and face-off against bizarre creatures including
one very angry wad of sticky chewing gum
