This book includes phrases for every situation, including expressions for describing art that make one sound smart and cool. Use sweet words to entice a local beauty into a walk along the Seine, and less-then-philosophical rebuffs for those overly zealous, espresso-fuelled cafe 'poets'. There are enough insults and swear words to offend every person in France without even speaking to them in English, which they really dislike.Nobody speaks in strictly formal address anymore. Not even in France, where the common expressions tossed around in cafes are far from text book French. This all-new, totally-up-to-date book fills in the gap between how people really talk in France and what French language students are taught.

Next time youâ€™re traveling or just chattinâ€™ in French with your friends, drop the textbook formality and bust out with expressions they never teach you in school, including:

â€¢Cool slang
â€¢Funny insults
â€¢Explicit sex terms
â€¢Raw swear words

Dirty French teaches the casual expressions heard every day on the streets of France:
â€¢What's up?
Ca va?
â€¢He's totally hot.
Il est un gravure de mode.
â€¢That brie smells funky.
Ce brie sent putain de drole.
â€¢I'm gonna get ripped!
Je vais me fracasser!
â€¢I gotta piss.
Je dois pisser.
â€¢The ref is fucking asshole.
L'arbitre est un gros enaele!
â€¢Wanna try doggy-style?
Veux-tu faire l'amour en levrette?
