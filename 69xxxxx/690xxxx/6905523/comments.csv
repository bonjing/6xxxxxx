ce? Do you know what Highres is? Why the admins of TPB created more sections in the movie category, and what separates them? I think, Xtinguish observation is legit, and it doesn't diminish the encoder/uploader merits, but it is a simply remark, that this upload should be in a different section. Do you think that AMIABLE or Test_Verify need an ass kissing advocate?"
