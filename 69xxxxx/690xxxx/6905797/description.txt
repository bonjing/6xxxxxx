So I downloaded randomly one read pdf/ebook by Sam Fryman and liked it.

When I went to download some other titles neither torrent or Sam Fryman website people have linked to in previous torrent comments worked (http://www.geocities.com/thmlplx/) apart from one blogspot with the same name/type of stuff... http://www.blogger.com/profile/16150794642032898419

As a measure of making sure it stays alive I created a torrent file using uTorrent and uploaded here to PB. My thanks to Piratebay and Sam Fryman.

The pdf I have read so far and so the only one I can recommend is called:
\\\\\\\"The Truth about Obsessive Compulsive Disorders - Sam Fryman\\\\\\\"
I agree a lot with what is said and anything in general with making aware of one\\\\\\\'s self means we can all just have a better, clearly life.

The rest of the pdf\\\\\\\'s are up to you to decide + seed for a little while if you can before deleting/moving the files.
