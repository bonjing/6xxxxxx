The Great Treehouse Challenge
This new three-part documentary charts the admirable efforts of three communities, from Paignton, Surrey and Scotland, as they try to create the ultimate environmentally friendly community space. The participants are solely responsible for the proposed use, design and construction of their respective treehouse. Help is at hand in the form of Charlie Luxton (DIY SOS, I Own Britain's Home), an architectural designer who's passionate about the environment, sustainable architecture and eco-friendly design. Which residence will you be rooting for and, more importantly, will the locals give them the thumbs- up?
