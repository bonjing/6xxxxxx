American World Pictures and Bron Studios have released the first images from Steven R. Monroes â€œJabberwockyâ€, which just completed production and is now headed into post. Monroe is coming off the remake of â€œI Spit on Your Graveâ€, and previously directed the films â€œIt Waitsâ€ and â€œHouse of 9â€³, both of which I found very decent. â€œJabberwockyâ€ looks like a swords-and-monsters fantasy movie, and co-stars Tahmoh Penikett (of â€œBattlestar Galacticaâ€ fame) and Kacey Barnfield (recently in â€œResident Evil: Afterlifeâ€).

Jabberwocky chronicles the story of a young squire (Michael Worth) who, alongside his brother (Tahmoh Penikett), must become a warrior to save his people and the woman he loves (Kacey Barnfield) after a horrific beast is unleashed on the Kingdom.
