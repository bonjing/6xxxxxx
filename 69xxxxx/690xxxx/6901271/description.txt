REVIEW:

Kitakitalu is a fantastic comedy movie. The director EVV has done an excellent job in presenting a good theme in most impressive manner. He well succeeded in presenting the story with more comedy bits. The story is good and has a good theme. Nareshâ€™s performance as a husband to a very fat lady is simply superb. The story is like this. Naresh , the hero of the movie wants to marry a slim and beautiful girl. But unfortunately he marries a stout girl upon pressure of his family members. But he doesnâ€™t like his wife and ignores her all the time. He accidentally meets a beautiful girl in the hotel where he comes for honeymoon. He fells in love with that girl and lag behinds her. But when his wife came know about this matter, she solves it very intelligently. You must watch the movie to know the wife saved his husband from another girl. I like all the characters from this movie. This is all time comedy movie. I am very much happy with this movie.

Rating:9/10
