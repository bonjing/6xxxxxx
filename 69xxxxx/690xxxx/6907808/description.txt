After recovering from her alternative rock days in the Drop Nineteens as well as the minor catastrophe of Hot Rod, vocalist Paula Kelley took her guitar and moved on to front Boy Wonder in 1995. Along with the backing of Josh (bass), Bruce (drums) and Aaron (guitar), the Boston quartet took on a poppier style of '60s-influenced bubble-gum pop that reflected the Beatles as well as fellow Bean Town residents Blake Babies. By 1997, Boy Wonder captured their sound through Roadrunner Records upon the release of their first album Wonder Wear. But upon the 1999 EP Break the Spell, Boy Wonder disbanded in January of 2000. Kelley went on to start a solo career as well as collaborating with guitarist Aaron to form the Boy Joys, while Josh took on the bass position for Astroslut.
