SCARED proudly presents: 

Videograss Shoot The Moon 2011

The Moon was closer to the Earth this March than it has been in nearly 20 years. 
With the power of the cosmos, and that ghastly large moon, the VG crew scoured 
the world on a relentless search for snow, new tricks, and new spots. Our 
journeys landed us in Japan, Sweden, Whistler, Boston, Alaska, and everywhere 
in between. This is certainly not the disco party snowboard video you are 
used to...Just pure snowboarding, personality, and progression the way 
it should be...Expect some mind numbing parts from your favorite guys 
on snowboards - Shoot the Moon!
