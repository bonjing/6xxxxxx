Mark Beaumont of BBC Music gave the album a positive review by saying, Just as comedy actors, no matter how massive their crowd-draw or how enjoyable their movies, stand a popsicle-in-Hell\\\'s chance of ever winning an Oscar, it\\\'s virtually unthinkable that the second album from Liverpool\\\'s The Wombats will grace the higher echelons of any end-of-year polls or the Mercury shortlist. They cross too many boxes â€“ they\\\'re shamelessly radio-friendly and insanely melodic, they have a \\\'wacky\\\' name and theyâ€™re simply too popular/ist to garner much of a credible critical vote. On the contrary, that scraping sound you can hear is the widespread music media dragging their shovels towards This Modern Glitch intending to bury â€“ largely unheard and with extreme prejudice â€“ the leading exponents of what the trolls have deemed \\\"landfill indie\\\".
