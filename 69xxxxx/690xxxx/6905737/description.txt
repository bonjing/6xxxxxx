â€¢ Skirmish AI tweaks:
o Tries to defend all owned town (previously the AI focused on its starting town)
o Previously if a hero stronger then the AI's hero threatened a town, the AI hero let that town undefended. Now the AI calculates all of its nearby hero's army and creature growth and defends the town if it finds it possible
o Always defends the last owned town if it can causes reasonable losses to the attacker hero
o Huge speed improvement, AI thinking is approximately 2-3 times faster than in the previous version
o Further improvement of cooperation among primary and secondary heroes
o Improved exploration and target priority
o Pre-calculated army contraction. The AI calculates how many creatures can the target collect (including possible creature growth) before the AI's hero can reach it and calculates if it is worth to chase it.
o Further improvement of Town portal usage
o In case of an FFA the AI tries to attack and capture towns from a weaker player
o FIXED: Sometimes the AI attacked a much stronger hero than itself
o FIXED: Sometimes without reason the AI split its army into 2 and lost against a stronger hero
o FIXED: Sometimes the AI miscalculated the cost of a town portal and spent too much points before trying to use it (resulting an undefended town)

o FIXED: Several smaller bug fixes
