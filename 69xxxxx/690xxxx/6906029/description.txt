Electric Dreams is a soundtrack album from the film Electric Dreams, released in 1984

Several popular rock and New Wave musicians of the 1980s contributed original music to the film's soundtrack. It was available throughout Europe but remained unreleased on compact disc in the U.S. until September 1998. Until then it was only available as an import.

The song "Together in Electric Dreams" by Philip Oakey and Giorgio Moroder was released as a single and became an international hit in 1984. It was later featured in their album Philip Oakey & Giorgio Moroder (1985). It is still regularly played live by Oakey's band The Human League to this day and remains one of their most popular live songs. Another song, "Video!" by Jeff Lynne, was also released as a single (with a non-album track, "Sooner or Later", as the B-side) but it wasn't as successful.

The song "Love Is Love" by Culture Club was released as a single in 1985 in Canada, Europe and Japan. The single went top 3 in Canada, top 10 in Japan and was Culture Club's biggest hit in Brazil.
