Tony Bennett celebrated turning 80 in 2006 with this television special created and directed
by Rob Marshall [Chicago, Memoirs of a Geisha]. In this docu-musical the viewer is taken
on a musical journey of Tonys life via a re-creation of the seminal venues of his career.

From 52nd Street swing clubs to the Columbia recording studios where he first recorded, from
the classic TV studios of the 60s to the Rat Packs Las Vegas stage and from Carnegie Hall
to his triumphant performance on MTV Unplugged, Tony is paired with some of todays greatest
artists to perform duets of his greatest hits, including Barbra Streisand Elton John, John
Legend and Christina Aguilera.

These performances are seamlessly woven throughout with narratives by Billy Crystal, Catherine
Zeta-Jones, Bruce Willis, John Travolta and Robert De Niro.
