A stunning masterpiece from Swedish composer Magnus Birgersson who once again takes us by surprise and delivers a wide, lush and electric 10th album. Until we meet the sky has a an intensely cinematic sound; from introspective, wispy and intimate ambient electronica it slowly builds up to a shoegazing spirit engulfing the listener in an ethereal dreamworld. An album of dizzying beauty composed by Solar Fields as a one track story in twelve phases from nightscapes to the sky. Deep and addictive.â€
