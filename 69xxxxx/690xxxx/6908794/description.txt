21 is the second studio album by English recording artist Adele. Released on 24 January 2011 in the United Kingdom and most of Europe, and on 22 February 2011 in North America, the album was named after the age of the singer at the time of its production. 21 shares the folk and Motown influences of Adele\\\\\\\'s debut album 19, also named after the singer\\\\\\\'s age, but was further shaped by the American country and southern blues music she encountered during her 2008â€“09 North American tour, An Evening with Adele. Composed in the aftermath of the singer\\\\\\\'s separation from an unnamed partner, the album typifies the near dormant tradition of the confessional singer-songwriter, and explores themes of anger, revenge, heartbreak, self-examination, and forgiveness.
