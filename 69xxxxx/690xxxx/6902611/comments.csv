I usually wait until there's at least a few seeds to be accounted for before posting it on the demon so it looks healthy and active since that site doesn't work well with updating public tracker status.

I don't like MKV's but some people use shitty media players like GOM which don't like x264/AC3 in MP4's but will play if in a MKV.

Personally I prefer having a PS3 ready MP4, but with more people downloading from me I gotta go about the ""standard"" format for 720p.

I make these MKV's into a PS3 ready MP4 in a minutes time using YAMB and it doesn't convert anything; only takes the audio and video tracks from the MKV and puts them in an MP4 container. It's the exact same A/V quality and size (within a couple MB). It's marvelous.  "
