                                      Norbit (2007)



Norbit (Eddie Murphy) has never been particularly easy. As a baby he was left on the steps of a Chinese restaurant / orphanage where he was taken care of by Mr. Wong (Eddie Murphy). It just gets worse when he is forced to marry the wicked, junk food guzzling Rasputia (Eddie Murphy). When things look darkest for Norbit moving his childhood sweetheart, Kate (Thandie Newton), back to town.

Comedy "Norbit" shows that nice guys do win in the long run



Enjoy the movie folks! =)
