How to Live on 24 Hours a Day," a classic personal time-management book originally published in 1908 has inspired generations of men and women to live deliberate lives. The arguments are witty and thought-provoking and ultimately persuasive, and the humor, though subtle, is effective. The author has an authoritative yet pleasant writing style that preempts rationalizations about why it wonâ€™t work. Not just another collection of timesaving tips, "How to Live on 24 Hours a Day" is more of a challenge to leave behind mundane everyday concerns, focus on pursuing one's true desires, and live the fullest possible life. Reflection, concentration, and study techniques make it easier to accomplish more truly rewarding undertakings than anyone ever dreamed possible. This book was recommended as a 'must read' in Dale Carnegie's 'How to develop self-confidence and influence people be public speaking' course. Though written a century ago, "How to Live on 24 Hours a Day" addresses the inadequacies, frustrations, and disappointments of people today in all walks of life--and it does so with humor and wisdom. A daily dose of this small work is at least as nourishing for the brain and soul as a multi-vitamin for the body. When writing this little book, Arnold Bennett created a classic of its kind, a self-help book that really helps. While it is hard to imagine that such a short book could be so persuasive, it is truly a classicâ€”and an early precursor to many others that have attempted to demonstrate how time is our own and ours to manage and expand our boundaries of our selves. In the thirty minutes it takes to read, you will be left forever vigilant, and will never sit idle, unless you consciously choose to sit idle, while you ride a train, wait for plane, or drive home from what once may have been a routine. Read it, study it, and live again.
