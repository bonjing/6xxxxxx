*INFORMATION*
*************
Gears of War is a futuristic third-person shooter emphasizing tactical action over run-and-gun battles. Players are thrust in a climactic clash between what's left of humankind and a swarming underground race called the Locust Horde. The main protagonist is Marcus Fenix, a once disgraced soldier looking to redeem himself by leading a ragtag squad against the monstrous threat.Since the alien army vastly outnumbers the team, players must use the post-apocalyptic world to their advantage, such as seeking cover behind dumpsters, pillars, cars, rubble, and other objects. The developer has adapted its award-winning Unreal technology to create interactive environments with a physics-based damage system. Players, for instance, can shoot down structures to forge new routes or opportunities to trap the enemy. Up to three squad mates will accompany Fenix in each mission, with basic commands such as "advance," "hold," or "freelance" available to guide them.A behind-the-shoulder view similar to the one employed in Capcom's Resident Evil 4 is the default perspective in Gears of War. Weapons include an assortment of grenades, pistols, assault rifles, and other long-range blasters, many of which offer a means to engage enemies in melee combat. The Locust Horde is not averse to lunging, rushing, or gnawing at soldiers, so players have the opportunity to perform grisly finishing moves by quickly tapping specific button sequences during close encounters. Cooperative support for two players is offered throughout the campaign, and players can battle each other in team-oriented modes via Internet connection.

*************
*Extra Notes*
*************
The game has a lag issue where it will lag every couple of seconds.  This appears to be more of a issue with AMD proccessors.
This is not a release issue or anyones faults but the games and People Can Fly (the people who ported it).  The game is 100%
up to date, version 1.02.  The update was suppose to fix the issue but for whatever reason it doesn't seem to work sometimes.
The game is precracked.  No videos are rencoded and the game doesn't need to be rebuilt like BlackBoxes, but just installed.
This results in the bigger size but doesn't take NEAR as long to extract.  The game is also fully precracked so install and play.

I tested this on multiple computers.  Sometimes it would not run automatically from Startup.exe so I launched IT ONCE with Wargame-GFWLive.exe and then exited the game through task manager once the splash screen appeared. Then it will run everytime from Startup.exe.  The game will not launch properly from Wargame-GFWLive.exe so only do it once if needed.

The instructions to get the GFWL key works 100% so I will not be helping people get keys.  If it doesn't work for you then I recommend looking on youtube for a tutorial on how to get a key.

If you don't want to play online then it is as easy as installing the game and making a offline account. :)
