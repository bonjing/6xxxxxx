Your 64 Magazine Complete Issues 01-14 (April 1984 - October 1985)

Your 64 was a short-lived magazine published by Sportscene Specialist
Press, and was the sister mag to the better-known Your Spectrum. It's
similar in style and scope to YS: lots of great technical articles with
some gaming content. It was published seemingly erratically at first,
before settling down to a monthly schedule in 1985 before being absorbed
into "Your Commodore".

These PDFs are the complied collections of page scans already available.
They've been OCR'd to allow text searching and copying - this should
prove very useful for the retro archivist who'd like to have their own
local searchable archive. They look great on most PDF readers, including
the iPad.

The OCR software has done it's best, but has struggled with some of the
more unusual fonts and layouts used. Also, paragraph formatting is a bit
random at best.

More OCR'd scans will be periodically available - please check
retropdfswordpresscom for more information.

Thanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum site
(wwwworldofspectrumorg), and ADJB and everyone else on the WoS forums
for help and advice.

90's style "greets" to anyone formally or currently involved in the
Amiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat
Will, mUb, Johann and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD
Grapevine. Nostalgia ain't what it used to be ;)
