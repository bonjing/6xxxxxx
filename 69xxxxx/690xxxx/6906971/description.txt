Little Jimmy Dickens - Country Boy [1949-1957] 4CD

Bear Family Records. Relase: 1997. With Covers & Discography


Country Boy is a four-disc import box set that collects Little Jimmy Dickens' complete Columbia recordings from 1949-1957 including most of his biggest hits, several sacred recordings, a handful of instrumentals, and much more. Dickens' music from this era vacillated between silly hillbilly novelties and maudlin weepers, which might sound like a jarring mix but actually makes for a more engaging listening experience when digesting a huge set of this sort. Dickens was an adept ballad singer but, because of his physical appearance, wasn't taken as seriously as he might have been. On the novelties, with his trademark twin electric guitar sound and humorous rural sensibility, Dickens made some of the most fun and funny music of the '50s. Country Boy unearths a number of excellent unreleased performances and stands as a well-deserved tribute to a beloved figure of country music. ~ Greg Adams
