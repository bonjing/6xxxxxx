will keep in Mind..."
L's except the last 2 episodes? I understand the rush to release and wanting to be the first to get the season pack out, but it would've been only a matter of hours before E12 and E13 became available.

I'm not complaining by the way, I've got all these already (including last episodes in WEB-DL) from tehparadox week by week. Just seems a shame its not all WEB-DL.

Again, kudos anyway - i'm not trolling."
