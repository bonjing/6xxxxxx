Adobe Photoshop 7.0 can be run under Windows NTÂ® for Intel compatible systems only. It will not run under other types of Windows NT such as Windows NT for DEC Alpha or Windows NT for PowerPCÂ®.

Adobe Photoshop 7.0 requires Windows NT Service Pack 6a or higher.

Many files installed by Photoshop - such as TWAIN support files and MSVCRT*.* files 
(Microsoft runtime files) are shared with other programs. When you install or 
uninstall other programs that use these shared files, the file versions used by 
Photoshop may be overwritten or deleted. If you experience problems with features 
that depend on shared files, reinstall Photoshop

Initialization and Preferences Files

You can find the Photoshop 7.0 preference files in the following locations:

Windows 98: 
Windows\Application Data\Adobe\Photoshop\7.0\Adobe Photoshop 7.0 Settings

Windows NT: 
WinNT\profiles\<username>\Application Data\Adobe\Photoshop\7.0\Adobe Photoshop 7.0 Settings

Windows 2000 and XP:

Note:  The Application Data folder is a hidden folder and not visible by default.  If you do not see the Application Data folder, go to Windows Explorer>Tools>Folder Options>View and check the option View Hidden Files and Folders.

Note: Many preferences are now in the Windows registry.  To reset your Photoshop preferences you can hit Shift-Ctrl-Alt upon startup.  

Installation Requirements

When installing Photoshop to a hard drive other than your system or boot drive (usually C:), you will still need to have at least 65-70MB free on your system drive to proceed with installation, regardless of how much space is on your installation drive.
