As you move your phone, the games view changes so you feel like you're really there. Realistic 3D fish can be seen swimming beneath the waves when they are close and will often jump to give away their location when farther away. When you see a big one just flick your wrist to cast. Pull back on your phone to hook a fish and fight it as you reel in your catch. After you catch a fish you can take a picture to view later or share with friends!
The full version has 10 locations.
