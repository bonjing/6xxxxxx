*****************************************************************************

*A practical guide to the control of reactive power systems
*Ideal for postgraduate and professional courses
*Covers the latest equipment and computer-aided analysis

A definitive new guide to the control of active and reactive power, featuring the latest developments including FACTS

Power Electronic Control in Electrical Systems offers a solid theoretical foundation for the electronic control of active and reactive power, providing an overview of the composition of electrical power networks; a basic description of the most popular power systems studies; and coverage of the roles of Flexible Alternating Current Transmission Systems (FACTS) and Custom Power equipment.

Developments in power electronics have opened up new ways in which power control may be achieved not only in high-voltage transmission systems but also in low-voltage distribution systems, and the coverage of these developments makes this new book on active and reactive power control in electrical power systems essential reading for advanced students, engineers and academics alike.

Within this book the fundamental concepts associated with the topic of power electronic control are covered alongside the latest equipment and devices, new application areas and associated computer-assisted methods.
