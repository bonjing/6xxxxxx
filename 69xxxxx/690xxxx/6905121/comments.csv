i used crack on the previous versions but my crack didnt work any more because the instalation replaced the exe with a new one (the previous instalations didnt do that) and there is no v105 crack yet when i put the old crack from mz USB there it crashes and this szstem doesnt work so Pirates wont be able to play until someone makes a crack"
