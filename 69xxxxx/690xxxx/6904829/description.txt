Throughout history, tidal waves have drowned us, storm surges have sunk cities, and hurricanes and cyclones â€“ fueled by the ocean â€“ have blown away all in their path. Today, science forecasts that the oceans are getting fiercer, rising up to reshape our coastlines and create untold devastation, social unrest and economic crisis. 


UNDERWATER UNIVERSE tracks the history and evolution of the ocean's seven deadliest zones â€“ locations that throughout history have been the direct causes of human devastation by floods, tsunamis, hurricanes, whirlpools, ice, underwater volcanoes, and shipping graveyards. Using expedition footage, 3D animation, and commentary from leading oceanographers, UNDERWATER UNIVERSE helps depict the awesome cosmic and geological fluctuations that make the oceans deadly over time. 


See how, with advances in navigation, engineering, and meteorology, people today have learned to avoid some of these catastrophes. But our sophisticated technologies have also created new threats, and the possibility that our own actions are making the oceans deadlier is becoming greater.
