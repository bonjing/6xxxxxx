CRF encoding maintains a constant quality across episodes by adjusting the required file size (bit-rate) to maintain the desired quality. Some scenes/episodes need a higher bit-rate than others. CRF...file sizes never too little and never too much...constant high quality across the board.
The high profile x264 settings provide greater compression, while maintaining the crf-18.5. i.e. CRF-18.5 at lower x264 settings would have the same quality, but would result in larger files.
