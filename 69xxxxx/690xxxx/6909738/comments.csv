I thought of including the ac3 5.1 track along with the dts track, but it seemed extraneous as most reviews I read preferred the dts.  But that is certainly subjective, open to personal taste.

Both of the dvd versions are letterboxed-widescreen 2.35:1.  However the new remastered version has anamorphic widescreen and the previous older one (without dts) is not anamorphic...not the other way around (http://www.digitalbits.com/reviews/x-filesfightthefuture.html) or (http://www.amazon.com/X-Files-Fight-Future-Widescreen/dp/B00005221O)

I don't plan on doing Firefly.  While I thought it was a great series (damn these networks for squashing great sci-fi shows after just one season), I generally don't do shows that have bluray versions available.  As you know, I'm into quality not quantity...and bluray is just about always better than even a great dvd rip.  If there's a good sci-fi show that only has 350mb xvid versions of the show, and no bluray counterparts, those are the types of shows I usually do.  Atlantis is an exception since so many people have requested it over time.
