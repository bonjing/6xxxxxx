The Emperor Wears no clothes by the legendary JACK HERER.   One of the most important books written on Cannabis & the farsicle situation surrounding its legal status.   This is one of the original renegade publications with regards to this subject.  Also included is an Australian suppliment, outlining how Australia was primarily settled as a HEMP (cannabis) colony.  (the convicts grew it for the British war machine)
