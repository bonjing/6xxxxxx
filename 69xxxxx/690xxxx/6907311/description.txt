Both of these clearly written titles discuss the geography, geology, ecology, economic uses, and future of these ecosystems. The first title details the wide range of desert types from the hot and sandy to the cold and foggy coastal variety. Tundra includes both the polar regions and the peaks of the Earth's highest mountains. In addition to the topics mentioned, the glacial biological and human history of these ecosystems are covered. The texts, though somewhat dry, are well organized. The authors go well beyond the standard descriptions of these biomes, providing significant information to enable readers to understand both the beauty and value of these areas. Numerous sidebars; captioned maps, diagrams, and scattered charts; and high-quality color photographs of plant and animal life are included. The bibliographies of print and electronic sources are helpful, although some of the works listed in Tundra are dated. Comprehensive and valuable for research.â€“Eva Elisabeth VonAncken, Trinity-Pawling School, Pawling, NY
