Review by Mr So Much:
 
In this self released album, DJ Hiatus delivers a beautiful and lyrical feast of sweaping electronica and deftly blended world beats. Melancholy at times but always soothing, Hiatus takes us on a journey, falling in love, breaking up and moving on. It's bitter sweet in places but always finds a bit of humour and manages to raise your eyes up to the sky. This reviewer had to turn the lights off and listen in the dark - something which hasn't happened for a long time. Like getting hugged by a sunset. If you've been missing Lemonjelly and dZihan and Kamien then this is for you.
