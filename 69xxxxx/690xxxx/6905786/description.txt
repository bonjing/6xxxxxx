Overview:

Prepare yourself for a grand adventure! UltimaÂ™ IV, sixteen times larger than UltimaÂ™ III, is a milestone in computer gaming. Lord British has produced a game to challenge not only your physical and mental skills, but the true fabric of your character.

The evil triad of Mondain, Minax, and the hellspawn Exodus have been vanquished and peace reigns throughout the land of Britannia. Evil yet abounds, but in isolated pockets and in the hearts of men. A new age awaits the coming of one who can conquer evil on all frontiers through mastery of both magic and the use of force. Daemons, dragons, and long-dead wizards still plague the countryside and must be destroyed. The seeker on the path of the Avatar will face hostile groups composed of mixed enemy types and will survive such encounters only by strategic use of weapons and terrain. Earthly victories over seemingly impossible odds lead to the final conflict, where the ultimate challenge - the self - awaits.
