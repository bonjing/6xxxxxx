Synopsis                 : The newest version of AdobeÂ® PhotoshopÂ® CS5 software 
redefines digital imaging with breakthrough tools for photography editing, 
superior image selections, realistic painting, and more. And now, use it with 
creativity-boosting mobile apps.

How to Extract           : Install, select your language, 
launch 'AdobePSPortable.exe'.

Additional Plugins/Pack  :
â€¢ 3D Invigorator (v5.07)
this is probably my most favorite plugin EVER! This is the tool i use to create 
3D Text, Titles, Logos, etc. Presentation/1st impression is an important aspect 
of graphics/design. This plugin will help you easily create 3D titles, text, 
etc. Unlike most plugins, you will actually use this! For more info. refer to 
screenshot or visit: http://www.digitalanarchy.com/3Dinvig/main.html
â€¢ Frischluft Flair Plugin Pack (v1.23)
Flair brings 8 high quality effects, among them shine, glow and sparkle effects.

â€¢ Talk-Mania Styles, Gradients, Color Pallete/Table, and Actions.
â€¢ Grafpedia Styles, Gradients, Color Pallete/Table, and Actions.
â€¢ and other personal Styles, and Actions from my personal collection.
* I did not just install these additional plugins, but i tested for 
'Stealthiness' to ensure nothing is left behind.

How to Install More    :
â€¢ You can install more plugins by installing into:
AdobePSPortable > App > Photoshop > Plug-ins.
â€¢ Same goes for Styles, Actions, Filters, etc.. just install to corresponding
folder in AdobePSPortable > App > Photoshop.
â€¢ Fonts: install on PC and Photoshop will detect. I highly recommend a font
manager so you don't have to install on your computer. I use 'Nexus Font' 
(freeware) because it's 'Stealth', and 'Portable'.!

Optional               :
â€¢ You can delete any language you don't need to save a few mb of space.
Navigate to: AdobePSPortable > App > Photoshop > Locales.
â€¢ You can greatly enhance Photoshop's performance by adjusting the RAM in 
settings.
â€¢ If you experience slow startup, check your plugins, you may have too many.
