Afterlife is a study about the great question, â€What happens when we die?â€ Answers to this question are examined in a study of the near-death experience (NDE) and the inescapable conclusion is reached, that there is no need to fear death: There is an afterlife. This is a profound statement and this documentary presents evidence which director Paul Perry and researchers Raymond Moody and Jeffrey Long believe will support this conclusion.



This and other questions about the afterlife are scientifically explored through modern research into near-death experiences. Through interviews with noted researchers like best-selling author on the subject: RAYMOND MOODY MD. PhD. And JEFFREY LONG MD., and testimonials from people that have had near-death experiences, and featuring re-enactments, this documentary explores the evidence of the afterlife using insightful interviews, case studies, event re-creactions and rich rendering of classic spiritual art on the subject. Afterlife is a provocative and inspirational examination of the science, and evidence, of life after death.
