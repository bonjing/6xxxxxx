Made from the 1080i MPEG-2 .ts file. This is 2-pass encoded to x.264 and is compatible with XBOX360 and PS3! The volume has been normalized to a very loud level while making sure there is no clipping.

All done on a P4 hyperthreaded 3.4 GHz machine haha!

Equally great quality at a smaller size!
