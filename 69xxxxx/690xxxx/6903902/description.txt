Synopsis:

In 1980, a young scientist named Victor DeNoble was hired by a major tobacco company. Fourteen years later, he was testifying in front of Congress that, despite the sworn testimony of the industry's chief executives, nicotine was addictive... and the research he did could prove it. ADDICTION INCORPORATED tells the incredible true story of how one of the most important whistleblowers of our time dropped a bombshell on one of America's most powerful industries- a bombshell that still reverberates today. If you think you know the story, if you think you know the science, and if you think you know Big Tobacco's next steps, this incendiary documentary will prove you wrong on all counts.
