Doomsday has returned in these tales from ACTION COMICS #900-904! The monster that once Superman's life in a battle that destroyed half of Metropolis is back for another round with the Man of Steel. Writer Paul Cornell (Doctor Who, KNIGHT AND SQUIRE) pens a tale that not only puts Superman in a fight for his life, but in a fight for the life of Superboy, Supergirl and all members of the Superman family.
