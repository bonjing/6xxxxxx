MIDI & Sylenth1 Presets - 13.75 MB

'That Hau5 Sound' from MS Records returns with the second installment of their best-selling 'Hau5' series. This is more progressively focused and introduces you to 15 fully ready progressions. Including Sylenth1 Lead, secondary lead, arpeggiated pluck and FX presets.


The follow up to 'That Hau5 Sound' takes you deeper into the world of Music Production. More in-depth chord sequences and complex note placement give you the power to see how the professionals achieve their floor-filling sounds.

MS Records know that in order to better understand how to write killer progressions, you need more than just pre-made loops. This is why they provide you with everything you need to make tracks like those demonstrated in the demo; right down to the exact presets used.

Product Contents:

â€¢ 21 MIDI files
â€¢ Sylenth 1: Lead preset
â€¢ Sylenth 1: Secondary lead preset
â€¢ Sylenth 1: Arp pluck preset
â€¢ Sylenth 1: FX down shift preset

Not only does this give you the ability to study, hands on, how to write great sounding progressions, but it also lets you easily manipulate the already written progressions into brand new songs with a totally fresh sound.

No external FX are used in the demo. That means no EQ, no compression or other effects. What you hear is a drum track and the presets playing in sylenth1. MS Records wants to give you, as best as possible, an accurate representation of what you'll hear right out of the box.

This pack is an essential for any serious House producer. If you're new to music production or even if you're a seasoned producer, this pack will provide you with a rich learning environment.

All tracks and presets provided in this pack can be used, sampled and reproduced royalty-free after purchase.
