Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Thursday, December 22 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with Don Browning, a K9 unit police officer for OKC who found many living and dead in the Murrah rubble and had the courage to testify before the OK County Grand Jury and stand up for police officer Terry Yeaky, who was murdered under suspicious circumstances. 

Alex also talks with Holland Van den Nieuwenhof, the writer and producer for A Noble Lie, a documentary exposing the official lie behind the Oklahoma City bombing. 

Alex also covers the latest news and continues to look into evidence that the government is activating FEMA camps as the economy nears the periphery of destruction.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
