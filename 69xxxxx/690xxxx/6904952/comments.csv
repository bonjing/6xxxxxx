As I said before aware of installation guide !
it's very clear written :
windows xp !!!! not 7 8 and ... 12"
it Alcohol 52 (the version provided in torrent is a bit unstable at least on my machine) so I've downloaded from 
http://alcohol-52.en.softonic.com
Otherwise everything works whit this torrent but pay attention to instructions !"
