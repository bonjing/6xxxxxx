Storyine: From the writers of Fireproof and Facing the Giants comes a story about four law enforcement officers whose lives are deeply tested as they embrace their calling to serve and to protect. As crime fighters, they must face danger every day. Yet when tragedy hits close to home, they are left wrestling with their hopes, their faith, and their priorities as men. Like iron sharpening iron, the power of their friendship invites them to face their hidden struggles as fathers. It is out of this honesty that comes a life-altering decision. With action, drama, and humor, the fourth film from Sherwood Pictures embraces GodÃ¢Â€â„¢s promise to â€œturn the hearts of fathers to their children, and the hearts of children to their fathersâ€. Your soul will be stirred and your heart will be challenged to beâ€¦Courageous.
