I dunno which timezone you are in (+8 -- +11), but this episode was released 2011-12-20 20:29 GMT. That is in worst case 2011-12-21 07:29:05 GMT+11, i.e. same day early morning.

Isn't that good enough considering that aren't supposed to see the episode until 16:00 GMT+11 on the web or 17:15 GMT+11 first airing?

Btw can't you just play the episodes same day in evening directly from svtplay. se ?"
tense (even sad at times) a good mix - good blend with massive acknowledgement of the producers who managed to squeeze in so much within 15minute episodes - I'm sure this one will go down as one of the greatest calenders in the Swedish calender tv ear history books
