,NOPE123,2012-03-03T00:12Z,"I have just tested both the ""Update 4"" and ""Update 5"" from Reloaded, and I can't get any of them to work with SKSE. I did a fresh install of Razor1911's Skyrim copy, and installed the update on top of this. But I still get ""Please update to the latest version of Skyrim"" when using skse_loader.exe. 

Has anyone gotten this update to work with any versions of SKSE?"
