iCleanup - abbreviation for iTunes Cleanup, to clear iTunes duplicates.


as iTunes Cleanup is for cleaning iTunes library like an iTunes duplicates cleaner and iTunes duplicate remover. iCleanup also find out song tracks that lost file locations in iTunes library.

iTunes library always generates lots of duplicated tracks when we have run iTunes for a long time, or sync with mobile phones and iPods. iTunes provides a way to show all duplicated tracks by choosing from menu "File-&gt;Display Duplicates", this gives us a way to choose and delete tracks one by one. iCleanup is such a iTunes duplicates remover app created for doing the deletion job. As an easy to use iTunes duplicates cleaner, iCleanup finds and sorts duplicated tracks in iTunes library , and check tracks to be deleted automatically depends on reasonable algorithm. If you want to keep iTunes library clean, try iCleanup.

iClean also checks songs with no music file associated ( called lost tracks ), and delete all these tracks that lost file location in batch.

To the \"United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users\",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intentionally 
posting fake comments & files. Their meaning is just trying to spread 
confusion and to frustrate TPB and it\'s users. 
Less downloaders = less seeders = less download speed etc = not good! 

It\'s in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intentionally keep posting fake comments & files. It\'s an easy answer against 
those who intentionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That\'s for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let\'s just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what\'s said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the \"United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users\"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
