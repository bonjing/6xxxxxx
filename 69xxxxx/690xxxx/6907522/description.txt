Bonnie and Clyde - Outlaws of Love DVDRip [1993].avi

The legend of Bonnie and Clyde is immortalised in a spectacular triumph of period sets, memorable performances and stunning stars, led by beautiful Racquel Darrian and the sultry Ashlyn Gere. It's Paul Thomas' most ambitious production since his ground-breaking film Sinderella. And if our Bonnie & Clyde have their way, they'll follow Sinderella all the way to number 1. With a bullet.
