Synopsis                 : Adobe Audition CS5.5 software delivers the 
professional tools you need to make your video and audio productions sound 
their best. Handle a wide range of audio production tasks efficiently, 
including recording, mixing, and sound restoration.

How to Extract           : Install, launch 'AuditionPortable.exe'.

Notes                    :
â€¢ I use a 64-bit Operating System, thus i tested for 'Stealthiness' on XP, 
Vista, Win7, and 32/64! Most people don't realize different Operating Systems
may leave trash at different locations & names.
â€¢ If you're into audiophile/flac/lossless quality audio like me, then you know
verification is very important. A very important tool that helps is Audition's
'Spectral Analysis'. I like it over others because of it's accuracy, features,
options, and the professional output. 
â€¢ Of course.. Audition is more than a 'Spectral Analysis'.. it's a professional
audio/video production suite.
â€¢ I posted a portable NSIS version a while ago but i highly recommend you
upgrade to this. PortableApps.com Format (PAF) is faster, lighter, cleaner, 
and follows a strict specification. All the source/code is included to ensure
nothing malicious has been encoded.
