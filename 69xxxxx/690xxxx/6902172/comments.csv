on ThePirateBay and no comments?

OK I'll bite:

V:9
A:10

XviD format, which I prefer given the broad device support.  Excellent video quality given the resolution, same files I had collected seperately.

The reason I like these rips is that the dynamic range is not so wide as to be inaudible at lower volume settings.  I get good audio with the main system turned up, but can still hear what people are saying (mostly) when trying to keep quiet at night.

I hadn't bothered getting the deleted scenes, so I'll be enjoying this.  I notice several WMV files in there, so...

Thanks LegendET for a very useful PACk!"
