NOTES

With your bow and arrow or gun in your hand, binoculars slung round
your neck, decoys in your pocket and a dog at your side to obey
your every command, progress in one of three hunting environments
(marshland, fields or  forests) and learn to identify each species
(those that can and cannot be hunted) with its favoured
territories, habits and behaviour. Proximity, noise, weather
conditions and wind direction are also factors that you must take
into account when you plan your hunting strategy while adhering to
all the current hunting regulations.
