                           DESCRiPTiON 

 The cook and food writer celebrates well-loved festive dishes, cooking a sea 
 bass starter, a roast duck feast and a party trifle. In addition to preparing 
 dishes inspired by memories of his family, he gives a makeover to his father's 
 annual contribution to Christmas dinner - a casserole. He also creates a winter 
 slaw inspired by the Slater holiday cheeseboard, and accepts an invitation to 
 venison supper in a Scottish castle, where he invents a new cocktail to toast 
 the special occasion.
                    
                                 Enjoy!
