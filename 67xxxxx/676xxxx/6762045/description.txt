DO YOU BELIEVE IN MIRACLES!?!?

Relive arguably the most exciting sports moment of all-time, as a young group of American college students triumphed over the heavily-favored Russian veterans enroute to the second US Gold Medal in Olympic hockey.

The United States team, made up of amateur and collegiate players and led by coach Herb Brooks, defeated the Soviet team, who were considered to be the best ice hockey team in the world at the time.

Team USA went on to win the gold medal by winning its last match over Finland. The Soviet Union took the silver medal by beating Sweden in its final game.

In 1999, Sports Illustrated named the "Miracle on Ice" the Top Sports Moment of the 20th Century. As part of its 100th anniversary celebrations in 2008, the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) chose the "Miracle on Ice" as the century's number-one international ice hockey story.

This torrent contains an ESPN Classic rebroadcast of the game, as well as the 1990 HBO Documentary featuring interviews with players and coaches (American and Russian) and media that lived the excitement firsthand.

Enjoy and please seed so that everyone can witness this epic moment in sports history...
