this is Koreans first 3D Movie, and a very good looking alien movie with cgi effects on mass at a oil rig. very promising and lots of alien and 3d effects inside the movie.
Audio is KOREAN, had the movie some while but no useful subs till now.
was a loads of work to get them in sync, now they are in place. had to retime a lot to fit on that stream.

Quality was good, still added sharpness,brightness,rgb and denoise
got very nice
