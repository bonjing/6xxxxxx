,DrMD,2011-10-26T17:54Z,"This movie sucks monkey nuts, what a POS stupid translation subs makes everyone sound like a fucking retard which 90% of the characters actually are. This is one stupid-ass monster movie with some of the most ridiculous scenes ever filmed. 
A/V=9 M=3 This is exactly the kind of crap you'd see on the SyFy channel.Don't waste your time."
,Bauirjan,2011-10-27T06:06Z,"Hi .BONE., I 100% believe that you are one of the ""superest"" users. Thanks for the upload. And I have one request: could you, please, upload screens of the movie so that visitors could see the quality? Thanks once again. You rock! :-)"
,Bauirjan,2011-10-27T06:08Z,"I think that Koreans shoot very good movies. And whoever thinks they suck, sucks himself. Don't judge by appearance, but do judge by one's inner side and feelings.  "
