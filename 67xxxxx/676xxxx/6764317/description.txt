SYNOPSIS:

Most of us have no idea where our money is. The only sure thing is that it's not in the bank to which we entrusted it. The bank has submitted it for circulation in the global money market.

After "We Feed the World" (which is still seeded here), Erwin Wagenhofer presents his new film Let's Make Money, following the tracks of money through the world-wide finance system, and points out the consequences of our greed for money.
