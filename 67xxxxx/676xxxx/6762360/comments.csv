They are actually a very well-to-do nation with a good economy and as you also pointed out, it is a very beautiful place. You are also right as far as the cruelty to there prisoners of war and there history of being a rather aggressive people. 

To be fair on that subject, No country wants to get into the argument that they (whatever country it is) treated people better then some other country). If you go back in time to the right era, I can't think of ANY country/nation, a people, a city-state, an empire, or whatever,  that at one time or another were practicing EVERY atrocity you can name. So, in reality, the entire world at one point committed many many terrible things. One would hope that by now, those kind of horrors would eventually be stopped. Sadly you still hear about people getting kidnapped and forced into prostitution, or forced into an engendered servant type of situation, terrorism, the list goes on."

,dlarrym1111,2011-10-24T23:58Z,"@rdkt11: You are so wrong. Did you make it through High School?? Your observation of a family next door to you is a few people of the 450,000,000.00 people in the US. That is 450million people. So you really think your observation of 2 or 3 people or .0000000009% of the US population is what you think applies to the other 449,999,997.00 people. Thats not a very sound theory you have going for you. Thats like saying, -For Example: If I saw 2 Japanese teenagers throwing rocks at a cat. Can truly come to the conclusion that because I saw 2 Japanese being cruel to animals that it means 50% of ALL Japanese are also cruel to animals. This is what you are saying. See how totally stupid you sound. What society is 100% free of having some over weight citizens anyway?

rdkt11, If you are such a butt buddy with Mr.Yamamoto and want to defend him. Take a stab at coming out of this with even a HINT of being on the ""right"" side of things. Lets mention Japans fucked up statistics.  yearly Dolphin slaughter.

For the first time ever, in 2010 -2011, Cove Guardian Activists from Sea Shepherd Conservation Society and Save Japan Dolphins were in Taiji every single day of the dolphin slaughter, which ran from September to March...yet the tragedy continues...

The activists witnessed day after day, week after week, month after month, as pods of dolphins were hunted and driven into the Cove by fishermen using high-tech gear. Terrified and exhausted, the dolphins were systematically and brutally bludgeoned to death. Dolphin calves swam in their mothers' blood. By the end of the 2010-2011 ""drive hunt"" season, 850 dolphins were killed in the Cove. Another 171 were sold into captivity after witnessing the murder of their families.  Even more so then other primates, Dolphins have a larger Brain to Body size then even us, homo-sapiens. Despite continued requests year after year, from: USA, Great Britain, Canada, Germany and other countries in the UN, to stop this in-humane treatment of these Dolphins, The Japanese continue this ritual slaughter. The fact that the Japanese refuse to let anyone document this on video and if anyone tries, they are driven off by armed individuals. If these actions don't TELL the rest of the world that they KNOW it is wrong, what will it take.? If these Japanese politictions think it is fine, and good way to act as a steward of our oceans, WHY hide it? If it is NOT wrong??. 

Only rapists and murders and other criminals HIDE there activities. Strange to hide this when the japanese feel its OK, The japanese, as criminals do, also hide there slaughtering of Dolphins. If it's ok, what do they have to hide? They are trying to appear normal. Eating a dolphin is like cannibalism and NOT normal. Having an entire cove on your coast line totally red with blood for miles isn't NORMAL. The Japanese press has compared us killing cows for food as being the same as them killing the dolphins. The HUGE difference is that WE DON""T HIDE THIS FACT that we eat beef by killing cows. , Why do the Japanese try to hide it like it isn't happening? It is because they KNOW it isn't right and it is there own SHAME that causes them to cower and hide. Besides COWS haven't SAVED men lost at sea, Dolphins have. Dolphins have a comparable intelligence to ours. Its like the Japanese would eat there own kids if they could.

I urge anyone to go to this URL and check this out.

Slow roasted dog is pretty good to. You need to marinade it for quite awhile though and then eat it warm with a nice chilli sauce.

dlarrym1111 have you ever seen a high tech slaughter house where the cows are on a conveyer belt, screaming, as they smell the blood of the animals infront of them being decapitated? Always puts me in the mood for a bit of steak every time I see it.

dlarrym1111... Did you know that pigs are more intelligent then Dogs? Does that take pork off the menu too? 


EAT, my children, EAT. Devour all, until only we remain. Strip the land of its bountiful beauty and wonderful creatures

,tharun_vt,2011-12-12T21:07Z,"Know wht ""Wish I was a fucking Alien tired of being a part of this crap society""

Doesn't matter which country / where ""We"" faggots belong to- For some Petty reason we find ways to hate each other.... The only thing history has taught us is -

Humans are pigs slaughtering each other for apparently the most trivial reasons (name 1 piece of land / geography that is not tainted with blood) 

The true enemy to a society / person is only another society or a person. 

Not asking u guys to love each other- just fuckin stop hating for others for no reason "
