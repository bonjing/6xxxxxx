Reggie and Ashley are on their way to surprise the campfire girls when a sudden accident strands them deep in the middle of nowhere. As Reggie wakes up from the blackout, she realizes Ashley is gone. The car isnâ€™t going anywhere and Reggieâ€™s phone is dead; the only sign of life is a small light emanating from a mysterious mansion.

Follow Reggieâ€™s search for Ashley whose only logical destination is the dark manor before her. Investigate the halls and their eerie surroundings, looking for clues and helpful items to solve the many complex puzzles located within. Will she find Ashley? Will they catch up with the campfire girls? Will Reggie realize that she is much closer related to the horrors of the mansion than she could have ever imagined?
