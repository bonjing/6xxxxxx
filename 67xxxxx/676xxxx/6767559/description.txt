Tom is back with an all new adventure! Tom is your cat that responds to your touch and repeats everything you say in a funny voice.

Since Tom is now an international celebrity, heâ€™s moved out of the alley and into a cool apartment.

But everything is not perfect for Tom, his neighbour Ben teases and pesters him constantly.

â˜…â˜…â˜… HOW TO PLAY â˜…â˜…â˜…
âœ” Talk to Tom and he will repeat everything you say with a funny voice.
âœ” Pet Tomâ€™s belly or head and make him purr.
âœ” Poke his head, belly or feet.
âœ” Slap Tomâ€™s face left and right.
âœ” Pull or touch his tail.
âœ” Press the fart button to see Ben fart and Tom grab his nose in disgust. After that Tom repeats what you say with his nose closed for a while.
âœ” Press the bag button to make Ben pop a paper bag and scare Tom. Itâ€™s hilarious.
âœ” Press the ? button to make Tom pull random items from behind his back.
âœ” Record videos of Tom and share them on YouTube, Facebook or send them by email or MMS.
