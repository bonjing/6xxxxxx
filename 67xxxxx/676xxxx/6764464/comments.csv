Clear audio throughout the movie.

Seen better, seen worse and someones stupid head at the down left corner of the screen. Who in this damn decade wears a tiara?

Bad, i mean...really bad. Don't waste your time with this. Cheap humor, bad story. Download the -93 version if you really like the story."

,gricardob,2011-10-23T19:18Z,Not worth the download.. better wait for a dvd rip.. specially if someones dumb head is in the left corner of the movie all the way.. but if you really cant wait to see it... then whatever.. i just rather wait for something better quality. the sound is shitty period.. 
,RedBusterd,2011-10-23T19:24Z,"a/v 7 as above comments.

as for movie... a very good story just hacked to total rotten waste. I would prefer to torment myself reading the book instead (i hate reading, not the story itself which is awesome).

@froggie100

I thank you for the in-depth video description so we can google various technical terms and so becoming smarter... thank you very much."
