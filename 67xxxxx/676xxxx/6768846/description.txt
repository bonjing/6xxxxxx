Oscar Peterson Trio - The Complete Cole Porter Songbooks (2010) 
320k mp3 from flac (musicfromrizzo) CD was published with 13 bonus tracks

This is the Cole Porter Complete Songbook by the Oscar Peterson Trio
This version of the CD was published with 13 bonus tracks to the version
being listed at amazon.com at present - although that may change perhaps
if this item is still to be offered by them as we go along.

I make this posting here to make the CD available as it isn't a total loss
at all to take a download I suppose. Jazz itself has the greatest potential
to transform itself as a genre as it has a certain semblance of civility and
of a decorum awareness(as it were)that is healthy in a sensible old fashioned
conscious society where nuances of polite discourse are encouraged with
background music that is intended to suit the occasion hopefully to do it
justice as it were.

That said, I have some beefs with Jazz as its currently implemented by all
too many composers and their artists per se.

I hate to have to point this out however there appears a clear and persistent
style within the Jazz community of what amounts to obfuscation of the essential
melody or song as it were into what become meaningless sounds instead - that
are simply "stringing you along" with all the essence removed sort of
decaffeinated coffee as it were - while you sit there waiting instead to be
awoken by some hint that there is beauty and great spirit in what you are being
made to listen to - only you already know the formula is doomed to fail as
without the caffeine the coffee will never be convincing as better tasting if
you want it for the effect its intended to have - a stimulant in fact and 
something with which to awaken the senses to better absorb reality than to
be lost in what is instead a fraud or perhaps simply a ruse when it need 
not be so at all.

When Cole Porter songs are sung to normal musical accompaniment as it were,
there are certainly some great tunes and great melodies and words in what is
the combination of what we call a great songs that are heard sung. Its Cole
Porter etc and its potentially great stuff of the genre of music from which
it comes.

On the other hand, witness the effect of the composer to Cole Porter's songs
in these Jazzy renditions by Oscar Peterson instead. Complete whitewash I say!

Jazz too often is implemented so that the original tune becomes retardedly
lost, with pauses in the music pace as its played in insane belabor, sounds
at times too inanely repetitive as to be an infliction onto the sensibilities
that once again defy logic of good sense (pardon the alliteration if you will
in my own comments here) and for the idea of being somewhat in a constant state
of "cathartic anticipation' yet never achieving any sort of climax as a tease it
all it turns out to be time and time again over decades of having to hear the 
genre in expectation that perhaps it has improved. Sounds that are dragged out
forever as though the composer hasn't yet made a connection to earth
and is beaming his rays from beyond as it were.

Perhaps Jazz should merge with Disco (just kiddin) - in fact the style of 
ballad singing in great old fashioned taste could simply be "jazzed up" somewhat
by the choice of the different sounds (staying within a range of what we are used
to however, from traditional showtune genre perhaps). So if you hear Danny boy
or The Sound of music - put to jazz - it should remain the real thing rather
than sacrificed to some other idea of good - a retarded rendition lost of all
meaning devoid of competence and integrity - simply pawned off on the contrary
by folks that have yet to be told - the emperor has no clothes on  when he makes
such choices and we should all have to go along. Jazz should no more retard
a song than having it put the piano in complete normal interpretation of the 
music at source.
