  a directory that contains special characters, such as (TM).
  If you notice any problems, rename your installation directory to anything
  that does not contain such characters and all your problems will be gone.

  2. Play the game.

Copied Crack: Yes
ATI Drivers tryed: 10.9 & 10.16

The problem i experience is when i start up the game i see the intro for a while then after a while it freezes and my AMD/ATI Driver crashes and i need to reboot my pc to get back into windows again. My PC does not overheat.

Is anyone else having this problem and does anyone know a fix?
