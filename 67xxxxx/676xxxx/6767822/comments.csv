BATTLEFIELD.3.LIMITED.EDITION



Battlefield 3 steps past the competition with the power of Frostbite 2, the latest version of DICE's high-tech game engine.

Battlefield 3 Limited Edition includes the Back to Karkand Expansion Pack, 4 classic Battlefield 2 maps re-imagined in the new Frostbite 2 engine

Strike at Karkand.
Gulf of Oman.
Sharqi Peninsula.
Wake Island.

Also features classic Battlefield 2 vehicles, weapons Which Can Be Brought back to your Battlefield 3 game, unlock, persistence and more!

Frostbite 2 is the foundation on which Battlefield 3 is built, and the game delivers superior graphics, massive destruction, dynamic audio and incredibly lifelike character animations. While the bullets wines, the walls collapsing in, and explosions throw you to the ground, feels the battlefield more lifelike and interactive than ever before. In Battlefield 3 players take the role of U.S. Marines, and may experience heart-pounding single-player missions and competitive multiplayer action in war zones around the world such as Paris, Tehran and New York.

Frostbite 2 - Battlefield 3 introduces the stunning Frostbite 2 technology that takes animation, destruction, lighting, and sound to new heights. The power from the super strong game engine deepens players' physical and emotional relationship to the world around them, in an unprecedented way.
Feel the fighting - Feel the power of bullets and explosions, for your wounded comrades to safety, and use your weapons from almost all parts of the terrain. Battlefield 3's incredible animation, spectacular graphics and realistic combat gameplay grabs your senses and allow you to experience it emotionally powerful warrior life in a whole new way.
Unsurpassed Vehicle Warfare - The best vehicle warfare online, is now even better with sound barrier-busting jets, leading an impressive set-up land, air, and sjÃ¶fordon.
Urban Warfare - Take tomorrow's wars to the iconic and unexpected places in the U.S., Middle East, and Europe, through the claustrophobic streets, city centers, and vehicle-friendly open spaces.
