,TorrentzNL,2011-10-28T11:27Z,Seed PLZ!!
[V],totomas1,2011-10-29T13:28Z,@TorrentzNL: Do you have any problems with the seeding? 149 distributors right now seems to be enough.
,Stroganoff_au,2011-10-29T23:15Z,"Great, thanks worked fine on Soft Modded Wii 4.2

BUT am stuck on how to make the cannon on the 2nd level of Pirates (the one where the barrel is in the net above the ground) Help!!"
,raffy836,2011-10-30T22:39Z,@Stroganoff_au You drag the burn pile under the net to burn it. The game keeps freezeing while loading the Monster's Inc. level... Anybody else having this problem?
