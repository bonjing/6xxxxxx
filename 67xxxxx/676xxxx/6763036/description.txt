Buying, selling, budgeting, and saving are fundamental business practices that almost everyone understands on a basic level. From them, more complex transactions are derived, and these constitute a realm of business that few people find easily accessible.

Featuring more than 800 entries, the two-volume Encyclopedia of American Business, Revised Edition is an up-to-date, easy-to-use guide to the nuts and bolts of business jargon. Difficult ideas are explained in straightforward language to help non-specialists, students, and general readers understand the complex and sometimes confusing concepts and terms that are used in business. Five general areas of business are covered: accounting, banking, finance, marketing, and management. This encyclopedia focuses on the terms, concepts, and associations that one is most likely to encounter in business, making it a great place to start learning about how businesses operate and what the primary and different features of specific business-related functions or ideas mean.
