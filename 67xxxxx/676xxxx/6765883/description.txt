Oh my goodness, it\'s the long-awaited new album from Sister City! Remember how you\'ve totally heard of them? Do you like punk music but don\'t really like punk people? Do you like indie rock but can\'t really grow a very good beard (mine refuses to connect to my mustache)? Perhaps you will like this album. It was done totally DIY, so donations are much appreciated. You can do so at http://sistercity.bandcamp.com
