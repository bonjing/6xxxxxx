,sparkybot,2011-10-25T12:48Z,"Yeah, will someone please say if it's real or fake?"
,Revolos55,2011-10-26T09:04Z,"A/V: 10/10, but it's an mkv file, so you might need a codec to play it in WMP."
,ahorwood,2011-10-26T14:12Z,"Thanks griffjam. I appreciate it even though it's only for my wife to watch.

cbratt11 I use GOM player, which works perfectly with MKVs, but so does VLC, also.

VLC comes with Matroska (.MKV) support, but some .mkv files may needs additional codecs. Try downloading a codec pack. You can google the ones on the list below. I use K-Lite, so I recommend that.

K-Lite Codec Pack [full]
XP Codec Pack
Cole2k Media Codec Pack Advanced
X Codec Pack"

,Lookingglass,2011-11-16T21:12Z,Sorry and thanks for effort but mkv is a pain in the ass - why does anyone use it?
