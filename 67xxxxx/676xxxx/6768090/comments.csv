You've spammed all the Paranormal Activity 3 torrents with your shitty movie link. 

Please go crawl in a hole and don't come out."

,neobomb,2011-10-28T15:00Z,Question - Does this one have all the footage from the trailers also?
,stunners0,2011-10-28T16:36Z,"dling now since u recommended. 

@neobomb, i dont think any of them do. Im sure i read that the trailer was made up of extra scenes therefore are not in the movie."
