,DMarine68,2011-10-24T21:27Z,"Still waiting patiently for a 100% (at 2.4%)...ha.  But the game is XDG3 and LT2.0+ is the only current firmware that will read this format.  So, even if your Xbox is banned you need to flash your DVD drive.  If you've updated the dashboard and lost your firmware...mod it again."
,littledoo,2011-10-24T23:04Z,holy shit this is downloading slow!!! keep seeding guys. this is a major release!!! and to whoever needs to know. this is XGD3 you need LT+ 2.0 firmware to play these newer games!!!........................all hail C4EVA!!!!

I am a mac-user that has been using ISOx360 for a long time at it has been working great. Just drag the  .iso file to the box and click burn after extracting the files. But with the latest three games (Batman, Forza4 and BF3) it does not work, it will not start burning. Does anyone now what this might be and what is the solution to it?

And one more thing, I just downloaded FIFA12, NHL2012 and Dead Island and they worked fine..

Thanks a lot."

Step 1:  Inspect your DVD burner for any dust or debris.

Step 2:  Turn on your Macintosh and wedge a small shim in the opening of your DVD burner.

Step 3:  Shoot yourself in the face :)"

,KingKool,2011-11-28T23:26Z,"C4E released the iXtreme LT+ v2.0 CFW for all versions of the Hitachi-LG GDR-3120L drive (â€˜PHAT Hitachiâ€™):

C4Eâ€™s iXtreme LT+ in association with Team Jungle & Team Xecuter

Official release of the iXtreme LT+ v2.0 for Hitachi drives
- Support for XGD3 ixtreme backups using LT-MAX for maximum capacity on standard DVD+R DL discs.
- Support for large capacity DVD+R DL media (no errors when burning)

About upcoming iXtreme LT+ 3.0 â€“ released after December 6th
Originals will need to be analysed by XBC to gain disc topology data. This data replaces the need for ap25/dae.bin data and enables any ap25 challenge to be answered correctly. The topology data method is very efficient using only 24k and is very accurate. Each title will need its own topology data as there are differences between titles, even xgd3 titles and backups can be detected if the same topology data is used between titles.
Backups will remain the same layout but will need the new topology data inserted by the new abgx or re-dumped with the new XBC for xgd2/ap25 or xgd3 titles.
Non ap25 titles will remain unchanged

Thanks go to Team Jungle for their hard work and efforts in the development process.
Thanks also go to Team Xecuter for their support to this project."

Which disc is multiplayer? "
,addi333,2012-05-27T18:52Z,"@ SpaceCadet6969754

Your post confused me... if it is as you wrote, then everything is as it should be. The game shipped originaly like this, with Disc 1 being HD content, Co-op and Multiplayer, while Disc 2 being Singleplayer content. If you wanna play Single only then Disc 2 is enough, but it will look better with the HD add on, which is located on disc 1. easy... "
