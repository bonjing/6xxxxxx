Prepare for full-scale war with Battlefield 3, the third major
evolution of the long-running online battle franchise. Using the power
of Frostbite 2 game engine technology, Battlefield 3 delivers superior
visual quality, a grand sense of scale, massive destruction, dynamic
audio and incredibly lifelike character animations. As bullets whiz
by, walls crumble, and explosions throw you to the ground, the
battlefield feels more alive and interactive than ever before. In
Battlefield 3, players step into the role of the elite U.S. Marines
where they will experience heart-pounding single player missions and
competitive multiplayer actions ranging across diverse locations from
around the globe including Europe, Middle-East and North America.
