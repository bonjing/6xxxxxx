This movie came recommended by my friends in China."
,mediums,2011-10-29T21:38Z,"ook im getting sick and tired of all you new guys putting crap and wrong comments on these sites ive been doing this for years and i know a good copy to a bad one
this movie is not 10/10 it more like 7 or 8
the reason why i say that is cause its a bit grainy in places great sound so dont worry about that. if you  watch the preview on you tube that's a 10/10. dont get me wrong its watchable but if you were a die hard fan of jet li wait for the dvd or at least till oneclickmoviez.com  has a better copy. pls start to rate these things better, for even the newer guys so they dont waste time or in my case bb, were im from we dont have unlimited as good as the rest of the world."
