,Silvak,2011-10-22T02:07Z,What are these the covers?  Pretty small file size.
,lapis2,2011-10-22T02:15Z,y not up these as a single torrent?
[V],Llama_Cookie,2011-10-22T15:32Z,"No, it's the comic book itself. And it would take too much time to upload all of them in one torrent. "
,ramikaz,2011-10-22T20:46Z,Thanks.
,lapis2,2011-10-23T02:56Z,so instead u clog up the site with individual issues?  and y would it take any longer?  I think ur fucking stupid.  I would think it would take less time to create 1 torrent than it does to make 30.  but whatever youre the fucking idiot not me I guess u know better.
,hoobamoob,2011-10-23T03:45Z,I have to agree. Bundle multiple issues together.
,sad4life,2011-10-24T04:35Z,"those who complain, why don't you go make torrents? yes you can't then shut the fuck up."
,vipeanut,2011-11-22T18:47Z,how the fuck do u open this kind of file? the heck is a .cbr?
,gizmogremlin98,2012-04-16T23:33Z,"thanx for the download. i am grateful that you put them here at all unlike those waste of space

,lg_ato,2012-05-30T16:10Z,"Not being ungrateful, but yes you should have bundled them. The files are not that big. Thank you anyway though for still uploading them.

.cbr is a comic book reader file. Look it up next time idiot."
