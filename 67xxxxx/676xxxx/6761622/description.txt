"Bad to Worse"

Harry represents Richard Cross, a recently 
fired biology teacher who claims he was 
terminated for failing a student for 
rejecting Darwinism. The case pits Harry 
against the overzealous Pastor who fired 
him. Meanwhile, Ollie helps a former flame 
accused of theft by fraud because she 
received lavish gifts from five much older 
men she was dating at the same time. 
Reluctantly, Ollie teams up with Adam to 
defend the serial dater, which all the men 
met through a dating website - one she 
owned and operated.

Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
