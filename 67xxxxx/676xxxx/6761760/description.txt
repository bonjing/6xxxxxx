Spinervals 27.0 - Threshold Test & Suffer Fest serves dual purposes. A great threshold building workout designed to boost your anaerobic threshold and sustainable power output for time trialing events including triathlons, this workout also functions as a repeatable 'field test' used by many prominent coaches and exercise physiologists to determine an athletes 'Functional Threshold', or that output of work (power) one can sustain on average over a 20 minute period. 

By learning one's functional threshold and retesting it every 6-8 weeks, an athlete can accurately determine the proper training zones as well as assess their training progress over time. This form of performance testing is critical for anyone interested in getting faster on the bike and achieving optimal results through a structured training program.
