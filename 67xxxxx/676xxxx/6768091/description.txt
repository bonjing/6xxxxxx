An updated, innovative approach to data structures and algorithms

Written by an author team of experts in their fields, this authoritative guide demystifies even the most difficult mathematical concepts so that you can gain a clear understanding of data structures and algorithms in C++.

The unparalleled author team incorporates the object-oriented design paradigm using C++ as the implementation language, while also providing intuition and analysis of fundamental algorithms.

    * Offers a unique multimedia format for learning the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms
    * Allows you to visualize key analytic concepts, learn about the most recent insights in the field, and do data structure design
    * Provides clear approaches for developing programs
    * Features a clear, easy-to-understand writing style that breaks down even the most difficult mathematical concepts

Building on the success of the first edition, this new version offers you an innovative approach to fundamental data structures and algorithms.

See it, learn it, do it...

With Goodrich, Tamassia & Mount's highly visual, applied approach to data structures and algorithms--now in C++!

Building on the extraordinary success of Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, 2/e, Michael Goodrich and Roberto Tamassia, together with C++ authority David Mount, bring you a new text covering data structures in C++. With this book, you will find a true C++ text, rather than a book translated from Java. Both the programming code and the appropriate concepts have been rewritten.

DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS IN C++ helps you develop a wide spectrum of valuable skills, ranging from sound algorithm and data structure design, to effective application of analysis techniques, to clean and efficient implementation and coding of design in C++. The authors' highly visual, applied approach and extensive suite of Web-based learning tools give you the opportunity to see visual justifications of key analytic concepts, learn about the most recent advances in the field, and actually do program design using data structures.

FEATURES
