,CzRMK,2011-10-23T13:28Z,"12 seeds, 1003 leechers. :-( "
,KwyjiboLinguist,2011-10-23T13:56Z,"Can someone comment as to whether this is fake like the one that's out there on other torrent sites that is supposedly by ""eztv""???"
,fizdude,2011-10-23T14:00Z,"Hi, can anyone please verify if the last ten minutes have sound on this copy?  It would be much appreciated."
,fizdude,2011-10-23T14:02Z,"There is a REAL copy doing the rounds but the last ten minutes has no sound.  So please let us know if you've downloaded this and if there is sound all the way through.  Would really appreciate the feedback. Pilot-leo, maybe you could tell us?  Thanks for the upload.  Cheers!!"
,Fangular,2011-10-23T14:25Z,Yeah.. I'm stuck on 46% - ETA: infinity. So close and yet so far! :-(
,Fangular,2011-10-23T14:36Z,"So if I ever succeed in downloading this episode and actually - finally! - watching it, I'll return to rate it."
,askewtos,2011-10-23T14:44Z,"This is a fake, this is just ep 12 repackaged as ep 13. Very disappointed!"
,trekky76,2011-10-23T15:08Z,This is NOT a fake. The quality is so so but it is ep 13.
,Cocottet,2011-10-23T15:09Z,"Come on people, this is not going to work if no one seeds. With close to 1600 leechers, imagine how fast this download would be if everyone seeded."
,hade26,2011-10-23T15:59Z,is this a fake or not??
,schmolch,2011-10-23T16:45Z,"Its real, has sound all the way through and i would give the quality a 7-8 compared to the usual 10."
,schmolch,2011-10-23T16:45Z,"@askewtos 

and Fuck you, you stupid piece of shit"
,octogirl_21,2011-10-23T18:27Z,I didn't have sound at the end...but it was at the end...better than nothing....if you don't want to watch it...don't. But don't shoot the messenger...I had been looking for a copy for two days and there are none to be had!  It is ep 13 part one.
,chcwu1202,2011-10-23T19:10Z,this is very real
,petfly,2011-10-23T19:25Z,"real and yes, there is sound at the end."
,caysea,2011-10-23T19:49Z,"It works through to the end for me, though the quality isn't ideal. (Still, poor quality is better than nothing at all. Thanks pilot-leo!)"
,tiramisubob,2011-10-23T20:44Z,"the last five minutes of audio is missing, but you can download the last portion of the episode with sound in-tact right here: http://www.magzcrib.org.uk/project-runway-s09e13-missing-audio-webrip-xvid"
,schmolch,2011-10-23T21:27Z,"There is no audio missing, there are just 2 or 3 very short distortions of 1 second length at most.
Maybe some of you should stop using Windows Media Player 1.0"
,tiramisubob,2011-10-23T22:03Z,"for clarification, i never downloaded this one, as it took far too long for such a popular show to get uploaded.  i commented on a few other posts about how to download it on another site.  in any case, thanks for your efforts, leo.  and yes, everyone should be using vlc player for all your media needs.  cheers!"
,sumisar,2011-10-23T23:26Z,"Took ages to download, but nothing wrong with the torrent."
,zahur,2011-10-23T23:32Z,"Thanks! 

@askewtos...what schmolch said!!"
,Fangular,2011-10-24T00:22Z,"I use VLC and I had sound at the end - a million thank you's to you, pilot-leo!!!"
,xushi,2011-10-24T19:32Z,Is it just me or is the quality TERRIBLE for this one?
,octogirl_21,2011-10-25T01:00Z,"@schmolch 

I use VCL and I did not have sound at the end, I don't have WMP on my computer. It didn't matter tho, no problem! 
Some of you guys floor me! I was charged a penalty of $60.00 last month on my cable so I could seed so other people could watch the shows I like. Who are you to complain about anything."
,lolo_666,2011-10-28T06:08Z,Thank you Thank you Thank you! but can you pleaaase upload episode 14 now? pleeeease?
