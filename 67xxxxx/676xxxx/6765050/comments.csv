You think you could do a nice 300-400MB mp4 of this. 
Cant find a good copy under 600MB and Yify's rip sucked bad.
To me this movie is not worth alot of space.
It would be much appreciated..... not that this isn't  ;)"

,Admirefly,2011-11-01T23:24Z,Treehuger - Ehh....buy a extra harddrive and/or a better connection. You can't expect everybody to take the time to compress down to that size....
