Two crooks stumble upon information that could ruin the lives of some powerful men in this allegorical political thriller from Slovenian filmmaker Vinko MÃ¶derndorfer. Sergej and Polde are a pair of hoodlums who break into a museum and steal a well-known painting entitled "Landscape No. 2." While making off with the painting, the pair also happen upon some rare documents and grab them as well. As it turns out, the papers are the item that have suddenly made their caper dangerous; the documents connect certain military figures to a war crime committed near the end of World War II. The surviving officers behind the ugly incident are determined to keep the story from becoming public, and they're willing to use any means at their disposal to silence Sergej and Polde once and for all.
