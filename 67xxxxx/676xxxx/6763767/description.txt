 Since the launch in January 2010, John OÄºCallaghanÄºs Subculture label 
 has grown into one of the most popular uplifting trance and 
 tech-trance labels of today. Known for its consistency and quality, 
 Subculture represents a sound that is both distinctive as well as 
 groundbreaking. The mastermind behind all this, is John OÄºCallaghan. 
 He marks the Subculture story of success with a yearly chapter of his 
 critically acclaimed Ä¹SubcultureÄº compilation, now heading for its 
 third edition, Ä¹Subculture 2011Äº. 

 In April, John released his third and most creative artist album, 
 Ä¹UnfoldÄº, including hit singles Ä¹Save This MomentÄº, Ä¹Talk To MeÄº, 
 Ä¹CenturionÄº and Ä¹Ride The WaveÄº. John isnÄºt only the winner of three 
 Ä¹Best DJÄº and two Ä¹Best ProducerÄº trophies by the Irish Dance Music 
 Awards, but also gets his weekly round of applause during his 
 worldwide gigs. If someoneÄºs got an keen ear for anything that gets a 
 crowd moving, itÄºs John. 

 Mixed and selected by the number one Irish DJ and producer, 
 Ä¹Subculture 2011Äº is there for the dedicated following of the label, 
 as well as those into its significant sound of energy, power and 
 feel. Including 4 sparkling new, exclusive originals and remixes by 
 John, as well as tracks by the likes of Neal Scarborough, Aly & Fila, 
 Will Atkinson, Giuseppe Ottaviani, Sebastian Brandt and many more. 
 John: Ã¶IÄºm so thankful to artists like Heatbeat, Tom Colontonio, 
 Chris Metcalfe, Full Tilt, Sneijder to name but a few Ä¾ for providing 
 me with very hard choices to pick for these releases! Along with the 
 events which we have planned for London, Dublin, Belfast, Newcastle & 
 LA Å¯ 2012 looks promising for Subculture!Ã¶
