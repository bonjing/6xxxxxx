,cheatsforme,2011-10-23T22:06Z,@ halo. This is probably because its without credits ? i do not know as i haven't seen it and this is the only copy on torrents atm
,Byron187,2011-10-23T22:40Z,"finally the real thing, works great, just finished downloading it and you're right it has no credits that's why it's 1hour18min"

,Exphailure,2011-10-24T00:05Z,"52.6%, pulling from 6 seeders out of a possible 1148... that sucks."
,IBlest,2011-10-24T00:57Z,Any change of speeding guys only getting 88.6 kb down and 328.88kb's up will seed after on me 100mb
,DWYoutube,2011-10-24T01:08Z,is this real????????
,Exphailure,2011-10-24T01:13Z,"Finished the download, pretty good copy, could be better during the darker parts of the movie. Audio sounds really nice, it doesn't have the ""empty can"" syndrome. 

However the movie starts are sort of weird to me, like it's in the middle of it, I'm not ready to watch it and I didn't want to spoil it so I just skipped around a bit. I suppose it's starting off where it's supposed to though, since it's got that ""documentary"" styled filming."
,Magic2011,2011-10-24T02:05Z,Thank You. Download is kind of slow but hey it's free right :)
,bryentheartist,2011-10-24T02:29Z,for supposedly having 501 seeders this is taking forever to download :(
,mzmango,2011-10-24T04:27Z,can you try in get the new footloose? bt loving this movie..
,i_steal_media_hohoho,2011-10-24T05:32Z,"Surprisingly watchable for a TS cam. Sound is good, and because of the film being based on old skool home video footage, the fact that it is cam quality seems to work."
,Exphailure,2011-10-24T05:57Z,"Wide open for another sequel... again. The trailer showed on the website has a lot of stuff this does, the knocking on the mirror, the demon specialist and the clip where Julie is thrown on the bed. This only made more questions with no answers about why the haunting started in the first place.
But it was definitely creepy."
,jimstarooney,2011-10-24T13:07Z,good quality for a ts not fake a/v 8/7 well done that man!
,GeekAtWork,2011-10-24T15:33Z,"Thanks for this! I'm to young to see it! (I'm only 12!)

A/V = 8

Very Good for a TS"
[V],.BONE.,2011-10-24T16:43Z,get his DTRG upload much better
,reeferwarrior420,2011-10-24T17:03Z,So is this the version that actually has all the cool stuff in it?
,TrustedQualityRatings,2011-10-25T02:55Z,"Rating for a CAM - 7/10
Rating in General - 5/10
Movie - Havn't watched it yet, just skimmed it.

Not as good as some people are saying like (best cam I've ever seen or even one of the best I've ever seen) but still watchable and not bad at all. It would be easier to watch if it wasn't this type of movie. The whole movie is supposed to look like it's shot on a home cam and most of the interesting parts are in the dark so its hard to make out sometimes but as i said concentrate and its watchable. Good for a cam."
,DeafMackem,2011-10-25T08:05Z,Moderator please ban @rebidebidu as that user have put up virus movie links on all Paranormal Activity 3 torrents. That user is not making any useful comments about this torrent so please ban.
,kimixpyro,2011-12-14T23:48Z,"Can anyone help me? /: I downloaded this and it downloaded fine, expect when I go to play it there's no video, just the soundtrack/audio."
