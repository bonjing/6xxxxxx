,Syreus,2011-10-25T00:31Z,"Has anybody had trouble with .net framwork when trying to install this? win7 has version 3.5 by default, but it's saying I don't have it. Uninstalling it and installing a new copy doesn't work either. Suggestions?"

@lukegoodman2001  What mods? Give a link and i'll tell you. If you mean custom maps you just need to put then into Portal2\portal2\maps and load them trough console."
