  A thief is found dead from blunt force trauma to his head in a pottery store where he was evidently trying to crack a safe. The team dusts the store and finds the fingerprint of a girl who has been missing for the last 20 years. Sara and Warrick find what\'s left of an old woman in her rocking chair. The two believe that they are witnessing a case of spontaneous human combustion. To prove it, Sara decides to conduct an experiment by herself.
