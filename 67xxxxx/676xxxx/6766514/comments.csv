Cheers."

,geeza2006,2011-10-26T20:26Z,"my honest opinion is that the copy aint all that great
a/5 way too much background noise
v/6 cant see much on the night scenes
but still thanks bone for the up"
,CaptTuttle,2011-10-29T01:11Z,"imdb says the movie is 1hr, 25 min and this version is 1 hr, 19 min. The scene with the two sisters playing Bloody Mary in the bathroom is not here. Strange.

Other than missing 6 minutes, A & V are both about 6 or 7 out of 10.  "
