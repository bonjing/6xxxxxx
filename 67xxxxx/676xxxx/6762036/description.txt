The interviews are fairly good as well. The John Lennon interview was a treat for me as a long time Beatles fan. Also interviewed are Elton John & Bernie Taupin, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Bruce Springsteen. Producer Mike Appleton has included an audio commentary. There's also an artist's gallery where you can read about the performance and artist. In special features mode a guitar will appear in the upper right hand corner and take you directly there. After you've read it, it takes you directly back to the performance.



Enjoy and Seed!!
