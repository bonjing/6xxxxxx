,GaryBradbury,2011-11-20T07:19Z,"It isn't possible for me to continue seeding this torrent forever. So, if you find there are no seeds left, the link below is a direct download (not a torrent). This file is only 175 meg, so you won't need to become a member to get this particular show, but I recommend you do (It's as simple as creating a user name here on the Pirate Bay). The maximum file size a non-member can get is 250 meg. Meaning, when I upload Season 5 of Rachel Zoe, you won't be able to get it!!

Here is that Link-
