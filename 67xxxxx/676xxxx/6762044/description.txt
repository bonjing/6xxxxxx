The Stranglers - Rattus At The Roundhouse (2007)

THIRTY YEARS TO the night, The Stranglers return to play the Roundhouse London, blowing away the amassed throng with an incendiary performance. With songs off the original 1977 set list plus Specter of Love and Duchess for an encore.The venue itself is synonymous with the band since breaking the consecutive sell-out records set by The Stones and The Who.

The band now returned to the classic four piece with Baz Warne taking on guitar and lead vocal duty's.
