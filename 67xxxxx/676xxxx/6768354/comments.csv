Haha, in my rush to upload this, I failed to realize that I included a single 'messed up' file that is a full song and a first third of the next song. So, deal with it."

I have googled the lyrics about 20 times to no avail. Anyone have a clue what the hidden track is? It is a BRILLIANT acoustic track."
