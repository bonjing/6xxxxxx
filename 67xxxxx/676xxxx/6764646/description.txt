I had to download it on a site that made me wait for 60 sec and limited my speed so it took 4 hours to download. Even more annoying you could not stop the dow, so you needed to finish it in one session. If you where to turn of you r pc you had to do it all over again.
I had to dow it from there cause it was not on pirate or kat...
