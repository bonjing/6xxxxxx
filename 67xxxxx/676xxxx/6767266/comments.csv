,drapedup,2011-10-24T23:49Z,"Not going to lie, the movie looks terrible. Appreciate the up regardless."
,Zhidar,2011-10-25T00:19Z,"Not going to lie, the movie sucked. Bad acting, bad plot, bad pretty much everything.

But on the other hand, someone else might love it. But be warned, it's one of those films that looks like they had a really low budget.

,angrybird0,2011-11-08T16:28Z,"Well, I haven't watch the movie yet, however, in terms of clearness, this would be an excellent one, no crashed or any defective pace while playing... so I rated ""plus 1"" for this great torrent."
