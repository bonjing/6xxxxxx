Gary Lineker introduces highlights from the day's Barclays Premier League fixtures. 
Aston Villa hosted local rivals West Brom, while Newcastle were at home to Wigan and 
aiming to continue their bright start to the season. Liverpool were looking for a fifth 
consecutive win over Norwich, and Sunderland were hoping for exactly the same on their 
visit to Bolton. And there was a first-ever top-flight meeting between Wolves and Swansea.
