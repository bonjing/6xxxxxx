Mega Breakdown: Porsche in Pieces
Los Angeles, California: home to the rich and famous... and their sports cars. Luxury is king here, and some say nothing shows off better than a Porsche. But when those cars crash and burn in accidents, their wreckage comes to "LA Dismantlers for Porsche". Here, an expert team tears down the totaled remains and pulls out the salvageable parts including the engines, transmissions, and seats: anything that wasn't damaged in the impact. Now, the team's got three new Porsches to tackle: a 2002 Boxster, a first-generation 911, and a 997 Carrera. Each car has components that customers have back ordered, so these fresh wrecks need to come apart now.
