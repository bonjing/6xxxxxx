The Walking Dead: Rise of the Governor by Robert Kirkman and Jay Bonansinga

In the Walking Dead universe, there is no greater villain than The Governor. The despot who runs the walled-off town of Woodbury, he has his own sick sense of justice: whether itÃ¢Â€Â™s forcing prisoners to battle zombies in an arena for the townspeopleÃ¢Â€Â™s amusement, or chopping off the appendages of those who cross him. The Governor was voted Ã¢Â€ÂœVillain of the YearÃ¢Â€Â by Wizard magazine the year he debuted, and his story arc was the most controversial in the history of the Walking Dead comic book series. Now, for the first time, fans of The Walking Dead will discover how The Governor became the man he is, and what drove him to such extremes.
