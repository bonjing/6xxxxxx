Review: If you liked films like The Abyss, Leviathan, Aliens etc., etc., this is a good film to have in your collection. I saw it and liked the special FX. It is not a big budget film, but the in FX department - it's outstanding. The script is good and the cast is decent, notable stars being Jack Scalia[Pointman], R. Lee Ermey[Full Metal Kacket], Ely Pouget[Death Machine],& Ray Wise[Robocop].
