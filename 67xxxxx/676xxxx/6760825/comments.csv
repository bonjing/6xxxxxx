THANKS.

Whoever will get the full piece of advice from you... ???"
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-10-21T23:41Z,"It doesn't matter  the quality!

It counts your name and ... the name of your internet...sponsor.

This is not a quality torrent !!!

Cheers.

[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-10-22T04:46Z,"Obviously....Ha, Ha, Ha !!!

 I'm a little sad about the chances of this torrent to show it's qualities !!

@fscene8: 

Thanks for your consideration."

Thanks."
,jamzkie,2011-10-31T10:48Z,better if you put screen shots and/or sample vid so that lots of people will know the exact quality. and use ac-3 audio rather than aac.
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-11-01T18:06Z,"@jamzkie:

Good sugestion about a sample. I missed that.

About AC3:

The only advantage: compatible with PS3 from internal HDD. [AAC only 2 channels !!!]

I'll think about that.

[My first .mp4 rips were with AC3 !!]

A good Media Player standalone or a PC soft player with the proper codec installed have no problem playing this HD video [on a decent configuration] !!!"

Man, you're spamming way too much! Add screens and STFU!!!

Glumeam doar :)) imi plac torentiitai. Tine-o tot asa chiar daca lumea nu apreciaza in scris asta. Multa bafta!"
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-11-22T19:28Z,"@Gabe:

Thanks for your...encouraging words.

Well ..a sample is much more valuable...so STFU !!

Multumesc pentru ""compasiune"". Torentul meu nu a fost sustinut la vremea lui in detrimentul altuia de mult mai slaba calitate, dar cu...nume. Bafta si tie !!"
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-11-22T19:30Z,"..cu avantajarea[nu in detrimentul]...

Sorry for the ...language.
