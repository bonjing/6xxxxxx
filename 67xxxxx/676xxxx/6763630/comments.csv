As for the album itself, to me, it's more 'songwritery' (ie folk inspired), and Waits has actually shed some of his ""Waitsiness"" that characterized his past few albums; those who're interested in his eclectic, bluesy, electric sounds will not find so much of that here. It has a more distinctly European flavor. I cannot fault the uploader for this, so A+. "
