Despite the fact that Lucky Town and Human Touch were both released on the same day in March 1992, they are vastly dissimilar albums. One is poppy and misguided and Lucky Town is a wondrous ride through the tunnels of love with a confident, secure and happy narrator. The wall that was in front of Springsteen for nearly two years finally evaporated and he purged his soul with some of the most intimate, reflective and happy music is his career. Springsteen performed the album almost entirely by himself, except for drums, some backing vocals and some assistance from Roy Bittan.
