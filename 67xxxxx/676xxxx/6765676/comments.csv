,Dj_Ziio,2011-10-25T06:11Z,"just wanted to update, install went perfect, i already had a registered version so i was unable to test the keygen, but for some reason, when using the roll-up window function on windows 7 x64 the window won't roll all the way up to the title bar, never had this issue with other version of the product so i've reverted back to 6.6, i left some feedback on the actual homepage about the issue, just thought everyone might want to know!"
,Dj_Ziio,2011-10-25T06:35Z,"checked the change log for the program and this is a new feature, folder windows will now show the breadcrumb bar on roll-up, not a bug, i should read more before i post, i'll shut up now, thanks again scene4all"
