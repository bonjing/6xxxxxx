The IMDB link is in the description."
,digs5446,2011-10-23T14:53Z,wasn't this just released in theaters on Friday?  has the the studio even finished authoring the BluRay yet???  
,bmalnes,2011-10-23T15:50Z,"@crackdave
are you a fucking retard? it takes 2 secounds to search for this movie on imdb, so why don't do it you self? "
,naseero,2011-10-23T16:06Z,"it sounds Fake... is it...? 
Any authentication .......?"
,flipflopper,2011-10-23T17:29Z,any comment on a/v?
,G3n3tiX,2011-10-23T17:33Z,"@naseero, Unless froggie's account got hacked, or the green skull now means the opposite to VIP (Very Important Person) then it's highly unlikely that this is a fake.

Thanks froggie, once again, always there when we need you."
,hargasd,2011-10-23T17:45Z,"The movie is not Fake.

V-8/9
A-5

There is some noise in the audio stream   "
,DontPissMeOff,2011-10-23T18:56Z,Crackdavid is right - is it so difficult to provide a clickable link to IMDB? Cannot 1 person do this so that the other thousands wouldn't have to?
,_preD,2011-10-23T19:14Z,Annoying clicking sound in the background
[V],froggie100,2011-10-23T20:59Z,it is real check sample please!
,hauntnut,2011-10-24T04:12Z,"Video is terrific, but the audio volume level is very low, and has some popping throughout. "
,G3n3tiX,2011-10-24T05:53Z,"Just found popping in the audio. Simply open the equalizer in VLC and lower the frequencies (1, 3 and 6 khz)"
,namshub,2011-10-25T02:57Z,"To the 2 utterly useless disappointments to their families who refer to themselves as @Crackdave & @DontPissMeOff on this glorious and storied site:

JESUS TITTY-FUCKING CHRIST.

It's so god-damned SAD that there are so many WORTHLESS LITTLE BABIES here like you, who instead of simply entering [select, C-c, C-l, C-v, ENTER] would rather submit an ENTIRE FUCKING COMMENT complaining to the world at large that: YES, some person who possesses actual worth, who provides something useful to this community that I leech off of every single fucking worthless minute of my useless life, may not have provided a link to IMDB that I could click on, NO, they had to enter it as text in the description, mandating I complain about how I had to, I dunno, READ or some shit cuz it wasn't all blue, then COPY a FUCKING LINK I had to select with my mouse, and then PASTE it into my address bar. Like, seriously, how much work do you people expect me to do to download all of this FREE SHIT that other people put here at their own expense & great personal risk?

A mewling, pathetic waste of space like you, whose only real accomplishment is somehow having the animal instinct to at least manage surviving the trauma of birth, but who from that moment on becomes nothing more than a fucking parasite on every single entity you come into contact with, guaranteeing that wherever you go, whatever you do, you will continue to make the world a shittier and more miserable place just by your very presence, are the reason that so many people think the world is always becoming an increasingly worse place to live.

Someone took the time to somehow acquire this movie, create the torrent, upload it, and leave their computer running long enough to allow others to download it and spread it out to the community.

People like you get all of their fucking movies, music, applications, and whatever the fuck else they want for FREE, yet they still complain that every fucking service hasn't been supplied to them.

Instead of posting a link in the comment section to the URL that was SUPPLIED to YOU in the description that you FAILED to fucking read, more and more of you FUCKING PARASITIC COCK-SUCKING ENTROPY-ACCELERATING USELESS PATHETIC WORTHLESS PIECES OF SHIT will take more time to COMPLAIN to the UNIVERSE at large that YOUR EVERY FUCKING WHIM hasn't been taken care of.

AWWWW.

POOR LITTLE BABIES.

[To the rest of the community, I apologize for this outburst. It's been a bad week, and cum-guzzling gutter-sluts like the asshats in the previous comments complaining that nobody posted a link to the obviously displayed URL have REALLY been pissing me off lately. I needed to vent.]

To the (real) community;
Cheers!

[To everyone else: I hope you get skull-fucked by a leprous demon. Or something. Whatever. I'm tired.]"

""Says the guy stealing shit. How appropriately hypocritical of you Mr. Religion."" 

Well,son,explain to us others:From whom are we stealing ""shit""?Because I didn't know we're stealin...From someone who freely and voluntarily shares stuff with us?Watch your language.And who the fuck are you to judge hypocrisy,especially on this pages?And your fuckbuddy ""namshub""could REALLY omit dear Jesus and God out of his ""outbursts""!(and find some chick to screw,when he needs to ""outburst"".)"
,amind,2011-10-29T01:05Z,Audio is terrible in this release... as stated by the other users popping in the background sound is constant.
,Mutegrill,2011-10-31T15:46Z,"IÂ´m surprised you even DARE to bicker on ""illegal"" matters..? When you are defending the ""wright of ownership"" of what you stole, you make it very easy for prosecutors to take you down. And find you they surely will, if they need to... Why donÂ´t you just download? If something is bad, you inform others of your findings, and then you try the next torrent in line, until you are satisfied. The only thing you risk is time, of wich you guys seem to possess plentyful, bitching about like sissys.

Would this be realtime interaction, you would probably belong to suburban nancy gangs. With swinging purses you would charge each other with iron dildos at the ready, be spitting, scratching and slapping each other over crumbs and leftovers hehe!"
,mkvluv,2011-11-01T00:56Z,DON'T DOWNLOAD! audio sounds like crap. lots of popping noise. wait for a proper release.
,dcabro,2011-11-06T21:26Z,"Okay, the video is very good, perfect even, but the audio is horrible. There's this annoying popping sound and I just can't watch this movie with that sound. I'm deleting it. IMHO it's not worth loading. "
