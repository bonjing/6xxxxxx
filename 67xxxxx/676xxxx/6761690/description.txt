Here is another one of my all-time faves. Get to both listen and read to all five of Brandon Mull's much celebrated Fablehaven Series!


1. Fablehaven
2. Rise of the Evening Star
3. Grip of the Shadow Plague
4. Secret of the Dragon Sanctuary
5. Keys to the Demon Prison


I bought the books in paperback but it hasn't been all that convenient to lug them around as I am always traveling with my laptop so thought I'd share my solution to that: Audiobooks and EBooks!

Enjoy and SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED!
