Work.Of.Art.The.Next.Great.Artist.S02E02-LowQwebrip.xvid-][ Art Movement ][ 20-Oct-2011 ].avi

found some source on web. and ripped it and converted it to xvid and mp3

however the source ripper obviously didnt know what they were doing and used
divx which adds a deface logo, instead of using the free avidemux to make a better quality xvid
and also added their own logo defacing it more!

low pixels for h and width so its watchable but pixelled

I scaled and delogo-ed some of the video and sharpened best I could do

250mb xvid mp3

enjoy and chip in seeding i cant do it alone :(

this will have to do until a 350 ht source comes to light if ever
