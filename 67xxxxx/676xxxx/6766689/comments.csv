,LunaBoi,2011-10-24T07:14Z,Thank you so much! I had almost given up on finding a torrent of this episode!
[V],psspss,2011-10-24T08:07Z,there is now also another webrip floating about about 550mn in size not sure if its more pixels or same source but Im happy with mine as just watched it and its all ok for portable device viewing.. but might be a bit grainy on large screen (unless upscaling is used)
[V],psspss,2011-10-24T08:14Z,"for the small size its good viewing

man these artists are weird bunch that weird girl and her guts and blood fetish"

,Fangular,2011-10-24T13:20Z,"Thanks from me too, psspss - I had also pretty much given up on being able to see this! I really, really appreciate you uploading it - it's a fun, funny little show, isn't it!? Thanks a zillion!!!"
,Wizard1973,2011-10-24T14:05Z,"Thank you from Europe!! There is no way we can watch this here, so you made our week :) !! Hope to see more episodes of Work of Art... Would be super too!! Thanks in advance :) "
,CzRMK,2011-10-24T16:53Z,Thank you! I really appreciate it. This show is one of the better reality shows. It's fun to watch them create things! :-)
,ninjamunk,2011-10-25T00:15Z,hmm.. found this unwatchable. Poor quality. But thank you for the effort nonetheless!
,mattwist,2011-10-25T01:03Z,thanks for effort-- but isn't it strange-  a low quality webrip is way worse than a bad vhs.. there is no detail-  i tried watching it on a small screen- still- tough watch.  But its the only one out there (well- you mentioned one other- that i couldn't find)- so only a douche like me would complain. 
,kfgvdrse,2011-10-25T04:31Z,_Very_ pixelated - unwatchable.
[V],psspss,2011-10-25T14:29Z,"im not sure what the problem is with it.


it watches fine in VLC 1.1.0.. better if you enable the ral time sharpener and slide the knob to find the sweet spot.. maybe everyone is too spolt for HD stuff now days :)

considering this was a 2 inch by 1 inch video screen
with a stream in it on a webpage where many watched it they were happy for want quality :) 

anyhow ive already add a torrent pointing to the 10 times better rip (so they said) but not got it myself 

click on my nick psspss and your find it"
