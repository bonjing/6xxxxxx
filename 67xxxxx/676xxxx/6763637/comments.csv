Too bad it no longer supports my native resolution, 1920x1080... -.-

If someone has a fix for this, please let me know!"

Create shortcut from where the driver.exe is at and right-click the driver.exe and click send to and then click desktop (create shortcut).

Right-click driver shortcut on your desktop and click properties. Click compatibility tab and click the square by Run this program as an administrator. Click apply. Double-click the driver shortcut and it will run :)"
