Obviously he has had no new info since the early 80's but keeps teasing in every interview that he has unreleased info about what is really on the moon and mars but doesn't want to release it yet.

The ones to listen to are Richard Hoaglan, David Wilcock, Sean David Morton and Graham Hancock. Morton has two amazing UFO clips, 1 of the Dome Of The Rock and 1 of a TR3B (Black Triangle) powering up and blinking out. "
