,randy94666,2011-11-01T21:49Z,"Awful album, I enjoyed Lou Reed + Metallica's Lulu much more than this. This just sounds like Dave doing the same this over and over. At least Lulu was musically experimental and daring."

,weston1004,2011-11-02T02:03Z,"randy that might be your opinion but whats the point of typing in something on the page if its negative about it? why are you even on here? they've had the first 3 songs released way before today 11/1/11, if you didn't like them, then you shouldn't be here :P and i personally like both metallica and megadeth, ive liked all of megadeths albums, but only kill em all to the black album of metallica. i heard lulu and im not a fan of it, but thats besides the point :P "

Great Rip!
