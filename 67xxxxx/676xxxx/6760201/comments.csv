Can u please tell us why did u advertise them? I have dloaded yr torrent and seeded above 1:1 only to find out this is useless to me...
I have considered your green skull to mark a trusted source... I am dloading the rest of yr Kurosawa uploads marked as having EN subs. If they prove to be false as well, I will ask for yr green skull to be removed!"
