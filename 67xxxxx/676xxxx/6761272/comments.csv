,destinyfate1,2011-10-21T20:55Z,"Any chance we can import skidrow saves to this version? seeing that THETA releases so fast, i might have to play on this version instead"
,Matinator10,2011-10-21T21:14Z,"SKIDROW saves were the same saves as THETA for me, updating should be fine for you"
,NanoEntity,2011-10-21T23:55Z,"This version seems to be stable, no save issues or errors playing on it :)"
,sorking,2011-10-22T00:56Z,"update just shuts down in the middle of installation, i already opened it as admin but nothing happens either, anyone have an idea? :/"
,Unit3727,2011-10-22T03:11Z,Does not work with skidrow release.
,darthvla,2011-10-22T05:37Z,What happens to saved data when this update is aplied?
,ThatQuietKid,2011-10-22T06:34Z,Skidrow version might not start up after using this patch.
,huldu,2011-10-22T09:34Z,You probably should get the THETA release before applying this update. My skidrow release crashed on startup after applying this patch.
,huldu,2011-10-22T09:35Z,#sorking If you're running windows 7 disable UAC... it saves you a lot of problems.
,vnpowa,2011-10-22T12:26Z,"Fun game, but i have an issue thats been happening since the first update, every time I leave the game, my characters are erased, I also can't open the configure section on the launcher as it says I can't create a preference file, and I wonder if it's related to my saves issue. Anyone knows a solution to this problem?"
,darthvla,2011-10-22T13:37Z,"Hmm... this update dont let me to play online (i could on 7.02 update). Maybe i have to unisnstall and install 7.03 without apply 7.02 as i did before? Anyone knows how to ,ake a backup of your hero?"
,darthvla,2011-10-22T14:11Z,"No... with this update you CAN NOT play online. I uninstalled the game and reinstalled, applied update 7.03 and thwn tying online it says ""Package DunDefArchetype version.......""

Anyway, i just installed update 7.02 over 7.03 and now i can play online :)"
,darthvla,2011-10-22T14:32Z,ÂŹÂŹ' Now i cant play local lol I will reinstall the game and stay with only update 7.02

Seems the update is missing something, but if you install all of them in order, the problem will go away and you get working Muliplayer LAN.

Install all the updates in ORDER
1) Install Dungeon.Defenders.v7.0.multi5.retail.READ.NFO-THETA
2) Install Dungeon Defenders DLCs dc111019.exe

,Trevone,2011-10-23T11:12Z,"I installed the THETA version of the game plus all of the updates including 7.03 (in order) and still I cant save my game. My hero keeps getting erased, I can play online just fine. Any help on the issue would be great."

Do EXACTLY as NanoEntity says and it will work fine.

LAN play: you DO NOT have to sign up for a gamespy account. Select the STEAM option for online play...log in to steam or use SMART STEAM. Run the game. Choose to play ONLINE. SKIP gamespy login and choose the play local option and it works fine. I've hosted 3 times now on LAN with 3 other computers and everything works no issues yet."
,yellowbeard68,2011-10-23T15:18Z,"My above instructions left out some minor details - but if you can't figure out some of this stuff on your own, you should not be messing with any torrented games - this game is good enough to buy and I will be getting the 4-pack now. Some of you may not realize - torrents are a good way to try out something before buying so we aren't wasting our money - while others are nothing more than common ingrates. If you like what you are trying out - then support the people who created this stuff. :-)"
,dtrosaly,2011-10-23T22:00Z,"I am also having the saving problem and I cannot figure out how to fix it. I have downloaded all of the updates in order just like he said. I have also tried putting my skidrow saves in the folder as also suggested..still nothing. Anyone have any ideas on what the problem would be? Trying to play this with my bro, and we want to be able to save our heroes. Thanks!"
,vnpowa,2011-10-24T15:33Z,"Finally solved the save problem, simply start the program as admin and the saves are there... one of these days I gotta find out why running as admin seems to solve all the silly problems x.x"
,markofkv,2011-10-24T16:25Z,"if u want to save your hero stats, just run as administrator to game every time"
