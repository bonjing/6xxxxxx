I think this is why AVG sounded off - the filename - there is no virus. I should have known better when it said win32 in a DOS flasher. In my own defence I would like to say that I was extremely STONED. Well I'm glad you got a good laugh from it most ppl would have flamed the shit out of me  :)

Anyways... Thanx for the up."
,SimStim,2011-10-23T11:46Z,"Get a decent virus scanner, like Avast. AVG sucks. Hey, how can it claim that ""this file has been seen March 15,"" if it was released less than a day ago?

But I'm glad to see you figured it out - man over machine! =D"
,FucHollywood,2011-10-24T00:08Z,@SimStim thx 4 the upload anyone tried this yet..any issues? I just ordered a iHAS424B wont be here till next week
,remedy2,2011-10-24T05:49Z,Can't believe how fast these fuckers work.  Well done.  I already ordered my iHAS324B for this.  Now my question: will abgx be needed if one burns a xgd3 0800 image since it will supposedly be a 1 to 1 burn?
,SimStim,2011-10-24T11:34Z,"I tried it successfully with my ihas624b. There will be an abgx update, eventually, but for now you can just burn 0800 rips, because there's only one way to rip xgd3, and that's c4eva's official tool...Tried several xgd3s, no problems so far."
,FucHollywood,2011-10-24T16:36Z,Has anyone tried any discs other than verbatim?
,hanfi,2011-10-24T17:50Z,"i know you gonna tell me im a noob, but why do i need this? im just fine with my old drive and the errors in imgburn. Please enlighten me."
,SimStim,2011-10-24T19:26Z,"I've tried other discs, but only a couple, all of them failed, but at the time I was still playing around with the settings, so it might not actually be the discs. I'd just recommend to use Verbatim for XGD3, and others for XGD2. Others reported success with TDK and Maxell, so really you should wait a few weeks and stick with Verbs until more reliable info surfaces.

As for why you would need or not need this firmware. You need it to burn 100 % of XGD3 discs. There are methods for burning only around 97 % of them (on regular discs, without this firmware), but some titles are occasionally checking the remaining 3 % (like Forza 4), and you can expect more titles to do so in the future. So, basically, you would need this to avoid content integrity verification (CIV) to fail and flagging your console as banned, and to play future XGD3 title in full."
,remedy2,2011-10-25T02:43Z,Thanks for the reply SimStim.  I'm not sure why abgx was needed to begin with except that perhaps rips were not 1 to 1?  Will we be able to go online with 0800 rips?
,remedy2,2011-10-25T06:23Z,Ok I did some research- 0800 xgd3 rips and burns with this FW and liteon drive does not need abgx.  Pretty badass.  Now the question is can you play backups on xbl.  My drive comes weds.  Looking forward to it.
,SimStim,2011-10-25T19:27Z,"You can play Live as safe as the old format (it's never been 100 %, you know). Just don't do anything ""stupid,"" like playing a game online before it hits the stores - you WILL be noticed LOL"
,FucHollywood,2011-10-28T02:07Z,@anyone who is looking for an iHAS B-model I can confirm that newegg.com has iHAS124-04b for sale $18.99 part number N82E16827106289 hope this helps. Everyone that has bought one thus far has confirmed these are indeed B-models I just got mine today
