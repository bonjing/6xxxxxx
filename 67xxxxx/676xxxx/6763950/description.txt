QAInfo  Help


Overview:

QAInfo is a utility program which does a snapshot of your hardware and
software.  The following tests are available:

       *  Hardware Configuration
       *  Device Drivers
       *  Environment
       *  Memory Map
       *  IRQ/DMA
       *  BIOS Configuration
       *  Disk Configuration
       *  PCI Configuration


Usage:

QAInfo can be used in three ways:

       *  Interactively
       *  Command-line options
       *  Redirecting output


Interactive:

To use QAInfo Interactively, type:  QAINFO.   This runs QAINFO in a menu
driven environment.


Comand-line Options:

There are two command line options available:

       *  -f
       *  -t

The -f option sends the data produced by QAINFO to a selected data file.
The -t option selects a test number.  The valid test numbers are:

       *  201  Memory Map
       *  202  Environment
       *  203  Device Drivers
       *  204  IRQ/DMA
       *  205  Hardware Configuration
       *  206  BIOS Configuration
       *  207  DISK Configuration
       *  209  PCI Configuration

You may use the command-line options as the following line illustrates:

       QAINFO -t205 -fhardware.dat

This example selects test number 205, and the data is sent to a data
file by the name of hardware.dat.


Redirecting Output:

Running QAINFO as follows sends the output data to standard out:

       QAINFO -t205


QAINFO.INI:

The first time QAINFO is run, it generates a QAINFO.INI file.  This
configuration file allows you to select/deselect a test within the 204
and 205 test suites.  The tests listed in this file are defaulted to
'Y'es, however these tests can be turned off by setting the test to
'N'o.

Special note on hard and floppy disk checking:  to check the hard and
floppy disks, the Logical Drives switch must be set to =y.  The settings
for BIOS HDDs and BIOS FDDs key off of the Logical Drives setting.  For
example the following settings display both floppy and hard disk
configurations even though both FDD and HDD are set to =n:

       Logical Drives=y
       BIOS HDDs=n
       BIOS FDDs=n


Error Codes:

QAINFO produces the following error numbers:

*  0 = success
*  -1 = invalid option(s)
*  -2 = invalid file name selected
*  -3 = invalid test number


Data File Options:

QAINFO generates a data file for each test it runs.  This data file is
deleted by default in the interactive mode.  To over-ride this default
action, you may select saving the data file option.  The files are saved
with the following file names:

       test 205 - hardware.dat
       test 202 - devdvr.dat
       test 203 - environ.dat
       test 201 - memmap.dat
       test 204 - irqdma.dat
       test 206 - bios.dat
       test 207 - disk.dat
       test 209 - pcicfg.dat


Runtime Problems:

QAINFO takes control of your computer's hardware to do it's testing.
Some memory resident programs (TSR), device drivers, or newer
hardware, may interfere with QAINFO's operation causing the system
to lockup during program initialization or execution.

If you are experiencing problems, reboot your computer with no
CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  With DOS version 6.0 and higher,
pressing the F5 key during boot-up will bypass the processing of the
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  Re-run QAINFO in this mode to
check your system again.

If the lockup problem still persists, you may edit the QAINFO.INI
file and turn off various tests until a suspect test can be isolated.
Each Hardware, IRQ and DMA item that can be identified and tested is
listed in respective sections of the QAINFO.INI file. By default, each
of these options is enabled, by the 'y' appearing after the specific
item.

To disable testing of one or more items, change the 'y' to 'n', save
the QAINFO.INI file and rerun QAINFO.EXE.  This process may take
several iterations and some intuition before isolating the item of
concern.
