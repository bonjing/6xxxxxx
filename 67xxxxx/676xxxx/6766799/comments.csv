[T],TAKINI,2011-10-24T16:16Z,still have the same startup problems after installing this patch.. running win7\64bit
,ej33t,2011-10-24T19:06Z,"@TAKINI
Same, it opens and closes after a short loading screen. This patch didn't fix it."
[T],alexisthebest,2011-10-24T21:46Z,"@mike130784

All THETA releases will show up as false positives
you'll have to disable your AV to install them.

They're always clean but if you dont trust THETA or myself, then just pass on the update."

Not sure what could be the problem.

I installed the game then installed the patch and it works fine.

Make sure you have the prerequisites
things such as the latest visual c++, .Net Framework"
