Survivors of a crash-landed starship crew battle the undead hordes of an entire world, desperate to complete their escape plan before they too are devoured by flesh-ripping zombies. Surrounded, trapped, beaten, the crew must fight to the bitter end, for they all know the horrific alternative: Should they fail to escape, they are doomed to join the bloodthirsty population of the planet, destined to devour flesh and brains forever, damned to Living Hell.
