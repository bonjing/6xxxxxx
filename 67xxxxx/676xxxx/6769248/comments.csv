Also, if you check my list, the last two eps for season 3 came out on the same day, which shows its a double block of Pawn Stars. The next episodes, which began season 4's list, aired a month later."
,SuperJ87,2011-10-28T02:49Z,"There is a new Episode, Rick or Treat. According to this list, it will be Episode 54, so name it accordingly.

You can find it here.

,akira2244,2011-12-31T05:22Z,"very nice super. this saved me alot of time and its organized well.  if ppl want to cry about you taking time and effort to collect these episodes, they can screw themselves. if ppl want to double check the number of episodes, imdb.com has all the airing dates and titles of episodes.  But again, good job Super!!!!"
