Alright so, I got tired of searching for every single Pawn Stars episode, dealing with the different names, titles, season numbers and episode numbers. So whatever list you have been using for Season 4, scratch that.

History released Season 3 DVD, and it turns out that Wikipedia was correct in their titling, as none of the supposed Season 4 episodes were included on Season 3 DVD. So this is the Season 4.

This is the official list "I" am going by.

Please enjoy and seed!
