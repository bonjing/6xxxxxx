,Madjack12,2012-01-02T18:22Z,mongojohan74- when you burn the game and it comes up saying that it is too big for the disc you have to pick the button truncate for it to fit on the disc if you are using imageburn. Make sure you go into your settings and set the settings under tools. U go to write under settings and pick on the right for layer break to calculate optimal. This is only if you are burning XDG3 games...if you are burning older ones than u have to input the layer break to 1913760 as usual. But that's what I do. If u are still having problems there was a game burning beginnner's guide on here that is pretty helpful to burn the new games. It helped a lot. Good luck :)
