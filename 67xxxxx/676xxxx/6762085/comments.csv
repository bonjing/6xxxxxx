,zzw1983,2011-10-22T10:18Z,luis: I am sorry but I'm not uploading this again. I've done it three times already. Why don't you do it?
,gyurci73,2011-10-23T10:51Z,"Hi!

Tried it, but not working!
Gives error when loading scenario!
:-((((("
,zzw1983,2011-10-23T13:46Z,"To all who are still having problems with it try this:

-Remove the acela and northeast corridor in package manager.
-Browse for the 'NortheastCorridor' folder (If it is still there) in the Assets>RSC folder and DELETE it.
-Browse for the Acela Express folder (If it is still there) in the Assets>RSC folder and DELETE it.
-Browse for the folder '00000030-0000-0000-0000-000000000000' (If it is still there) in the Content>Routes folder and DELETE it.
-Install the Acela Express rwp package
-Run the .rar winrar executable and extract ALL folders (assets, content, package info) to your railworks directory.
DELETE BLUEPRINTS"
,Evil Nemesis,2011-10-24T18:08Z,"okay just tested this and the accela express addon, well ppl the accela express scenarios are very slow, but this NEC route is still playable without accela, I don't know if it's just for pirates but. thanks ZZW1983 for the upload. looking forward to play Trainz vs Zombies but this game has alot of bugs."
,zzw1983,2011-10-24T19:06Z,@evil: no kidding eh? I wish theyd spend all their time and effort on fixing things. 
,gyurci73,2011-10-24T19:52Z,"Tried it regarding the instructions you write, but it is still giving me the error message.
It looks like you missed some important asset files from the package.
Also the Acela rwp contains NEC route asset files, whats - I think - not part of the original DLC package.
Fortunately it is not messes up other DLC package files the user maybe got, so these can be uninstalled.
I tried it several times and several methods, but neither works, always giving the scenario error.
So it is useless, unless someone upload the correct rwp packages for the updated NEC and the Acela, too."
,zzw1983,2011-10-24T20:23Z,@gyurci: I really don't know what to tell you. The scenarios seem to work for me. Could you tell me the scenarios that aren't working for you?
,gyurci73,2011-10-24T22:23Z,"@zzw1983: I think neither of the scenarios are working! But I didn't try all of them. The ""evening clocker"" scenario gives the error, and two acela scenarios are gives the same. Maybe this error is becouse it is working only with the cracked version of Railworks3... But the route and the scenarios are visible and choosable in the menu, so I don't think so..."
,acme005,2011-10-25T13:08Z,worx perfect. thanx a lot
,tristen1230,2011-10-28T01:24Z,Hoping this will fix my Acela Problem. No scenarios work.
,Naxell,2011-10-30T14:17Z,"Many thanks zzw1987 this fixed my problems with loading scenarios, but it runs really slow. I went from 60-40 Fps to 8 Fps :-( I hope this will get fixed in the near future."
,zzw1983,2011-11-01T19:48Z,naxell: you're welcome and yeah either you buy a used NASA supercomputer or turn shadows completely off. Never has 'try before you buy' become more important now with this game!
