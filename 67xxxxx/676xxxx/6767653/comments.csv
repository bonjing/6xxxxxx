,johnniebrasco,2011-10-24T17:48Z,Thank you for uploading these when noone else seems to do it!!! this is a show that cannot be watched without hd quality with all the great locations!!
,tyrabit,2011-10-24T17:54Z,"Thank you, of course I will seed :)
I have currently very low upload speed, only about 1 Mbit/s, and quite many leechers, so I guess it takes a while :)"
,GhOsTRiDeROwN,2011-10-24T18:35Z,"Okay, It doesn't matter to me how long time i have to wait, cuz I'm waiting for something good you know ;) Thank you soo much for the HD Uploads of Amazing Race that you have :) Appreciate it extremely much :) 
I guess your from America tyrabit, right? "
,tyrabit,2011-10-24T18:50Z,"No problem, be my guest, sharing is caring ;) 
No, I'm from Europe, very small country :)"
,GhOsTRiDeROwN,2011-10-24T20:04Z,"Ohh, so am I, and which small country? ;) And, when I'm talking to you, i wonder, how did you get all these HD episodes of Amazing race, if you're from Europe, Cuz the airing is on CBS channel from America, right? :) Sorry for the stupid question, but i have never been a uploader , so I don't really know how the process of everything goes :)"
,tyrabit,2011-10-24T20:57Z,"E _ _ _ _ _ a :)

Oh, I didn't record these episodes, these are scene releases, I'm just sharing them on Piratebay :) 

I've been hooked to Amazing Race for years, right from the start and just want to share it for others in HD :) I just don't get it- why watch SD if HD is available..."
,GhOsTRiDeROwN,2011-10-24T21:27Z,"Aah, Okay , so you're from there! Ooh, how stupid am I , DIMENSION have done all work, and I didn't figure that out xD Stupid me. And how to you get the ""Scene realese"" (?) and upload it, or where do you get it from :) (I don't know what scene realese means)
Yeah, I've also been stuck with amazing race for alot of years, and when HD came for the first time, in Season 18 (?) i was just trilled, i love watching in HD :) "
,tyrabit,2011-10-25T14:14Z,Just have to look around various forums for links to find the desired episodes. Nothing fancy :)
,GhOsTRiDeROwN,2011-10-25T17:26Z,Okay :) Well Thank you for answering all my questions :) 
,tyrabit,2011-10-25T19:30Z,No problem :)
,octogirl_21,2011-10-31T04:06Z,"Can you answer a question for me. I of course will seed this wonderful download but one of the need torrents has 3500 leechers and approx 50 seeds. Do people not seed when downloading? I am new at this so I don't know much about it. Isn't that kind of shitty? Does seeding make your comp go slower when your not downloading? 

thanks"
,octogirl_21,2011-10-31T04:06Z,sorry new torrents....lol
,tyrabit,2011-10-31T18:55Z,"leechers seed, but not the whole file, only the parts thay have already downloaded. once they receive all parts they become full seeders. but sadly, for different reasons, most of those choose not to seed, and cut themself off."
