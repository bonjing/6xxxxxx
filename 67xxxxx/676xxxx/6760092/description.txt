Itâ€™s been over fourteen months in the making, and itâ€™s finally here. The first full-length project from the celebrated Toronto rapper Jazz Cartier. 

While many became frustrated while waiting, Jazz masterfully strung his fans along, occasionally dropping an incredible remix or single (Take It Home, Gold & Girls, Etc). With a lot to live up to, the pressure was on while creating Losing Elizabeth. Instead of cracking under the pressure, Jazz created a work of art. 14 tracks, some of them weâ€™ve already heard, and some are new, all are dope. Iâ€™ll stop talking now and let you listen.
