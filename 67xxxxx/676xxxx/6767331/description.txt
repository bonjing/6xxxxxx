These are the various tracks that appeared in the deluxe editions of domestically released Jimmy Eat World albums. Some of these can be found on iTunes, but several are no longer available commercially. 

Jen in particular is difficult to find. Take 'Em As They Come is a cover of a 1998 Bruce Springsteen song from his box set Tracks.

Bonus Track
Your New Aesthetic (demo)         - Jimmy Eat World EP


The bonus track is a demo version of Your New Aesthetic, which originally appeared on their self-titled 1998 EP. Unusually for a demo, it's wildly different from the finished track and has (in my opinion) a much more refined sound.
