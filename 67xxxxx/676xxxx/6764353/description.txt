Synopsis:

Dodging speeding cars, crazed cabbies, open doors, and eight million cranky pedestrians is all in a day\\\\\\\'s work for Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), the best of New York\\\\\\\'s agile and aggressive bicycle messengers. It takes a special breed to ride the fixie - super lightweight, single-gear bikes with no brakes and riders who are equal part skilled cyclists and suicidal nutcases who risk becoming a smear on the pavement every time they head into traffic. But a guy who\\\\\\\'s used to putting his life on the line is about to get more than even he is used to when a routine delivery turns into a life or death chase through the streets of Manhattan. When Wilee picks up his last envelope of the day on a premium rush run, he discovers this package is different. This time, someone is actually trying to kill him.
