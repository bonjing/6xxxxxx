From the Inside Flap
Unhappy customers wonâ€™t just dump you. No, first theyâ€™ll tell at least ten or more people about their bad experience with your company, and then theyâ€™ll broadcast it online. But wait, you say you have a good customer service department? Really? What hoops do your customers have to jump through before you help them? What rules have you wrapped around your customer service department, so that your reps canâ€™t really help? How long do you keep your customers on hold?
In Itâ€™s the Customer, Stupid!, top salesperson and motivational speaker Michael Aun shares his secrets to keeping your customers happy, your sales growing, and yourself sane. Youâ€™ll discover the myths and truths about customer satisfactionâ€”and why many businesses and organizations, despite their claims of being customer-centric, really havenâ€™t got a clue.
This energizing book is packed with sales-boosting tips you can apply right away to your company or your own job, including:
â€¢ If you need to fix something, donâ€™t make the customer work for it.
â€¢ Somebody has to take out the trash. Translation: If your company makes a mistake, you may have to fire the person who caused the problem later, but for now, step in and make the customer happy again. Fix the problem, not the blame!
â€¢ Whether youâ€™re talking to a customer or trying to make a sale, shut up and listen.
â€¢ So what if you might screw up? Make a decision!
The good news is that you can woo disgruntled customers back, keep them content, and even grow Sales. But first, wake up and smell the coffee: Itâ€™s the Customer, Stupid!
