,whmxtra,2011-10-25T09:32Z,"ok advice appreciated here, even though I have no limits set on my torrent client etc and I have a 7 mpbs max upload speed my seeding is still only plodding along at less than 100 kbps with over 25 leachers. Not enough experience with torrents to understand why.

I can upload to my own server at about 1.3 mbps no problem but for some unknown reason my upload speed with this torrect is barely a fraction of what I should be able to do. Don't give a crap about my ""bandwidth limits"" as the ISP just dings me for extra cash if I go over but the speed itself should be higher.

Any ideas on how I can speed it up? The last couple torrents I uploaded were fine and fast but since I moved and did this one the upload speed is nothing compared to what I should be able to do."
