Ok since nobody else has uploaded it yet and burgandyranger can't do anything till the end of the month I have managed to find episode 20, it's HD but only 720p. I didn't make make this encode, nor do I know who did, was a random lucky find on filesonic, so credit to whomever encoded this, just figured I'd upload it since nobody else likely will anytime soon for those that don't want to wait for burgandyranger to upload (which will probably be higher quality).
