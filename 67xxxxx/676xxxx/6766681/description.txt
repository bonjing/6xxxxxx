HOLY TERROR - Frank Miller

In HOLY TERROR, join The Fixer, a brand new, hard-edged hero as he battles terror. The graphic novel is a no-holds-barred action thriller told in Millerâ€™s trademark high-contrast, black-and-white visual style, which seizes the political zeitgeist by the throat and doesnâ€™t let go until the last page.

HOLY TERROR is a 120 page hardcover graphic novel with spot-color interiors presented in a 10 x 13 landscape format.
