,wistfool,2011-10-24T22:05Z,"Damn, though. The audio isn't all that good."

Yeah this cam audio like the others out.
After new audio source gets available i will make a new upload."

This is still the best rip out there by far, and the audio became clearer when I plugged in my earphones instead of using the laptop's built-in speaker.
