The highly anticipated sequel to last yearâ€™s PC hit, Puzzler World 2 brings more puzzles, new games, fun rewards and an all new Master Mode.

Created by the same team that developed the original Puzzler World, the team were able to flex their development muscles and improve on every section in the game. With a revised selection of puzzles and mini-games, brand new Master Mode, a new reward structure and the inclusion of trophies â€“ Puzzler World 2 takes the highly addictive franchise to a whole new level!

Each puzzle completed unlocks a bonus game which in turn rewards the player with the all-new prize wheel. Players spin the wheel and see what prize they can earn. Players can win hint tokens that can then be used to buy help if they get stuck on tricky puzzles.

Puzzler World 2 also allows players to unlock special Master Mode puzzles which provide playerâ€™s with even tougher challenges.
