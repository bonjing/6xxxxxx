Comment: 
A densly packed 80-minute dance compilation presents a Megamix-like CD Album
with traditional \"fade out\" & untraditional mixing techniques of the well-known and
the most promising dance compositions and remixes that have enjoyed recognition on the 
dancefloors around the world as well as the ones which are about to hit the charts.
The mixed tracks are well-balansed; even though heterogenic by the style & content are
compiled in order to create the groovy/exciting atmosphere of the Albumas well as the
imprssion of a colourful infusion of sounds of the latest 
mainstream & popularhouse style songs. 

-----------------
Notes:

For seamless non-Stop playback of the SPLIT TRACKS version use 
Windows Media Player or Media Monkey Player 
(many of the Winamp Players make half a second pauses or \"Fade Outs\").
