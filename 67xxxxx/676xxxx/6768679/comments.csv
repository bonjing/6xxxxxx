,WDB,2011-12-06T11:35Z,"Hi
The problem I think is the 301 version. Early
betas (as enclosed) are unstable. Save the
key-file and use it with later 301. That might do it"
,beuwolf777,2011-12-08T10:23Z,"Too many activations :-(

,rokindude24,2012-02-17T20:40Z,"Guys! There are 3 files included in this torrent.
There are the instructions, there is the Plus key file and uTorrent 3.1
DO NOT DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL UTORRENT OFF OF THIS TORRENT!!!
Go to utorrent.com and download the latest version off the site. This version is WAY out-dated now.
The only thing you need to download from this torrent is the 'license.btkey"" file. 
After you have installed the latest version of uTorrent from the uTorrent website, just double click the license.btkey file and uTorrent Plus will automatically be activated!!

,phgace,2012-02-18T00:49Z,"For those looking for a fix too many activations, I finally did it.
2 steps: 

1. start up regedit- find (do a search for)  utorrentplus. Delete folder of UtorrentPlus

2. Go into the App Data Folders of both Yourself & admin account (if u hav the admin a/c enabled), go into Roaming, Utorrent, then find Settings.DAT and Settings.OLD and DELETE them.
now start up utorrent and your preferences have been reset. 

Finished now you should have utorrent working fine without the annoying error."
,byetsoft,2012-02-19T00:53Z,Download utorrent plus here for free work 
,ZeeKayeX,2012-02-20T03:20Z,Lmao the Irony
,NeonYouki,2012-02-22T01:09Z,"I was working on the same thing as PHGacy was and I'll add to what he found out.

1.) Delete the settings.dat and settings.dat.old from /appdata/roaming/utorrent

2.) This is the part he missed.  In that same directory, you'll need to delete the ""apps"" directory.  It will be recreated on startup.

3.) Put this in a .reg file and run it:


Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[-HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\uTorrentPlus]


That will delete your license from the registry.

NOTE: Keep in mind, this will take away all of the uTorrent plus interface and functionality.  This will reset everything back to the free version.  If you want to keep the Plus version, you'll keep getting that message until a crack is made."
,RussianKillerTeady,2012-02-24T11:51Z,"I dont understand this step..... 

3.) Put this in a .reg file and run it:


Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[-HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\uTorrentPlus]

What am i putting there and how?"
,xXNeoREXx,2012-03-04T15:26Z,"Virus infected, DO NOT DOWNLOAD"

,atomicpixle,2012-04-23T06:29Z,"bunch of lame fucks. why does everyone feel the need to talk shit on the uploader, its not fake or spam so fuck off.  anything w a keygen or crack is going to have a anti virus notice popup.. duh.  and you should know to go to the site FIRST, then dl then patch/activate/crack, then fuck off.  Why don't you pay for your shit instead of crying, or learn how to program. And to stoopidass1877 whatever the fuck, fuck off America sucks just like every other country."
