2011 collection from the beloved Irish Alt-Rock trio. The Best Of Ash documents the band's biggest hits and most loved songs to date. Opening with their breakthrough hit `Girl From Mars', the album also includes such defining Ash songs as the Ivor Novello-winning single `Shining Light', their highest charting single `Goldfinger', the enduringly popular `Burn Baby Burn' and live staple `Kung Fu'. In addition to the hits, the album also presents three of the band's less discovered gems with the progressive title track from the band's 2007 album Twilight Of The Innocents and two songs (`Arcadia' and `Return of White Rabbit') from their groundbreaking A-Z singles series. The album is completed with a brand new recording of `Jack Names The Planets' which originally featured on their debut EP `Trailer'.
