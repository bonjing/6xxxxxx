"Remember Me"

Cooper receives the surprise of his life when a 
woman from his past arrives at the practice; 
Addison consults her patient, Jodi, who is eight 
and half months pregnant and suffering from 
severe memory loss after a traumatic car 
accident; and Sheldon and Violet clash when 
their patient, Jodi's husband, Zach, considers 
leaving his wife and taking the baby with him.
