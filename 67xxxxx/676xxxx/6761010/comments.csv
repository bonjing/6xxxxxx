[T],sweetthing,2011-10-21T16:54Z,Love your uploads but please can you set your MP3 ripper to include track numbers.  It's a simple thing but take ages to put in by hand afterwards.  Thanks!
,musicfromrizzo,2011-10-21T17:17Z,Thanks - we normally do especially where its clearly relevant - such as our Supertramp Breakfast in America posting or Vivaldi's 4 Seasons etc. Sometimes the track numbers arent available for whatever reason and we only then apply them manually if justified. thanks for your comment Michael Rizzo
