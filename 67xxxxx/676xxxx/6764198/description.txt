REVIEWS
"This is the first documentary that I know of, that has united experts from the two worlds of biblical prophecy and the New World Order."
-- James Ainsworth, Fall River, MA

"I have been researching on my own, the issue of eschatology and the New World Order. I've seen many documentaries, and read a few books, but NEVER have I ever been so informed both in biblical and non-biblical sense about the history of the plans for the new world order. I have both part 1 and 2 but have not yet watched part 2 because part 1 has SO MUCH info in it that you have to either rewind some things, or just wait it out and let your mind absorb all the info that it provides on this issue. If you're like me and you like me, and this end times/ new world order tickles your nerve, get this video."
-- Jay

"An accurate Biblical and historical account of prophetic events. Put together very well, especially Daniel's prophecy."
-- Kelley Locke, Simi Valley, CA

"It is one of the most fascinating documentaries I have ever seen, largely due to information and history that has been withheld from the public at large."
-- James Ainsworth, Fall River, MA

"Excellent. Very comprehensive. The best we have seen."
-- Rita Williams, Cephas Ministry

"Very well done. Very powerful, cohesive and to the point."
-- Nicole Reagan, Van Nuys, CA

"Substantial and fast paced. Your presentation graphics were fabulous."

Megiddo II - The New Age:

The Lie of the Serpent is the second part of the controversial Megiddo series, which next focuses on the highly influential New Age movement. But is the New Age really new? Or does it represent the ancient doctrine taught by the serpent to Eve in the Garden of Eden? The answer will startle and amaze you as you learn the influence of the serpent's teaching through the spiritual explosion of occult activity in the 19th and 20th centuries.

Some of the greatest and most recognized people of the modern era (including Charles Darwin, Thomas Edison, Adolf Hitler and Hillary Clinton) have been influenced by the movement that has re-awakened mankind's communication with the spirit realm, and re-shaped the Western view of God and His relationship to mankind. What are the implications of this "paradigm shift" that seeks to introduce a new global consciousness? Will this new consciousness really bring mankind into the dawning of a golden era? Or the awakening of another dark age?

Full of highly detailed research and exhaustive documentation, Megiddo II challenges even the most skeptical viewer to consider the consequence of the global awakening taking place before our very eyes.

Join speakers Dave Hunt, Caryl Matrisciana, Dr. Kent Hovind, Pastor Joe Schimmel, and Dr. Stan Monteith who expose the movement that seeks to unite mankind in a one-world religion through the United Nations.

Global adherents claim to await a â€œuniversal Christâ€ to lead the world. What happens to those who will not follow this world leader? And are there sinister warnings against those who refuse to be â€œinitiatedâ€ into the New Age?

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.

RAPtURE (My transportation outta here).

The Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)

In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...

"And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.

"Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)
