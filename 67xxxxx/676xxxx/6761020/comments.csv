,junkman,2011-10-29T04:53Z,"THIS IS THE MOTHER OF ALL SHITTY FUCKING CAMS. THIS IS THE WORST QUALITY CAM I HAVE EVER SEEN IN 6 YEARS OF TORRENT DOWNLOADING.

1) 2/3 OF THE MOVIE IS IN VIRTUAL BLACKOUT BECAUSE THE CAM IS SO DARK. YOU CANNOT SEE WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING. YOU CANNOT HARDLY SEE THE CREATURE AT ALL AND THATâ€™S THE FUCKING POINT OF THE MOVIE. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THE EFFECTS ARE GOOD OR BAD YOU CANNOT TELL.

2) KEY SCENES FROM THE FILM ARE MISSING. THE FIRST THING ATTACK JUMPS STRAIGHT TO THE AUTOPSY AFTERWARDS. AND UNFORGIVABLY THE END SCENE THAT SETS UP THE 1982 "" THE THING"" MOVIE  HAS BEEN LEFT OFF.

3) THE SCREEN HAS BEEN FILMED AT AN ANGLE. DREADFUL INCOMPETENT JOB.

THE PERSON THAT FILMED THIS MUST HAVE DONE SO ON A 2003 CELL PHONE CAMERA AND IS COMPLETELY INCOMPETENT. DO NOT WASTE 1 HR AND 25 MINUTES (25 MINUTES SHORT) ON THIS ABOMINATION. YOU WILL CURSE YOURSELF IF YOU DO. AND YOU WILL STILL WANT TO SEE THE FILM AS YOU WILL NOT FEEL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN IT AT ALL BY WATCHING THIS TRAVESTY.

DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS PEICE OF FUCKING SHIT. FUCK THE CAM OPERATOR AND FUCK THE UPLOADER. I WOULD NOT PUT MY NAME TO THIS PILE OF FUCKING CRAP CAM!

A - 0/10
V - 0 /10
M - CAN'T SAY AS I STILL HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET."
,junkman,2011-10-31T18:43Z,"APOLOGIES TO THE ULTRATOTRRENTS. I SUPPOSE YOU JUST PUT UP WHATEVER'S OUT THERE. HOWEVER YOU SHOULD'VE SAID THAT SCENES WERE MISSING.

AS FOR THE CAM OPERATOR - HE SHOULD BE BEATEN TO DEATH WITH HIS OWN SHOES. "
