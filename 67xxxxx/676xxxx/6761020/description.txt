Readnfo:

Source was slanted and had alot of movement throughout
as well as subs in an unknown asian language
cut video into 24 pieces and cropped rotated and 
resized each then sharpened and tweaked RGB
Due to the movement being severe at times and fine at others
the AR will switch as some areas were overcropped to cut out 
as much camera shake as possible but a few minutes was removed 
from the middle due to losing all picture
Audio is LiNE hence the TS title so take it or leave it
