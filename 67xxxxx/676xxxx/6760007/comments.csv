thanks mate, I would love to see a headlight beam fix for all locos in rw3 any info on this ?"
,zzw1983,2011-10-21T15:21Z,@evil nemesis: Not sure. You'll probably have to edit the files yourself. Shouldn't be too hard to do. 
,Evil Nemesis,2011-10-21T17:49Z,"now that's what I'm asking on every single forum , but no one doing it, I'm not an expert in this, but still if you could do something for me I'll be really thankful to you. Plz if you have the files upload them here or somewhere else, I want High Headlight beam for all locos. Thank you very much mate"
,pfwolf,2011-10-21T18:10Z,"If I want to load the Amtrak Acela Express - Silver Star Route or the Acela Express Route in Career mode, then I get the following error:
Unable to load file - Tracks.bin -

If I choose Standard and not carrer mode evertything is working fine. Can anyone please help here.

If I load the business bullet in career mode it is also working fine."
,zzw1983,2011-10-21T18:58Z,"@evil nemesis: I really have no idea how to do it myself. Plus I have a ton of locos. If I ever figure it out I'll post a tutorial or the files themselves for sure. it's not a priority for me though having settled with no headlights for so long in RW2.

@pfwolf: There seems to be a bunch of unique issues with the scenarios for this. I'll try the scenario myself and report back."

,Evil Nemesis,2011-10-21T21:04Z,"thanks mate, but I think I would be waiting for an addon or patch, it's too tough for me."
,tristen1230,2011-10-28T04:31Z,Still don't work for me. I get broken consits. Missing the like passenger car.
,blurka,2011-10-29T19:18Z,Can this addon work if I actually bought this game through steam?... or do I have to pirate the game to get this to work?
,Golono,2011-11-04T16:23Z,"@blurka
Yes this works if you bought the game through Steam. Just follow the instructions in the description. Assuming you have your Steam folder in Program Files, the directory is Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\railworks"
,showitoff,2012-03-13T20:19Z,"zzw1983 Your a true virtual railfan! For taking the time to upload,seed and actually check back and answer questions! Nice! This works like a dream....no issues at all! Thanks for the hard work and effort!"
