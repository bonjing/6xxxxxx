 Battlefield 3 leaps ahead of its time with the power of Frostbite 2, the
 next instalment of DICE's cutting-edge game engine. This state-of-the-art
 technology is the foundation on which Battlefield 3 is built, delivering
 enhanced visual quality, a grand sense of scale, massive destruction
 dynamic audio and incredibly lifelike character animations. As bullets whiz
 by, walls crumble, and explosions throw you to the ground, the battlefield
 feels more alive and interactive than ever before. In Battlefield 3
 players step into the role of the elite U.S. Marines where they will
 experience heart-pounding missions across diverse locations including Paris
 Tehran and New York
