language is russian.
thereÂ´s a language torrent to solve this Battlefield.3-English.Language.Files

you have to apply the reloaded crack from reloaded

you might get one or two error messages that some .dll files are missing (i got D3DCompiler_43.dll and d3dx11_43.dll as being missing). google the name of the files, download them and simply put them in your battlefield 3 installation folder.

,Attakny,2011-10-28T19:09Z,"Great upload, workd like a charm. Just follow the instructions on how to get English language working.

Currently running this on my laptop:
AMD Phenom X2 N620 @ 2.8 GHz
ATI Mobility Radeon 5650 1GB
6GB RAM
WIN7 64 Bit

Performance depends on the mission environment. The game suggests mosly high and medium settings and for the most time it is playable. However in huge open reas, especially at night, the CPU struggles. 
Turned it all down to low now and the game still looks great and is playable at 20-30 fps. If you google a little you might find some tweaks for better performance.

IF your specs are beneath this you shouldn't even bother the download. The game will probably not run well. Multiplayer is gonna work better than singleplayer, but I think that eye-candy is kind a important in this game :)

When I have the chance I'll pick it up for my 360.

ok for people that want to know how to bypass origin and how to install english and so on just listen up I'll explain.

First step, You need to download This torrent ;) Next step download the English language torrent (just search battlefield 3 in the search bar) 

once downloaded mount the ISO using daemon tools or some other mounting software? you decide. 
A pop up should appear on screen (autorun) 
before you click autorun disable origin, right click on the task bar on origin and click Exit
 Then Just click Autorun and let it set up and install. shouldn't take any longer than 10 mins.
(this is what I done to get mine to work.) 
once installed run the game it will be in Russian Don't worry though. just bring up task manger and end task BF3.exe
go the dictionary where BF3 was installed. (C:\Program Files (x86)\Battlefield 3) now locate the folder /Loc (C:\Program Files (x86)\Battlefield 3\Data\Win32\Loc)
simple unrar the language files you torrented and drag n drop them in the LOC folder next to the RU language file's"
,purpleraver,2011-10-29T04:54Z,"and that's it done, all you need to do is set the language to English, http://www.cjs-cdkeys.com/battlefield-3-origin/reg.rar do this and it's done :) now you'll be ready to kick some AI arse, Well shoot em whatever ha. "

Worked for me 100% on (win 7 32bit , nvidia 9500 GT 1 Giga , 2 Giga RAM and CPU 3 GH Dual Core )


Battlefield 3 Double Sound Echo Fix By Dr Ali Aliraqi


Before you begin and load your mission (on Game Menu)

Press Alt + Tab then Task Manager then rigth click on BF3.exe then Set Affinity

after that unselect CPU 1 ( Select only CPU 0 )

you will notice that  double sound or sound echo disapear ...

But you will notice also that game will become slower (because only one CPU of dual core CPU worked) so you needed to reduce resolution ...


Note :Few Seconds after loading and beginning your mission you can reselect CPU 1 with CPU 0 and game will become faster ...

But But But double sound or echo reapear when new loading regain (loading regain when you kill or begin next mission etc ... ) ...


So Conclusion : Dual Core CPU is main cause of double sound or echo ...


So we are waiting  computer supporter that make patch or installer or anything for : ( battlefield 3 begin with single core CPU and converted to dual core 
CPU automatically few seconds after loading complete and when new loading reapear it converted to single core CPU automatically and it converted to dual core
CPU automatically few seconds after loading complete )   

It is so difficult but we are needing that ...

,Abbe-,2011-10-31T13:46Z,"hi guys,
it,s easy to change language to english,pls read the instruction of other downloaders,just like i did,here is the link,
step 1

http://www.cjs-cdkeys.com/battlefield-3-origin/bf3lang.html
donload link 1 and save.
you will get zip file by name- upp date-en-extrakat and open,there you get -en.sb- and -en.toc ,those two file you should replace them instead of russien,go the battlefild file and open,look after file name -Data- open it, look after file name - win 32 - and open look after file name - loc - open it here you should place the english files ubove.  
step 2
http://www.cjs-cdkeys.com/battlefield-3-origin/update-en.zip
save this file and extract you will get GDFBinary-en-us.dll
go back to where you opened battlefield 3 flie,you will see the icon of battlefield,bf3,go down to GDFBinary-ru-RU.dll ,and replace that by the file ubove.
step 3
http://www.cjs-cdkeys.com/battlefield-3-origin/update-en.zip
download this and save then extract,after that you will get battlefield 3-english-language. double klick to activate.
that,s it.

I hope i was helpfull."

yea,my system is too bad maybe,but i think its not so bad to have fucking 4-6 FPS on low settings..ive installed all drivers i should install..maybe im using Intel graphics instead ATI but i dont know where i could exchange that..i just searched in BIOS and nothin.."

,ubuntux21,2011-11-02T19:20Z,"@Gezzman26 

dude if u want a notebook or laptop for gaming ...buy an alienware 

or build a good PC yourself

with that intel graphic adapter ..u will never get good FPS on most of newest good games

i run this game arround 60 fps at 1440x990 resolution

My rig:

CPU: amd phenom II x4 965 3.4 Ghz
RAM: 4 gb DDR3 1333 Mhz
GPU: ATI HD 6870 1gb DDR5
HDD:500 gb 

save some money and build a nice rig...is not too expÃ¨nsive ...my rig is less than 800 $

or u can buy an ipad 2 for 700$ and waste your money listening itunes and reading ebooks ..its ur choice...also u can buy a ps3/xbox360 aswell..but you will get an reduced/lame vertion of the game  

also buy the game when u get a good PC...the multiplayer is awesome

Notebooks/tablets/laptops = work and casual games

Good PC = hardcore graphics games

good luck friend "
