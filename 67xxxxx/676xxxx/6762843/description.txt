Model Sailing Craft by W. J. Daniels and H. B. Tucker is a classic for all you model yacht builders and racers. This is the second edition published in 1936 by the Rudder Publishing Company. I have not seen this posted before so here it is. Also, this is my first torrent so I'm still getting the hang of it.
