Sex in a loving relationship can be the deepest and most meaningful experience a couple can share and yet many couples find themselves too time starved and intimacy shy to enjoy it.
Helping couples to overcome these barriers, Loving Sex offers friendly, frank exploration of what sex means as part of a loving relationship, and how you and your partner can experience it to its full potential.

Written by New York Times bestselling author Dr. Laura Berman, Loving Sex explores a different aspect of sexuality, from the anatomy and physicality of arousal and orgasm, to the psychology of lust, love, and partnership. Free from unrealistic media representations of perfect bodies and pornstar practices, Loving Sex shows you the positions that work, helps resolve common problems without blame or embarrassment, and explains just how important sex can be to long-term loving happiness................
