The Best of Eddy Arnold Greatest Hits and more (musicfromrizzo)

2GB mp3s collection - the bulk being either remastered 320k or greatly nice
quality 256k (which probably include some remastered tracks too that
simply aren't indicated as such) and a very small handful of 192k and even
a rare 128k gem or two in there that sound great and couldn't be left out.

It was conceivable to include everything this man had ever recorded as it all
goes down as easily as Crystal Gayle in a similar sort of style that tugs at
the heartstrings and sense of country kin. That said, this is a comprehensive
collection of all his greatest and best and even lesser known and most
importantly, the crucial additions to a single collection that others have
been content to miss - such as "You gave me a mountain" "Among my souvenirs"
and other such greatest songs of his singing talents.

Eddy Arnold was the most important man of his time in Country music for
the meaningfulness of his lyrics for country folk that seek meaning in all it
is they do and live with.

If you look to his yearning for an idealism in his style and focus of lyrical
themes to support his mindset and justify his existence at the level he felt
he could aspire to and be capable of, you'll find it as he does in his songs
- in the realization that there isn't any shortcut to simply callin it straight
and seeing it through that way in life. That's why country folk are so special
in my own books here too! There are some songs he sang which aren't in here 
perhaps, or rather certainly, however with all that's here, we have the essence 
and even a more than generous serving of Eddy Arnold to the point of avoiding 
belabor with what we can already enjoy enough of I think with this collection as 
it stands.
