,Pakundo,2011-10-24T07:35Z,"There's still no sound, and my PC is a 1000$ gaming rig..."
,Cerebral222,2011-10-24T15:30Z,"Game works well, sound is perfect; wish I could help you Pakundo, but I installed this game as I would any other game with no problems, you may be missing an Audio DLL file, I'm not sure, hope you figure it out. Thanks for the upload tim, no bugs, & a remastered classic working perfectly. Thanks alot for the upload. +1 from me, Cheers."

[T],ADHDerby,2011-10-25T16:09Z,"If the game doesn’t start, or if you don’t get audio, lower the sample rate of your sound-card to 48 kHz
Control Panel > Sound > select your default playback device > click Properties > Advanced Tab > change the sample rate to 48000 Hz"
,Porthos18,2011-10-26T16:15Z,"I can't get this too work. Downloaded, unrared, used daemon tools lite to install and placed the crack but whenever I try to run it I get a bunch of error messages and nothing else."
,Porthos18,2011-10-26T16:22Z,Unable to load GL function error pops with different variables pops up a dozen times and that's it.
,paulpicsou,2011-10-26T18:38Z,"I might be an idiot but where is the crack, I download, unrared and use deamoon tools but i don't know which file is the crack, normally it is a .exe file, no ?
When I try to run the game, I've got an error message, it says that the file X3DAudio1_7.dll is missing 
Can someone hekp me ? ( I also try to lower my sound card but it doesn't work)"
,Porthos18,2011-10-26T19:03Z,The crack is in the file named TinyiSO.
,paulpicsou,2011-10-26T19:18Z,"Well, actually I cannot open it because it says that the file .nfo may be incompatible or damaged ...
Is there another way to open it ?"
,Porthos18,2011-10-26T20:35Z,"Seriously, why do I have only 6 files in the mdk folder after it's installed? One of which is an 800 mb rar file. Shitty instructions."
[T],tim2251337x,2011-10-27T02:07Z,"First of all this is no different than any other .bin or ISO game FFS.

 Use universal extractor or 7zip to extract(preferably universal extractor for no errors).
Mount the .bin file or burn to disc.
 Run setup.exe to install the game.
Now,open the .bin file and look for the folder named TinyiSO.
Open that folder and copy the file inside.
 Paste it in the installed folder in your program files overwriting the existing .exe 
DONE


@ paulpicsou 
You are trying to open the NFO,,,,thats only a read me file,,,,,the crack is inside the extracted .bin file.

@ Porthos18
Have you ever installed a pirated game before?

"
,Porthos18,2011-10-27T08:03Z,"I did everything you listed, but when I try to start  I get a bunch of openGL error messages and nothing else."
,paulpicsou,2011-10-27T09:45Z,"Thank you tim for trying to help me ^^
There is 3 files that appears when I extract the folder. There is a .cue and 2 .bin (the fist one has 0Ko) But they all open with VLC media player so I can't see anything or take any files in it.
Which program do I need to use to open it ?"
,1TWISTED,2011-10-27T15:37Z,"thanks,.. nice upload,... well done,.. ; )"
[T],tim2251337x,2011-10-28T02:50Z,"use powerISO or Daemon tools,,,,and then you can mount the .bin file or just burn to disc with it.


VLC is trying to read it like a movie,,,,it's not made for this operation at all"
,sixor,2011-11-02T13:16Z,"thanks, works perfect, the new remake game is kinda shit, the textures are the same, the only new is enemies and characters, this is a shit console port,, there are no options for graphics, the game lags in my 965be + gtx460, hell no, the game is awesome if we skip the doctor parts"
