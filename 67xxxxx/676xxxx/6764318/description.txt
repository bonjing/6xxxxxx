Forget everything you've ever heard about Tori Spelling. OK, maybe not everything. Itâ€™s true, her dad is the most successful TV producer of all time and she did spend a decade playing the virginal Donna Martin on his hit show "Beverly Hills 90210." But now that Tori has left that zip code and her parents' mansion behind, she wants the same things we all do: friendship, respect, and love. Used to tabloid scrutiny, Tori navigates life with a self-deprecating sense of humor and the support of a loyal crew of friends sheâ€™s know since high school, along with her devoted manager, her beloved nanny, and her ever scrutinizing mother Kiki, the ultimate Beverly Hills housewife.

Starring Tori Spelling (90210), Zachary Quinto (Star Trek), and Loni Anderson (WKRP in Cincinnati). Also features Joe Manganiello (Spider-Man and True Blood) and Whoopi Goldberg.
