Thx! Been looking for a 720p version of this for a long time."
,canopener,2011-10-26T21:39Z,"Ooops, commented too soon. As the info states, it's not a 720p."
,amberleeway,2011-12-06T11:46Z,"I downloaded this and it wasnt even the second one, its the first. UGH."
,Nadey,2011-12-18T11:03Z,I just reported you for sharing crap and misleading customers. Hallelujah
,trother,2012-01-05T09:32Z,"amberleeway: This is Charlie's Angels Full Throttle from 2003! NOT Charlie's Angels from 2000! And Nadey, thank you! Download and check it out before you accuse me! "
,jly2k,2012-01-28T09:12Z,"Nice try, Trother. This *IS* Charlies Angels from 2000. Contrary to your insistence that Amberleeway is wrong, it is in fact you who are wrong (and perhaps trying to waste peoples' time).

I just watched the original Charlies Angels today. Downloaded your torrent to watch Full Throttle, and lo and behold it's the first one again.

Hopefully others will read this and not waste their time. Your reassurance that it was Full Throttle is why I downloaded it after all, so I'm here to dispel your myth."
,jly2k,2012-01-28T09:15Z,"And for reasons unknown this copy has a resolution of 720x336 and a filesize of 1.93GB, while the copy I have is 1280x528 at only 1.45GB. Looks better, has less size, and was actually named after the movie it actually is :P

If you think your copy here is Full Throttle then it makes me wonder if you watched both movies and had no idea it was the SAME movie? Oo"
,tarzanscousin,2012-03-28T20:06Z,"This is *not* Full Throttle, this is the first Charlie's Angels movie."
,touji_ryuuzaki,2012-04-25T14:44Z,Who ever uploaded this is either trolling or an ass hole. This is the 1st movie.
