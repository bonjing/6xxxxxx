I'd like to point out SOME of the information in this book is quite inaccurate. For instance, 7,000 bce ""for the first time people knew how to start a fire.""
This is inaccurate. In Jericho located in modern day Palestine was a mass city 9000 bce They had fire and wine. 
Second is plows which is said ""4000 bce"""" In Ancient Sumerian texts they spoke of farming and the tolls they used which included a plow. Made of stone and wood. 

There are several inaccuracies in this book through out.  "
