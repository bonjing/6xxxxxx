Looking at the technology all around us-and then explaining how it works, the How Things Work Encyclopedia lifts the hood of a car engine, gets inside a TV set, and discovers the power of invisible microwaves. With close-ups, cutaways, and diagrams bringing the technology to life, and timelines illustrating the development of inventions, challenging curiosity quizzes and fascinating facts, the How Things Work Encyclopedia lets children really see and understand what's going on inside.
