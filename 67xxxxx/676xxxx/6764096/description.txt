This a ZIP file that contains three product recovery image disks, those normally comes with a new Panasonic CF-73 Toughbook Series laptop computer, to fresh install Windows XP Pro. The CD part number is (MK1-XP1M-W)

Just unzip (using WINZIP) the three ISO images to your desktop and burn the three CDÂ´s images with any buning software. (like Magic ISO). 

Keep in mind that all CF-73 are not the same computer versions, some have different features and the restore CDÂ´s may wonÂ´t work. At the beggining the laptop computer will say that the restore installation CD not compatible with your computer. 

To donÂ´t waist blank CDÂ´s, I suggest to burn only the first CD and place it in the Toughbook laptop computer, then turn it "ON" or "Restart". 

At the very beggining, after the Panasonic logo comes out, the CD runs and will tell you if are the CDÂ´s for that machine or not. 

If shows to continue, then burn the CDÂ´s 2 and 3 and procede with the installation. 

Warning, this product recovery CDÂ´s set will restore Windows XP PRO SP1 with all drivers for a Panasonic Toughbook CF-73. You not need serial or activation numbers, when the restore procedure is done, everything is should be ready to go, Just like when you took the laptop out of the box when you bought it.

Please backup all your personal data because all data will be deleted !!! 

I hope this help you. Quiquichu
