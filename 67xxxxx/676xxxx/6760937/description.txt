First and foremost I want to say I didnt upload this for bragging rights or claim any \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"I did it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" first trophy.... Just noticed that there was only over 1 gb torrents of this movie on here. So I decided to compress the dvd and make it 700 mb, for people like me that do not want large files. Anyways enough of about that. Hope y\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'all enjoy and seed.

 
Two years after the bachelor party in Las Vegas, Phil, Stu, Alan, and Doug jet to Thailand for Stu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s wedding. Stu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s plan for a subdued pre-wedding brunch, however, goes seriously awry.

Stu is getting married. Along with Doug, Phil, and his soon-to-be brother-in-law Teddy, he regretfully invites Alan to Thailand for the wedding. After a quiet night on the beach with a beer and toasting marshmallows by the camp fire, Stu, Alan and Phil wake up in a seedy apartment in Bangkok. Doug is back at the resort, but Teddy is missing, there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a monkey with a severed finger, Alan\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s head is shaved, Stu has a tattoo on his face, and they can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t remember any of it. The wolf-pack retrace their steps through strip clubs, tattoo parlors and cocaine-dealing monkeys on the streets of Bangkok as they try and find Teddy before the wedding. Written by napierslogs
