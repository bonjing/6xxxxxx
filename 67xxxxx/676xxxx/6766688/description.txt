Release Notes....: If you haven't already noticed, Discovery Channel and many of its affiliates have been 
                   cutting their show runtimes down about 1min/hr for the last month or so. Their 
                   telecining patterns have also been erratic. Straight M-in-N decimation leaves frame 
                   blends and deblending filters seem to leave missing frames (as in this release). We 
                   can only assume that Discovery has employed the same frame raping as ABC. From now on, 
                   or until their shows are properly edited for the shorter length, straight 1-in-5 
                   decimation will be used since it seems more watchable than the alternative.
