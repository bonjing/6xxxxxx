       NIGHT ON BALD MOUNTAIN                                            
       Liz invites Michael to her unit's weekend retreat, to be held at  
        Judd Cutter's mountain cabin.  Michael brings his laptop along
        so he can work on a motion for "TaintedTush.com," a website
        Luther is representing.  Liz teases Michael by masturbating in
        the car en route to the cabin; when they arrive, they initiate
        sex, only to be interrupted by the arrival of the others,
        including Preston, Judd and his date, Jackee.
        Judd sees Michael as a rival.  He has loud sex with Jackee in
        the room next to theirs, so Michael and Liz fake a loud
        encounter to tease him.   Liz explains that Judd is jealous of
        what isn't his - in this case, her.  That night, Judd gets drunk
        and even more obnoxious.  He brings Michael's laptop, which
        shows the TaintedTush logo, outside and drops it.  Then he
        brings up his past affair with Liz.  The two men have words, and
        Judd comes after Michael.  When Liz tries to intervene, Judd
        shoves her.  Michael comes to her defense and punches Judd,
        breaking his nose.  Michael and Liz leave.  Preston, who writes
        in his spare time, records the incident.
                            
                                 
                                                  
      
            
                                                     
                                                 
                                                                      

      We know who we are, where we came from, and why we're here.
