,ryan1997,2012-01-23T16:17Z,"does this work on 5.50prom?
cause i tried to update to 6.60proB10 and it said this program is not supported by your FW or something like that, and the game gives me an error 8002013"
,shikibane,2012-02-23T10:33Z,This torrent of the game was giving me the same error everyone else was getting so i got an untouched iso from somewhere else and it worked just fine so its just this torrent this torrent may work for some but only the untouched iso has worked for me.
