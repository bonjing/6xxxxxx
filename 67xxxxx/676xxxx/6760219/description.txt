The most interesting thing about this movie was that a few of the cast members ended up having semi-successful careers. Danny Trejo (who genre fans will know from a variety of Robert Rodriguez movies) played a bad guy named Spider who couldn't keep his shirt on. The buff henchwoman was played by Raye Hollitt who fans of "American Gladiators" will know as Zap. She is also famous for a Playboy spread as well as a humorous scene in the John Ritter vehicle Skin Deep. Robert Pucci, who played Eric, went on to write The Corruptor starring Chow Yun-Fat and Mark Wahlberg. Director William Sachs had previously done The Incredible Melting Man and Galaxina.
