It takes more effort to make a bunch of .rar files than to just offer the original files and then something is consistently missing.  Most of an archive set is as useful as no files at all, and here's another example of an incomplete set.  Has a moderator noticed the pattern?"

RAR is for 60 meg hard drives on windows 95  not in this day & age its unrequired & totally useless considering most use the actual winrar tool which is hopeless for anythin other than 3 pics by email on dial up.well pissed off with npo game three now,spent all fuckin day d/l +they all no use"
