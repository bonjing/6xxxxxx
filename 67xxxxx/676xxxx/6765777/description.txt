They are widely accepted as part of the Neue Deutsche HÃ¤rte scene (alongside others such as Oomph!, Eisbrecher, and Die Krupps) and they are the genre's most successful band, achieving worldwide fame. Their songs are usually in German, but they have also performed songs entirely or partially in other languages such as English, Spanish, French and Russian.
