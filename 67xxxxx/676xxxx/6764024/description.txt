Poldark possibly stands out as one of the top examples of what a historical drama can be, when made by the BBC at its prime. If you like the Sharpe's series from the 1990's (starring Sean Bean), then you'll get an appreciation for it here. There's not as much pure action as Sharpe had, (there is action, just not as consistent as Sharpe's delivered), but you don't have to worry about getting bored either.

There's plenty of historical back stabbing, power grabbing, disaster reacting and love chasing to go around. There's trials, old mine's collapsing, cousin's drowning, cousin's you sleep with, 14 year old girls you marry later....you get the idea. Good old BBC drama at it's best, without the complete "chick film" feel you get from so many Jane Austin series that have been done. (Probably because here the main character is a guy). 




Tried to upload the classic BBC series of Poldark to tpb but it was not accepted 
due to being set to 'private'.

Therefore I have uploaded the torrent files in a separate torrent.

Merely download this torrent and then doubleclick on the contents.  It will then
open up in your torrent client so you can download both seasons of Poldark.

Enjoy and Seed!!
