   Type your message, and then just a few    
   mouse clicks can fax it, print it, e-mail 
   it, prepare an envelope, and print a      
   label. Best of all, leave your printer    
   settings alone. To mail your letter, just 
   stick an envelope where the paper goes    
   and let Easy Mail Plus handle the rest.   
   You can put a sheet of labels in the      
   printer, print the ones you need          
   immediately, and use the rest of the      
   label sheet another time. Built-in        
   importing uses easy drag-and-drop         
   technology to make it a snap to create    
   address files from your existing data     
   files. Use our predefined envelopes and   
   labels (metric and U.S.) or configure     
   your own. Use one of our logos, or any    
   BMP, GIF, JPEG, WMF, or ICO image. Drag   
   and drop addresses, logos, and bar codes. 
   Put post office bar codes on envelopes    
   and labels. Print to the entire list, one 
   at a time, or to selected addresses.      
   Print just one label or a few per sheet.  
   Print a full sheet of the same or of      
   different addresses.
