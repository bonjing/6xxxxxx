[/b][/color] Jessie is an 18-year old girl from a rural Texas town who moves to New York City.
She suddenly finds herself becoming the nanny of four children living in a multi-million dollar penthouse in a hotel after being pushed out of a taxi.
One of the youngest children just asks her to be her nanny and now Jessie has to get them to get along by keeping them from fighting.
One of the children has an imaginary friend and another has a pet water monitor lizard.
Assisting her is Bertram, a mean, lazy butler and Tony, a 20-year-old doorman who secretly likes Jessie.
