,jayzablade,2011-10-24T11:38Z,I usually download all wrestling from scene4all but for some reason all his stuff recently has had out of sync sound when played through my Cyclone +2 media player. My player is pretty damn good and plays everything so i dont know why this happens!! Im sure it plays fine through VLC on my laptop but that would kinda defeat the object!! Any ideas??
