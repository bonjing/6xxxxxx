  Release Info:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  With fast paced action, crushing hits and loads of room to 
  experiment, 3 on 3 NHL Arcade will have gamers from all walks
  of life excited about hockey. With no rules to hinder the action,
  deliver devastating checks that send your opponent over the boards
  and watch as he has to skate back onto the ice. If the goalie 
  comes  out of his crease to play the puck, check him. Exaggerated
  player-looks take center stage with 40 of the top NHL stars, 
  representing every team, skating around the miniature rink. With  
  game-changing power-ups falling on the ice throughout each session, 
  serious is not the name of this game. Fly down the ice with a 
  super-speed skater, and beat a giant sprawling goalie with a trick
  move for that highlight reel finish.
