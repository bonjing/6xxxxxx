       THE PROPOSITION                                                   
       A nude Liz paints the sleeping Michael, which leads to a paint    
        fight and sex.  Afterwards, she gives him a painting he admired.
        Real estate developer Mason Dorring admires it when he visits
        Michael's office, and Michael sells it to him for $20G.  Michael
        gives the check to Liz, who demands he get the painting back -
        she doesn't sell her work.  When Michael refuses, Liz goes to
        Mason's hotel room, demands the return of her painting, and
        punches a hole in the canvas when he refuses.
        In the meantime, Michael helps Jocelyn rewrite a speech she's
        giving at a trade conference.  The speech streams live, and it
        looks like a flop.  Michael dodges Jocelyn's calls, but finally
        decides to face the music:  what looked like stony silence was
        actually an audience of Danes too polite to laugh.  Liz
        reconsiders her behavior and allows Mason to select another
        canvas.  She tells Michael that, ever since her parents sold her
        grandmother's collection of travel souvenirs, she has been
        reluctant to part with anything that means something to her.
        Michael spots Mason's check under a snow globe (Liz's sole
        memento of her grandmother), and smiles to think that Liz is
        slowly letting her guard down.
                            
                                 
                                                  
      
            
                                                     
                                                 
                                                                      

      We know who we are, where we came from, and why we're here. Do you?
