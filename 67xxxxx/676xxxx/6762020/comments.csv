You may need to go to the dBpoweramp site in order to download the free codec you need.

Take care

For the love of God, if you're gonna post a nearly 17GB file, do it in a format that more than 7% of the computing public uses regularly. Yeah I can figure out how to do what you suggested, but it would have made a lot more sense to post in FLAC. It's ridiculous to expect the public to conform to you rather than the other way around."
,fuzzybrain,2011-12-29T22:23Z,apple lossless? are you insane?
,explosivefrostbite,2012-03-07T12:44Z,"neil1966hardy fantastic upload great work but please upload in flac and not in this format. we don't care of compatibility dude we just want quality and satisfaction. We can convert flac files to whatever format whenever needed, so please do it in flac only. But however its the complete edition with few missing tracks."
