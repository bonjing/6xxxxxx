You need to download before you can upload.
Braindeads -.-

,jordanh,2011-10-25T11:50Z,"Thanks Dude, ive been waiting for this one for a while now ;)
Come on people seed, everyone else wants to play this too!"
,Amiths,2011-10-25T11:53Z,"Seed please! Im uploading at 100kb/s and downloading at 1.5kb/s -.-"""
,agoss70,2011-10-25T12:26Z,First game I encountered that is so bad that I even wont have it for free. You all people simply waste our bandwidth downloading this crap. Buggy beyond believe and only campaign mod available. One can sell anything these days it seems...
,ncrosanct,2011-10-25T12:28Z,"In Win7 64 bit: when started a garbled text box pops up with on an OK option, screen goes black, taskbar pops on black screen, screen goes black again, and finally the game quits. I tried the crack/crack fix but all that does is pop up 2 instances of program not responding."
,huldu,2011-10-25T12:45Z,^ Same problem but 32bit. 
,Bjorta31,2011-10-25T12:57Z,"I cant get sound in the game, and the update crack fix work 100% thanks 

any one now how to get sound in the game??"
,ironymon,2011-10-25T13:08Z,"Works good so far, the one thing i didn't like is random hieroglyphs, most likely this copy of the game came from Asia, anyway it is in ENGLISH just download crack and crack fix and apply where the game exe is located."
,ironymon,2011-10-25T13:09Z,If your on windows 7 run in compatibility mode Windows xp sp 3 or similar.
,Lightning2,2011-10-25T13:23Z,Hi it gives me some kind of Chinese error when I extract stronghold3.rar and put the crackfix and crackfile on it
,Lightning2,2011-10-25T13:27Z,"would like some kind of guide how to install since I tried:

Download > Extract stronghold3.rar > put crack files in

Stronghold3\ALI213\stronghold3\stronghold3\bin\win32_release

Doesn't work..?"
,Groundunit,2011-10-25T14:03Z,I need help... The stronghold3.exe won't extract for me. It did the first time then it just disappeared because Norton removed it
,Atharol,2011-10-25T14:17Z,".Dude

First of all Crack only in the botton of your description. Lol why? its not the crack only

And you got 2 files that semse to be very wierd.
Semse like a japanese virus or somthing."
,danyjr,2011-10-25T14:50Z,"Just download the Crack fix on top of comments.
The game is awful though. Very buggy."
[V],.Dude.,2011-10-25T15:04Z,Atharol: I pasted the link for crack only which didnt show up in the description :P
,thermobaric,2011-10-25T15:16Z,"ok.. i downloaded it and i extracted it but now i get some wierd chinese shit? what is this?

next time plz upload english shit or make a guide.. this is shit what nobody can use"
,yyourmom,2011-10-25T16:54Z,"Im using bitcomet and the download stops and a red cross shows beside the torrent name and the error says this: 
Stopped [Error: The requested lookup key was not found in any active activation context]???"
,Atharol,2011-10-25T16:56Z,"Dude. YOUR A FKING IDIOT

This is a Virus DONT DOWNLOAD IT"
,Atharol,2011-10-25T16:59Z,"VIRUS

DONT DOWNLOAD IT.

Report .Dude"
,Jaed3n,2011-10-25T17:35Z,Virus do NOT download this.
,nr14,2011-10-25T17:50Z,"Seemed to fishy so i deleted it, also, how the hell was i supposed install it? In the archive there was a folder, in the folder there was what seemed to be an install file, I ran it but since there were three buttons all with kanji and a bar with more kanji, I simply decided: ""no, fuck this"" and deleted it. I hate it when people don't even try to translate, especially when the game is in English."
,Dimmis80,2011-10-25T18:53Z,"Guys chill out...!@.Dude. has a Trusted status Skull so i don't think that this guy changed sudenly and now uploading Virus-Crapp or bullshit stuff.!!I remember @.Dude. for ages here in PB and it brings good stuff..And about this game i remember ""Red Orchestra 2-Heroes of Stalingrand"" from the same ALI 213 dude and the installation was all in Chinese or something but the game was in English incide the menus and game and stuff.It might be kinda strange sometimes or difficult but i think that this torrent works.I will try it and post later the results.."
[V],.Dude.,2011-10-25T19:03Z,Atharol: Go report it Dumbfcuk!
,Amiths,2011-10-25T19:05Z,I totally agree with @Dimmis80. Its not easy to win a Trusted Skull if you upload virus. Again like Dimmis80 i dont think that he would change that. After i finish the download i'll run NOD32 and Kaspersky to prove that its not a virus. But its funny how people delet the game just because the menu is in japanese/chinese. I already got a lot of games that were in strange languages (like Russian) and they worked fine.
,Amiths,2011-10-25T19:06Z,"And i know Dude's work here on PB, i already got like 5~8 games from him and i never had ANY problem.

@.Dude. - Dont worry about them! They'r like 5%. 95% thanks you for the fast upload. :D"
,xspark,2011-10-25T19:24Z,"completely agrees with amiths..
that stupid atharol is a NOOB ASSS..
dude dont mind him.."
,nbnf,2011-10-25T19:32Z,"SEEEEEEEEEEEEEED YOU FUC*ING PIECES OF SHIT !!!!!!!!!!!
OMGGGGGGGG"
,Dimmis80,2011-10-25T19:36Z,AMIN to that @Amiths...Thats for sure..
,StefanGavrila,2011-10-25T19:46Z,"I've downloaded and played the game for a few hours. There are no viruses/trojans in the torrent and the game is utter crap, borring and buggy."
,Hakito,2011-10-25T19:58Z,"Tested on: Win7 Ultimate 32bits.

Result: Doesn't work.
There is no readme in english, and probably the game isn't in english either.
Changing compatibility doesn't do a damn thing.
The crack and crack fix don't do a damn thing.
Updating drivers doesn't do a damn thing.
It's not an iso, so most likely there is no installation, and neither is there a way to find out, because everything is chinese and fucking russian.

Recommended course of action: *Delete*, *Sigh*, waste of bandwidth."
,Dimmis80,2011-10-25T20:01Z,I just test it and it works flawlesly just great...I was sure about it and @.Dude. deliver it great like always..It gave me a false Positive from my Avira AntiVir but its a false positive about the exe.And for all the Noobs and Dumbfucks that said that it don't work first u idiots do your homework and then learn to try and first test and then say that it wont work or that is a virus or bullshits like that..!!How i make it work.Very fuckin simple.Its Direct play style.Just extract it then Copy/Paste the Crack our uploader gaves incide-Stronghold 3\bin\win32_release and put there the crackfix to.All great.Again a big thanks to our good uploader mister @.Dude.You are the man..
,Amiths,2011-10-25T21:13Z,"Thank you @Dimmis80 for the tip! :)

Im looking forward for this game."
,fallenwwn,2011-10-25T22:14Z,SEED PLEASE!!!
,SoulSauce,2011-10-25T22:22Z,"wtf makes someone think this is a virus because it has a language other than english?  especially since Dude is trusted...

Thanks, been waiting for this game."
,Dimmis80,2011-10-25T22:50Z,Don't mention it mate @Amiths.About the Visuals are kinda dated mediocre and very similar to Stronghold 2 or is my Graphics Card and system problem or something else.!?I found them very mediocre and it don't look like a game that needs a lot of power to play it.How u guys find them do u like them or not.??
,Amiths,2011-10-26T00:33Z,"Im here to say that the torrent works! Im using Win 7 x32 and its working without any problem. Just read Dimmis80 that show how to play the game. There is a Free Build, a map editor and of course the campaing (Peace and War). Now lets wait for a patch to fix the bugs. :)

Godspeed!

Thx again Dude for this game! :)"
,Amiths,2011-10-26T00:37Z,"Dimmis80 - Well the game looks a little more ""realistic"" and maybe darker. There is a improvement over Stronghold 2 but not to much. =/"
,lordme93,2011-10-26T00:58Z,works fine
