Notes: We were kids then, but now we're older. We have teens and a house in Boulder. Once a year we vacation in the Florida Keys. Now you're saggy, you wear a one piece. I have nose hair, I don't like swimming. The pool is just a different place where we can read, just you and me. And as we walked to our hotel, I smelled that same old coconut smell. Your silver hair reflected the light and I realised... Amanda you're an angel!
