I just fail to understand why anyone would go through the trouble themselves and then make the unfortunate leecher also waste 5, 10 minutes of his time to unpackage it. It's just really fucking stupid.

I noticed after downloading this that it was in RARs. I then decompressed it using 7-zip only to get a message about halfway through that the drive I was doing it in had run out of space. Then I extracted it to another partition, upon which it turned out that one of  the files in it is broken and it stopped at about 98%. So that's 6 GB of bandwidth I just wasted. 

Perhaps there's an obscure technical advantage to be had from uploading torrents in RARs but I fail to see it. Just seems like a completely unnecessarily hassle to me. And hey, I know it's free but my time and internet connection aren't, so fuck you very much sceneline."
