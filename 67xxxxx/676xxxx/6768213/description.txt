Statistics for the Life Sciences, Fourth Edition, covers the key concepts of statistics as applied to the life sciences, while incorporating the tools and themes of modern data analysis. This text uses an abundance of real data in the exercises and examples, and minimizes computation, so that readers can focus on the statistical concepts and issues, not the mathematics. Basic algebra is assumed as a prerequisite.
