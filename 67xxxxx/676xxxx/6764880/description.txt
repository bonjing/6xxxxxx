This is possibly one of the most important books you will ever hold in your hands. Its aim is to help
bring the sanity of peace to a world wracked by the madness of violence. It will train workers in
Caritas to incorporate conflict prevention, peacemaking and reconciliation into their work as part
of Caritas Internationalis (CI), an international Confederation of 154 Catholic relief, development
and social service agencies working in 198 countries and territories â€“ one of the largest
humanitarian networks in the world.
