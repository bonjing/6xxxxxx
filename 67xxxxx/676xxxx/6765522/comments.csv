,artgrrrl,2011-10-29T16:28Z,"I haven't been able to find last night's episode of Kitchen Nightmares, but I found this, so it's a nice consolation. I wasn't even aware Restaurant Impossible had a second season, so thanks very much!!"
,Eddiehjjjfcfjfc,2011-10-30T05:33Z,I don't see how it's possible to turn around a failing restaurant in 2 days.  I think on Kitchen Nightmares it's 4 days and even that is very short.  But 2?!
,slasherman,2011-10-30T21:31Z,"agree, the concept is pretty stupid why not use more time? But Irvine is pretty entertaining to watch....but I liked Dinner Impossible better"
,arnoldlayne3,2012-01-16T21:27Z,excellent upload@!  but please seed......it is rather slow.....
,arnoldlayne3,2012-01-16T21:51Z,"oops, my last comment was meant for part 2 of season 2....sorry"
