Shot in 2001, "Slaughterhouse of the Rising Sun" used the same concept that "Grindhouse" did 6 years later. The marketing people had the same issues as they did for "Grindhouse" -- and cut a trailer and marketed the film out of fear that people would think this really was a film from 1972. Distributed by ThinkFilms / Intl. Sales by Dream Entertainment. The film is available for rent/purchase through Hollywood Video, Netflix, Amazon and other video stores and online retail stores -- in over 12 countries worldwide
