Movie Summary:

Lilo is a 5 year old Hawaiian girl who's quite peculiar: she has
an off beat take on life and is a little obsessed about taking care
of downtrodden animals. for example, she collects cans and bottles
to recycle from the beach and buys fish food with the money she makes,
then paddles out in the ocean to feed the fish there. Meanwhile, on a
distant planet, alien authorities have captured the most dangerous of
all criminals and are sending him via rocket to a prison planet.

This is stitch.
