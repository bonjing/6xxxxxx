,darkscale,2011-10-27T04:22Z,just fyi: the CP numbering is off by one. This is actually eps 1441. There were 3 episodes that were not aired. Check out the wiki here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_episodes#Pok.C3.A9mon_.28Pocket_Monsters.29:_Best_Wishes.21_.28Series_4.29
,Peskens,2011-11-01T22:42Z,"The Numbering is correct.

Only episode 24 and 25,  Team Rocket VS Team Plasma are not aired.

Hikari - A New Journey!/Nibi Gym - The Greatest Danger is not legit."
