SUMMARY......: 
Adam and Jamie test three viral videos featuring the extraordinary excavator:   
Can it really row a barge? Be used to go wakeboarding? Perform seemingly        
impossible feats of acrobatics? Then -- using only duct tape -- Kari, Grant,    
and Tory attempt to patch up a plane that's had an unfortunate encounter with a 
bear.
