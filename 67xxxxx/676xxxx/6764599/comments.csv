,sun83kim,2011-12-03T23:01Z,"Works perfectly as described.

Make sure you also download the skidrow update as mentioned by the above poster @

https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6783627/The.Haunted.Hells.Reach.Update.1.and.2-SKIDROW_%5BALEX%5D

The update fixed the difficulty of the gaming because alot of people were complaining how hard it was.

Windows XP sp3, E8500 with GeForce 9500GT and runs smooth.

Fun game similar to killing floor. Under appreciated by most; wait till you start chaining your attacks from gun to melee continuously. It gets much better :)"
