Clash of unbeaten giants



BarÃ§a host Sevilla at the Camp Nou at 22.00 (R@dio BarÃ§a) this evening in a game that brings together two sides that have yet to lose this season and that have the best defensive records in La Liga. Also tonight, Cesc is back.

The visitors at the Camp Nou tonight are Sevilla, ï¿½â‚¬Å“one of the big teams in La Ligaï¿½â‚¬Â, according to FCB coach Pep Guardiola  . The game brings together the teams currently lying in first and fourth place in the league table. 

Barcelona have been on stunning home form in the championship so far, where they have scored 21 goals in four games and not conceded any. 

Cesc returns 

BarÃ§a can welcome back Cesc FÃ bregas  this evening after he was declared fully recovered from his hamstring injury on Friday. The only players still sidelined are PiquÃ©, Alexis and Afellay. Reserve player Isaac Cuenca, who made his Champions League debut on Wednesday, has been involved in training sessions with the first team this week and may be back in the team to face Sevilla in what will be the third game for the Catalans at the Camp Nou in just seven days. 

Two tight defences 

BarÃ§a and Sevilla, along with Levante, are the only teams that have yet to lose a game in the league. The Catalan and Andalusian sides also have incredible records in defence. VÃ­ctor ValdÃ©s has just kept five consecutive clean sheets in league and Champions League matches, while Javi Varas picked the ball out of the net last week for the first time in 443 minutes. Along with MunÃºa of Levante (3 goals) these are the goalkeepers with the finest records in the championship. 

Three major absentees 

Marcelino GarcÃ­a Toral is arriving at the Camp Nou without three very important players, namely the suspended Spahic and the injured Perotti and Negredo. Sevilla have drawn all three of their road games so far this season.
