[/b][/color] Five million years ago, the Atlantic Ocean covered North America all the way to the Ohio Valley.
As the ocean receded to form our present-day geography, a family of squids was stranded in a remote setting in the North Georgia mountains.


This motley melange of mischievous mollusks, influenced by the rural ways of the redneck locals, quickly "adapticise" to a world of fighting, feuding and fornicating with a Faulknerian flamb?? of ferocious sea creature livin'. The humor lies in the "adapticization."
