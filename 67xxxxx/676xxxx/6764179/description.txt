                         |Falcon 4 BMS 4.32 1.04 realism mod|          
                          ----------------------------------

This mod is appliable without the need of the previous version, and goes directly over the game's main folder.       




This mod provides the following:
--------------------------------


-Most of the missile's flight models closer to their real behaviour and performance values

-The SA-10 now has a hearable warning on the RWR when it locks on and fires

-The SA-10 now has two missiles in the air, just like the real one

-The F-14's advanced flight model has minor changes to the CG, making it more stable at higher alpha, and it's closer to the real thing's behaviour

-The F-16's advanced flight model has minor changes to the CG, and now it may do more stable loaded rolls, without departing due to the CG being too far
back initially (inertia coupling + CG combination made it more unstable than the real F-16), and it now respects the real F-16's flight envelope

-Many aircraft's maximum reachable speed depending on altitude and acceleration levels have been revized and have their realistic value

-MIG-29 can go supersonic in vertical climb (at lower than 50% fuel state), just like the real aircraft

-MIG-23 now has it's realistic acceleration diagrams, which depend on altitude, payload and airspeed

-Cobra manoeuvres can now be done with the Su-27/30/33/35/37, Mig-29's, F-14's, aswell as the powerloop with the F-22 Raptor, when using the CATIII config

-Also the F-18E/F Superhornet can reach higher AOA (up to 50 degrees), with less limitations from the flight controls, just like the real aircraft

-The Javelin missile has it's realistic range and burn time achieved



Fixes over the previous mod versions:
---------------------------------

-Fixed a bug where the F-14 could not takeoff or land

-The AGM 158 JASSM missile now has a more realistic range and characteristics

-The AGM 154A/C JSOW missile now has a more realistic range and characteristics

-Aim-9x has 120 degrees off boresight maximum angle

-Iris-T has 160 degrees off boresight maximum angle

-Aim-132 Asraam has 90 degrees off boresight maximum angle

-R-73 Archer (AA-11) has 67 degrees off boresight maximum angle

-The zoom levels for both FOV and EXP modes on the AGM-65/AGM-154/AGM-158's TV are more realistic, also the units appear more correctly





***IMPORTANT***

THIS MOD IS A MULTIPLAYER CRITICAL, SO ALL WHO WANT TO PLAY ONLINE SHOULD HAVE IT, OTHERWISE THERE WILL BE REALISM DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PLAYERS...!






Always check for new updates...!


Enjoy,

Have a Falcon day!
