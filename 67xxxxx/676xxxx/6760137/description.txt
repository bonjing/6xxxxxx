The previous "scene" 720p rip of this episode had the wrong audio attached (had audio from ep 1 instead) and so never seemed to make it to the torrents. I grabbed that file and one of the low-def rips from here and remuxed the audio together and it seems to work pretty well. There is some video corruption around 29 minutes but the audio still stays in sync - I'd still prefer to watch this than a low-def rip. Enjoy :)
