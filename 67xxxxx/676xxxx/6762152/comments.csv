,geuheo28,2011-10-23T01:24Z,yeah i don't know guys i believe you guys that it doesnt have a pw on it now and thats why i'm redownloading it but obviously me and some other people on here got the wrong file or something from this torrent cuz it's on my computer wasting space waiting for a pw lol. but i know this one i'm downloading is probably legit because like i said it's a bunch of rars and not one big 7gb rar.

Doesn't work for me even after attempting Multi-man permissions fix and running EBOOT fix + EBOOTMOD

Anyone get this running on 3.55 CFW? "
,tom7900,2011-10-26T16:32Z,"Can someone tell me where can I get the PC version?
Yes,there IS a PC version.
Searched all pages,IGN,Wikipedia,Machimina,ETC."
,reign_873,2011-10-27T12:28Z,We just need a EBOOT.BIN fix for this game to run on kmeaw 3.55! And there is no fix for now! Must wait!
,XLR8BG,2011-10-27T22:08Z,"@tom7900 The PC version comes out a ~month after the console, so wait for it."
