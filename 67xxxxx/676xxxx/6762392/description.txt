On August 31, 1970, a 35-year-old Leonard Cohen was awakened at 2 a.m. from a nap in his trailer and brought onstage to perform with his band at the third annual Isle of Wight music festival. The audience of 600.000 was in a fiery and frenzied mood, after turning the festival into a political arena, trambling the fences and setting fire to structures. As Cohen followed the incendiary Jimi Hendrix, onlookers watched in awe as the Canadian folksinger-songwriter-poet-novelist quietly tamed the crowd.

This CD/DVD package contains the new beautiful film by Academy Award-winning documentary filmmaker Murray Lerner (From Mao to Mozart, Festival, Message to Love) as well as Cohens full performance on CD. Experience the energy, drama and magic of the 1970 Isle of Wight music festival through the songs, musings and poetry of a true legend - Leonard Cohen.
