Have you watched we have many things in common?

1. We got promoted by a same mod on a same day.
2. Our area of interest / upload (e-book, then music).
3. Our country (most probably) ...

Keep up good work. :)"
[V],_F1_,2011-10-23T18:02Z,(on your comment) - Yep!!! Our country is different. Your country is 'Planet Earth' and mine is 'Library' ... :)

,riahc3,2011-10-25T12:38Z,"Jedi Mind Tricks (Vinnie Paz) posted this on their Facebook wall. Laughable:

""
music being leaked doesn't mean you have to FUCKING STEAL IT. Its like dealing with fucking retards. I've worked with the same engineer forever. you think a GROWN ASS MAN would risk his career to put a fucking cd online? and IM the fucking A&R. and NO producer has any mixed songs. just me. retail gets music 7-10 days in advance. XXL and The Source get advance copies for review. everyone is clearly... missing the point: music is going to leak. you don't think after 20 years in the game that we KNOW that? I've sold half a million units ON MY OWN, I don't need amateurs waxing poetic about ""how"" its happening. not only do these morons STEAL MY SHIT, but they steal it BEFORE the release date and critique it like they're Robert fucking Christgau. when I didn't like shit, I just didn't talk about. one thing I learned over the years: critics are always retards, failed musicians, or sound men. in SOME cases all 3. If you don't like somebody's shit, don't buy it and shut you fucking mouth. If you dig it, support said artist. don't steal someone's livelihood then go online and fucking cry about it like a faggot. and don't tell me its ""part of the game"". I was part of the game before it was called the ""game"". I'm gettin on my Jay and Silent Bob shit and going to everyone's crib and punching them dead in the face.
""

Whats laughable about it is that he himself problably does or has done it. He needs to stop bitching and realize that if you are independent you are in it for the love of the game if you are on a major you are in it for the cash. Cant have both."
,Shaka420,2011-10-25T13:39Z,"@riahc3

Hahahaha, I saw that in Facebook too. That's what brought me here. Fuck him. Good music though."

,sotegihe,2011-10-25T17:38Z,"haha yeah I saw it at the facebook page aswell, just pathetic. he also brags about having sold over 500 000 copies, then so what? What are u bitching about? time to live up to what ur saying in the texts lmao. greedy son of a bitch."
[T],theLEAK,2011-10-25T19:32Z,"@riahc3
