MODIFICATIONS

Need For Speed Shift 2: Unleashed music:

___
ETC
Drift music:
- While extracting goes fine, the files are not. They stutter when played. There might be another algorithm besides the key. But...since it sounds like the drift music is just a distorted version of the normal racing music, it's not worth it.
