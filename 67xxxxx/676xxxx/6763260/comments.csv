,immagical,2011-12-10T13:19Z,"Hi there NIcko7,.  dont know if you still check these comments but i'll leave them anyways..

because i dont know what this game is trying to manipulate other programms on my system i have used it in a old laptop first to see what will happen..   i run the application and then the virus scanner tell me what i have mentioned above in other comment about the ""global windows messaging hook""  so when it askes me what to do about it, i select it to block the permission,.  anyways that being done the game loads up no prob's with no results in vurus..  but when playing the game, thereis no sound at all,  the game is in total silence,, so i need help with this,.  

do you know there is no sound??
do you think it has something to do with the global messaging hook?
and if not have you got a fix for it so i casn get the sound?

please reply if you still look at these comment..

thanks in advance. :)"
,nicko7,2011-12-14T09:55Z,"@immagical I'm sorry I haven't got back to you, I can't explain how it is trying to terminate your files, I just don't understand why it would do that, this is a Rip from the C-D itself, needs no install, maybe try it on your desktop if you have one, the sound issue I can explain, there was an error when ripping the game, saying could not rip audio files, hence why I put the (NL Sound) on the end of the title. Hope I Helped, and again I'm sorry "
,immagical,2012-05-05T21:44Z,"Ye Thanks for the reply.  :)

About the ""windows messaging hook""  it doesnt do it anymore so i have no idea myself what that was all about or why it was even relating it to the game.   i can only assume it must have been something going wrong on my laptop at the time i was opening the game file..

About the sound, :S  i missed that at the end where it Clearly states """"NL"""" :S
Maybe it you could upload me some ""glasses"".. lol. "
