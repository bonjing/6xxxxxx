Captured with a fairly old capture card with composite, rather than component cables, the file size is more than I hoped for, I did get it down to 369mb, but just too boxy for me, as this is for my own archive, I wanted a bit better quality, so sorry in advance for the file size, I\'m only uploading because no-one else has bothered to at this point.

Test the quality if you want by downloading the sample first.

All the best.
