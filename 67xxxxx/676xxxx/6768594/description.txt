◘◘ Right, the whole reason of the READNFO on this is to point out     ◘◘
◘◘ some of the negatives and to give thanks. So a big thanks needs    ◘◘
◘◘ to go to those wizards at KiNGDOM (DiGiDEATH) for doing a beyond   ◘◘
◘◘ fantastic job on the sources, the video and audio have been        ◘◘
◘◘ filtered beyond belief, so i want to thank them for their original ◘◘ 
◘◘ work, without it this encode would not be what it is now. Ok now   ◘◘ 
◘◘ to move onto one of the worst issues, which isn't that bad: "JRRG" ◘◘                                                                    
◘◘ have hardcoded there logo on the vid. It apears aprox 3x in the    ◘◘            
◘◘ movie and only lasts for a few secs. I didnt blur this, out of     ◘◘ 
◘◘ respect for my source. I have also respected that, and have left   ◘◘ 
◘◘ the logo, don't worry it isn't really bold and doesn't make any    ◘◘ 
◘◘ part of the movie really unviewable. So nothing serious. Now,      ◘◘ 
◘◘ you are probably wondering why we are releasing a CAM, as a TS is  ◘◘ 
◘◘ already out. The reason for this is the same as what DD said, the  ◘◘
◘◘ "LiNE" audio is pretty horrible and in many instances the CAM      ◘◘
◘◘ audio was better and easier to clean up. So now for the last part  ◘◘
◘◘ of the READNFO part: This is much better than the older CAM's      ◘◘
◘◘ going around, which we very very dark. Don't expect wonders as     ◘◘
◘◘ this is still dark in the dark scenes, only difference is that you ◘◘
◘◘ you can actually see more of what's happening this time around.    ◘◘
◘◘ As always, it's free so why complain? Right that's the whole READ- ◘◘
◘◘ NFO part over. Now work done; we took the sweet source from DD,    ◘◘
◘◘ Dropped it in for conversion, whilst it was there we added a few   ◘◘
◘◘ filters of our own, before then tweaking our custom encoding setti-◘◘
◘◘ ngs and converting down to a 500mb file. Looks way better than our ◘◘
◘◘ V1. The audio sounds way better, but don't expect studio quality,  ◘◘
◘◘ it's still a bit muffled and has some minor issues, but it's free  ◘◘
◘◘ and the best out so you can't complain. Ok nothing more to say     ◘◘
◘◘ except another big thanks to the Wizards at KiNGDOM and ENjOY! ☻   ◘◘
