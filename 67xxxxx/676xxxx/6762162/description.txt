Are you eating more than you should? Trapped in a constant cycle of dieting? Perpetually anxious about your weight, shape and size? Many of us fight an ongoing battle with food. 

Understanding Your Eating can help you if the way you use food bothers you and you feel it is beyond your control. Author Julia Buckroyd uses the term disordered eating rather than eating disorders, to reach out to everyone who is distressed and miserable about food.

Understanding Your Eating will help you become more aware of your feelings towards food, understand your emotional eating, and explore the reasons behind your challenges, so that you can find other ways of managing your day-to-day experiences.
