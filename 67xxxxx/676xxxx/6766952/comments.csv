,tiss2,2011-10-24T20:33Z,Poor download speed.. go for sceneline
,ptl_base,2011-10-24T21:21Z,"@eztv I noticed you usually upload multiple formats of the same show, why do you not upload an AVI file of this show. I have to go elsewhere to get it VTV.

I like to stream to my PS3 and X-Box and they don't support mkv files.

Please upload in AVI also. Thanks."
,mooncar,2011-10-24T21:40Z,"Video 4 (looks worse than an 350 MB avi)
Audio 4

Worst 720p release i've seen."
,ghostkernel,2011-10-24T21:56Z,LEGIT. A10 V10 HD quality Thank You!
,Mitch0133,2011-10-24T22:06Z,@ptl_base Download XenonMKV its real easy to use and automatically changes the format to a playable format for xbox 360/ps3 
,cjohny24,2011-10-24T22:37Z,"Thanks in advance! 
With you it's always right ;)"
,paulosty,2011-10-24T23:19Z,U the best! Love ya!
,ThomasJones19,2011-10-25T02:11Z,"Brilliant torrent!

A: 10
V: 10

Anyone else think that the episode itself ended quite abruptly? I actually thought part of the episode was missing until I spoke to an American friend who watched it on AMC and he confirmed that's how the episode actually ended, such a great cliff hanger!! Can't wait for next week's episode! 

Keep up the great work eztv!!! :)"
,dswatson44,2011-10-25T04:18Z,"@ptl_base
One of the best things about the ps3 is the fact that it CAN read mkv files. Ps3 media server is a good program to use to stream the files. 1080 and 720 files can be viewed easily using this format unlike the xbox. Curious about how you didn't know this..."
,cukitas,2011-10-25T05:26Z,Thanks!!
,funkrat,2011-10-25T05:53Z,"Totally crap.

Video : 7
Audio : 5

Audio out of sync?! WTF. Almost unwatchable."
,DalittleBIGmen,2011-10-25T06:23Z,"Can someone confirm the out sync audio problem, please!

There are some complaining about this. I won't like to download and then deleted cuz it is unwatchable. I prefer downloading a good copy and seed as much as I can.

Thanks for the replies. "
,zepplin10,2011-10-25T07:44Z,"My copy got corrupted somehow, so I deleted it.  No ranking on eztv though, they usually come through for me."
,TerFar,2011-10-25T10:00Z,"Sound track is total crap and makes this unwatchable. Please turn off the Auto sound levelling device because it is pumping up background sounds to DEAFENING levels during non-talking periods. The original soundtrack didn't need any fucking up.

thanks for the up."
,pax_corpus,2011-10-25T20:12Z,The audio is really bad. Had to stop watching at 12 minutes. The video isn't great either.
,xPocketRavex,2011-10-25T21:34Z,compared to other videos at 720p this is poor. i can deal with it. but its a little bit blurry
,Hanzmeister,2011-10-26T07:00Z,"Much better quality than the 350MB versions but the 350MB doesn't take up as much space, downloads and trasfers faster..."
,hadza2390,2011-10-26T08:26Z,"ya, video is 1x1 px and contains random pictures at britney career. and sound,.. they are talking klingon.. backwards. background sound is bono which is also backward. yarr"
,scurvypirate1234,2011-10-26T12:20Z,"IMMERSE is always crap. With Breaking Bad we had someone uploading the WebDL rips. Hopefully that'll happen with this series, too."
,TerFar,2011-10-26T23:09Z,"How can anyone possibly believe that the Audio is Quality 10. It is CRAP: no better than 3 out of 10. It is so bad as to be painfully unbearable.

Stop compressing the Audio. It is the equivalent of converting the video to monochrome."
,BassUrger,2011-10-26T23:55Z,"2nded what TerFar and tatsujin said.

It feels like this has been screwed up intentionally. Nobody can produce such bad quality by accident.

Both audio and video are absolutely DISMAL. I started laughing at the sound compressor so badly I couldn't watch it beyond 10 mins or so. Video was also stuttering horribly at times.

Don't waste your time on this crap, get the CtrlHD WebDL release instead. It's stereo only but still light years ahead this.

Amateurs."
,D.o.s.,2011-10-28T06:58Z,"i just wanna say thanx e.z. if it wasnt for you i would have to wait months to watch things like supernatural and smallville (sad to see that one go actually) as england doesnt get those shows till roundabout 6 to 12 months later than america sometimes. and also thanx for the walking dead too, tho i have a question, will you be uploading the 3/400mb versions of this season of TWD, as well as the gb versions, just cuz the little ones come in handy for when ive not got a lot space on my hard drive, and because they dont take up alot of room i dont have to seed them for as long as the bigger stuff (i seed to a ratio of 3.00, which if its something big takes forever to complete sometimes) so just wondering if the little versions are coming back? keep up the good work, theres nothing wrong with the quality, people just need to stop being so picky and exagerating, the qualitys good enough to watch on your computer, if they want hd versions for there super mega widescreens, they should just watch it when it comes on tv. youve never let me down once e.z.

p.s. this is my first comment on TPB ever, so now i can say i popped my chat cherry with e.z.t.v. haha @_"
,akobarako,2011-10-29T08:47Z,"from united arab emirates
we thank you very much "
,tofushoyu,2011-11-03T20:13Z,"Thanks again, EZTV!"
,DismantleRepair,2011-11-04T08:38Z,"The people whining about the audio are correct; there is dynamic range compression being applied to the source material, which absolutely ruins quiet scenes.

With regards to the video, it is important to note that it was a conscious decision to shoot the series using 8mm film cameras, which have a significant amount of grain. Under high compression such as these 1GB episode releases, the subtle flickering grain effect is compressed into a a distracting pool of artifacts. The only way to solve this is to lower the compression, which is why I'm going to wait until someone can do a responsible Blu-ray rip at a much higher quality level to display the grain as it was intended to be viewed by the cinematographers."
