,desi_superhero,2011-10-31T17:08Z,"Pixelated from the moment the Universal logo loads on the screen at the start of the movies. Fast forwarded through the first two movies, same condition. This is a first for ""jbr"" release. For a ""BluRay"" it is 6/10 video and 9/10 sound. Couldn't check it on my Home Theater, player shows ""File may be corrupted"" error. This a very good quality collection for a non-HD computer display."
