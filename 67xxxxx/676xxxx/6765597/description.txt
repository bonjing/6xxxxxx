Description:
In Alcatraz: Prison Escape the player takes the role of an innocent man who has to break out of five prisons. The main objective of every level is to find keys or other objects which have to be used to advance in another part of the level. But since the protagonist is a prisoner he has to sneak past the guards - and because he is innocent he only knocks them out and doesn't take their guns. The player has to wait for the right moment to make his move but since the other guards don't react to unconscious colleagues the actual place is not of much importance. If the player is seen an alarm is triggered and he has to hide for a short amount of time.
