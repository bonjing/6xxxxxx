I downloaded the 1 track mixes of each disc that were put up and seperated all the tracks. Can't stand not having all the individual tracks and I'm sure you guys too. I'm planning on seperateing Global Underground 35, 36, 37 and Global Underground Nubreed 008 by Sultan and Global Underground Nubreed 007 by Jim Rivers as well, hopefully in the next few days.  I'll seed each for a while but please seed them as well.  THX
