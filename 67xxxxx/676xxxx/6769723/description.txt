This is a high-quality fan-recorded version of [i][b]the trailer[/b][/i] for the re-release of 'The Phantom Menace' in February of 2012.  (Again, NOT THE MOVIE, JUST THE 90-SECOND TRAILER.)

It was first uploaded here at:

I downloaded it from there and then tried to do some color-correction on it, so I think it looks a little better.

It's very similar to the original 1998 trailer for the release.  Back then, it was the MOST ANTICIPATED MOVIE EVER!!!  

Watch the awesome fan reaction for the initial trailer back in 1998:
