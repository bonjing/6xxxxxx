  BinNavi is a binary code reverse engineering tool that wa
  built to assist vulnerability researchers who look for   
  vulnerabilities in disassembled code.                    
                                                           
  With BinNavi you can analyze disassembled x86, ARM,      
  PowerPC, and MIPS code using the powerful built-in static
  code analysis techniques. In cases where static code     
  analysis is not enough, you can use the built-in debugger
  to get a live view on the program you are analyzing.     
                                                           
  Use Cases:                                               
                                                           
  * Do control flow based code analysis of disassembled x86
  ARM, MIPS, and PowerPC code                              
  * Cut down on complexity by removing unimportant code fro
  functions                                                
  * Use powerful remote debuggers to debug programs on     
  different operating systems                              
  * Use Differential Debugging to quickly locate relevant  
  code                                                     
  * Create and assign user-defined tags to mark important  
  functions and basic blocks                               
  * Use advanced code analysis algorithms to keep track of 
  data and code                                            
  * Manage all your reverse engineering projects in one    
  central database                                         
  * Write scripts and plugins to extend BinNavi to meet you
  specific goals                                           
  * Rename and annotate variables and functions to make the
  self-explanatory                                         
  * Use the REIL meta-language to write platform-independen
  program analysis code

  INSTALL NOTES:                                           
                                                           
  1) Setup Java (and you will need an SQL server)          
  2) Extract the application                               
  3) Run our keyfilemaker                                  
  4) Generate a keyfile and save it in the same folder you 
  extracted the application                                
  5) Start the application                                 
                                                           
  NOTE: follow the tutorials to setup a database.xml and   
  configure the application to start using it
