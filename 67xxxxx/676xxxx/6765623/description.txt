Rheology is the science of the deformation and flow of matter. Specifically, rheology is concerned with the interrelation between time, force and deformation. Rheology originated from the Greek word \\\\\\\"rheos,\\\\\\\" which means to flow. The study includes a broad range of materials and industry processes. The important concepts in rheology include shear stress, viscosity, strain and elasticity.

This document was initially wrote with Open Office as lectures material for the Rheology course taken by M.Sc students in Marseille University. Basics of Rheology are explained using the minimum possible level of maths. Complicated models are avoided but the text aims to the understanding of the Physics behind the most common rheological tests.
