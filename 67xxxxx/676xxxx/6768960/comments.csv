,bongowolf2,2011-12-05T10:23Z,"So fucking what if it's RAR?  What a fucking ass. Listen kid - go to cnet.com - download a fucking FREE RAR extractor - do a fucking search for EXTRACT RAR (I know that will be hard). Download the fucking RAR extract program. When it up on your computer, drag & drop the fucking RAR file into it - and you will get a fucking AVI file you can fucking play. "
