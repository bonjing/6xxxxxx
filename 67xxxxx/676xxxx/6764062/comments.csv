You Should have Lt2.0 at least to play this game. If not it asks for a software update. If you click yes you lose your firmware for the dvd drive. Software downgrades won't help. Put (or let it do) lt2.0 on your dvd drive and it works! "

Update to lt2.0 it's the only way to play this game! You can't downgrade the software as far as I know. (You can but it wil not work)"

,Solid73,2011-10-25T18:55Z,I'm not doing it myself either. Look on youtube or something if you want to do it yourself. Or google anyone who does.
