Robert Plant himself calls this show â€œmagicâ€ and it is given how loose everyone is and in the mood to party. Jimmy Page hurt his finger several days before when they were throwing beer bottles out of the hotel window (so the story goes) and the first LA date on May 30th was canceled. His injured finger is noticeable with some bum notes in â€œRock And Rollâ€ and especially â€œCelebration Dayâ€, but with â€œBlack Dogâ€ he hits his stride.
â€œIs everybody sufficiently in the state of mind to have a good time?â€ Plant asks afterwards, and when they finish â€œOver The Hills And Far Awayâ€ suggests the name of the recording and says he had known Bonzo for fifteen years â€œand heâ€™s been a regular bastard.â€
