,amlodil,2011-10-24T23:46Z,only for 2000/xp
,snowbirds,2011-12-29T00:06Z,"amlodil is lying on both counts.  

This is a beta version, and you have to enter a beta key during installation.  The uploader has provided the beta key and it works fine.

I just installed this on Windows 7 64bit, registered it with the supplied id and license key, and then updated it to the latest version.  

I haven't started using it yet, but everything seems perfect. 

Thanks uploader!"
