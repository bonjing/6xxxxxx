,asd08,2011-10-29T16:12Z,"Only one method working 100% (till now) for Battlefield 3 Double Sound Echo Fix

Worked for me 100% on (win 7 32bit , nvidia 9500 GT 1 Giga , 2 Giga RAM and CPU 3 GH Dual Core )


Battlefield 3 Double Sound Echo Fix By Dr Ali Aliraqi


Before you begin and load your mission (on Game Menu)

Press Alt + Tab then Task Manager then rigth click on BF3.exe then Set Affinity

after that unselect CPU 1 ( Select only CPU 0 )

you will notice that  double sound or sound echo disapear ...

But you will notice also that game will become slower (because only one CPU of dual core CPU worked) so you needed to reduce resolution ...


Note :Few Seconds after loading and beginning your mission you can reselect CPU 1 with CPU 0 and game will become faster ...

But But But double sound or echo reapear when new loading regain (loading regain when you kill or begin next mission etc ... ) ...


So Conclusion : Dual Core CPU is main cause of double sound or echo ...


So we are waiting  computer supporter that make patch or installer or anything for : ( battlefield 3 begin with single core CPU and converted to dual core 
CPU automatically few seconds after loading complete and when new loading reapear it converted to single core CPU automatically and it converted to dual core
CPU automatically few seconds after loading complete )   

It is so difficult but we are needing that ...

,mr.at,2011-11-09T21:24Z,"FUCK ALL ELSE...

ALL THOSE WHOSE GAME IS CRASHING/NOT WORKING...

I found this out after a lot of bullshit. The only proper working crack is the 31.3 MB one (RELOADED). Remember: It's just the .exe file you have to replace. No bullshit patches/cracks/dlls.

Like all here said (and you probably overlooked, dumbot!), just replace with the right .exe file (31.3 MB), and rename the God damn folder from ""Battlefield 3â„¢"" to only ""Battlefield"".

The game crashes only because of the â„¢ in the folder name. Some fucked up. Don't know why that is.

Worked for me!"
,wam9xx,2011-11-11T16:01Z,"i have used the included crack and also used otheres but when i click to start the game i get an error of dynamic link library KERNAL32.dll.
  PLEASE GIVE ME SOLUTION"
