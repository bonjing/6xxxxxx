How to Talk to Anyone, Anytime, Anywhere: The Secrets of Good Communication
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
King, host of CNN's Larry King Live, here sets out to instruct readers on how to talk confidently and effectively in a variety of situations, such as job interviews, business presentations, social events and even discussions with one's spouse. Shyness and "bloopers" can be turned into assets, comments King, who relates how he clammed up the first time he was on a radio show. By openly admitting his nervousness, he claims he disarmed his listeners. Filled with practical advice, amusing anecdotes and a chapter on his "best and worst guests," this self-help guide, written with freelancer Gilbert, will be a hit with King devotees.

You might not be as smooth a talker as King after finishing this book, but it doesn't hurt to try. King, who has talked to everyone from Gorbachev to Michael Jackson, tells us how he does it.

Info
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was unable to find a PDF of this book, so I purchased the book legitimately.  Turned out, that despite purchasing an ebook version, it was not downloadable, and could only be read online in the browser.  So with the aid of screenshot software (Greenshot), I made this PDF.

It should also be noted that the Audiobook version of this book, which at this time can be found, is more of a summary and leaves parts out.

TL;DR
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I paid money, got screwed, so I spent a couple hours making this.
