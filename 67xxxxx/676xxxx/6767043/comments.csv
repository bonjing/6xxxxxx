,JWales82,2011-10-25T02:37Z,Thanks alot man. Your awesome.
,DalittleBIGmen,2011-10-25T12:42Z,"Hi all!

I am looking another link to download this episode. I had checked with VTV and EZTV(both green skull) but the audio is not quite good. They had been turn  the audio level on so when no one is speaking the background sound just goes up. Pretty annoying. 

Does this torrent have the same problem? 

Thanks in advice.
(Asking before so I will not download and delete, I prefer to be sure so I could seed as always)"
,DalittleBIGmen,2011-10-25T13:00Z,"I do not see my comment! May be it was deleted or the internet went nuts.

I had encounter some problems in other torrents regarding audio issues specifically background audio from EZTV and VTV. Both reliable sources. It makes watching pretty annoying specially when they are in the forest. Background audio goes up and down as they speak. 

Does this torrent have the same problem? 

Here is the explanation of other fella:
""Sound track is total crap and makes this unwatchable. Please turn off the Auto sound levelling device because it is pumping up background sounds to DEAFENING levels during non-talking periods. The original soundtrack didn't need any fucking up."""
,MrE159357,2011-10-26T02:20Z,"Already picked up for a third season!!!  I wish there was a way to directly support the show you like, a little extra.  I already get AMC, but am too lazy to encode for my PC.  Thanks 2007prt1, and cheers to the soldiers overseas!"
[T],2007prt1,2011-10-26T07:47Z,"Audio10/Video10. enuff said !

plays on my HD-TV & also on my PS3. come on guys.

@MrE159357 : You welcome & i feel the same way ""cheers to the soldiers overseas! """
,legalpimp,2011-10-26T14:00Z,Last 20 minutes are missing just like the EZTV torrent.
,RockJohnAxe,2011-10-26T17:43Z,"@ Legalpimp

You Seriously that retarded? Its a 60 minute show minute 17 minutes of commercials. No shit its only 43 minutes."
,RockJohnAxe,2011-10-26T17:43Z,Minus*
,RockJohnAxe,2011-10-27T07:35Z,"A-10
V-10
When the background sound gets louder when the actors are not talking is part of the show and has nothing todo with the rip."
,schlinks,2011-10-27T17:33Z,watched it A:10 V:10 no complaints from this guy! ill be staying tuned for the next episode. keep up the good work 2007prt1 ur fucking awsome!!!
,Cryptical654,2011-10-27T20:24Z,"Finally downloaded and watched it. The video is jerky as hell. Someone encoded this poorly or they didn't encode it to run well on all computers, which also basically means ""poorly.""

Oh, and fuck the soldiers overseas. They are uneducated chumps and everytime they arrogantly talk about ""fighting for our freedoms"" I want to kill somebody. ""MY freedoms""? Am I in fucking Iraq?"
,Coke4Life,2011-10-27T22:19Z,When is episode 3 coming?? :D
[T],2007prt1,2011-10-29T19:23Z,"LOOK AT THE INFO, ON THIS ""Air Date""

""When the background sound gets louder when the actors are not talking is part of the show and has nothing todo with the rip.""

The stupidest thing I ever heard! No that is NOT part of the show, it is poor ripping. I saw that problem in breaking bad rips and it is just in this episode and s02e02. It comes from compressing the audio."
