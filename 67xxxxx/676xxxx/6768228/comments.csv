[V],GoodFilms,2011-11-02T01:22Z,"probably because it's not called ""blue ray"" :)"
,kotuwa,2011-12-31T11:50Z,"This is 720p HD. 1280x688.
But the quality is not super!.. I think they could not preserve high quality prints :(
For me 6937mb (7gb) for this quality is waste! 

I would prefer a 1881mb (2gb) rip. 
It is 800x432, not HD, but has BETTER Quality and clean print with less noise :)
