The record was for airplay only as part of the BBC\\\'s \\\"In Concert\\\" program.  It was made by BBC Transcription Services.

This was captured by me from vinyl and is the final, definitive version.  I uploaded it before but noticed some things that needed to be fixed.  So, if you got that version, sorry for the trouble and go ahead and replace it with this one.

If you intend to burn this to CD, be sure to set your gaps (pause between tracks) to 0 (zero).  That way, you will have a perfect copy of the record with no hiccups in the crowd noise, etc.

Turn it up and ENJOY!
