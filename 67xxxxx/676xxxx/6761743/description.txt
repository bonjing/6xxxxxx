                    Heavy Metal Magazine Collection 1977-2011  




This is the complete Heavy Metal Magazine Collection starting from the first 1977's issue to the latest, November 2011 and last year's issue as well. The collection will include the special issues and goodies like ''Heavy Metal Presents, Epic Illustrated and Metal Hurlant''. The files are organized by volume and issue number, month and year. On the Heavy Metal Magazine Cover Collection folder, there's a cbr file so the cover gallery can be viewed in eComic format. Also I added CD Display, an essential tool to view cbr files. This collection is a must have to any avid Heavy Metal Magazine collector, you won't find a better and chronologically organized collection as this one all over the web. Enjoy!

Note:

2011's volume 35 issue numbers 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, are ''sample editions'' consisting of 33 to 58 pages the most. These issues were provided by the heavymetal.com web site as teasers, once I finish gathering or scanning these issues, I will update the torrent so the issues can be completed.
