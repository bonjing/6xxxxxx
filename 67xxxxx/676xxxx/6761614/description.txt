Like the title says, I really could use a new mixer. This mixtape was made for Pioneer\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s competition, and the prize was new mixer. So now you understand the name. In competitions rules it was asked to use filters, and I did so. For the first time of my life. Using EQ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s more ordinary to me

The songs in mixtape are pretty much new stuff. And more importantly, they are quite hot at the moment. Especially Tom Staar (at least for me), I just lately discovered his productions. Also Wolfgang Gartner said that he is the breakthrough producer of 2011. I also used few mash-ups, since they tend to bring more excitement and unique feel to mix in my opinion.

I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ll try to seed as often as possible, and as much as possible. But if you can\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t get any seeds, you can listen mixtape here:
