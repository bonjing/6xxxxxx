,pirates4eva,2011-10-22T16:35Z,@Dimmis80 its the latest firmware from c4eva you will NEED it to play this game and all of the other XGD3 games time to get ur xbox re-flashed mate.
,FucHollywood,2011-10-22T16:40Z,@Dimmis80 LT 2.0 supports the new larger size games that are over 8 gigs compared to 7.29 you need the latest flash & dashboard update to play these newer titles.
,micko84,2011-10-22T17:23Z,"@FucHollywood  as for random civ checks, dunno but you can assume that it will be like forza or maybe even different"
,Dimmis80,2011-10-22T18:09Z,@pirates4eva-@FucHollywood thanks for the respond mates..I know all about the Dashboards and i can find them and update my 360..Now about the Latest Firmware from C4EVA where i can find it and how i am going to flash my 360 so i can play those larger games to.?I don't know shit about flashing my X-Box and stuff..Is the same way with an USB-Flash Driver like i use with the Dashboard Updates or its an another way about flashing.???

,DanielRibeiroMarinho,2011-10-22T22:50Z,"For everyone wondering if you need disc one or two to play the campain, since you don't have HD, download only the disc 2, i'm not lying, and here's the proof; http://www.lensoftruth.com/ea-explains-why-bf3-will-be-2-xbox-360-discs/"

,pirates4eva,2011-10-23T02:00Z,@Dimmis80 no flashing ur xbox means removing ur dvd drive from ur xbox and putting custom firmware(lt 2.0) on it u will require special tools wich u can get here http://www.modtraders.co.uk/ they ship world wide or ur preferd supplier. if u already have a flashed xbox did u get sum1 to do that?? u will have 2 ask if they can update/re-flash ur drive b4 playing these larger XGD3 games.
,pirates4eva,2011-10-23T02:04Z,@elvis233 u cant be flashing all drives lt2.0 as it is not yet released for hitachi....getting all those hitachi owners hopes up.
,grygt2,2011-10-23T02:20Z,Is there anything special i need to do with the 0800 directories?? 
,grygt2,2011-10-23T02:21Z,What do i need to do with the 0800 directories??
,esc-cos,2011-10-23T04:05Z,"have now playd it in 5 hours.

and no errors. like the unoriginal disc.

burned with imgburn.


the game didnt live up tp my expentions though"
,esc-cos,2011-10-23T04:06Z,and all you need id the disc 2!! for singleplayer
,FucHollywood,2011-10-23T05:45Z,@esc-cos did you burn 97% of the game w imgburn?  or do you have a lite-on dvd burner w imax firmware?
,mikethegreat4,2011-10-23T14:10Z,"@esc-cos, can you confirm what disc is what? I've heard the split is sp and mp, or graphics installation and the game, but you can play the game w/o the installation disc. What disc is the game disc/single player disc?"
,micko84,2011-10-23T14:26Z,"put in disc 2 first, then it will ask if you want to install the HD content, then it asked to put in disc 1 and installs 1.5g to you hdd so you can play in full HD otherwise you just play in 720, disk 1 is for multiplayer and co-op disc 2 is campaign"
,micko84,2011-10-23T14:27Z,"i have the new burner and new fw to go with it, no errors on imageburn, flawless gameplay"
,pirates4eva,2011-10-23T14:39Z,@mikethegreat4 disc 2 is defo the single player game disc 1 is just multiplayer and hd content but you do not need this to just play the campaign if you just want single player DISC2 is what you want confirmed as im playing it rite now with no probs at all.
,mikethegreat4,2011-10-23T14:55Z,"awesome. did you use the new burner for it? I heard people are having problems with the new games like arkam city, but I was able to truncade it and play it without the new burner. I don't put my xbox on live though."
,pirates4eva,2011-10-23T15:46Z,@mikethegreat4 no i used my normal tscorp burner standard in pc truncate and all ok on verbs i completed arkimcity on thurs usin this method no probs i dnt use it 4 live anyway so all good...well till m$ get wise and start puttin new checks on disc in the last 3% i think after time we will probs all have to get the new burner 4live or not unless those larger discs get produced. lets just hope its all ok for MW3 and ill be happy.
,esc-cos,2011-10-23T16:08Z,"yeas its true as they sey... you only need disc 2 for singleplayer.


and to those who wounder. 

i DONT have the new  burner!!  and still no problem!!!
used the new img burn with the function to burn all the way to the ends of the disc.


but when that beeing sead, i do have one of the erliest moddels of the xbox. 

it realy seam like the older ones like mine , can handle this new security better.
with the writing option listed over

i play pretty much all of the new games with the bigger imagefiles, pretty pretty much no errors.

,Dimmis80,2011-10-23T21:39Z,"Hey guys.@micko84 i have a question mate about the  Full-HD u told us.Is it worth it to install the HD content from DVD 1 because i don't have a full HD TV and i have a HD Ready TV 26"" Samsung but again not Full HD..!Do u thing that i will see better visuals if i install the HD Pack or because i don't have Full HD in my TV i will not see them so its not woth the space from my 360 Hard Disc to install it..??"
,DanielRibeiroMarinho,2011-10-23T22:13Z,"@Dimmis80 I think you still have better details if you install the hd content, because it's a texture pack, not a resolution pack, and since you have a 720p hd tv, you will provably see some difference."
,micko84,2011-10-24T00:05Z,"@Dimmis80 i dont think it will make you jump up and down and you might not notice much difference but if you have 1.5gig free on ya hdd, you can install and just delete it once you finish the game. "
,fanfasnight,2011-10-24T02:33Z,"Short single player, finished in ,less then 3 hours"
,esc-cos,2011-10-24T08:54Z,"i tryed both  with and without the hd pack.

and i didnt see much difference at all.

yeas i also finished the game.

to dam short.  and the game in tatal is vas not to good"
,warwind74,2011-10-24T10:26Z,hay whats up all i have a jtag and iso2god 1.3.5 dose not work on this game and all the new ones any of you all have seen any thing new
,FucHollywood,2011-10-24T16:39Z,Has anyone tried any discs other than verbatim with new lt max?
,Dimmis80,2011-10-24T17:20Z,Hi guys.I think i made a big mistake with my 360..!!I download and update my 360 with the Latest Dashboard Update.Now my copy games older and my new does not working anymore and i can only play only original games..!!I think i am F.U.B.A.R.So is there a way to reverse it and fix this problem something to do like an older update or something.Is there a solution about my problem..???Thanks in Advance guys.:-(
,pirates4eva,2011-10-24T17:45Z,@Dimmis80 what u have done is flash ur xbox back to stock by accepting the update ur srewed now  ur xbox is no longer flashed u will have to get it re-flashed there is no way of reverting this the only solution is to get it flashed again until then u can 4get all about any burned games.
,Dimmis80,2011-10-24T22:09Z,@pirates4eva thanks for replying.I hear u.But is there a way to fix my problem without getting my 360 re-flashed and stuff..!?Is there an another solution or something that can help me like an older update.??I read somewhere that if i revert it to stock it fix the problem but i don't know how.???Btw i contacted the shop that flashed my 360 2-3 years ago and they told me that they want 60-70Euros to fix the problem and the thing is that i cant fuckin afford it right now...If there is an another way i would realy apreciated if u tell me mate.????
,pirates4eva,2011-10-24T22:57Z,@Dimmis80 i dont know where you have read that if you flash ur xbox back to stock it wud fix the problem that is not true!! stock is m$ official firmware that is obviously not goin to allow you to play burned games!! You have got to flash to stock b4 any major dash update as to avoid ur problem. sounds like you have to save up for a re-flash that is the only way to fix it unless you get ur xbox j-taged.if you lived in my area i would flash it 4 free but you talkin about euros you obviously dont.
,Dimmis80,2011-10-25T01:02Z,@pirates4eva again thanks for the advises.I think for now i will wait and when i have the damn money i will take it for a Reflash like u sugested and i am gonna put the LT2 Firmware to for the new games.U win some u lose some..
,zcarter85,2011-10-28T03:16Z,"I have a flashed console with 2.0 but I heard you can only play xgd3 with jtag or something like that. Nothing I read verified you can play xgd3 games on flashed consoles. Can any one verify for me?
"
,pirates4eva,2011-10-28T04:16Z,@zcarter85 yes you can play XGD3 games on lt2.0 as long as you burn them corectly and if you mean they are not verified on ABGX it is because ABGX has not yet been updated to support the new XGD3 format has of yet but they are still playable i have got all the XGD3 games and they work flawlessly. although there have been quite a few issues reported with the sammy drives on lt2.0/2.01 not reckonizing the XGD3 games but still plays other burns fine...i can confirm my liteon and benq both phat working with lt2.0 no probs.
