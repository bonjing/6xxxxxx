But, just curious why make such a big deal about the audio when its more distorted than the first torrent? Yes, its louder but, its so muffled it makes it worse! Sorry, just being honest! NWDL!

You wasted your time in making this release. The audio is just even worse.

At least on the other one it's quite clear and you can hear what they are saying."
