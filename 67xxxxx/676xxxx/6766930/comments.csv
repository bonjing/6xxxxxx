If an eclipse could do this just try to image what would happen on a cloudy day! I hate sci-fi when it contains no ""sci"" and only ""fi"". This kind of story belongs in the 9/11 commission report, another horrible work of complete fiction that defies any real laws of physics. Okay, now I'll go download it just because I like really bad movies."
