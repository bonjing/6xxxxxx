movies arent shot in a pure 16x9 ratio. 16x9 is a tv/video standard.  Films are slightly wider so the height shrinks."
,chl2is,2011-10-24T23:38Z,overall is it a great rip??
,tHURTle,2011-10-26T10:12Z,"After beeing many years on useing UseNet. I wanted to try  a Torrent again,, After 4days of Downloading i still havent got this torrent Complete.. After this Movie I'm back to Usenet.. Release groups Respect for Uploading the movies on P2Ptorrent.. Many people think Usenet is to Difficult and Use torrents..."
,p0okjudge,2011-10-27T14:27Z,"I can see the Q = awesome. Pitty that after 24 seconds there is a codec error of some kind and the file stops playing. I tried every program I can think of. Got latest Perian updates, multiple MKV players still keeps bugging after 24 seconds.

Don't know if anybody else has the same problems, Im not saying that you shouldn't download it. Just saying on my system it aint working as it should. I'm quite resourceful in solving problems like these due the industry I work in and the software and tools I have, nevertheless. Also tried to convert it to different kinds of media files no luck either. 

Anybody any idea... i'm out."
,mikel81,2011-10-27T15:30Z,Have you tried VLC?
,p0okjudge,2011-10-27T18:43Z,"Yep, tried both on Mac and PC. Im starting to think that if nobody else is having issues there might be an error with the file structure or something. So something while downloading went wrong."
,fdox,2011-10-27T20:58Z,"Ok i took me like a week downloading this thing, but i think is worth! its actually a 1080p version (With the Wide black bars up and down the frame). This is weird because i dont think this movie was actually ""filmed"" i think it was recorded, and modern cinema cameras (digital) records at 4k, 2k and those resolutions higher than Ful HD so its weird to get bluray on a 1920 x 800 aspect... 4000 pixels even with the bars up and down will full your screen with image (Real 16:9). Even cameras like the canon EOS 7D uses 16:9 full HD and fits my 42"" LCD without the bars with no problem... Ill do a  research and find out why this bars appears on a Bluray (almost full quality) Maybe we will never get the real copy uncompressed (4:4:4)... But anyways the quality is AMAZING! i compared a 720p version (also with the bars) and looks a little less sharp, but the file size was like a quarter of this torrent... soo if u r a big fan of the film, u want it full quality and u aint got problems with file size then download this torrent!! if u r the average person who watch movies just one time and dont take a huge look at details and contrast stuff and rather have a small HD file then get the 720p version..... 720p looks PERFECT, but this one looks AMAZING! :D

THANKS FOR THE UPLOAD! :D"
