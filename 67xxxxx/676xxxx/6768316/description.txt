This is a website dump of Access to Insight, which is an awesome project by John T. Bullitt, to collect the most important Buddhist texts together. Included are suttas that make up the Pali Canon - the central literature of Theravada Buddhism, and a number of other Theravadin writings.

The command used was "wget -rk" so the materials are browsable offline locally (or hostable on a web server). All of the content is subject to copyright but licensed for free spreading, to advance knowledge of the Buddha's teachings. The files have been compressed using 7-Zip, which is needed for successful depacking.

To begin studying, extract the archive and go to the directory named after the site and load 'index.html' with your favorite HTML-capable application program. The search feature and random article link do not work offline and the CD image (/cdrom/) and ready-made package (/tech/download/bulk/) were also removed.

The Tipitaka (Pali ti, "three," + pitaka, "baskets"), or Pali canon, is the collection of primary Pali language texts which form the doctrinal foundation of Theravada Buddhism. The Tipitaka and the paracanonical Pali texts (commentaries, chronicles, etc.) together constitute the complete body of classical Theravada texts.
