Frankie Boyleâ€™s Tramadol Nights is a six-part series that mixes Frankieâ€™s outrageous and often controversial stand up with pre-filmed sketches in which he picks apart all aspects of modern life. Everything is given a uniquely Frankie spin â€“ scabrous, sharp and scathing â€“ a no holds barred comedy that promises everything you already know and love about Frankie with even more added bite.

Among the sketches in the new series is â€˜Untitled Streetâ€™: a new BBC soap opera which is so politically correct that actorâ€™s faces are blanked out to avoid causing offence and plots are so ambiguous that the viewers have guess for themselves what itâ€™s all about. Others include â€˜Columbian Showbiz Newsâ€™, where anyone whoâ€™s anyone is invariably shot dead before they make it to the red carpet and a new documentary â€˜Life in the 2050 houseâ€™. Is it all living with robots? Not quite. Boyle satirizes everything we love and loathe about British culture, mixing sketches with stand-up and delivering unadulterated comedy thatâ€™s not the faint-hearted. The UKâ€™s most fearless and uncompromising comic at the top of his game, expect brass neck and belly laughs in abundance.
