Standalone Installer means any computer software installer that can work offline, i.e. does not necessarily require network (Internet) connection to function. Skype web installer requires Internet connection to receive Setup files. but that files already integrated with this version. so this Setup does not require Internet connection to install Skype to your computer :) "
