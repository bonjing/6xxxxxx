,kktpirate,2011-10-24T15:27Z,Can anyone tell me how to open epub or mobi file in a pc.....
,ttlens,2011-10-24T15:51Z,"@kktpirate

Stanza is the easiest way. Calibre is another option with more features but a much more complicated interface. Both are free downloads."
,kktpirate,2011-10-24T16:47Z,Thank you ttlens. Converted the file to pdf.....
,sv504,2011-10-24T16:54Z,@kktpirate - I use Mobipocket reader to check my .mobi files before uploading them to my Kindle. Free download at http://www.mobipocket.com/en/DownloadSoft/ProductDetailsReader.asp

Reading on my iPhone. Beautifully presented. via Calibre and MegaReader (replacing Stanza, murdered by Amazon)."
,upMONSTERdown,2011-10-24T17:53Z,if you want to read these on your computer you can download the nook reader applications for free from the barnes and noble website.
,Buttagood4you,2011-10-24T21:08Z,How would you be able to view this on your Iphone? Anybody want  to help me?
,n.m.,2011-10-24T22:07Z,"Buttagood4you,

I'd suggest downloading the free Dropbox (or Box.net) app for your iphone/ipad.  Open up a free account and then you can upload all of your ebooks to the online server and access the files through your iDevice wherever there is wifi access.  Also install the free iBooks app on your device.  After you upload your book to your online account...you can open the Dropbox app and select your epub file...then tell it to open in ibooks.  Enjoy!"
,n.m.,2011-10-24T22:41Z,"One more thing if you're using Dropbox app to open epub file...when you select the file it will say that it can not be displayed.  If you look in the top right of the screen, there is a forward arrow symbol.  Click on that arrow and you can then export the file to the ibooks app.  Hope that helps!"
,nguyenS_LHN,2011-10-25T00:00Z,You got the ePub from iBookstore?
,ihos4m,2011-10-25T05:00Z,"@Buttagood4you: use iBooks app and put the ePub file to your iPhone via iTunes
