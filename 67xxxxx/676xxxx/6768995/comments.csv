,zoso5150,2011-10-25T16:56Z,"@ smb & vtwin,with the quality of the uploads that you both put out,isnÂ´t it time that the powers that be,make you both master uploaders(a gold skull would be appropriate!)Thank you both."
[V],vtwin88cube,2011-10-26T04:34Z,"zoso5150...I'll second that nomination! But unfortunately, I'm still working on getting a thanks. Thank you to you for letting me know that I'm not invisible. Cheers, my man :)"
[V],smbdownload,2011-10-26T12:22Z,ditto brother - I think most of us 'share' because we have a desire to share 'our' music with others - to expose others to sounds they might not have heard or maybe not heard in a while...at least thats why I do - a simple thanks from time to time is all I seek - as you seem to be 'one of the good guys' also...thanks - peace
