Roy.Zimmerman.-.You're.Getting.Sleepy.2011.LAME-254kbps

Look deep into my eyes. Now laugh at the Republicans. Or better yet, listen to these spellbinding new songs. "You're Getting Sleepy" is 11 originals, recorded in the studio, covering an hypnotic blend of subjects: ultra-conservatives, corporate fat cats, religion in government, the inequities of war, and the new American Spring.

"Vote Republican" is a mesmerizing mockery of GOP nonsense in the run-up to the 2012 election (already a hit on YouTube). "Citizens United" is a sensuous slow-jam sneer at corporate personhood. "The Unions Are to Blame" lampoons the Big Business lunacy that has spurred thousands to Occupy Wall Street. There's a theme song for "The Wedding of Church and State" and the hallelujah blow-out of "I Want a Marriage Like They Had in the Bible."
