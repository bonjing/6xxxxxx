Plot
The Book of Mormon is a religious satire musical which tells the story of two young Mormon missionaries sent to a remote village in northern Uganda, where a brutal warlord is threatening the local population. Naive and optimistic, the two missionaries try to share their scripturesâ€”which only one of them knows very wellâ€”but have trouble connecting with the locals, who are worried about famine, poverty, and AIDS.
