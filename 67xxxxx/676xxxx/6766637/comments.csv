,shaayned,2011-10-24T12:35Z,can someone please post the link to full version of the ep?
,ffsdik,2011-10-24T13:01Z,"oh my word!!!!! the episode is 42 mins because of a thing in America called......advertisments.
These are things that the TV companies use to generate income to continue making great shows like this.

And if you dinlows start harping on about ""last weeks episode being 1hr and 6mins long"" then try to remember that it was a special 1and a half hour season opener.....which meant 1hr6min of show and oooooooh let me think......24mins of fooking adverts!!!!!!!

Just be happy that people are seeding!!!!!!

Peace"
,ffsdik,2011-10-24T13:03Z,"oh and the thing at the end is called a 'cliffhanger'

It makes you want to watch the next episode....."

,makisunn,2011-10-25T07:33Z,"@ThePopoy that might be from your end. Try using VLC. Or a new codec pack, or a new soundcard, or a new headphone. Or maybe late last night your grandpappy might've snuck in your room and stuck his HEARING AID in one of your ears as a prank. You never know with old people these days."
,ASPEN79,2011-10-25T08:23Z,@ TheBodyEater I agree...an abrupt ending... THIS EP IS SHORTER TOO! Is it complete????
,Seeeeder,2011-10-25T10:11Z,"Subtitles here www.addic7ed.com/show/1175

nice ep man, but the ending is missing..."
,DalittleBIGmen,2011-10-25T12:35Z,"v:10;
a:7
I do not like to be disrespectful but I found that the audio is not good. They might turned off the audio level. It makes the background sound so high when no one is speaking. This is what I found not mine but is the same complain:

""Sound track is total crap and makes this unwatchable. Please turn off the Auto sound levelling device because it is pumping up background sounds to DEAFENING levels during non-talking periods. The original soundtrack didn't need any fucking up."""
,gordonflash39,2011-10-25T12:36Z,"1. The ending is not missing. 42 minutes is the standard procedure.

2. I don't know what audio compression you used, but this was absolutely horrible to hear. Every scene with background ""nature"" noises was dreadful: when they speak, the noise disappear, but comes back really loud when they stop talking. 

3. The video is sometimes a bit laggy. I've been downloading from VTV for years, never had those problems. What happened?

Thanks anyway for the overall amazing work!

V: 7/10. A: 3/10."
,smokey_smith,2011-10-25T17:52Z,"Thanks, great quality!"
,thedeadserv,2011-10-25T18:56Z,Thnaks mate!
,Kosmonaut333,2011-10-25T19:00Z,"Ending IS missing. Read any episode recap (like avclub.com) and you'll see them discussing events not seen in this version. Avclub recap even mentions an awkward commercial break seen exactly where this version ends, so persons behind this download probably accidentally thought the episode was ending. "
,rhinovinyl1985,2011-10-25T21:37Z,"@Your_hero84

This is episode is on TV here in the UK on Friday. "
,manikopsa,2011-10-25T21:58Z,"Good quality as usual VTV :)

I'm waiting for next episode..

Keep up the good work .
"
,benandlol,2011-10-25T23:36Z,Having misophonia made it impossible to get through this with the audio going everywhere. Anyone got a clean audio version?
,Hanzmeister,2011-10-26T06:56Z,"Good quality BUT IT'S MISSING THE ENDING!

It cuts out right after an action scene and totally cuts out like 15 minutes of the episode."
,Jack0ff,2011-10-27T21:18Z,@Hanzmeister -  god youre fuckin stupid. episode 1 was a 1 1/2 hr premier all the rest are 1 hr. if you think 15 mins are missing you are either dont live in america and/or do not understand commercials.
,ReVaQ,2011-10-27T21:56Z,"Great quality!

I am pretty sure and including me, all us leechers of the Walking Dead are not americans. We download it, including me because we want to watch it right when it is released, we want to see it at the game time as the americans do. I would so watch it on TV, don't worry, the americans do and the other countries don't count."
,TAM70,2011-10-31T00:55Z,"Thanks a lot VTV, good work and thanks for taking time to do this. Greetins from Norway. PS. its not missing a second, its how this episode ends to keep us urging for the next episode ;)))))"
