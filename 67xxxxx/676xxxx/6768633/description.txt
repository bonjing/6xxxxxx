The Black Death - An Intimate History - NEW BBC Radio Audiobook - cheops
------------------------------------------------------------------------

By John Hatcher - Published in June 2008.

Read by Robert Glenister, abridged by Polly Coles.

The Black Death remains the greatest disaster to befall humanity, killing about half the population of the planet in the 14th century. John Hatcher examines everyday medieval life in a parish in Suffolk, from which an exceptional number of documents survive.

With scrupulous attention to historical accuracy, John Hatcher describes what the parishioners experienced, what they knew and what they believed. His narrative is peopled with characters developed from the villagers named in the actual townsÂ¿ records and a series of dramatic scenes portray how contemporaries must have experienced the momentous events.

`Professor Hatcher cannot be faulted on his devotion to the detail, or his convincing portrayal of the village of Walsham... Individual men
and women are painstakingly described.... The Black Death conveys with great effectiveness the intensity of medieval English devotions and their deep preoccupation with the business of dying. Reading this book I was reminded time and again of the Tibetan Book of the Dead.` ( Will Self - The Evening Standard )

`A historical recreation of what happens when the plague strikes a typical 14th-century town... hardhitting` ( Scotland on Sunday )
