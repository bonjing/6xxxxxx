,fredfan,2011-10-31T16:10Z,"Good lord...you have to rename the file you get after unRARing it (WHY should we have to unRAR in this day and age???) to an .ISO file.  It comes out as something else.  Otherwise plays fine, and is an interestingly offbeat and gritty film.

Has a custom initial menu asking you to choose a Nordic language, just click any one of them and turn off subs later if you want.  It's in English.  THANKS FOR SHARING.  HARD TO FIND ELSEWHERE IN DVD-R."
