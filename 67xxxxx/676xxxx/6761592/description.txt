Gary Lineker presents highlights of today's Premier League clashes, 
including Liverpool v Manchester United at Anfield and Chelsea v Everton at Stamford Bridge. 
United were looking to avenge last season's 3-1 defeat away to the Reds, when Dirk Kuyt scored 
all three goals for the hosts, and the Toffees were aiming to continue their fine recent record 
against the Blues. Plus, action from Manchester City v Aston Villa, Norwich City v Swansea City, 
Queens Park Rangers v Blackburn Rovers, Stoke City v Fulham and Wigan Athletic v Bolton Wanderers
