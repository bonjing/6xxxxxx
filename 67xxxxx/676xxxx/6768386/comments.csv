PIX611: This is, I assume, since it has been heavily publicised for the last week, the episode featuring Walter Isaacson, who wrote the Steve Jobs biography.
I'm 10,000 km away and I know that much.

Surely it's just as easy to google the date and program name as it is to log-in at PB and ask the obvious."
