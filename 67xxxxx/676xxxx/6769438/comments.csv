,amoghthegamer,2011-11-06T18:18Z,Great job man! I have yet to download this but how did you make these conversions? I'd love it if you explained it more in depth!
,Mesohappy,2012-01-07T23:37Z,"Yes
The audio is messed up Video is Great but I have played it from my Thumb drive on a samsung BD550
I have taken it from the hard drive via USB.
I spent hours trying to find out whatthe issues were.
On the other download is what I used but it seems to be an issue here. 
What seems to happen is from the beginning it shkips and repeats. Does this a lot. Drops out alot.
Now the only other ting I have yet to try is put it on disc after converting with Video conversion.
I am using an optical cable my receiver only takes audio from a digital source. It can`t play 3D so I go straight. I hav had problems with other downloads going out of sync. Now it could be on my end. I am going to get the new Yammaha 3D blu Ray player it will play a lot of formats and will stream better for High end equipment that I am using. BIG screen. and loving it. ""130"" 
If other have had the problems or know a fix let me know through pirate contact.
