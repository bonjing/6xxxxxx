This CD of eleven original songs, produced by Michael Hill, is a tasty blend of gutbucket rhythm and fermented blues topped with the rich and soulful vocals of â€œLong Tallâ€ Deb Landolt. Bassist Melvin Powe and drummer Doug Oscard provide a solid machine in delivering the backbone behind guitarist Richey Bâ€™s excellent slide work. What is particularly exciting about this release is that each song has its own distinctive sound, and the material seems to flow in a natural progression throughout. What appeals is a carefully and quality-crafted debut CD that sounds fresh, new and exciting.


This is the best blues album from a female artist that I have heard in a long time.
