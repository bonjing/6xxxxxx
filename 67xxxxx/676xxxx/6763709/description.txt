  The Royal Bank of Scotland was once a famous Scottish institution; a  
  bank with a reputation for prudence. But in October 2008, less than   
  a decade after Fred Goodwin took over as chief executive, it came     
  within hours of collapsing. RBS later posted the biggest loss in UK   
  corporate history - 24 billion pounds - which damaged the bank's      
  reputation for financial prudence and Scotland's image as a global    
  financial centre. Using previously unbroadcast footage of the bank's  
  top executives and interviews with bank insiders, this documentary    
  tells the compelling story of a national catastrophe.
