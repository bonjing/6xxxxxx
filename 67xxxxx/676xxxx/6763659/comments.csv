How are these cut together?  Do the fist two movies have any credits at the end?

More info please."

,anahka23,2011-10-22T20:12Z,Secret? You get a minus then. 
,theshape31,2011-10-22T22:05Z,So the content of this rip is a secret?  Not sure that makes a whole lot of sense.  I'd prefer to know what I'm getting into prior to downloading a 64+GB release.
,joshua1964,2011-10-23T06:04Z,"Look to the Media info.I take  Imgburn ,bd rebuilder,Blurip,Avimux gui,mkvmerge gui,mkv exstract gui,subtitle workshop,and subtitle edit.

The upload is not Quick,but I seed 128 gb and wait on seeders.

This is very good ,believe me."
