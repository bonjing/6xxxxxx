I have been watching Horizon since i was a young boy ( quite a while ago  ) and it's still one of the best science programs in the world . and one of the few programs that is worth our license fee .

,babybluetits24,2011-11-21T17:11Z,"help ! fucking microsoft rellabbeled ny hard drive to a new letter after a restart ive got 80% of this torrent but cant get it to hashcheck what ive got. although the title neil1966hardy gives is BBC Horizon Mega Collection (293 Episodes) when you save the torrent its only called Horizon, what should i do to the old folder i have to get the torrent to hashcj=heck what i have ? eg must it be the exact same name using same capitol letters ?"
,karmaboost,2011-12-03T16:38Z,"I took time to register here only to say how grateful I am for this collection you've made. I just found it today after a year of search, and I really hope the quality is good.
Horizon series are way underappreciated as from what I have experienced while I was in UK, and had access to BBC. I hope one day they will release a box set.

Many thanks from Hungary!!"
