This is the result so far of my attempt to gather as many episodes of this great documentary series together as I can. It currently totals 293 episodes. This is of course not complete, not by a long shot, since most of the episodes broadcast is not ripped yet, or will ever be considering that Horizon have been on the air since 1964.

I upload it here since it's much more complete than any other torrent I've found that collects Horizon episodes. All episodes have a correct title, airdate and season/episode information in the filename according to what can be found at thetvdb.com.

The quality is variable depending on the quality of the files available, and all episodes, even the newer ones that were also broadcast in HD are in standard definition, since that is what I myself use.

There are subtitles available for many of the episodes, but not for all. For many of the episodes where subtitles are available I've gathered them together with the .avi file in a mkv. But on a bunch of episodes I've not gotten around to doing that.

Since this is a huge torrent and I've not got access to any remarkable connection it will probably take a while for a full copy to get out, and to make sure that the speed can reach sustainable levels a lot of seeds are needed. So please stay on so that more can get access to this collection.


Enjoy and Seed!!
