The original, now rare, Charisma Perspective LP was incorrectly mastered in M&S rather than normal stereo. This transfer corrects the problem, which dramatically improves the sound. The recording was also de-clicked using Izotope RX tools. 44.1k, 16-bit FLAC files, converted with MediaMonkey. m3u playlist included.
