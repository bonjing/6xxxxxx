thnx for the awesome upload."
,kingjoser,2011-11-01T09:25Z,"This movie sucked!! The story/Plot moved way to slow and there wasn't even any action in this movie, only a couple parts that lasted a minute! And the end was even worse. There was no big battle or nothing. The alien just put together a bunch of cars, tv's, microwaves and a bunch of other dumb crap, made the spaceship out of that and just took off. This movie Sucks!!! Really boring. The movie playing during the credits was way better than Super 8. Spielberg and abrahms shouldve put a bigger budget in the movie playing during the credits. Would've been a better movie!! Super 8 was shot well and looked good, but it sucks!! 2.5/10 good quality though"

You seem like the type of person that absolutely adored Transformer 3. Some of the greatest movies of all time are slower paced. Ever watch 2001 a Space Odyssey? No action what so ever, but still a great movie. That's what's sad about this new generation. They always need blood and violence to please them. "

I'm not really sure why others are rating the Audio on this file so highly. With volume all the way up on the  player, the PC, and the speakers the Audio was still a whisper other files played fine, so I can narrow the culprit to this file :("

,Adohleas,2012-03-04T16:58Z,"The reason your audio is bad is because your using the wrong media player. Players like Windows Media will have no audio. If you use VLC media player, the Audio is perfectly fine."
