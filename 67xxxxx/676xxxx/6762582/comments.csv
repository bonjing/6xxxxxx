[T],ctang,2011-10-25T20:55Z,"tooner66: im not an amateur here...i know what im doing...there is nothing wrong with this dvd...all you have to do is compress it with a compression program like nero recode or dvd rebuilder...most people dont just vomit useless info such as what you have before doing at least a little bit of research first...go somewhere else where someone hasnt put up a dvd 9 in ""non-iso"" format because clearly you dont know how to handle a dvd file structure

,mukaas,2011-10-30T06:21Z,"i have burned this to dvd...clean copy. a/v +1. thx for including the extras. when you have time, would you pls up the change up (unrated), the jacket, brooklyn's finest, crossing over, the machinist, tropic thunder (unrated), revolver, lucky number slevin and fight club? with untouched menu and extras. i apologize for such a big request but i cannot find those movies with menu and extras on any torrent sites. i realize that you cannot fulfill the whole request all at once but if you could do 1 or so every now and then it would be greatly appreciated. thx again for your hard work. regards.
