Arthur Brown (1944) is best known for "Fire" from 1968 by his group The Crazy World Of Arthur Brown. Arthur went on to form Kingdom Come and recorded with many different artists over the years. When he formed an Austin, Texas-based painting company called Two Gentlemen Of Color with former Mothers Of Invention drummer Jimmy Carl Black (1938-2008) in the mid 1980s, they also decided to do an album together. They rounded up the band known as The Mannish Boys, featuring the late harmonica player Gary Primich, and recorded this album.

Teaming up with ex-Mothers of Invention drummer Jimmy Carl Black (who gets second billing) and a team of Austin bar band veterans, Arthur Brown turns out a set of R&B; standards such as "Fever" and "Smokestack Lightnin'." For the most part, Brown is content to play the role of straightforward blues shouter, only letting his wilder persona out on an extended rap during "Got My Mojo Working," an appropriately extreme version of "Hound Dog," on which he takes even more lyrical liberties than Elvis Presley did, and "The Lord Is My Friend," ain which the self-proclaimed "god of hell fire" gets religion and learns to preach. None of these versions will ever make you forget the classic ones by progenitors like Muddy Waters or Howlin' Wolf, although they are competently done. This is the kind of set that is best heard in a bar with a cold one in hand.
