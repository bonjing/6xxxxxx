Please seed FOREVER. I don't think there's a limit to how many seeds a torrent can have at hand. If there is, we better damn well reach it.

Hunter x Hunter chapters 1-310 setup to work beautifully with the "Photos" feature on the iPad.

All pages are in JPEG format. So will probably work just as well on a Kindle or Nook. If you have to ask if it works on a computer, you should probably assume its a miracle you've gotten here.

INSTRUCTIONS: Put chapter folders in what ever folder you are syncing your ipad/ipod/whatever photo library to. Each chapter will show up in order as a photo album.

OR: Just read it. 

Feel free to put them in any other way you want it won't mess up the order of the pages. I don't recommend putting all 5000+ pictures in 1 album though. Seems like a lot to scroll through...
