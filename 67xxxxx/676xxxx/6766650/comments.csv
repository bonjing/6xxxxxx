,Gh057man,2011-10-30T02:52Z,"@ Orgzm79 LMAO! Mental problems? That's rich ... after your massive tanties with the irrational name calling and such. All because your poor torrent etiquette was exposed. BTW I am not normally a freak hater, but, I can make an exception in your case ;). I must admit you do have one thing going for you which in this case is a fine taste in music. :)"

If you check out my latest Lana Del Rey Discography torrent, you will be happy to notice that a perfect, high quality, no glitches version of the song you wanted is there! What I think you fail to understand, is that when you shit on someone's work, you damage the whole torrent world and shit can your reputation at the same time! This whole thing is a work in progress! Yes? Phantazm79. "
