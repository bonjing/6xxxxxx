  Jools welcomes back the mercurial Canadian singer-songwriter Feist,   
  originally from Nova Scotia and now based in Toronto, with songs      
  from her fourth solo album Metals.                                    
                                                                        
  Wisconsin's Bon Iver returns with his ambitious and haunting          
  self-titled second album.                                             
                                                                        
  Debuting in the 'oval of excellence' are metal band Mastodon,         
  brutalising and astonishing with songs from their fifth studio album  
  The Hunter. There's also the good time old school soul of Frenchman   
  Ben L'Oncle Soul and his band, offering their retro soul revue.       
                                                                        
  Lounge lizard Buddy Greco, who was a key member of The Rat Pack in    
  the 1960s, chats to Jools and plays the odd standard or two as he     
  releases a live album from the 60s which was recorded at the Sands    
  in Las Vegas. And 21-year-old singer-songwriter from London, Lianne   
  La Havas, makes her TV debut armed with an electric guitar, sweet     
  harmonies and an incredibly soulful voice.                            
                                                                        
  Enjoy this!
