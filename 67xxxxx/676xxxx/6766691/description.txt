			The GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb (MOAB) (colloquially known as the Mother of All Bombs) 
		is a large-yield conventional bomb developed for the United States military by Albert L. Weimorts, Jr.
		At the time of development, it was touted as the most powerful non-nuclear weapon ever designed.
		The bomb was designed to be delivered by a C-130 Hercules, primarily the MC-130E Combat Talon I 
		or MC-130H Combat Talon II variants.
