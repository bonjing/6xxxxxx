Tomorrow, Iâ€™ll be on radio station KPFK in Los Angeles around 10am, on The Michael Slate Show. Weâ€™re going to be talking about various things, but one thing in particular: weâ€™ll be plugging The Magic of Reality. Slate had a very good one-on-one interview with Dawkins earlier this week, and I think we all agree â€” getting more copies of that book into peopleâ€™s heads would be an excellent idea.

While Iâ€™m recommending books, I also just finished Sean Fairclothâ€™s Attack of the Theocrats! How the Religious Right Harms Us All-â€”and What We Can Do About It. Itâ€™s about how the religious right is corrupting the United States, with a nice collection of concrete examples of the idiocy these bozos â€” who keep getting elected! â€” represent. If youâ€™re reading this blog, you know what Iâ€™m talking about, and itâ€™s a safe bet youâ€™d appreciate this book.
