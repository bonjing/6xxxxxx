Long before Monkeytown Records Modeselektor started the 50 Weapons 
label back in 2006 as an anonymous white label series. No artist 
names, no release information, no cover art, just pure high class DJ 
music. Modeselektor, Siriusmo, Housemeister, Moderat, Headhunter, 
T++ and Shackleton, Bok Bok, Roska and many more appeared on the 
earliest white labels, later bundled as "50 Weapons of Choice #02-09"
a CD that was released as an ultra limited and numbered compilation, 
only available in indie stores.

"50 Weapons of Choice # 10-19" comes as the even stronger follow up, 
unmixed, with many new label signings, big names and hot newcomers 
all combined on an almost 1 hour long bass mission to defeat boredom.

*** REPACK *** 

The previous release did not comply to rule 7.3, which states that 
the proof picture must include a small paper over the medium and/or 
cover with the group name. Instead our paper with the tag was in 
between the two.

And then we have rule 7.7, which says proof fixes are not allowed. 
Unfortunately there is no other option than to re-release this. 
Nothing has been changed to the audio files, only the proof and 
directory name is different.
