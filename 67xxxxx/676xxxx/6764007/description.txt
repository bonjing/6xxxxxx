Jackie (Kannada: à²œà²¾à²•à²¿, Telugu: à°œà°¾à°•à°¿) is a 2010 Indian multilingual film[4] directed by Soori and features Kannada actor Puneet Rajkumar and Bhavana Menon in the lead roles.[5] It was released in Kannada on 14 October, 2010 to a critical acclaim[6] and was adjudged the Best Film of 2010 at the South Filmfare Awards.[7] Telugu version was released on 6 May, 2011[2] while Malayalam version release date is yet to be announced.[8][9]
The film is noted for its technical prowess, witty dialogs and lyrics, combined with an art that has become a trademark of Soori's rustic feel cinema.[10] Music was composed by V. Harikrishna with Yograj Bhat as the lyricist for all the songs in Kannada. The album, which celebrated its platinum disc, is also available as a 5.1 audio DVD disc.[11] After successful screening in Australia, United Kingdom and Germany, Jackie was released in the USA and Singapore in Feb 2011.


Plot

Janakirama alias Jackie (Puneet Rajakumar) is an 8th standard drop-out living with his mother Jayamma who operates a flour mill in a village. Jackie is a guy who dreams of making it big; but not by hard work. He is an expert card player and thinks he can repay all his debts with earnings from it. He does every job and hopes he would one day make it big as a realtor. He is talkative and uses the opportunities around him to eke out a living. In the locality where he lives, a priest's daughter Yashodha (Harshika Poonacha), is in love with a photo studio owner who is actually a conduit for a human trafficker and asks Jackie to help her get married. Jackie initially tries to help but when the priest questions him, he decides to cop out of the issue respecting the aged father's feelings.
Losing all hope, Yashodha elopes with her lover, along with a blind girl. The priest is under the impression that Jackie is the mediator in this case. So it becomes responsibility of Jackie to trace Yashodha and the blind girl. Meanwhile, Jackie is followed by police as he has sheltered a friend who has fled from the prison and a cop gets killed during the escapade. In the dense forest, he averts a ritual of human sacrifice where Lakshmi (Bhavana Menon) is the intended victim. The trouble shoots up for Jackie again as even the wrong-doers are chasing him now. As he lands up in Bengaluru, he finds out that the blind girl who went with Yashodha is dead. He gets a clue of Prasanna alias Jooli when he becomes friendly to constable Bheemanna (Rangayana Raghu) which leads to suspicious activities of a gang transporting girls to abroad in oil tankers, headed by Mithai Rama (Ravi Kale). Jackie is on the hunt for the dangerous team and as the police from other part also follow Jackie, it is where the cinema finds a happy-ending climax.
[edit]Production

With a budget of 7 crores, the production of the film started on 3 March at Kantheerava Studio and took place for 95 days in Bengaluru, Mysore, Italy and Namibia.[13] The film is the home production of Dr. Rajkumarâ€™s family under the banner of Poornima Enterprises. Jackie is Puneetâ€™s 15th film and his first with Duniya Soori. The movie saw the debut of Malayalam actress Bhavana in Kannada language films.[14]
Director Soori, who is known for maintaining his script and characters a secret, had earlier revealed that the film is about how life takes a turn for Jackie and the way he faces the challenges and added that the film will be different from Puneetâ€™s earlier films. Soori, however, was initially "scared" to be directing a Puneet Rajkumar flick just because of the enormous expectations from the audience.[15] SnorriCam has been used extensively in the film's song and stunt sequences giving it a point-of-view feel.
Remake rights was purchased by NS Rajkumar, who is dubbing the Kannada film to Telugu and Malayalam languages for a 2011 release.[16]
