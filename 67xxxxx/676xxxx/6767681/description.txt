None of the files I will be uploading are mine, the credits go to others. 

All the files can be found on bittorrent sites. 

All have been re-encoded and cleaned up.

To everyone who don't hit and run but keep on seeding - THANKS.

On Wikipedia:

"Although the episodes are listed in airing order, there is a slight error on the disc one/volume one menu and cover. 
Mirror Mirror, On the Wall/Great Movie Mystery is placed BEFORE The Gumdrop Kid/Professor Presto, thus causing a mix-up with the selection on the menu."
....This has been fixed on this dvd.

Enjoy
