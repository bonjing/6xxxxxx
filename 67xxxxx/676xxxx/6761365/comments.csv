,lam1582,2011-10-21T21:34Z,"Thought I'd let you know I contacted support about your constant spamming. You were warned to stop that activity and you refused to comply. Bye, Bye spammer.

If anyone else thinks this spammer should be removed, please contact support. Copy and paste his spam and put it in your notification. It's at the bottom of every post he has ever made. Take the most recent one. 

To all of POtHS11 fanatics sign up for his news letter to receive further spam and ungodly religiosity.

Thanks"

Many uploaders on their pages encourage supporting the creative talent and production of the material being pirated non-stop here on this site.  It's often said, if u like the video/music, buy it!  Those who disagree, I'll make it simple for even them to understand, Just kill the goose that lays the golden eggs (so to speak), right?  To put this in perspective, one of the main reasons piratebay was originally formed was to bypass the idiocy of the mainstream media and govt control tentacles that suppress information, not just so the witless masses on distraction overload can watch movies for free.  but let's leave the big picture out of this and understand that rules were meant to be ____, right?  btw karma is a b- and im sure there are many people in powerful positions who would absolutely love to see laws obeyed to the letter ;)  o yea, anyone who posts image links for video quality happens to be spamming for that particular site (always an ad that pops up in those), hmm, what to do about that... lets face it, some people hate freedom of speech on some things and not others, and thus feel the need to resort to technicalities without understanding the big picture."
,lam1582,2011-10-22T04:33Z,"@Truther111 This is a place to post movies, music, ebooks, etc.  This is not a place to proselytize or  ""spread the faith.""  Such things are better left to blogging. "
,hendo666,2011-11-03T18:56Z,"This is a place to post whatever you damn well feel like actualy!just because you dont approve of the subject matter does not give you any right to berate someone when there are plenty of people world wide who welcome poths torrents. Just because your so thick you watch nonsencical lies like zeitgeist and lap up every word as truth in an attempt to make yourself look 'intelligent' as its 'cool' to knock christianity. 
Poths thanks as always."
