[S],velvet.,2011-10-21T15:37Z,Enjoy your pink skull.
,tops.c,2011-10-21T19:51Z,"I can understand the competition to get the ""pink"" scull ?, well it's a TOS issue for this site plain and simple. "
,Djcole,2011-10-21T22:35Z,"what the fuck is wrong with all of you??
if your that unhappy with it beeing the same one 
as the others.. first read MiSTERE all the other 1s
have that in the title. if you can't read then go
and risk your neck in a movie theater with a 
camcorder. and post it here at TPB.
Thank you charlesfire22.
and the skull means you can trust his uploads."
,Djcole,2011-10-21T22:38Z,"rochie you are the worst..
you share DICK and you complain the loudest.
Go and suck on your mamas tit.. fuckin' little baby."
,muroly72,2011-10-21T23:31Z,All you see is dark 
,Telgar123,2011-10-21T23:32Z,"The problem is they don't read. Instead they assume a movie is such and such. Then when they find out it is not what they expected, they complain like spoiled two year olds. You shouldn't complain about anything you get for free. Why? Because it's free and it cost you nothing. Simply appreciate the fact that here on TPB, you can download torrents which get you all kinds of free stuff. Say thank you to the uploaders and keep your useless and unwanted comments to yourself. Of course this is just my opinion. However, i am sure others with half a brain will agree with me. As to the spoiled two year olds, well fuck off. No one cares what you think."
,xeno100,2011-10-22T03:09Z,"Agree with the two above.

Thanks for the upload but it is way too dark to watch. 

Didn't start out too bad but that was only because the opening scenes are outisde in the snow. After that it's virtually impossible to watch. Audio isn't bad though but unless you have impaired vision you aren't going to want to just listen to it.

I'm to going to wait for something better."
,missJiaLi,2011-10-22T04:16Z,"Hey ""Torture"".......you don't sound hardcore or cool.....you sound like a 5th grade drop out who can't read anything that isn't 4th grade reading material and under. [aKa, you make ""rochie"" sound like a genius]


Anyways.......a piece of commonsense for folks.
You usually can't expect MUCH from a movie that has only been out for a week or under. AND, another piece of commonsense knowledge..........SCARY MOVIES WILL ALWAYS BE HARD TO SEE ON MOST CAMS IN THEATRES!!!![Duh]

So think next time, before you go postal on someone...........
Or, continue to go postal if that's the only way you can feel big and bad about yourself....cussing out someone like a moron via TPB because your loser-self could NEVER cuss anyone out like that in the real world.[LOL] 

But I'm just saying.......you look stupid when you don't A) Read descriptions/titles, and B) Lack commonsense."
,tigertunes,2011-10-22T12:43Z,"Remember every time a cam is placed here someone will take it and do there best to tweak it and repost it better, at least its the real deal stop whining and do one if you dont like it"
,ikilledsuperman,2011-10-23T02:03Z,"I am DLing now ! I tell it like it is NO MOVIE REVIEWS FROM ME. I only give pic quality ,sound quality, wat the real spoken language is (cause sometimes that can be other than wat it is listed as). & most importanly is it real & without unlock codes crap. Be back in 1/2 hr. or so. IKILLEDSUPERMAN"
,missJiaLi,2011-10-23T02:03Z,"Kudos to whoever deleted ""tortures"" brain-dead comment =)
*hi-5's*"
,ikilledsuperman,2011-10-23T02:30Z,"Ok dl complet spoken langauge is english, pic quailty is watchable sound not bad oh to all the haters out don't forget IT'S FREE ! ! "
,xeno100,2011-10-23T13:37Z,"I agree it's free and I've thanked the uploader in a previous post and agree with your comment about the 'haters'.

But...""pic quailty is watchable"". !?

It's only 'watchable' in the most basic sense in that you can just about watch it if you aren't too bothered about heads missing at times, parts of the screen cut out left and right, and that you never see half of what's going on because it's far too dark.  If you can watch a movie like that then good luck to you."
,carlsonjon33,2011-10-26T21:44Z,How long before a decent copy is available?
,imgettingangryreallyfast,2011-10-30T16:35Z,"if you are stupid enough to download a movie that weighs in at 300 mb thinking its going to work, then you have another problem "
