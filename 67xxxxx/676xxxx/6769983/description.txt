[NOTES]




As far as I know this is the only Math Advantage that wasn't uploaded to the net yet. This is also supposed to be the best or close to the best M.A Edition out and is also pretty rare. A couple of months ago the price for the only one was about $100 LOL

Got this of E-bay complete in box for only $.99 + $3.99 shipping  :]
