per my German friend:  there are many Europeans that can read English, but not understand the spoken word. 

I guess if thats true, than having subtitles in English would help them learn English faster.  Works for me !

This is only an hour long cartoon, so it should only be half the size of a normal blue ray rip.

Cheers"
,lizardomanson,2011-11-02T13:04Z,"bighands, subtitles are good for any good reasons, not necessarily for hearing impaired. Not everyone understand well when hearing english, but when reading it yes.

Besides that V= excellent, S= excellent

For the people that want subtitles, try this one 
http://subscene.com/english/Batman-Year-One/subtitle-496784-dlpath-91144/zip.zipx  i haven't tested it yet so i can't confirm is compatible.

,andares,2012-05-08T19:41Z,Subtitles confirmed ;)
