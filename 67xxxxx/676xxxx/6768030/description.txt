The third book of the Mathematics in Action series, Algebraic, Graphical, and Trigonometric Problem Solving, Fourth Edition, illustrates how mathematics arises naturally from everyday situations through updated and revised real-life activities and the accompanying practice exercises. Along with the activities and the exercises within the text, MathXLÂ® and MyMathLabÂ® have been enhanced to create a better overall learning experience for the reader. Technology integrated throughout the text helps readers interpret real-life data algebraically, numerically, symbolically, and graphically. The active style of this book develops readersâ€™ mathematical literacy and builds a solid foundation for future study in mathematics and other disciplines.
About the Author
The Consortium for Foundation Mathematics is a team of fourteen co-authors, primarily from the State University of New York and the City University of New York systems. Using the AMATYC Crossroads standards, the team developed an activity-based approach to mathematics in an effort to reach the large population of college students who, for whatever reason, have not yet succeeded in learning mathematics.
