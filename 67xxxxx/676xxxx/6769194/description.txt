[/b][/color] Charlie is a well-to-do bachelor with a house at the beach, a Jaguar in the front, and an easy way with women.
His casual Malibu lifestyle is interrupted when his tightly wound brother Alan, who's facing a divorce, and his son Jake, come to live with him.
Together, these two and a half men confront the challenges of growing up; finally.
Complicating matters are the brothers' self-obsessed, controlling mother, Evelyn, Alan's estranged wife, Judith and Charlie's crazy neighbor Rose, who wants to be a part of his life and is willing to do anything to be around.
