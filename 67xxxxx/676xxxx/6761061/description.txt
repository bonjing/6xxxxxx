Thanks for this book! 

P.S.

Can you ( F1 or someone else ) upload T.S. Eliot's book, "Notes towards the Definition of Culture"? I am a teacher of English here in Romania, and my daughter who is a student in the English department needs this for some exams! It is simply unfindable! Please help!
Thanks in advance!
