,meyr1120,2011-11-27T03:57Z,HR hey this says it is designed for direct playback on the xbox 360.  Well I stream from my pc to my xbox and it is glitchy and laggy to the oint where it is unwatchable.  Any suggestions???  Thanks for all your hard work
[V],HolyRoses,2011-11-29T22:59Z,use a usb drive or pen drive.  something wrong with your pc or streaming program or network.  cant fix that for u.
,meyr1120,2011-12-02T06:28Z,Thanks you were right it was an ISP issue.  Put them all on a 1 TB Ext HD and they worked like a charm.  Thanks again for all your hard work.
