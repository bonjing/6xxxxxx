,ddsd123,2012-01-20T18:47Z,"@kooninjz - I had the same problem (I only wanted to play Titan Quest, not Immortal Throne.) Make sure you follow the full install instructions in the nfo file (install both titan quest & immortal throne, then run the update). This will get rid of the disc error. Works perfectly! Thanks ForbiddenSoul"
,Asys85,2012-02-21T16:11Z,"I followed the Install instructions in the .nfo file but there wasnt any folder named ""Patch"" with the TQUpdater file as far as I could find?"
,div12345,2012-02-22T04:32Z,Work great !!
,bloodslainer,2012-03-09T17:47Z,"i have installed the game exactly the way it says in the .nfo text(and this is not the first time ive did this :p). but now the problem: if i try 2 start the game after the patch update etc. it says this:
Please insert the original disc.

so i downloaded a crack of titan quest immortal throne. but then if i wanna start or join a multiplayer server it also says this: please insert the original disc.

please some1?"

,tsukami,2012-03-28T08:06Z,are you unable to connect this game LAN because its pirated?
,deama12,2012-04-05T13:57Z,"I don't get it; there the fuck is the patch file? There is only the disk images and the .info, nothing else!"
,deama12,2012-04-05T14:00Z,"I don't get it, where the fuck is the patch file? There is only the image files, and the .info file!"
,deama12,2012-04-05T14:02Z,nvm about the patch; its apparently in the directory where you installed the game at :|
,WiredReflexes,2012-04-10T05:09Z,"I Can get this game working on one computer but with the other computer i run the game and before anything loads up it just crashes. ""Titanquest.exe has stopped working"". Any help?"

,ironymon,2012-05-22T10:27Z,Matches the quality of diablo 1 and two. Even rivals 3. Can't wait to play it.
,ironymon,2012-05-22T18:04Z,Fucking CRC error.
,axossk,2012-05-23T19:23Z,"-Install Titan Quest, ignore the crc error on Creatures.arc 
-Install Immortal throne
-Start the update in the immortal folder (C:Program Files (x86)THQTitan Quest Immortal ThronePatch) it will overwrite the corrupted file"
