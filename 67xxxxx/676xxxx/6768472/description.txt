Many of the current questions in particle physics can be addressed with the advent of the Large Hadron Collider, the world's most powerful particle accelerator, at the European research centre for particle physics, CERN, in Geneva, Switzerland.

Moreover, new space telescopes allow for better observations of high energy processes in space. This book presents the status of the field of particle physics at the highest available energies, and presents the recent results and experimental techniques, together with the future of the field. It will be needed and used by researchers from both high energy and astrophysics, since these communities increasingly join to answer key questions of physics.
From the Back Cover
Written by authors working at the forefront of research, this accessible treatment presents the current status of the field of collider-based particle physics at the highest energies available, as well as recent results and experimental techniques.

It is clearly divided into three sections; The first covers the physics -- discussing the various aspects of the Standard Model as well as its extensions, explaining important experimental results and highlighting the expectations from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The second is dedicated to the involved technologies and detector concepts, and the third covers the important - but often neglected - topics of the organisation and financing of high-energy physics research.

A useful resource for students and researchers from high-energy physics.
