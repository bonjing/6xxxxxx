This is the first book to comprehensively bridge the gap between classical vehicle dynamics and the widely-used, computer-based technique of Multibody Systems analysis (MBS). MBS is firmly established as a key part of all modern vehicle design and development processes; any engineer working on problems involving vehicle ride or handling will use MBS to simulate vehicle motion. Suitable for use both as a teaching text and a professional reference volume, this book is an essential addition to the resources available to anyone working in vehicle design and development. Written by a leading academic in the field (who himself has considerable practical experience) and the chief dynamics engineer of Prodrive, the pre-eminent rally, race and road technology organization, the book has a unique blend of theory and practice that will be of immense value in this applications based field. It is full of practical examples and applications. It uses industry standard ADAMS software based applications. It is accompanied by downloadable ADAMS models and data sets available from the companion website that enable readers to explore the material in the book. It guides readers from modelling suspension movement through to full vehicle models able to perform handling manoeuvres.
