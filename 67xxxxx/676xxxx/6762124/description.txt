  Duration: 02:37:45

     Notes:

While working on the two \"Pirates Of The Carribean\" films, Johnny Depp and director Gore Verbinski became 
fascinated with the lore and fable of the pirates and sailors who ran the high seas. Enter legendary 
producer Hal Wilner, who brings his knack for matching maverick musicians with extraordinary material. 
Artists on this double disc set include Bono, Sting, Nick Cave, Bryan Ferry, Lou Reed, Richard Thompson, 
Lucinda Williams, Jarvis Cocker of Pulp, and many more. \"Rogue\'s Gallery\" offers a look at the hardships, 
the horrors, the lusts and lurid depths, and the crystal beauty that led men to the sea in ships for 
hundreds of years.
