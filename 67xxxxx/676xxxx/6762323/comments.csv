,redactedwv,2011-10-23T01:50Z,"Fuck, GreyWiggle - Thanks for fuckin checking it out before rating it. Just d'led to encode an archive copy based on your rating and the fact that it's from EZ. 

Appreciate the up from EZ, but BS ratings like GreyWiggle's fucking suck. Check first, then rate. 

Thx to all s/l's... 'preciate it, all."
