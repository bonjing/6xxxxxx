,keywest33,2011-10-21T18:43Z,YES  IT WOULD BE USEFULL TO GET SOME IDEA ABOUT THIS
,dudefromdownunder,2011-10-22T01:11Z,"As far as I can tell, this is the Pro... it is definitely the FULL version. Installed (Mac version) on OS X Lion. Werx like a charm. Clean and fast. 

This, however, is only the App, minus all the Content and 3rd party plugins. The built in instruments are all there, but without the Content files, they give out no sound. Also, the fully licensed Melodyne is a 3rd party plugin that needs to be installed, which means it is not built into StudioOne. It is also missing from this DL.

You can, of course, download it from your PreSonus account, which you won't have unless you bought StudioOne and registered it, and all that.

Fortunately for me, I bought Melodyne DNA last year and the current version works with StudioOne 2.0 very nicely. I also bought StudioOne v1.0 last year with all the Content that came with it on 2 DVDs, which I found that I was able to install all of v1.0's content into v2.0.

What I'd like to see is all the Content for 2.0, including the Melodyne plugin, uploaded here, perhaps as separate torrents to keep sizes down, so that we can use this new version with all the goodies that come with it. 

Altogether it's an awesome piece of software. Thanx for providing it."
,maracuja_flash,2011-10-27T23:22Z,@dudefromdownunder: how did you get it running on a mac? I downloaded this torrent but the crack file is an .exe file... Any advice on this would be well appreciated!
,vichuns,2011-11-02T11:24Z,"This App is for both Mac & Windows, hence the two folders. Ignore the WIN folder - in fact, if you're on MAC only, you can trash it. 

In the MAC folder is a .dmg. Mount it and you'll find the App and a Crack folder. Drag and drop Studio One 2 App into your Applications folder, then launch and follow instructions in crack.txt. I don't remember now exactly how I did it, but I believe you can just drag and drop the license file onto the main window, and the App will process it.

I'm in the process of getting a new iMac, so I will be installing this puppy again. If anything more needs to be said, I will return and post...

Good luck."
