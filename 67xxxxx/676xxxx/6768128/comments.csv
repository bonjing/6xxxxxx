Video files do not compress, so there is no point in RARing them.

Why not simply create a torrent consisting of a folder with the TV episodes in it, the same way everyone else does it?"

But your question is good, I could also have unpacked it. Although it also has some samples with it, but that isn't any good answer either.

The main reason I am uploading this because I have some pc problems due to out of harddisk space and have this for a long time on my pc but want to keep this, and I checked if it wasn't already on here in this format with this subtitles. I also checked for which trackers to use or any help with uploading couldn't find any also not on the forums on recent topics or pinned threads and all."
