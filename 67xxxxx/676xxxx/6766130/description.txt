Let Them Talk Ã¨ l'album di debutto dell'attore e musicista britannico Hugh Laurie, pubblicato nel 2011.

L'album, composto da classici brani blues, Ã¨ stato pubblicato nel Regno Unito il 9 maggio 2011.
Alcune delle canzoni sono collaborazioni con noti artisti come Tom Jones, Irma Thomas e Dr. John.
Laurie ha eseguito in anteprima alcuni dei suoi brani in un piccolo locale di New Orleans nel marzo del 2011.
Nel Regno Unito, si Ã¨ esibito nella Union Chapel a Londra, al Cheltenham Jazz Festival, al Warwick Arts Centre di Coventry, e al Royal Northern College of Music a Manchester.
Laurie ha fatto inoltre diverse apparizioni televisive, tra cui quelle nei programmi di BBC Two The Graham Norton Show e Later With Jools Holland, ed Ã¨ stato intervistato in Chris Evans Breakfast Show di BBC Radio 2.

"Let Them Talk" is the first album to be recorded by Hugh Laurie after signing to Warner Bros Records in 2010.
Produced by Joe Henry and recorded in Los Angeles and New Orleans, the album is a celebration of New Orleans blues, a genre that drives Hugh's musical raison d'etre.

Spiritually inspired by similar genre albums like Ry Cooder's 'Buena Vista Social Club' and T-Bone Burnett's 'O' Brother Where Art Thou' soundtrack, Hugh's 'Let Them Talk' recordings bring together an extraordinary selection of heritage tracks, renowned musicians and vocal legends to champion this much neglected body of work.
Hugh drives the whole album on piano and vocals and is joined in the studio by the 'Queen of New Orleans' herself, Irma Thomas, blues piano and horns supremo Allen Toussaint, vocal legend Sir Tom Jones and in an especially momentous collaboration on 'After You've Gone' by his lifelong hero Dr. John.

Released on May 9th in Europe, the album launch will be supported by live shows in London, Paris and Berlin and a television special following Hugh's musical journey to New Orleans and featuring the performances of much of the album filmed at Kingsway Studios in the French Quarter along with Hugh's band and his incredible collaborators.
