,1subgenius,2012-02-12T20:49Z,"I solemnly promise to seed this to the best of my ability. This saves me a trip to the garage to pull out my discs and re-import them at a lossless quality. Contrary to music industry propaganda we are not all just thieves. Many were induced into the mp3 crap where you only hear 5% of the music as recorded. I will just stop there. 
Thanks for this...Madness is one of my faves, and I can't wait to hear them again in lossless.  "
