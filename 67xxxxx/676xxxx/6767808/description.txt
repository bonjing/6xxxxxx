Colin Murray introduces all the goals, highlights and talking points from a busy day in the Premier League. 
The five games include the Manchester derby. Clashes between United and City are always eagerly anticipated, 
but even more so this year after the terrific starts both clubs have made to the season. Many observers believe 
the title will be fought out between these two sides so this clash at Old Trafford is a massive game. 
There is also another local derby taking place with Chelsea visiting west London neighbours QPR for the first 
time in 15 years. Arsenal - who have not had the best of starts in the league - host Stoke, while the day's other two 
games see Harry Redknapp's Tottenham travel to struggling Blackburn and Martin Jol's Fulham take on 
David Moyes's Everton at Craven Cottage. As ever, there is a full review of Saturday's goals and incidents with 
expert analysis from Lee Dixon and Alan Hansen.
