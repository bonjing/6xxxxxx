,EdoSensei,2011-10-24T16:06Z,"Why do people still use .avi? 

Because MP4 doesn't work on a number of devices! I only ever used to DL pooloop's uploads, but now I DL the other's if possible because pooloop's MP4s won't play on my portable DVD player from the SD slot. 

That's why! It's also probably why other people regularly upload MotD now, when it just used to be pooloop."
