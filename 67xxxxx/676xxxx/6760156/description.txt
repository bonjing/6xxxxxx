Cave.Of.Forgotten.Dreams.2010.LIMITED.BRRip.XviD-EMBER 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1664894 

Plot:
In 1994, a group of scientists discovered a cave in Southern France perfectly preserved for 
over 20,000 years and containing the earliest known human paintings.
Knowing the cultural significance that the Chauvet Cave holds, the French government immediately 
cut-off all access to it, save a few archaeologists and paleontologists. But documentary 
filmmaker, Werner Herzog, has been given limited access, and now we get to go inside examining 
beautiful artwork created by our ancient ancestors around 32,000 years ago.
He asks questions to various historians and scientists about what these humans would have been
like and trying to build a bridge from the past to the present.
