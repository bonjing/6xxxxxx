Get "Up and Running" with AutoCAD using Gindis' combination of step-by-step instruction, examples, and insightful explanations. The emphasis from the beginning is on core concepts and practical application of AutoCAD in Architecture, Engineering and Design. Equally useful in instructor-led classroom training or self-study, the book is written with the student in mind by a long time AutoCAD user and instructor, based on what works in the industry and the classroom.

Strips away complexities, both real and perceived and reduces AutoCAD to easy-to-understand basic concepts.
Explains "why" something is done, not just "how": the theory behind each concept or command is discussed prior to engaging AutoCAD,  so the student has a clear idea of what they are attempting to do.
All basic commands are documented step-by-step: what the student types in and how AutoCAD responds is spelled out in discrete and clear steps with numerous screen shots.
Extensive supporting graphics (screen shots) and a summary with a self-test section and topic specific drawing exercises are included at the end of each chapter.  Additional practice is gained through  projects that the students work on as they progress through the chapters.
Also available in a comprehensive volume that includes coverage of 3D drawing and modeling in AutoCad.  ISBN for comprehensive volume is 978-0-12-375717-3
