,mang87,2011-10-23T22:43Z,"Does anyone notice the textures seem... really really low? Are the graphics terrible, or is this some sort of anti-piracy measure forcing low res textures?"
,tadpole76,2011-10-24T12:08Z,"as far as I can tell the graphics are the same quality as the original Arcania, the textures seem fine to me...
Anyone manage to get the game to recognize and import their Arcania character?"
,Wumps,2011-10-24T19:23Z,"Thx for uploading :)

Does anybody else have trouble starting the game ?
After choosing difficulty the game just stops working and shuts down."

just go to My Documents arcania gothic 4 and change the directory or delete."
,Wumps,2011-10-24T22:28Z,Wow that did actually work..  Thx brotha
,Jomapil,2011-10-25T15:15Z,Up to now the three releases of Arcania Fall of Setarrif don't function and nobody says anything? Please send a release of Skidrow or Reloaded.
,Fancellu,2011-10-30T21:19Z,"Yes, this is a consistent problem, you can't import your old game, which sucks big time. 

This game is supposed to be a sequel to Gothic 4, but I can't be bothered to play if I can't import old character. This is an issue with the proper game, you'd think they'd want to fix it, but I've seen nothing of the kind."
