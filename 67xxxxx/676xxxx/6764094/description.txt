Mega Breakdown: 747 Breakdown
For years, when a jumbo jet reached the end of its 30-year lifespan, it would end up in a scrap yard, or rotting at the end of a runway. But at the Evergreen Air Centre in Marana, Arizona, planes past their prime are recycled instead. Witness each step as they carefully drain toxic fluids, carve out the pricey parts - from landing gear and flight controls to engines and pumps - and then slice up the airframe.
