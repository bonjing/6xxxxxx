Hiya! Cheers for reading this, this is the bit aboot series 2. Well, what have we no been up tae? Loads, but hereâ€™s what happened in this series. For starters I thought it would be a good idea tae swap our seats on the flight home fae Afghan for tickets tae Shark World! VIPs and that - but the lads werenae intae it. Then there wis security for Barack Obama - which wis goinâ€™ fine till a bunch ay pure rabbits turned up - nightmare! Then we auditioned for an advert that wis mental and I dinny want tae talk aboot it. Then the chef got sick cos he ate a peanut - how funny is that?! Then we lost a tank - kindae... then we scattered ma mum aboot a path! Sounds good? You bet your face it is!!! See ya!!!
