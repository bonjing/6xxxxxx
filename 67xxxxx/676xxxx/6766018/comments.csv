[S],velvet.,2011-10-23T18:14Z,"Due to your longstanding practice of uploading your torrents to the wrong categories, I have removed the pink skull you used to have.

Music torrents should NEVER be uploaded to the Other > Other category.
Our system is very simple:

Upload music videos to the Video > Music video category.
Upload music FLAC torrents to the Audio > FLAC catgory.
Upload other music to the Audio > Music category.
Unless the torrents contain .TXT or .URL files, in which case they need to go in the Audio > Other category.


When you have smartened up to the point where you can be relied on to place your uploads correctly, you may contact me, velvetfog, in the forum, and I'll give you back your pink skull.
