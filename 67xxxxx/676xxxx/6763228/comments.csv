,Konkor,2011-10-27T10:44Z,"I have not tried this, although for those not running in a sandbox its your own fault for getting viruses you should be more careful. But I want to say that it is possible for super compression, a guy on here uploaded San Andreas (4GB) and compressed it down to 2MB... Sometimes the impossible is possible, but use Sandboxie just in case..."
