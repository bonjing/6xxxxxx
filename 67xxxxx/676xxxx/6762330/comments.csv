,splindsay,2011-10-26T13:53Z,"Whenever i try to open the program it says:

'File SYNSOACC.DLL could not be located in the windows system folders.'

then when i click ok, it says:

'File SYNSOACC.DLL does not have the expected interface.'

Can anyone help?"

,spokey123,2011-11-30T22:20Z,"Hey, I am very new to this:)!!!

So, I have downloaded the file, but I can not instal it now. It is image file, and neil1966hardy says that
""to get Cubase 5 installed and running All in one .iso image that you can mount using a virtual drive or burn onto a 4.7gb DVD and install.""

But I am new to windows, have been using mac, and I don't know what is a VIRTUAL DRIVE or how to install with a DVD?!?!

Plz help. Thank you"
