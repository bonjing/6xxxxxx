Readnfo:

JRRG have hardcoded there logo on the vid. It apears aprox 3x in the
movie and only lasts for a few secs. I didnt blur this, out of
respect for my source. I have also respected that, and have left
the logo, don't worry it isn't really bold and doesn't make any
part of the movie really unviewable. So nothing serious. Now,
you are probably wondering why we are releasing a CAM, as a TS is
already out. The reason for this is the same as what DD said, the
"LiNE" audio is pretty horrible and in many instances the CAM
audio was better and easier to clean up. So now for the last part
of the READNFO part: This is much better than the older CAM's
going around, which we very very dark. Don't expect wonders as
this is still dark in the dark scenes, only difference is that you
you can actually see more of what's happening this time around.
As always, it's free so why complain? Right that's the whole READ-
NFO part over. Now work done; we took the sweet source from DD,
Dropped it in for conversion, whilst it was there we added a few
filters of our own, before then tweaking our custom encoding setti-
ngs and converting down to a 500mb file. Looks way better than our
V1. The audio sounds way better, but don't expect studio quality,
it's still a bit muffled and has some minor issues, but it's free
and the best out so you can't complain. Ok nothing more to say
