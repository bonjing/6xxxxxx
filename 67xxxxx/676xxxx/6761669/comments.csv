,Azncrook,2011-10-21T21:36Z,"@rsl87
The DVDrip is already out, usually it take around 1 week for the Bluray version to come out after, been already  6 days since the DVDrip is out, so expect the bluray to come out soon, but as any torrent, we never know for sure when, hope that help you."
,rsl87,2011-10-21T22:19Z,Thanks Azncrook! Looking forward to that one.

,meothui,2011-10-25T18:00Z,"5.5 GB for a 720p? Don't you fucking know there's an encoding mode called ""quality mode"" which uses variable bitrate? 5.5 GB should be a 1080p with the same quality. The damn movie is retarded anyway."

,1476,2011-10-27T17:57Z,"Do yourself a favour and watch E.T and Close Encounters of the Third Kind instead. This film is totally uninteresting compared to the classics it's trying to emulate.

Abrams is not the new Speilberg.
Speilberg is not the old Speilberg. "
