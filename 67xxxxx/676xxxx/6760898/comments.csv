,MorphzreaZ,2011-10-21T14:06Z,never heard of this game.. so checked some clips.. an this game is not wurth downloading in my eyes... utter garbage
,just4phun,2011-10-21T14:24Z,"Hmmm so what's ripped? or by how much percent did you reduce the quality of the vids in this game? (If there is)? I'm just curious...
"
,Cheppo,2011-10-21T14:47Z,"Does this work ? 
Reloaded version gets a black screen flicker then crashes.

I know the game sucks but it is another 20 days for Skyrim :)"

,motley666,2011-10-21T15:40Z,"@ sonuyosro

I thought you were a serious uploader till i saw your comment here? Jealous? Maybe."
,Wowtgp,2011-10-21T16:11Z,Thanks dude.  @sonuyosro why u  always post weird comments?

,motley666,2011-10-21T22:12Z,"@ sonu

i am not an indian and definitely not an immature child as you. You will grow up eventually but you'll remain the same dipshit. "
[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2011-10-22T04:14Z,@sonuyos would u like a ban
,coolrick92,2011-10-22T04:35Z,"I have always never had any problems when emulating games, but when I mounted this and double clicked setup.exe (admin or not) all I receive is ""Access is denied"" Any help?"
,Dw514,2011-10-22T04:43Z,"To sonuyos:

I also thought you were one of the few non skull uploaders that had the potential to get a skull. But with your recent comments in various torrents, it clearly shows someone who is not educated or very immature.

PS: Just because you upload first doesnt mean your better than anyone, half your games have 6 different types of the same game( example DEUS EX Human Revolution)"
,bram00,2011-10-22T11:26Z,@trixrabbit 13..tried it doesn't work..oh well.. thanks for the up anyways.

,Skizzorz,2011-10-22T17:52Z,does this even work? after i click the setup.exe all it does is sit at a menu. nothing happens..
,XIRee,2011-10-23T04:17Z,"I've tested this and it works fine for me on win7 64. I have UAC disabled.

The game is quite fun while killing time, not something I would play everyday though and I usually don't play more then 1-1,5 hours then I get bored. 6/10

Anyway thanks again .Dude. for this fine release."

,deepak_rokz,2011-10-30T17:11Z,"for those who get black screen, can try this.

1. Go to your installation folder
%Program Files\Payday The Heist\redist\PhysX

2. Run the PhysX_9.10.0513_SystemSoftware.exe

that's all. hope it works.

Suggestion in another torrent"
,Ratman_84,2011-10-31T10:34Z,Installs fine. Game sucks though. Isn't really meant to be played offline.
,adnan4ot0,2011-11-04T00:13Z,what happened to the black box site ?
,iloveguns,2011-11-14T00:04Z,"To all of those that is having probs installing it, just click on the setup.exe then press ENTER whenever you need to. thanks great torrent, not so great game."
,XFirEFo,2012-02-17T16:43Z,When i reached to Reputation 52 every upgrade i had was lost.Why is this happening?
