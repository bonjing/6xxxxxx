,fairwaybaby,2011-10-25T18:51Z,yes new
,zincyellowmach1,2011-10-25T19:13Z,"Awesome you are the man!!! Was hoping this would be available so soon!!! Kudos! Now if we could get more seeders, but isnt that always the case lol"
,namajnin,2011-10-25T20:33Z,"Hmm, I can't seem to get it to work with WBFS"
,namajnin,2011-10-25T21:14Z,"I got it onto WBFS Manager, but when I start it up, it freezes after the press 2 to start screen."
,zincyellowmach1,2011-10-25T21:55Z,Are you using wiibackupmanager? If not try using 3.0
,joljolmax,2011-10-25T22:18Z,I'm using 3.0 and wiibackupmanager is freezing on the title screen of game
,zincyellowmach1,2011-10-25T23:14Z,"Softmod or chip? What version of os? I heard a rumor it needs 4.3, which sucks cuz i have 4.2"
,zincyellowmach1,2011-10-25T23:18Z,"Also experiment with different ios, that should be the key. If you dont have others go find some "
,zincyellowmach1,2011-10-26T01:19Z,Ok I did some research and 4.3 didnt really change much so its probably an ios issue. I use usbloader and ios 249. Try that. I will experiment when I finally get it downloaded
,steelbunny,2011-10-26T19:15Z,"Can't load to WBFS, it says :""Error(s) occurred while reading some of the iso files...""
Why? anyone knows?"
,fairwaybaby,2011-10-26T22:08Z,"use cfg loader or wiiflow cios249 or248 base 56, dx2 v6 installer is what you guys are looking for"
,sahara112,2011-10-27T09:35Z,"if you got::""Error(s) occurred while reading some of the iso files..."" you need to close ÂľTorrent or stop seeding untile finshing transfer to hdd"
,snader999,2011-10-27T13:38Z,Is this PAL of not?
,Martac,2011-10-28T13:01Z,Works like a charm! Its NFS but it worked great on my softmodded wii with usbloader. Had some trouble when I was adding it to wbfs manager. I removed the file from from Utorrent and tried to add it again and it worked... Wierd. 
,jta1973,2011-10-28T16:21Z,"thx for the tip zincyellowmach1, i used ios 249 and it works like a charm!"
,fuzzy4,2011-10-29T15:44Z,what is iso 249. do you just change the name to this. sorry if this comment is foolish but im new to the game..lol
,zincyellowmach1,2011-10-29T20:26Z,"No worries fuzzy we all started sometime, if you are using cfg usbloader click on the game so that you see the options for it, click options and close to the bottom you will see ios, change that to 248 or 249 and it should boot just fine."
,BigDet,2011-10-30T04:43Z,thanks game works great on my 4.1U softmodded wii
,fuzzy4,2011-10-30T10:22Z,thanks zincyellow appreciate it. Its working now
