Understand is very efficient at collecting metrics about  
the code it analyzes. These metrics can be extracted      
automatically via command line calls, exported to         
spreadsheets, viewed graphically, dynamically explored in 
the GUI, or customized via the Understand Perl API. They  
can also be reported at the project level, for files,     
classes, functions or user defined architectures. Most of 
the metrics in Understand can be categorized in the       
following groups:                                         
Tree Graph                                                
                                                          
    *Complexity Metrics (e.g. McCabe Cyclomatic)          
    *Volume Metrics (e.g Lines of Code)                   
    *Object Oriented (e.g. Coupling Between Object        
Classes)
