,Drakonas,2011-10-24T01:06Z,PLEASE SEED!! OMG! Don't download and then just remove the torrent! Honestly... How do you think others are going to download it if no one seeds?!
,Drakonas,2011-10-24T01:08Z,"Oh and I do have a dedicated uploading VPS. The other seed is my home laptop, which may not always be uploading. Also, I can seed from my phone when I'm on the go.

Thanks! Enjoy!"
,Drakonas,2012-04-20T03:31Z,"Whoever has been seeding this, thank you. I have not had the money to pay for my VPS to seed the music, and I run applications at home which require all of my computer hardware resources, and I cannot leave the computer running overnight.

Once I have the money, I will re-purchase the VPS, and start seeding again. Sorry."
