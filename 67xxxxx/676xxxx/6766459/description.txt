[== Description ==]

  This rip is from a brand new, clean disc, fully tagged to the best of my ability.
If you haven't heard Exit Trance's style of music, it is basically a mix of J-Trance and J-Core.
EXIT TRANCE PRESENTS Famitrance EX is the only Exit Trance album dedicated to Video Game music remixes.
Not only that, but in my opinion, it is the best video game remix album available.

  This album has remixes of classics like Dragon Quest II and Mother,
as well as slightly more recent games like Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy X and XII.
Plus, but it has the best Tetris remix I've heard to date.

  You will not be disappointed with this album, I assure you. It starts off slow, but you'll recognize the tunes almost right off the bat, I firmly believe.
Even if you've never played the original games, most of these songs are among the most remixed songs out there.
You are bound to have heard it somewhere along the line.

  This album could not be found anywhere in FLAC before I bought this. I looked before buying.
I hope you enjoy this as much as I have. It is also available at the FFShrine forums via Filesonic and

  Please buy this album if you love it! http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/detailview.html?KEY=QWCE-133
I used to pirate music day in, day out. Now, nothing feels as good as having an official CD in your hands, let alone one you love!


[== Notes ==]

All tracks are tagged from original CD, and VGMDB (Japanese version).


Some of the tags are tagged incorrectly. I apologize.

Track 17 was actually Mother 2. VGMDB was right. Someone from Youtube screwed up.

It is unknown if track 18 was written by Mari Iijima.
