This is the first torrent which doesn\'t meet the high standard. This torrent does have every Art Bell show from 2004.
I\'m not releasing it on Demonoid yet. But you can help!

If you have any shows I\'m missing, I can arrange SFTP access for you to upload shows to me.
I\'ll even take links from file-sharing sites, but those are least preferred.
Ideally you have many of the shows I\'m missing and you can post a torrent and notify the Google group or email me at Gmail.
