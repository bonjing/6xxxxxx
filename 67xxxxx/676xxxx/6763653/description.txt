  Love them or hate them - there's no getting away from caravans in     
  Wales. Eleven million caravan nights bring around 300 million pounds  
  to the Welsh economy every year and this series gets to know some of  
  the people spending their leisure time in their own fibre glass box.  
  We explore the joys of hitching your home to the back of the car and  
  hitting the open road or settling down in a static on one of Wales's  
  many coastline sites.                                                 
                                                                        
  Vince Owen from the Rhondda is leading South Wales Caravan Club's     
  attempt to win the biggest award in Touring caravanning - the         
  Inter-Centre Cup at the National Rally. This year the club will also  
  be hosting the huge event in Laleston, Bridgend. Will the host team   
  organise a successful weekend - and more to the point can they carry  
  home the cup? Eileen from Pontypridd knows her way around a netball   
  court but how highly does she score in the kitchen? The tug-of-war    
  team have spent all summer training but can they beat their arch      
  rivals from West Wales? And all the club's hopes rest on single mum   
  Angela as she takes on the best, in the caravan reversing             
  competition.
