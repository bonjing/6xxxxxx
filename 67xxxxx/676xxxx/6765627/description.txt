Features:

Drag Racing, as the name implies, is a game about two cars going down a straightway, and the fastest car wins. You control your car by shifting at the right times â€“ there is no steering involved, just timing. You can choose from a wide range of cars to purchase with your winnings, and as you progress, better cars become available.

There are a few different modes to play in â€“ the first is the basic mode, played on your phone against the AI, and is a good way to learn the controls and earn cash to start out your garage. You can battle â€œbossesâ€ for harder races that will earn you more RP to upgrade your cars, and finally you can go online to race other players. The cost of your car and upgrades will determine your â€œlevelâ€ which is what is used to match you up with opponents.

The developers are actively improving the game, and some of the features Iâ€™ll be really excited to check out down the line include things like full car customization, more new cars to unlock, and even the ability to challenge friends. The last is the one Iâ€™m most interested in, since it will take this game to a completely new level.

Tips How to Play Drag Racing:

1. Racing

Blue/green lights on dashboard will help you launch and shift at the right time
If there is too much wheel spin, you are not going anywhere
Once you learn how to drive properly, ignore the lights and find your own winning strategy
Nitrous is more effective on underpowered cars with lots of grip. Timing is crucial!

2. Cars and upgrades

Test drive before you buy a car!
The more your car costs, the tougher opposition youâ€™ll face both offline and online
Upgrades count towards increasing car cost/level, while tuning doesnâ€™t
Keep your car cost just under your level cap to get an advantage
Adjusting gear ratios (Garage -> Upgrade -> Tune) is costly, but lets you achieve times that are impossible on stock settings

3. Game modes and winnings

Race against beginner/amateur AI to get some quick cash and build your car
Defeat bosses and unlock achievements for extra RP
Go online and race against others to earn maximum cash/RP
If your car isnâ€™t ready for online races, earn some cash in â€œDrivers Battleâ€
For the ultimate challenge, race against top players in Pro League
