no cues, no logs...

be kind to us and provide a wee bit more info please..."
[T],ddirt80,2011-10-24T19:02Z,"Source is my CD collection, about 2 years ago. 
I ripped them using Apple iTunes, into Apple Lossless, because I was on a Mac, and didn't know worlds about ripping, like Logs and things.

Take them or leave them, they're lossless, but I suppose, not ""verified"".
