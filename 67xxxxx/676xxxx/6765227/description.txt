What happens when five best friends get together that bring a
diverse style of thought, talent and charisma?
By its own definition, LEGACY is something that creates a 
foundation and a beginning that can be passed on for
generations.
Forming out of the hotbed of the music scene in Ohio, these
Toledo natives bring a fresh sound that will definitely stand
out from the rest of the "scene."
The drive and passion of this band can really be heard in all
aspects of the music, from the catchy choruses to the brutal
breakdowns, daunting guitar solos and inspirational lyrics,
LEGACY will stick in your head.
In the short amount of time that these five have come
together, drawing from past experiences, they will catapult to
the top quickly.
Talented is an understatement considering where each of the
members come from and the national and international touring
that these friends have done before seeding their own legacy.
