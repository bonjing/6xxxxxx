,hart2412,2011-10-22T16:42Z,"Hi GEVD,
Thanks for the great uploads. I cannot get any of the updates to work even as administrator. Your original War in the East works great, but none of the subsequent updates. Any ideas anyone?"
,tvarohovej,2011-10-23T12:51Z,"hi,
I have the same trouble, this file includes a launch icon, that seems to be mentioned to replace original icon and some data, althought these files has overwritten the older files, nothong happened in the game, the game appears in the same old version I had, not in 1.05.32. Didn't help to run it as administrator..."
,hart2412,2011-10-23T21:17Z,I just keep getting the serial number error.

The main menu the lower right corner should read  Exe File Version 1.05.32                                                                                                                                 The version number that appears in ""version installed"" shows the wrong number.                                                                                                                              
The version number that appears the upper left corner is a false                                            "

Try to run the ""WarInTheEast.exe"" with ""Run As Administrator."
,tvarohovej,2011-10-24T20:13Z,"Thanks for reply, but even the lower right corner says I have old version. Seems I do something wrong. Are your files supposed only as copy and paste method? Because, there isn't any install file, like in patches from matrix. Of course I tried to run it as administrator also."
,hart2412,2011-10-24T21:07Z,"Hi GEVD,

""Try to run the ""WarInTheEast.exe"" with ""Run As Administrator.""

Thats what I have been doing, but I still get the serial number error."

Yes, you need only to extract  Gary Grigsby's War in the East v1.05.32 beta patch.rar to the game folder and overwrite the existing files.                                                               &                                                                  the game should now be updated to v1.05.32"

I do not know, but maybe you should try to uninstall & re-install the entire game and then update to 1.05.32"
