,Nillaj,2011-10-23T19:33Z,Lower quality then the other episodes.  Looks like the encoder recorded the SD Cartoon Network instead of the HD one.  The image is enlarged leading to a low quality picture and the top and bottom are cropped to make it widescreen.

If your going to record something, ffs do it properly or dont do it at all."
