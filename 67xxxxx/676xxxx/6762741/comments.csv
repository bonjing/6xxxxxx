,GaryBradbury,2011-10-22T09:24Z,You're welcome :)
,GaryBradbury,2011-10-24T02:26Z,I am trying very hard to upload the 3rd episode but Pirate Bay has not had an uploaded torrent for hours! I'll keep trying :)
,GaryBradbury,2011-11-20T07:54Z,"It isn't possible for me to continue seeding this torrent forever. So, if you find there are no seeds left, the link below is a direct download (not a torrent). This file is only 175 meg, so you won't need to become a member to get this particular show, but I recommend you do (It's as simple as creating a user name here on the Pirate Bay). The maximum file size a non-member can get is 250 meg. Meaning, when I upload Season 5 of Rachel Zoe, you won't be able to get it!!

Here is that Link-http://bayfiles.com/file/1cvb/k2IcmD/Mad_Fashion-_Season_1-_Episode_02.avi"
