,soft_13,2011-11-22T19:49Z,that's crap.. i've unpacked lotsa archives (252 MB) and got 1 file 4 MB sized.. what does that mean?
,meeps Oo,2012-01-06T23:53Z,@soft_13: use winrar to extract from multiple archive volumes like this
,CaioSniper1,2012-01-09T04:20Z,"Thanks a lot. Besides you have to unrar all the archives two times, it works good."
,Cannon_Drive-by,2012-03-18T21:03Z,"So I unpacked the files which was weird as every folder it did created the dynamics and file id_files which I had to tell Windows to replace all, but it went fine. 
Then when installing it told me to install the authorization manager, which I cancelled out of, and it didn't seem to impair my progress, so I guess you don't have to install that thing. 
I put the crack in, but didn't run the registry thing as I'm a bit wary of the safeness of it, as I don't recall doing such things in other software cracks. It would be nice if more than one person confirmed the safety of this. Either way, it seems to work without doing that step so I guess I'll leave it for now."
,Wolfy_J,2012-04-20T16:58Z,The .vpa64 file is broken for me. I'll try re-extracting everything but i may end up just using the 3.0 version.

It works 100 % for me (win7 32 bit)
the thing is .. you have to unpack the files correctly and follow the instructions !!
thanks dynamics"
