Description:

A stand-alone expansion pack, Arcania: Fall of Setarrif is the next installment of the Arcania storyline. An ominous, demonic force devastates the Eastern lands of Argaan, heading towards the coastal city of Setarrif. Meanwhile, King Rhobar III mobilises his royal military forces to conquer the last of the rebels. To make matters worse, the route to Setarrif is blocked by a volcanic eruption. Only the most simplistic of history books will describe this series of unfortunate events as a coincidence. The outcome of this tale depends on the nameless hero and his strongest allies.
