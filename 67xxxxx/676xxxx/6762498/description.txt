Hi there
Well it is the missing complementary apps package to get the exact complete full driver package for
my previous post for AMD 8.92-catalyst 11.11 beta_early preview
this part 2 is even bigger than the previous one.
This one has-gets 363 Mo size...
open this new archieve called \"Apps\"
You should see and find 8 new sub folders so.
Copy and paste the eight new ones directly into your first \"Apps\" folder of the first part of 
this complete driver package called : 8.92-111016a-126980E-ATI
afterwards you should get the exact and complete full driver package for a final size of 1,17 Go !!! Yeah,crazy ! i agree.
when totaly extracted or fully decompressed anyway.

Details of these new applications software and file : 
contains 8 sub folders such as :

DotNet35 : Net Framework 3.5

IntelMedia1 :
(Intel media component and its Media SDK and ibxHDMI for Intel switchable graphic driver support for :

Next generation Intel(R) Core(TM) processors (codename Ivy Bridge)
* 2nd generation Intel(R) Core(TM) i3 processor 
* 2nd generation Intel(R) Core(TM) i5 processor 
* 2nd generation Intel(R) Core(TM) i5 vPro(TM) processor
