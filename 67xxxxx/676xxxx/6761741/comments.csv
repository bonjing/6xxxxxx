,afroebob1994,2011-10-28T21:54Z,"Well, disc 2 was leaked from a factory or warehouse worker but not disc one so it COULD be real but I use the word COULD very loosely, I would call it maybe 25-35% chance of being real. Then again I haven't DL'd and scanned it so I can't give you any results on detected viruses."

,colinb74,2011-11-01T05:00Z,"@terrorking24 - NO. People need to ""Title"" the torrents more to the point. ""Modern Warfare 3 Screens, Vids and Concept Arts"" would have been more appropriate would it not? Just sick of misleading titles. Thanks for sharing ;)"
