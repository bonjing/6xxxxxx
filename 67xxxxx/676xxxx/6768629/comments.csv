,viscious-chris,2011-11-04T22:08Z,"Hi guys, finished downloading and seeding now. this is what i did to get the game running. 

1) mount iso DVD1 and DVD2. 
2) Install game
ps. for people who cant get the install to start I had to change the directory because it could not be found, I did this using the (...) box and browsed to  program files x86 because im win7/64.
3) after the game installs and exits with code 0.
browse to folder in the installation directory (Programme files x86 for me) and remove the TM signature on the folder by renaming it battlefield 3. 
4) find patch and copy and replace. 
5) play. 

ps. I am having trouble with audio and lag in campaign mode???? can anybody help please :)
3)  "
,viscious-chris,2011-11-04T22:12Z,"PS. I have reduced lag slightly by opening task manager and right clicking BF3 and setting priory to ""high"" as it was on ""low"". but still have some lag issue on campaign mode and audio issues. namely repeating! help please "

,TaleMunja,2011-11-14T00:58Z,"This works nicely. 
 You just need to rename folder ""Battlefield 3 tm"" into just: Battlefield 3 !
 Go inside-start exe and enjoy ;)

 Thank you guys for help and thank you uploader! 
 Great appreciation man!"
,kortuldevastator,2011-12-09T22:30Z,"for you who have lags in audio just update the drivers, it will anihilate the lag or at least draw it to minimum.
