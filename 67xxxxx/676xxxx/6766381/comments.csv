,SteXDudE,2011-10-24T02:23Z,"Blaze69,dude ,thats completly different game 
its ""Footbal Manager 2012"" not ""FIFA Manager 2012"""
,nick.nider,2011-10-24T02:32Z,"I can t believe they made an expansion for this game (such a waste of time and money)...it has nothing to do with the gothic series and it was so boring, linear and a catastrophe...pass this"
,Pimbax,2011-10-24T04:20Z,"Dear Blaze.. He was asking for Football Manager 2012.

Im waiting for the scene release of that game too.

Any news on that release will be apreciated.

,d_wayne,2011-10-24T12:24Z,Thanks for the upload by I have a question. Why did you list amphetamine as a system requirement? I'm a chem major and just thought that a little odd.
,elessarGObonzo,2011-10-24T14:14Z,"reinstalled a few times, crashes just after selecting New Game from menu. passed system requirements and ran Gothic 4 fine. ???"

,sonic30,2011-10-24T16:51Z,"Same issue as elessarGObonzo and allstar21369. Game installed fine, started fine but when I click on start a new game it crashes"
,sonic30,2011-10-24T16:57Z,"Okay I found the problem, if you have a save file in your ArcaniA - Gothic 4 folder, the game crashes. So now I dont know how to load my character from the main game to FoS."

windows seven ??"
,Rawlings44,2011-10-24T22:27Z,"Can't import a character, the game just crashes. What sonic30 said is correct, if you have an Arcania 4 save in your documents then the game will crash when you select new game."

,Jomapil,2011-10-25T15:12Z,Up to now the three releases of Arcania Fall of Setarrif don't function and nobody says anything? Please send a release of Skidrow or Reloaded.
,rocco_sifredi,2011-10-26T14:36Z,so is this a torrent that won't work ? if so...what is the reason this upload is here I ask ?
,rocco_sifredi,2011-10-26T14:43Z,"This is for the noobs that asked IDIOT questions:

1.As the uploader suggested come here often and check uploads , not only when you want a single thing.

2. Stop asking for particular games to be uploaded. This is no charrity or church morons! 
If you want some wait in line like the rest or go and buy the fucking game and stop whining like a smelling prick that you all are.

3. Stop giving suggestions what a uploader should do etc. You mean nothing to us. You are just some shitty beggars on which nobody gives a fuck !

4. Don't let here email address as if someone is even interested to email you to tell you exactly where your prick is and to instruct you hiw put stuff it in your mouth. You are mistaken this site and important users with ""lost & found"" service. You want something LEARN how to do it and pay attention when a uploader write down a README in the package."
,newmouse,2011-10-27T00:43Z,"I installed this & its running fine OK.
I'm playing a 'New Game' with a new Hero..
If you want to import a Hero from Arcania Gothic 4 
it HAS to be one that has finished the main quest.

Read this games Manual (you no you can do that if you really try;) .Its within this ISO  @@@@ "
,newmouse,2011-10-27T00:45Z,"Oh... me again.. I do have ArcaniA - Gothic 4 
installed @@@"
,SopLul,2011-10-27T16:09Z,"well...still can not manage to get my arcania character in the add-on.
I have played the endscene so I did finish arcania.
And i have the endgamexx.sav file in my documents/arcania like the manual says.
But still it crashed.
If I empty the folder like said in the comments the game goes fine and I start a new game with a new character.
But would be nice to import my old character.

Is it a flew in the FLT realease? Doing still something wrong? Or just a bug nobody can fix yet?

ps: running win7 x64, don't know if that matters."
,elessarGObonzo,2011-10-27T21:46Z,"rocco_sifredi,  take your own advice.  -  stop asking stupid questions: read the comments. torrent/game does work, jus can't import Gothic 4 saves.  -  you're talkn bout ""you mean nothing to us (uploaders)"": you ain't offering shit for upload thru your profile either!"
,John_Hill,2011-10-28T11:03Z,Does it working with the authentic game???
,elessarGObonzo,2011-10-30T05:18Z,
,msu2000,2011-11-03T00:21Z,"Explanation for ""non-working"":
The game crashes if imports non-updated end-save from Arcania Gothic 4. To avoid this, simply delete the folder ""%UserDocuments%\ArcaniA - Gothic 4""
This is standalone expansion, does NOT require installed Arcania Gothic 4.
The actual gameplay is not 10+ hours, but about 3-4. You may switch to max difficulty, even so you'll not have to use med. recoberies. 
Too easy, too short, too disappointing. True linear gameplay, little world, no terrain and extras for exploration. The entire Fall of Setarrif is about 10 times smaller than Arcania Gothic 4.

PS: Arcania Gothis 4 has 4 patches, as number 4 does not require any prevvious, and does not use any crack - the protection is removed by the manufacturer.

Have fun :)"
