  Throughout the 20th Century the car has been tangled up in the        
  social, political and economic fabric of Australia. It conquered the  
  interior, shaped the design of our cities, was the basis of our       
  manufacturing industry for many years, and created some of our        
  best-loved heroes. The car is embedded in our culture and our         
  psyche: lets face it, Australians are just a bunch of rev heads.
