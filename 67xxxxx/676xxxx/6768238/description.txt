What happens when we die - do we simply cease to exist or do we survive in some form? It's the greatest mystery of science. Now, biologists, physicists and philosophers are closing in on finding the answer to the ultimate question.

Space seems like it goes on forever - but does it? Surprising new evidence suggests that not only is there a place where the universe ends - but there is something unimaginable lurking beyond it.

Time is not what we think it is. New research questions the nature of time and challenges our most basic perceptions about reality.

New evidence forces us to consider a truly shocking possibility - is our reality an illusion?

New research is discovering that thoughts can fly across space and that we all may be part of a global consciousness. Scientifically, a sixth sense is entirely possible.

There could be more than one version of reality - and more than one you. As scientists unravel this possibility, a new astounding one emerges: these parallel worlds could determine the destiny of the entire universe.

A revolution in science is underway that will transform life on Earth and ensure our survival as a species. If we can solve the equation of everything, it will present the keys to creation itself.

Physicists are designing warp drives, learning how to pry open wormholes, and finding cracks in the fabric of the cosmos to bring the final frontier within our grasp.

Death is a humbling reality - but what if life had no end? Cutting-edge science embarks on a bold mission to extend human life and may soon bring immortality within our grasp.

Across the galaxy lie exotic worlds made entirely of water or stewing with poisonous gas. What kinds of creatures thrive in these places? Would they resemble beings on Earth, or could life take on new and unexpected forms?
