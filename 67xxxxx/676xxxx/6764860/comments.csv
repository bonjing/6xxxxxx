[T],trialNerror,2011-11-12T05:29Z,"Season 4 is currently incomplete.  
I need 2 episodes - one of them airs on Nov 19th - and no clue when the other airs.  
It will eventually and that's when I will release a complete Season 4 in 720p.
I'll be releaseing S4 in 2 parts as it's going to be about 30GiB total.  
I would release part 1, but the episodes I need are from the first half and I just can't release part 2 before releasing part 1."
