Civilisation â€” in full Civilisation: A Personal View by Kenneth Clark â€” is a television documentary series outlining the history of Western art, architecture and philosophy since the Dark Ages. The series was produced by the BBC and aired in 1969 on BBC2. Both the television material and an accompanying book were written by art historian Kenneth Clark (1903â€“1983), who also presented the series. The series is considered to be a landmark in British Television's broadcasting of the visual arts.[1]
