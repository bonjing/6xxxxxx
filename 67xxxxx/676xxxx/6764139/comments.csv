,bronco4,2011-10-24T22:59Z,"This is nothing more than the usual, traditional USA view of the war. That this war, was just nothing than a tremendous beating, a genocide of an entire population, is nothing that the makers of this âinformationâ films are able to even think...."
,dmnrocha2,2011-10-26T06:40Z,@bronco4 Oh shut up you harpy.
,asputasdaminhavida,2011-10-29T21:49Z,Vietnam was an illegal invasion by the USA that got killed millions of civilians to support yet another corrupt dictatorship.

Seeeeeed......god.......damn....it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,{me},2011-11-10T04:14Z,"War isn't illegal R'tard, it's war. Congress declared war therefore it is legal. Don't be stupid just because you disagree with the legislator's choices. If you really care to learn about Vietnam and the war a movie (from any director) is not going to be sufficient. Read, read, read. It's an amazingly shaping factor of [my] country and had we not learned the lessons we did then we might only now be learning them. 
Every man dies, not every man truly lives. And every man that served in Vietnam has lived more than you could imagine.
Happy Pirating. Thanks for the Up."

You said:
""War isn't illegal R'tard, it's war. Congress declared war therefore it is legal""
ARE YOU A FUCKING MORON? Yes, you are. 

Since when does the US congress make something ""legal"" in the world view? 

Every man lives? Stop drinking your own urine. They no more lived than anyone else. Go take a fucking class on Buddhism and learn ""living for the present moment"" instead of spouting off nonsense about soldiers somehow living. 

For your information, what everyone else said is correct. Vietnam was a horrible war. The US invaded a country and killed many innocent people all in the name of a bullshit war. They backed a corrupt covernment all in the name of some bullshit democracy. 

Same bullshit the US is pulling in Iraq right now. 

This film is from a horrible US perspective on the Vietnam war. They are fucking retards (just like you) and have no fucking clue. Vietnam has had border wars with China for many many years. The US only made China and the Communist problem worse by invading. The whole Gulf of Tonkin was a LIE (and proven so) just like WMDs in Iraq. Yet, stupid ""Mericans"" believe the bullshit.

The soldiers are invaders, plain and simple. They are not liberators. Somehow people get killed and have to bullshit themselves into believing they were heroes and died for a good cause. The fact is, they are fucking morons and their death has NO MORAL VALUE. Stop making them out to be heroes when they are NOT.

The US STILL has not learned the lesson as they have yet invaded another country, installed a puppet democracy, and killed many innocent people (more than Saddam himself killed)"
,buzzman758,2011-11-25T06:19Z,"@hachiko11, pretty much to your amazement, the US runs the world, like it or not. If Congress says it's war... it's on.  Although you are probably of Asian decent, you thought the war was bad, and it was.  The soldiers are heroes because their choices were, got Vietnan or go to jail. The US DRAFTED soldiers and MADE them go. I would be like forcing your head down a toilet and flushing it and saying, take the flushing or spend the rest of your life in a prison cell.  Same exact thing.

Now, the way the US fights wars... we don't torture people unlike the North Vietnamese. Yes we probably killed women and children, but they carried bombs to kill us, so what would you do?  Hmm?  If you had seen your best friend blown up by a 6 year old little girl carrying a bomb, wouldn't  you be a little leery too? Yes you would.

Our soldiers ARE heroes, any soldier is. However their welcome home here wasn't very grand and all inviting.  They were spit on and ridiculed.  It wasn't even their fault they were in the damn war... they were FORCED to go.

So maybe you should look up your history lesson a little bit before flapping off at the gums...

BTW, the only thing that saved the N Vietnamese is we just played around in that war, had we gone all out to win.... there would be no N Vietnam... Think about it..."
,buzzman758,2011-11-25T06:21Z,"@Hachiko11, we are Christians here in the US, any other religion is blasphemous. So why should we read about Buddhism?  Do we come over there and MAKE you  read the Bible?  NO!  We might suggest it, but we don't MAKE you."

,sirnamemr,2012-03-28T08:09Z,"Just wanted to let people know the torrent's description is wrong concerning the titles and content of the DVDs. Here is the correct DVD titles/content for this torrent.

DVD 1 - Spying And Espionage In Vietnam
DVD 2 - Declassified: Viet Cong
DVD 3 - Warriors Behind The Line
DVD 4 - The Tet Offensive/Disaster At Dien Bien Phu
DVD 5 - The Battle Of Khe Sanh
DVD 6 - Gunboats Of Vietnam

Noticeably different right away is DVD 5 witch is completely different then it's suppose to be and so on. It's not just here but all over It's the same difference so whoever made the torrent originally must have made a mistake. The source seems to be the same but the torrent version has the addition of the History Channel logo on the DVD's so the content must have been changed for them.

A/V Quality Out Of 10 Is...

8/8

The DVD file sizes are huge for the length of video, maybe I will try making them smaller and converting them to AVI or something. Thanks tho to the uploader, great stuff.

SEED or DIE"
,bmk0666,2012-04-24T22:29Z,some of the plp commenting on this  are dumb ass and u wasn't even there or even born yet so how THE FUCK WOULD U KNOW and war isn't illegal and in every war innocent civilians are killed and for u dumb ass who don't know history is written by the winner and if u don't like it don't DL it
