Hello. Thank you for downloading the Discography of Springfield, Illinois band: Dog Of Panic.

This Torrent was created by the band to gain more exposure for the band, because Record companies make it very hard for the small guys to make a living with their originals.

Weâ€™ve given you this free gift, in hopes that you will return the favor.

First and foremost, weâ€™d like you to invite you to hopefully buy our music: 
http://dogofpanic.bandcamp.com

I know youâ€™re thinking, â€œI already have your music. And it was free!â€ But  Iâ€™d like you to think of your purchase in different terms. Think of it like a donation to a DIY band thatâ€™s trying to make a name for themselves.  Youâ€™d also be supporting local music. And all the proceeds go directly to the band. No corporate fat cats, no royalties to labels, and NO STEVE JOBS!
