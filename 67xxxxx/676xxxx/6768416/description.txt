  Ever wanted to chill out on a warm sandy beach, with lush palm trees,
  calming blue waves and a horde of brain hungry zombies? Here's your
  chance - Zombie Driver: Summer of Slaughter contains the new Paradise
  Island Slaughter map.
 
  Fight your way through the streets of a zombie infested city to save the
  survivors of a disastrous chemical accident that changed most of the
  city's population into mindless brain hungry monsters. Time is the enemy
  and your car is a weapon as you race through the streets smashing
  everything on your way including fences, phone booths, street lamps and
  hordes of zombies. If you get tired of rescuing people, take part in the
  Blood Race tournament. Chase other cars and take them down without mercy
  on special racing tracks populated with the zombie horde. Earn loads of
  cash while you progress through the events, unlock new rides and purchase
  weapons of mass destruction to become the ultimate Blood Race leaderboard
  champion. If the car chases and speed runs are not your thing, jump into
  the Slaugher mode where your objective is to survive as long as possible
  while ramping up enormous kill combos and annihilating endless waves of
  zombies on specialy crafted arenas.
