,xenoFLASH,2011-10-23T07:01Z,What if Peter Parker killed Peter Parker? Crazy. What will they think of next? What if Wolverine killed Wolverine?
[V],GunningHawk90,2011-10-23T07:05Z,Its actually Ben Reilly :P
,xenoFLASH,2011-10-23T08:18Z,Ben Reilly is a clone of Peter Parker.
[V],GunningHawk90,2011-10-23T08:41Z,Exactly. Parker killing Parker kinda sounds like suicide.
,trblewalkn,2011-10-23T17:37Z,"A better comparison would be What if X-23 Killed Wolverine, since she's a clone of Logan"
