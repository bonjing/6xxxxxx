To babybluetits24 :
Stops al 98 ?? Are you loading 2 almost identical torrents?
Then it will go wrong but you only wil miss the info but can write the iso to a disk"

Yeah I got the same problem sometimes. But not only with Azureus, with Limewire etc. too.

 In my experience, its because the download is split up into little files over different uploaders. 
But when its almost complete, all the little files have been downloaded, and it needs to reassign a little part to another uploader, but therefore it needs to reconnect, so that takes a little while. 
But if you are patient it will eventually download completely."
