,SpaceCadet6969754,2011-10-22T13:32Z,Seriously this is like it was made by high school kids with a handicam and a laptop.Torrent quality is 100% but the movie is unbelievably pathetic beyond stupidity.
,eNdEmiOn06463,2011-10-22T20:43Z,"@FuCtUpPuNk
Only occasionally the rating is really wrong and usually when it's really wrong the rating is much to high instead of too low."
