,rabbit74,2011-10-24T05:47Z,"Compression is too much.

Video quality is poor due to over compression.

I like the idea of what you are trying to do, but dial the compression back a bit. Handbrake defaults are best."
,albokid89,2011-10-24T07:01Z,Thank you! +1
,sexyface,2011-10-24T14:19Z,Video quality is not poor... video quality is good and makes the stranded AVI dvd rips look like crap. mp4 and mkv rips are the way forward ... and the size is good for ppl who dont want 5gb plus down load size... i give super 8 V10 A10 M 8 
,Symn,2011-10-24T21:36Z,"Too much compression!? WTF?? Whatever.. On my screen (1440 x 900) it looked absolutely perfect.
I thought the audio was a bit 'uneven', a lot of dynamic range. Which is good for the theatre but sometimes it scares the shit out of me. Anyway:

A/V: 10!
M:7.5"
,Sanyi001,2011-10-24T23:23Z,yeah 720p and only 700meg is too good to be true
,esapxai,2011-10-25T02:55Z,THankssss
,munky261,2011-10-25T06:57Z,I played this in both VLC and Media Player Classic and had something come on the screen telling me to use windows media player.
,albokid89,2011-10-25T06:58Z,"Not bad at all man, thank you +1

,s_t_o_r_m,2011-12-31T03:50Z,"x264, MP4, MKV - THIS IS THE FUTURE!

People should start to realize that this type of torrents (700MB & 720p & excellent quality) are the future and they will replace AVI.

700 MB x264 = 1.4 GB AVI"
,ricbush,2012-01-20T06:59Z,"yify, can u upload mission impossible 4 plz?"
,OverlordAlexndr,2012-03-11T19:58Z,"awesome video quality, although the sound is a bit off. I mean, you hear everything well, but when some action scenes come, your speakers blast the brain out of your ears. not to speak if you have headset.

DK, maybe its the movie itself, not the uploader, but Im just saying so that others know.

thanks YIFY"
