This two-part series follows rookie DC Anna Travis. Anna is assigned to her first homicide case; a string of grisly murders that have gone unsolved for the past eight years. The discovery of a new victim, who doesn't fit the usual profile of prostitute or drug user, causes concern that the killer may be indiscriminately targeting his victims. Eager to prove herself, Travis uncovers a vital piece of evidence linking one man to all the killings. But things get complicated when she finds herself attracted to the prime suspect...

Series 2

A young girl dumped on the banks of the Thames. Horrifically mutilated and drained of blood, her death is an ominous mirror image of an unsolved 1940s case in Los Angeles known as "The Black Dahlia". Detective Inspector Anna Travis must race against time to catch this copycat killer, dubbed "The Red Dahlia" from the flower his victim wore in her hair. But there are no suspects and a media frenzy is spiralling out of control.

Series 3
