,useduser,2011-10-24T07:05Z,"be nice to noobs, they are fragile."
,ribcord,2011-10-24T07:06Z,"Piechanface, you're just a dick. I was as impressed as fixdeman by the very large gap between seeders/leechers, regardless of the recent availability. I'm gonna assume that you're the fucking noob, as you took the time to be an asshole for no apparent reason."
,Thomas197205,2011-10-24T07:19Z,Thx!

,bossnig29,2011-10-24T07:51Z,"Being an asshole =/= being a noob.

Thanks ezTV, always fucking great quality."

,TheSageM,2011-10-24T10:22Z,"Marry me, EZTV!"
,VampireMuffinMan,2011-10-24T11:44Z,"For noobs, here's how this works...
1) Uploader uploads the file and is one seeder.
2) People start to d/l the torrent and are 'leechers'.
    [because they aren't yet sharing the whole file...]
3) People start to complete the d/l and only then are they considered
    'seeders'. [because they are sharing the whole file...]
4) People who are leechers whine that there are so many more leechers
    than seeders. [even though they *are* leechers...]
5) People with a clue laugh...because it's funny.  Sad, but funny."
,VampireMuffinMan,2011-10-24T11:46Z,"BTW, Love eztv...  I always go straight for their uploads whenever possible as I never have a problem with the quality of your offerings.  You guys are awesome."

,samvanzeeland,2011-10-24T14:37Z,"VampireMuffinMan ..... you dont have to complete the file to seed it, i have higher seed then leach ratio sometimes"

,VampireMuffinMan,2011-10-24T19:53Z,"I'm just saying that in order to be considered a 'seeder', you must be sharing the whole file.  Until that happens, you show as a 'leecher'.
As for thanking eztv for the quality, you're right, LOL and others deserve the credit for that."
,BARB05A,2011-10-24T20:58Z,always nice to see torrents go viral like this
