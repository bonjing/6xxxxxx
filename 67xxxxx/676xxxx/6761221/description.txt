  Release Info:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Nathan Spencer will make use of his trademark tool
   his bionic grappling hook  to grab, swing and 
  leap through series of lush new environments. Hell 
  be met by plenty of gun-toting soldiers and mechanized
  threats ready to give him a hostile greeting. Bionic
  Commando Rearmed 2 improves upon the visual achievements 
  of its predecessor with the addition of more detailed 
  character models, textures, and vibrant colors. New player
  mechanics will add another strategic layer of platforming 
  to the overall experience and the famous bionic arm will 
  be getting a major makeover delivering a more dynamic bionic
  experience to the player.
