,MRShanku,2011-10-24T12:23Z,Ok done dude...
,ramashu,2011-10-24T16:25Z,"@jhonnynewyork2011 : Dude, Y are u posting same request with each & every 720p small size uploader..."
,ramashu,2011-10-24T16:30Z,"@MRShanku : Bro no offence about u accepting the request of LOTR Triology for small size 720p, but same uploads are already done by Gunnersrock & StylishSaLh in small size & also YIFY is uploading it in near future...

I have only concern that, as ur net speed & encoding speed is slower than many others & if you consider these kind of repeated requests which are already available in TPB then other nice & rare uploads that u are doing will get delayed even more..."
,jhonnynewyork2011,2011-10-25T05:40Z,"i was requesting to mrshanku , give me that link which were u taking about coz stylishsalh trilogy is not working "
,ramashu,2011-10-25T22:46Z,"@jhonnynewyork2011 : I dont know which link u had asked for... Ok I will give 2 links, 1st one abt ur request to other uploader & 2nd one to LOTR triology by gunners rock... enjoy...
