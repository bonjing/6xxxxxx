If youâ€™re like most guys, then itâ€™s likely that youâ€™ve had a few hit or misses with women. I remember the first time I tried to approach a girl, it sure wasnâ€™t pretty. My hand was shaking, my palms were sweaty and Iâ€™m pretty sure my voice cracked when uttered my first words.

Was it simply genetics at work? Was I born a man thatâ€™s incompetent with women or is it just something I hadnâ€™t figured out yet? All I knew is I wanted to change that part of my life, forever.  I was a man in need of a change!

So I started asking around on forums, then reading some books, observing some friends and I finally figured out what to say! Yay. Unfortunately, even though I knew what to say, women still werenâ€™t responding to me in the way that I wanted them to.

What was wrong? Wellâ€¦ everything.

I was a geek with a few lines and a little knowledge on how women worked. Giving someone a few lines and pointers is like throwing someone in the ocean when they canâ€™t swim. Youâ€™ll remember that you have to move your arms (like youâ€™ll remember the lines), but youâ€™ll be so panicked that youâ€™ll flail all over the place and barely make it out alive.

Instead, the ideal approach is to become a swimmer first by learning in a pool with a trained professional and you wonâ€™t even have to think about moving your arms, youâ€™ll just do it.

The man transformation program is very similar to this in the way that it transforms you into someone whoâ€™s great with women, so when you talk to them, theyâ€™ll automatically feel all tingly inside. You wonâ€™t have to remember pick up lines, or cheesy canned openers, youâ€™ll just be naturally attractive.
Youâ€™ll be one of the very few guys that has women chasing them.

Then when a woman actually gets to know you, sheâ€™ll love you for who you are because youâ€™re being genuine.  Thatâ€™s what man transformation by David DeAngelo provides, it morphs you into a person that is so successful with women, once a woman finds you sheâ€™ll never let you go!
