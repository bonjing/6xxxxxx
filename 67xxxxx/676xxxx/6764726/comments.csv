Ditto that percentage for me as well.

By the way smb, is it safe to assume that the recent torrents you have been uploading haven't been added before?  I put my music onto an external hard drive and it'd be great not to end up with duplicates.

I'm enjoying The Chris Robinson Brotherhood concerts you've added.

Cheers from the other side of the globe."
