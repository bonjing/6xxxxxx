 Âº  Description  Âº
 


The Web is all about innovation, and Firefox sets the pace with dozens of new features 
to deliver a faster, more secure and customizable Web browsing experience for all.

User Experience. The enhancements to Firefox provide the best possible browsing 
experience on the Web. The new Firefox smart location bar, affectionately known as the 
"Awesome Bar," learns as people use it, adapting to user preferences and offering 
better fitting matches over time.

Performance. Firefox is built on top of the powerful new Gecko platform, resulting in 
a safer, easier to use and more personal product.

Security. Firefox raises the bar for security. The new malware and phishing protection 
helps protect from viruses, worms, trojans and spyware to keep people safe on the Web.

Customization. Everyone uses the Web differently, and Firefox lets users customize 
their browser with more than 5,000 add-ons.
