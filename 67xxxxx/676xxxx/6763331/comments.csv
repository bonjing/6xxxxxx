,russell1nash,2011-10-23T16:09Z,"I also appreciate your work, but hate false advertising! I was very disappointed to dload a Kurosawa u have upped with a clear description of EN subs present, only to discover, after completion and seeding, that there were none present... Not cool, my friend, not cool at all!
