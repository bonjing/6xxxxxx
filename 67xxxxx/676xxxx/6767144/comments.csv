 Let me know if is working. I'm curious."
,R0ck3rul,2011-10-24T10:52Z,hey man can you seed the game ?
,R0ck3rul,2011-10-24T11:39Z,Why have you uploaded this if you're not seeding it?
,redabaris,2011-10-24T13:47Z,"@ROck3rul
I'm seeding from the moment i've uploaded. If you're running on a modem, than it's your problem."
,redabaris,2011-10-24T13:52Z,"And by the way, on my uttorrent is no leacher, just me seeding. So....next when you came with stupid question (ROck3rul) i will not answer."
,redabaris,2011-10-24T15:32Z,this torrent is dead...you'll gonna found reuploaded under the name Morrowind (Overhaul included)(RedAbaris)
,R0ck3rul,2011-10-28T22:37Z,"@redabaris i can download other torrents from TPB just fine and in my utorrent list i was having 10 peers but no seeds.
And BTW i've tried to upload to demonoid and it worked so i think it is a problem from you.
Or maybe you forgot how to upload a torrent."
