T.E.S III Morrowind (Overhaul project included).
 Ok. More details about Overhaul you can find over the internet..Google search.
 The game includes Tribunal and Bloodmoon and you don't need any crack or CD to mount in order to play, just follow the info inside the folder (it's very very easy).
 Created and tested only on XP 32 bits, not on Vista or above, especialy on 64 bit 
platforms. I guess you know how to run old programs/games under Vista, if not then too bad. Create a shortcut to your .exe file than check (on shortcut) compatibility and administrator junk. Not every time is working (that's the programmer's fault....and Microsoft in the first place) so i'm gonna stop glittering about that, right here. If you cannot make the game to start, let me know.
 Overhaul is using the latest update, 1.3.
 P.S.: Almost forget, you'll need 5,64 Gb for decompression.
       Using 7zip (LZMA2-Maxim (32)-solid). If you're using IZarc, PowerArchiver or other garbage, download and install 7zip, PeaZip,WinRAr (latest version).
 Whatever, leave a message just in case.
