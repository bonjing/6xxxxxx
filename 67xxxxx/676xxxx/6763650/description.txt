PLOT:

Noynoy runs a barbeque stand with his friend Brad across the Red Light Beerhouse.
This is where he sees and eventually falls for the bar girl Jewel.
Although Noynoy is afraid to cross paths with Harry, Jewel's pimp, he proceeds to come up with an escape plan for Jewel, to "save" her.
"Ang Beerhouse" is a satire and black comedy set in a carnivalesque bar filled with colorful characters not far from our contemporary society- the corrupt but anonymous boss, his power-hungry henchmen, seductive sirens, low lives... together with a dreaming and struggling underdog... and the alluring muse.
Sexy and funny, yet insightful.
The Beerhouse will intoxicate you.
