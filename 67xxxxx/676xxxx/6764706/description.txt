Republica - Speed Ballads

After their hit debut album Republica released Speed Ballads in the UK in 1998, reaching #37.  Unfortunetly the label went bankrupt before the album could be sold in the states.  Most American don't even know this album exists!  And what a gem it is.

As the name suggests, fast paced music with manic energy.  Suffron really outdoes herself.  This is very hard to find in FLAC!  I went out and bought this so download now before it;s gone tomorrow!
