On Friday's Mark Levin Show: We bring you the Best of Mark Levin. Mark discusses how the attack on millionaires and billionaires is also an attack on you - that the Democrats are eying your 401K packages and won't stop there. Small businessesâ€™ and the individual are under attack as there is no end in sight to what the socialist ideology wants to do. Also, Mark calls on President Obama and the Democrats to denounce the Occupy Wall Street movement that includes hate groups and lawlessness. Finally, Mark discusses the Republican candidates and the positives or negatives of some of them. We can't stand for an Establishment Republican that won't lower the deficit or roll back the socialist tide.  Rather, we need a principled conservative who is capable of bringing America back to its' principles of liberty, freedom, private property and a free market economic system.
