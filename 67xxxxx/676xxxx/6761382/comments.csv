[V],Hackulus,2011-10-21T20:10Z,"nobody is asking you to download, wait for a dvdrip and stop complaining about something free"
,touchwoodblues,2011-10-21T21:14Z,What he's bitching about is that you advertise it as a PPV when it is obv NOT ....
[V],Hackulus,2011-10-21T22:02Z,"yes it is a ppvrip I have re encoded it from a different source for better quality, if it was anything else i would have labled it different, I will upload samples next time to stop people complaining"
,Ozdl,2011-10-22T03:13Z,"Just ignore them, Hacklus - some of us appreciate that people like you are willing to upload.  And as you say, nobody is forcing us to download!"
,Ozdl,2011-10-22T05:26Z,"Sorry about spelling your name incorrectly, Hackulus!"
,giggedyguy,2011-10-22T09:08Z,"What ever happened to scene groups releasing R5's with a couple months? Seems like they concentrate on PPV and Iflix stuff, which don't earn them nearly as much from storage hosts because most people won't download them?

At least Kackulus bothered to reencode his upload for us. So many new ""groups"" popping up that don't even bother. Thanks, dude."
,UKMadDog,2011-10-22T09:17Z,Still way too dark for me in the indoor/night but thanks for the up

@touchwoodblues

You are both scumbags. You both haven't uploaded a single torrent, and then you come to this one, moaning like little babies about the quality.

So you have 2 choices here:

1: Fuck off and never come back
2: Upload a dvdrip yourself
3: Download the movie en be thankful its free.

And we all know choice 2 and 3 are never gonna happen. Goodbeye.

And before you go criticicing my english: i'm from holland and my english is bad."
,guanche07,2011-10-23T10:50Z,"Hackulus don't listen to some of the negative comments, your doing a great job, again well done!!! ;))"
,millennium5,2011-10-25T09:25Z,Is is realy noone who got the bluray of Cowboys & Aliens? According to amazon its out.
,Aizou,2011-10-25T11:04Z,Do you have any idea when this movie will come on Master quality?
,CuttURface,2011-10-27T20:06Z,puff Puff -----'
,sv8.pro,2011-10-28T02:56Z,There is no r5 of this because not all movie studios do r5 releases fox and sony do and im not sure about the rest .
,Ozdl,2011-10-28T07:59Z,"wrwrr, your English is very good, and I fully agree with what you have said!"
,port8080,2011-10-29T04:47Z,"@wizzkid1970 - your'e not a dick..your'e just foreskin working it's way to become a dick.

@Hackulus - Nice Work..the other TS XVID Copies were makin' my eyes bleed...

Spread the Joy...Thanks Again for the Encode!"
,THEflerp,2011-10-30T10:06Z,"This is an enhanced CAM. Not a PPVrip. Perhaps you just took IFLIX's so called PPVrip and then enhanced so you got confused as to whether this is a CAM or a PPVrip. This is a CAM. PPVrips have quality almost as high as a DVDrip but with a weird aspect ratio due to recording a pay per view movie on a DVR inside of a hotel. IFLIX used to have proper PPVrips but have been uploading fakes for months now. I also couldn't help but notice that wrwrr has no torrents and thus has lost credibility in his comment. It is the seeders that keep this site running, just because you didn't upload a torrent doesn't mean you don't seed. And it is negative feedback that actually improves something and makes the final product high quality. Please correct future labels of torrents."
,Toadem,2011-11-01T16:36Z,"Thanks for the effort Hackulus.

@wrwrr your english is fine its your arithmatic that sucks lol"
,Toadem,2011-11-03T01:35Z,"@81tarr

awwww you posted it twice for me, thats so kind. I'm not quite getting it though maybe a third posting in another format would help me :P"
,ferrabra,2011-11-05T01:13Z,"Maybe specifying resolution would clear some doubts. Sample is also ok, as you've said."
,346gun,2011-11-08T04:24Z,i think the high quality rips are called vodrips and lesser quality are called ppvrips.
,beedub66,2011-11-09T00:57Z,"Got the first part of you name right 'HACK'. Don't advertise it as a ppv when it isn't. It just wastes people's time. So what it's free, so is dog shit."
,ronin6,2011-11-09T03:59Z,"it upsets me greately when people complain about other's hardwork.  we all have CHOICE in what we download.  there is a delete button on keyboard, use it move on AND STOP BITCHING AND WHINING ABOUT WHAT YOU COULDN'T DO WHEN HACKULUS DID - DUMB MORONS!  IGNORE THEM AND THANKS FOR THE UPLOAD!"
,Jofersine,2011-11-11T01:12Z,"Yo momma!
Just Sayin'."
,red_eleni,2011-11-15T12:20Z,Thanks
,Dutchy1982,2011-11-16T04:32Z,Could someone please rate this torrent!!!!!
,Dutchy1982,2011-11-16T04:34Z,Don't worry I guess I did not read properly!!!!
,Lola.Lane,2012-01-04T01:48Z,Ok picture.  Not the best but seriously can't complain.  Thanks Hackulus.
