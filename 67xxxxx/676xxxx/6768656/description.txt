Date: 97-06-11
Venue: Prins van Oranjehal

Recording: AUD
Quality: 8(-)
Menu: NO
Extras: None
Comments: Single cam on the balcony stage right. Camera work is OK, a little out of focus at times and closeups are a little shaky. 
The blurriness of the footage looks like a 3rd gen VHS transfer. 
(The actual video is a little clearer than the screenshots may suggest though.) Audio is good. 
This is the show of the so-called "fence incident" where the band stops the show for as long as it takes the crowd to step back a bit.
