,katlee26,2011-10-28T17:53Z,"Hi, nothing against uploader, I registered just to write this and normally never have any probs with the regular uploaders - I have received a notification from my ISP - they got notification from Lionsgate Films stating for me to stop illegal downloading and they knew it was this version as they had all the details in the email I received...I have never received a notification before Im in Aus and rarely heard of here...just thought I should warn as they (Lionsgate) are obviously on the hunt to stop sharing - even thought my ISP had stopped me accessing TPB as couldn't log on msg said my server was blocking the connection... but now working we'll see for how long. I guess take it or leave it. To crazy-torrent I have downloaded plenty of yours and other regulars and never any probs before so nothing against you..I guess as time goes on the studios will do more and more to try to stop sharing.
As for being a cam A:7 and V: 7"
,Dude1217,2011-11-03T22:32Z,@katlee26 i hate when people spread this dumbshit. shut up. i have been downloading from this site for 10 years and never had a problem. quit spreading fake shit like some of these other morons. if you actually had lost internet acces then do us all a favor and stay away from this site. i downloaded this movie with no problems. you probably work for the movie company and are trying to scare people away from downloading. if that is true then you can go screw yourself
