                          The Sarah Jane Adventures
                           +++ HDTV (XviD/MP3) +++
                            The Complete Season 5


Sarah Jane and the gang gather one last time to save the world from evil Aliens or help friendly ones to go home again.

Filming for three of six two-part serials planned for the fifth series was completed prior to Elisabeth Sladen's death on 19 April 2011.

On 4 May 2011 the BBC announced that the fifth series will be the final one for the programme, and that the remaining six episodes will air 'as a tribute to Elisabeth'.

Elisabeth Sladen created one of Doctor Whoâ€™s best loved and most enduring characters, Sarah Jane Smith. For over 35 years she brought the feisty, com-passionate journalist to life, creating a figure that was adored by audiences of all ages â€“ truly a heroine whose appeal had no boundaries.

Included in this torrent is a 15 minute programme â€“ 'My Sarah Jane' - that is both a tribute and a celebration of Elisabeth Sladen. It aired on CBBC and brings together stories from friends and colleagues and draws on a rich archive of material to remind us of Sarah Janeâ€™s journey, from companion to the Third Doctor to the central character in CBBCâ€™s award-winning The Sarah Jane Adventures.
