,str1ka1,2011-10-24T19:03Z,Decent copy. Dark but watchable. The problem is this is NOT the movie advertised in trailers. There isn't ONE scene from the trailers in the movie not ONE.

,SireJeff,2011-10-26T09:49Z,"What is a ""TS""?"
,Phat-Tony,2011-10-26T11:12Z,TS means telesynced it means the audio was recorded from the cinemas wireless speaker system or sound jack for the hearing impaired or even sometimes from the projection booth via the original source and added afterwards to the camera recorded video file so you dont hear laughing etc

Just think about the other movies and how it is based on intense moments with things jumping on your screen to scare you. You need the surround theater audio to really see this movie. imo

They say they have jobs but none of them ever seem to go to them. So they either have really lenient bosses or are full of shit. I mean this is California, houses are fucking expensive here especially the ones these people are in. If i may i think they robbed some blue beard and chopped him into 80lbs of uncooked hamburger so they could be set up for the rest of their lives and now his ghost is haunting them, hence why they never call the fuzz or even ghost busters.

I some-what liked the movie, i just think the 1st one is way better (or last one in story line if you see it like that...)

I lol'd when the ghost pulls the kid's hair hehehe.

Why the dad/husband/boyfriend always end up dying? pff.. and why they all recorded all that when it started happening? waaay too fake :) anyway its a good sunday night movie, must watch all 3 movies in a row, hehe. Atleast thats what I did and was cool xD"

Dude what does it matter! You seem so excentric over someone posting their thoughts about a movie on a site that's free. It amazes me that you would lose so much energy over this. You can choose to ignore it and skip over the comments you really want to read. I cant understand what horrible pain is causing you by people posting thoughts and opinions here. I honestly feel that if this angers you this much you should strongly consider not using the internet to avoid feeling so hostile.

Happy new year giggidyp, i hope things get better for you."

I'm not angry or""pained"". I,(like you) just feel the need to blurt out random feelings to strangers to feel superior.
what ""amazes"" me is how you could spend sooo much time analyzing and thinking about these films directed solely to make quick cash and nothing else. Did you nit-pick the other horror/shock films? IE;halloweens/nightmare on elmstreets/friday the 13ths? I doubt it! so why now!

I can call you an asshole and you can do the same thing in relative safety. Freedom of speech is great isn't it? Honestly i don't want to make anyone here so upset that they go postal, i just love to debate and i do it constantly with people i know personally. The problem with reading text is that you can not always accurately understand the tone intended in it.  Making it difficult to understand the persons mood. Everyone on earth has an opinion about something and this is the one place they can voice it safely, but of course with opinions comes critics. They are one in the same like peanut butter and jelly. I really meant no true insult to you or anyone else, but every action inevitably has a reaction, so feel free to react to this."

I'm not sure about how others rate their quality of videos but if we are comparing this to say like and old bozx or daemon release of this size this is absolutely terrible. Terrible, terrible, terrible release. Now, If you read it looks like they spent a lot of time ensuring the quality but then that leads me to believe that they are quite satisfies with sub par quality.
I'm not one to make ""any"" comments really but when i seen the rating some gave it and how much the ULr talked about his/her work...I wanted to DL this. It literally made me Dl this just from the title talk
Thing is. Is its blurry. Not movie blurry either...its digitized real poorly. It's got muffled sound quality. Not like from a handy cam either. It's just bad convert audio.
P.A makes a point of keeping people interested with excellent, excellent audio and video. They openly admit that as their trademark.
So these folks FUCKED IT UP REAL BAD!
