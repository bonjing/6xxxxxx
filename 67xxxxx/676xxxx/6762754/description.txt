Bing Crosby - 100 Hits Legends (Expanded 4GB collection) 320k (musicfromrizzo)

Here is the Bing Crosby 100 Hits Collection with added tracks as indicated so 
as to provide a complete library of his recordings to the extent of fully 4GB
worth of 320k mp3s!

Many remastered tracks were substituted for what was in the initial
collection, and among the additions to the folder.

Bing Crosby was the voice of the Irish spirit for many in America - few
others can claimed to have done as much although the Clintons 
(Former President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary) have come as 
close in my view and even been more effective at times at radiating
a kindlier Irish spirit than would otherwise have been appreciated on
the world stage - from stateside.

His last LP (Seasons, The Closing Chapter - 1977) has apparently only just
made it onto CD however no one has a copy for sale it would appear - we did
manage a download on the net from an old LP which gave better sound than
the previous folder we had)so we include that instead. Such decisions in the
preservation and persistent promotion of the Irish culture should never be
left to a different spirit as a bureaucrat will never do as well if that
is the stuff they are made of in showing any competence whatever in aiding
the Irish spirit legitimately and in full conscientious sense of idealistic
duty as that comes only from within if it is there to be had.

That LP included his beautiful and insightful rendition of "Yesterday when
I was young" - one of the best songs he had to his credit in my own view - 
and to think they pulled it off the shelves for decades means someone just is
inane and perhaps brain dead in the shepherding of collective wisdom down there
I'm afraid to have to say!

Enjoy this music forever and help keep the spirit alive with whatever seed 
no matter how small you can keep turned on for us on this torrent! God bless!
