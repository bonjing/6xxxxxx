As you say.

I think if they would have done a fake, they would have done a job so good that it would be no misstakes that easy to find."

Unfortunately, the moon is convex so would there not have been divergence of light even from a single source?"

""They"" allways pay to somebody to do the dirty work. Maybe that somebody wanted everyone to know the real deal, but at the later stage. Or did somebody doubt the imaginery of moonlandin in the 70's, when the technology was'nt so developed, like it is nowadays?"
