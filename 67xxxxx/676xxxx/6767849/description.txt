David Attenborough - Madagascar - TVrip - Xvid




Lying just off the coast of Africa, Madagascar is a land of misty mountains, tropical rainforests and spiny desert scrub â€“ and home to strange wildlife, most of which is found nowhere else on earth.

Madagascar explores this extraordinary wildlife and the dramatic landscapes of one of the world's most bizarre islands.

Using the latest in filming technology, the BBC's Natural History Unit captures the diverse and rare wildlife that inhabits this incredible land, some filmed for the first time, and features surprising stories of the favourite and enduring symbol of the island, lemurs, as well as less familiar creatures.

There are frogs that turn from brown to bright yellow; wasps that pluck tadpoles from tree-nests; fish that swim upside down and the romantic life of the world's tiniest chameleon.

Narrated by David Attenborough, Madagascar is the BBC's ambitious and intimate portrait of a fascinating but perilously fragile island.
