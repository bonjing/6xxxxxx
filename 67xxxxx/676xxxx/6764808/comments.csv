Please akaruna, can you seed a little while longer?

This software is very wanted, so you did a good deed to upload it, and a thank you deeply for that, but please seed it."
,akaruna,2011-10-23T23:15Z,"sorry about that, i cant seed while im at work. internet connection there sucks big hairy donkey balls. seeding all night while im at home though. then to top that off my netbook kicks the bucket with this crappy wifi card so i gotta reboot everytime it does. hope you enjoy this very bloody expensive piece of work lol :)"
