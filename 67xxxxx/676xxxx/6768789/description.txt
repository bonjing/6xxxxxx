 Ever wanted to chill out on a warm sandy beach, with lush palm trees
 calming blue waves and a horde of brain hungry zombies? Here's your
 chance - Zombie Driver: Summer of Slaughter contains the new Paradise
 Island Slaughter map

 Fight your way through the streets of a zombie infested city to save the
 survivors of a disastrous chemical accident that changed most of the
 city's population into mindless brain hungry monsters. Time is the enemy
 and your car is a weapon as you race through the streets smashing
 everything on your way including fences, phone booths, street lamps and
 hordes of zombies. If you get tired of rescuing people, take part in the
 Blood Race tournament. Chase other cars and take them down without mercy
 on special racing tracks populated with the zombie horde. Earn loads of
 cash while you progress through the events, unlock new rides and purchase
 weapons of mass destruction to become the ultimate Blood Race leaderboard
 champion. If the car chases and speed runs are not your thing, jump into
 the Slaugher mode where your objective is to survive as long as possible
 while ramping up enormous kill combos and annihilating endless waves of
 zombies on specialy crafted arenas
