GOMTV presents GSL October.

The new and improved GSL meets its third season.

This season might see the fiercest competition we have seen to date.

Only the best two players will make it through and earn the right to compete for the coveted Code S championship title at the grand finals live at Blizzcon 2011 in Anaheim. Who will it be?

GSL October will run from September 19th until October 22nd.
