,aiigghht,2011-10-24T11:28Z,"where is the real episode guys?

ep6 aired last night why are we getting a repeat here?"
,aiigghht,2011-10-24T11:36Z,"episode 6 never aired, they fucked up"
,mb_webguy,2011-10-24T14:19Z,"Just viewed it, and I can also confirm that this is s02e05, ""BrotherFae Of The Wolves"".  s02e06 doesn't air until Oct 30."
,lugosi13,2011-10-24T14:47Z,Damn.  ThatÂ´s last weekÂ´s ep. 
,oldlen70,2011-10-24T18:13Z,Wiki says ep 6 is on the 30th..they rescheduled..
,thebeav111,2011-10-24T19:12Z,wow didnt expect this from eztv
,greylion,2011-10-24T21:11Z,"Check out the comments on eztv.it - the channel aired a rerun of the previous ep, and the rip equipment is probably set up to record, convert and torrent it automatically, so it's an honest mistake.
The (heh) ""Real"" episode probably won't be out until about a week after this was added, which is just around where daylight savings time starts, so maybe 1 hour before."
,wiggle47,2011-10-25T00:28Z,"greylion, I agree eztv is far to trustworty and relilable to post a rerun. must be an honest mistake. well we will wait another week or what."
,forgetit,2011-10-31T11:44Z,Really really fake. Why isn't this removed?
,jj_13,2012-03-15T13:31Z,This torrent should be removed already. This is not episode 6. It's episode 5.
