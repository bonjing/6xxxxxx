thanx for the good work :)"
,Theeditor,2011-10-24T19:43Z,Application load error wtf
,Jiraiyarocks7,2011-10-24T22:18Z,Is this supposed to work with Skidrows release?  The game wont even open up for me anymore
,NanoEntity,2011-10-25T00:38Z,"THETA Patchs do not work with SKIDROW.
Please download THETA if you want to update."
,artremedy,2011-10-25T00:55Z,"what's the update files to play online? i got online yesterday, now it doesn't work, thanks"
,NanoEntity,2011-10-25T12:21Z,"It works online fine with tunngle LAN.

About black screen, you can only join games that are 7.04.

So look for HOST that has a GAME NAME: 7.04....

If you HOST, always include PATCH NUMBER into your GAME NAME, when you host.

That way people can join right game for there version."
,iconcoil,2011-10-26T04:32Z,Does anyone know if there's any problem with just using this update on a clean install (of theta's version) without  applying 7.01r5 then 7.02 then 7.03 first?
,rand0n11,2011-10-26T18:38Z,"@iconcoil
A friend of mine did that, and he could not manage to get the multiplayer working, but I'm not sure if that's because he did not install all the patches."
,btan219,2011-10-26T19:10Z,ive downloaded the theta version and i started the game just to see if it was working. everything was fine. but i want to know how i install these updates? like which folder am i supposed to install these updates into? thank you
,Walsheh,2011-10-26T22:52Z,Do I have to download all the updates? or can I just download this one??
,NanoEntity,2011-10-27T00:32Z,"If you want to play LAN, you need all updates in order for some stupid reason.

Else you get DunDefArchetype ERROR, not sure if they fixed that in 7.04 but that was the case in all the patchs.

The order is
Dungeon Defenders DLCs dc111019.exe, v7.01r5, v7.02, v7.03, v7.04.

About updates, they go into ""Dungeon Defenders"" folder."
,NanoEntity,2011-10-27T00:37Z,"If you want to play over LAN with lots of people, use ""tunngle"".

Just type that into google."
,btan219,2011-10-27T02:09Z,"under the win32 file, do you start the game with dundefgame or dungeondefenders? or it doesnt matter?"
,axaw313,2011-10-27T22:00Z,Will someone please tell me how to insert this crack and in which folder plzz?
,axaw313,2011-10-27T22:10Z,"When i try to start it up it says ""dundefgame.exe have stopped working"" i dont know why but plzz help me :("
,btan219,2011-10-27T23:45Z,"ty for the answers, but i have another question.

i made a folder on my desktop called dungeon defenders and i saved my game in that file. do i save the updates in the desktop folder? or within 1 of the 3 folders in there, binaries, engine, udkgame. ive tried saving it in different places but whenever i start my game it still says v7.0, how can i tell if it updates successfully?"
,btan219,2011-10-27T23:54Z,"ty for the answers but i still have one more question.

i made a folder in my desktop called dungeondefenders and i installed my game there. when i run the updates do i save it in that folder, or one of the 3 folders in there? (binaries, engine, udkgame), or even within on one of the folders in those 3? thank you"
,NanoEntity,2011-10-30T11:56Z,ANY NEWS on 7.05C?
,Wolfbanes,2011-10-30T14:40Z,"@NanoEntity

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but the patch only works on the Trendy servers, where you have to use steam to have them active.  It'll change later this week to where you can use it locally."
,Silver4k,2011-11-01T07:37Z,"Any word on if we'll get the 7.05 update any time soon? It has some balancing and gameplay tweaks (determining actual best value of items based on maximum stats, increasing the storage box by 60 items) that would be useful. Especially since they've now come out with 7.06 already."
,em0r0ckem009,2011-11-02T03:32Z,Is there by chance you'll be able to put this game in steam??? just wondering cause I desperately wan't to play this game online.
,Silver4k,2011-11-02T05:13Z,"@em0r0ckem009
Um. If you want to play the game on steam, you'll have to buy it. it's 15 dollars. At this point, if I hadn't been missing so much work due to severe illness, I'd have already purchased this gem. I may yet, depending on how things go with the hospital in a few days."
,golhol2,2011-11-04T10:52Z,"i get ""required package onlinesubsystemsteamworks""  can't join games... what to do?!"
,WalkingPC,2011-11-06T19:11Z,"You want to know how to play the damn game? Change to Gamespy (it's in the settings somewhere), sign up at Gamespy (google it). Done. You can't play ranked though, but open is fine."
,Bloodvenom14,2011-11-07T06:31Z,Anyone having no sound issues?
,Conbar,2011-11-07T21:53Z,Anyone else having problems with the DLC? I only got the little green dragon and none of the other DLC with THETA's release. With Skidrow I had all the Valve related DLC but not the little dragon.
,tpb_joe,2011-11-08T11:02Z,"i have 3 heroes and i played them all till i reached level 25, but when i checked it again, my heroes level reverts back to 22! anyone here having the same issue?"
,Warriorleave143,2011-11-09T21:10Z,"Is it possible to install halloween dlc? If so, how? "
,tpb_joe,2011-11-14T04:57Z,"@oorenotsoo

[T],alexisthebest,2011-12-07T14:09Z,"@oorenotsoo

I was out of the loop for quite some time now. I'm gonna try and update as many THETA stuff as i can, but i'm now limited on how much i upload so we'll see how that goes."
