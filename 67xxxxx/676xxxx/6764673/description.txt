Psst! Want to know a secret? Do you dare open me up? Because inside you'll find the incredible TRUTH about mind-boggling confidential stuff 'they' don't want you to know! And wanna know something else? Find out where the Bermuda Triangle is, whether alien abductions actually happen, and the truth about crop circles. Explore lost worlds, unravel secret codes, marvel at mysterious places and meet spooks, spies, secret keepers and scandal makers of the world. When you've finished riddle solving, close me up in my funky cage so no one else can get at my secrets! But ssh! Don't tell a soul.
