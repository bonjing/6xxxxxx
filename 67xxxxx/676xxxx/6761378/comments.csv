You have created a Media type DVD for retail valued  $29.99 or has Apple?

I can't locate this DVD anywhere on the Apple site. $29 is a bargin.

But from what I can tell on apple site it is New Version 10.7.2... but only downloadable from the Apps store and no dvd avaiable.  "

all,right ?
Then you will get a sort of DVD retail so ;)"
,ClassZero,2011-10-22T01:24Z,fake. it is a pre-release not the real 10.7.2 install!
