Altium Designer - Complex system of designing high-speed electronic devices based on printed circuit boards, which 

allows developers to create projects, from concept and VHDL-description of the FPGA, to carry out simulation derived 

schemes and VHDL-code, prepare files for production, and the concept of Live Design, the so-called living design, 

allows it to complete the project on-board debugging NanoBoard.


System requirements:
* Windows XP SP2 Professional or later
* Intel Pentium IV (4) 1,8 GHz or higher
* 1 GB of RAM
* 3,5 GB hard disk space (Installation + User Files)
* Monitor resolution of 1280x1024 is highly recommended:
- The SECOND monitor with minimum screen resolution of 1024x768
- (YES it is software made for two monitors!)
* NVIDIA GeForce 6000/7000 series, 128 MB or above
* Parallel port (for connecting to the NanoBoard-NB1)
* USB2.0 port (for connecting to the NanoBoard-NB2)
* Adobe Reader 8 or higher
* DVD-drive

Installation:

This is a russian release (the software is ENGLISH), so the /Patch... directory software is in russian language.
I've dissected that piece of software and found nothing peculiar in the code.... (and no, I haven't had the time to 

translate the russian strings to english strings... get PE explorer and do it yourself).

## This release contains NO vendor directories. This is a standalone clean install.
## At least have 10.589.22577 installed.

Mount image in UltraIso or DaemonTools, installed via AltiumInstaller.exe, replace dxp.exe, edit AD10.700.ini
to the instructions in russian (or see previous release CRACK_EN.txt, run the (russian software) from left to rigt. 

The three buttons is "Read AD10.INI", "Create ALF license file" and "Exit"...

Whereas previously there were previous versions use AltiumUninstaller.exe, just might have to hand delete the file 

C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Local\Altium\AltiumInstaller.ini - in Win7.

In WinXP you must remove the same file AltiumInstaller.ini, location of a similar, but for XP - a descent can not 

remember, use the search file. If AltiumInstaller.ini can't be found or removed, then reinstall to begin with the 

former place.

And a extra thanks to mandresc for figuring out the C to hardware (CHC) and Unified Compiler. His help is fantastic.
