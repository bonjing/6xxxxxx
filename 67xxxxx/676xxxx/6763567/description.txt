Jason Adasiewicz is making the vibraphone a necessary ingredient for music
making in this century. His mallets have been featured in recordings by Josh
Berman, Jason Ajemian, Harris Eisenstadt, the Lucky 7s, and Rob Mazurek's
Exploding Star Orchestra.

As a leader, his two recordings with Rolldown, the self-titled 2008 disc on 482
Music and Varmint (Cuneiform, 2009) feature Josh Berman, Aram Shelton, Jason
Roebke, and Frank Rosaly playing his original compositions. Here, he pares
things down to a simple trio with bassist Nate McBride (Joe Morris, Ken
Vandermark) and Mike Reed, with whom Adasiewicz collaborates in the drummer's
People, Places & Things.

With Sun Rooms, he delivers his version of a piano trio, with five original
pieces and three "sort of" standards. Perhaps it is easiest to begin with those
pieces, as a gauge of the trio's playing. They play Duke Ellington's "Warm
Valley" straight, with McBride leading the melody before playing an overtly
simple statement, like humming a favorite tune. Sun Ra's "Overtones Of China,"
is performed with amped-up forcefulness, McBride and Reed supplying the
compulsion, as Adasiewicz applies ringing, simple notes. Like Thelonious Monk or
Miles Davis, Reed can say more with economy of sound then a noisy solo. "Off My
Back" by Hasdaan Ibn Aliâ€”a favorite of Max Roach in the 1960sâ€”comes closest to
Adasiewicz's style. The piece, which opens with the trio producing what might be
mistaken for a bit of electronics hum, features a sly mercurial swing that is
simultaneously unadorned and knotty.

The remaining five tracks, all originals, are invigorated by the players. "Life"
almost prances on the melody before the momentum is slowed with McBride's
solo. The vibraphone, like the bass clarinet, can be pushed to extremes, yet
never sounds bellicose or threatening. This trio can swing hard, yet the music
remains a warming wash of tones and resonances. Adasiewicz' "Stake" is played
fast and hard, with Reed's snare drum and ride cymbal chasing the fleet
mallets. Next comes the balladic "Rose Garden," with its cascading
notesâ€”something that might have been written with the great Bobby Hutcherson in
mind.

This disc should be kept in mind when 2010's 'best of' lists are written.
