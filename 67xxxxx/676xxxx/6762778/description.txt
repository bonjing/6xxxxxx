Cuff The Duke  released their fifth album Morning Comes on October 4th. The ten-track album was produced by Blue Rodeoâ€™s Greg Keelor and is the first part of a two part album. Morning Comes includes single â€˜Count On Meâ€™  and an eight minute epic called â€˜Bound To Your Own Vicesâ€™. Cuff The Duke are also excited to announce a tour of Western Canada. The alt-country road-warriors will hit the road on October 20th in Thunder Bay (full list of dates below). More Canadian dates will be announced soon.

â€œThese albums are about dealing with loss of someone and the change that brings to oneâ€™s life,â€ says the bandâ€™s Wayne Petti. â€œThe confusion and loneliness that occurs at that point in someoneâ€™s life. Coming to grips with the reality of those things. By the end of this record we start to make peace with this and come to terms with it. All these songs are about that. They deal with a similar theme and emotion but still wondering in the back of our minds whether there will be a point to all of it. Thatâ€™s what the second record will be about. Embracing what has happened and navigating down new roads. This album is the low and the next album will be the high.â€
