Ian Robins Dury (12 May 1942 â€“ 27 March 2000) was an English rock and roll singer, lyricist, bandleader and actor who initially rose to fame during the late 1970s, during the punk and New Wave era of rock music. He is best known as founder and lead singer of the British band Ian Dury and the Blockheads, who were one of the groups of the New Wave era in the UK.

Brand New Boots And Panties

Following Ian Dury's death, the album was remade by as a tribute album under the title Brand New Boots And Panties. Except for "Billericay Dickie" and "My Old Man", The Blockheads played on all the tracks, with vocals provided by various others:

SinÃ©ad O'Connor - "Wake Up and Make Love With Me"
Robbie Williams - "Sweet Gene Vincent"
Paul McCartney - "I'm Partial To Your Abracadabra"
Madness - "My Old Man"
Billy Bragg & The Blokes - "Billericay Dickie"
Wreckless Eric - "Clevor Trever"
Cerys Matthews - "If I Was With A Woman"
Grant Nicholas - "Blockheads"
Shane MacGowan - "Plaistow Patricia"
Keith Allen - "Blackmail Man"

Billy Bragg & The Blokes chose to give "Billericay Dickie" a more Indian feel, a style they were using on Bragg's album England, Half English, the song has subsequently been re-released on the 2006 re-issue of that album, likewise Madness' "My Old Man" was much more in their style than the Blockheads. SinÃ©ad O'Connor chose to change the words of "Wake Up and Make Love With Me" so the sex of the song's narrator was a woman, Cerys Matthews did not choose to do the same with "If I Was With A Woman". Wreckless Eric, for whom "Clevor Trever" was originally written, meanders and mumbles during the latter half of "Clevor Trever", extending the song to nearly double its original length. The album's cover art is a painting of Ian Dury by Pop Artist Peter Blake, an old teacher and long time friend of Dury's.
