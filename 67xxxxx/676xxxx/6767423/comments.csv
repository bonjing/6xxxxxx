,bloodydemons,2011-10-24T17:42Z,can someone tell me if this copy of the ppv has the opening? i downloaded 2 versions of the ppv last night and both started out showing to crowd and didn't have the opening
,summon4gods,2011-10-24T23:33Z,s4a is damn amazing. im more than confident he/she uploaded the show in it's entirety. I don't even bother procuring ppvs from anyone else anymore.
