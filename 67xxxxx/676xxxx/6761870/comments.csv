,grandfred29,2011-10-22T05:47Z,"Hi mickyfinny,

many thanks for this upload."
,EmesiS,2011-10-22T06:50Z,"Hey cool this is one of the airports in this year's World Flight 2011. Thanks for the share.

@jjmtzp1 Here's an idea, why don't you buy the A36 and share it with everyone. That way you don't look like such a little leech bitch requesting shit all the time."
,aarque,2011-10-22T07:24Z,"jimtzp is obviously a child that assumes mickey buys everything he shares and denies us the generosity of his wallet. The possibility that mickey actually sources and offers anything he finds doesn't even occur to the juvenile. Mickey, tell us, place2use, is your ""tracker,"" huh.
?"
,aarque,2011-10-22T07:31Z,"Haha, I just checked your ""fix."" You don't have to answer the above question man, I already got my answer."
,rogue09,2011-10-22T11:08Z,Really appreciate this one. Any chance of the FS9 version if you have it?
,rra137,2011-10-22T13:44Z,"Thank you mickyfinny, I was waiting for this one.

,aarque,2011-10-22T14:04Z,"Everyone who hates the troll should check this link.
Since it spammed mickeys torrent - ty for that faux pas btw - it has violated a cardinal rule and is eligible to be removed. (They also might remove the troll simply because they are tired of all of us requesting that they get rid of it):

I prefer to find ALL the fsx add-ons on TPB.
It is tiring to browse the Internet for hours.
If you find interesting payware on other download sites it would be nice to post them on TPB."
,Iceland757,2011-10-22T17:16Z,I love this airport.I live very close to the Keflavik airport :)
