WTF is this?"
,michaelrwatson,2011-10-22T20:45Z,"BTW, 1.61 GB is WAY to fuckin big."

m: you be the judge"
,Phatfish,2011-10-23T14:38Z,"A/C - Good. Even audio is good. Not the crap cam audio that some of R5s have. 

M - Descent, not bad. Not that I'm a expert but I have read and studied what happen and the movie is a bit misleading in my opinion. You get the feeling it was just a few rotten eggs, but In reality it was a large number of people  involved who's concern for the public was more or less non-existing. Everybody just grabbed as much as they possibly could b4 the ship sunk. "
,ashen77,2011-10-23T15:16Z,"That sounds suspiciously like capitalism Phatfish. *oy vey, I'm down to my last 500 million already! Lets make it and even billion so I can piss on the poor from my private 26 seater helicopter*

,TheUltimateGayMan,2011-10-23T20:20Z,"I'm only watching it for the cast. As far as ""White-collar"" criminals go, they should get NO leeway at all..... I say give them a year for every $100 stolen!"

,MrStillwell,2011-10-24T03:57Z,"This movie is nothing but lies. Don't believe that this happened due to some error. The people who made this happen were fully aware that it didn't ad up. The most scary thing? They are still at it as we speak, and we are not close to having seen the worst of it. Embrace for round two ..."
,bilper,2011-10-24T14:48Z,"GARBAGE. Screenwriters, producers and actors seem to be playing for sympathy for these thieves.

It should have ended with them going to jail. But then we don't put wealthy and influential people in jail in this country - do we?

The acting STINKS.

Final scene - Spaceyďťż buries his dog.
He should have jumped in with him clutching the screenplay."
,Phatfish,2011-10-24T19:56Z,"A / V - Good-

M - Ok. Not bad. However if you wanna know what really happen this is definitely NOT it. 

The real story was more close to the holocaust compare to this sugarcoated pink fairytale. "
,bilper,2011-10-24T20:28Z,Stillwell & PhatFish are right on the money!
