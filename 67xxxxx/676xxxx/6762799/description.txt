Jools welcomes back the mercurial Canadian singer-songwriter Feist, originally from 
Nova Scotia and now based in Toronto, with songs from her fourth solo album Metals. 
Wisconsin's Bon Iver returns with his ambitious and haunting self-titled second album.

Debuting in the 'oval of excellence' are metal band Mastodon, brutalising and 
astonishing with songs from their fifth studio album The Hunter.

There's also the good time old school soul of Frenchman Ben L'Oncle Soul and his band, 
offering their retro soul revue. Lounge lizard Buddy Greco, who was a key member of 
The Rat Pack in the 1960s, chats to Jools and plays the odd standard or two as he 
releases a live album from the 60s which was recorded at the Sands in Las Vegas. 
And 21-year-old singer-songwriter from London, Lianne La Havas, makes her TV debut 
armed with her electric guitar, sweet harmonies and an incredibly soulful voice.
