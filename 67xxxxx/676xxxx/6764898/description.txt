Hi, this is my first upload and I thought I'd upload this as I couldn't find it anywhere else. I searched around for about 2 hours to find these and it took about 4 hours to download because of the small amount of seeders. I will probably upload season 2 soonish as well.
I will seed for a week or so, but not 24/7 because I will turn my torrent client off if I am using Skype or something.
If you download this please seed back at least what you downloaded, it helps out a lot!
All these episodes are of high enough A/V to watch and enjoy, but please comment if there is something wrong.
I recommend you use VLC Player (http://www.videolan.org/vlc/) or GOM player (http://www.gomlab.com/eng/GMP_download.html) to watch. GOM player is my personal favorite because of the nicer interface, and keyboard controls (enter puts full screen on, space pauses/plays, arrows to skip, etc) are much better IMO.
Thanks, and enjoy!
