  Web Builder is an WYSIWYG (What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get) utility   
  that gives you the possibility to build web pages.                 
                                                                     
  WYSIWYG means that the finished page will display exactly the way  
  it was designed. The program generates HTML (HyperText Markup      
  Language) tags while you point and click on desired functions; you 
  can create a web page without learning HTML.                       
                                                                     
  Just drag and drop objects to the page position them 'anywhere'    
  you want and when you're finished publish it to your web server    
  (using the build in Publish tool).                                 
  Web Builder gives you full control over the content and layout of  
  your web page.
