A/good, V/good
Movie?  Normally, I will not be a movie critic because its all different for different people, and some of the best movies I've ever seen received bad reviews.  And, PA 1 and 2 weren't ""bad"", so I thought to give #3 a try.  It was one of those rare cases where my wife and I both looked at each other when it was over and said, ""how in the hell can we ever get back the 118 minutes we just wasted watching this?""
The previews make it look enticing, but this movie ranks awfully high on the suck list.
This is not meant to be any sort of reflection on you, BONE.  We always look forward to your high quality offerings and really appreciate you! "
