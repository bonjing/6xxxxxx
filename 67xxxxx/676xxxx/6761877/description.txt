Inventive violinist/whistler/indie pop singer/songwriter Andrew Bird's first foray into film music doesnâ€™t stray too far from the Chicago-based artistâ€™s solo output, as heâ€™s been dealing out heavily layered, pastoral slabs of cinematic atmosphere since he first arrived on the scene in the late 1990s. Scoring Norman, an independent coming-of-age teen drama directed by Jonathan Segal, could have been an exercise in soul crushing melancholy, and while there is enough of that here to fill a bucket or two with string-induced tears, Bird knows when to pick up the pieces, put your sack on your back, and whistle your way back home. With the exception of an amiable pair of new originals and a cut from 2009â€™s Noble Beast, Bird's contributions are primarily instrumental. Elsewhere, the Blow and Richard Swift offer up a ramshackle take on ABBA's â€œS.O.S.,â€ Chad VanGaalen provides the stoic â€œRabid Bits of Timeâ€ from 2008â€™s Soft Airplane, and Wolf Parade downplays the histrionics of 2005â€™s â€œYou Are a Runner and I am My Fatherâ€™s Sonâ€ with a â€œreduxâ€ version thatâ€™s as spooky as it is subdued.
