Behold one of the greatest albums of all time.

Abbey Road is the eleventh studio album released by the English rock band The Beatles and their last recorded. Though Let It Be was the last album released before the band's dissolution in 1970, work on Abbey Road began in April 1969. Abbey Road was released on 26 September 1969 in the United Kingdom, and 1 October 1969 in the United States.
Abbey Road is widely regarded as one of The Beatles' most tightly constructed albums, although the band was barely operating as a functioning unit at the time. Rolling Stone placed it at number 14 on its list of "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time". In 2009, readers of the magazine also named Abbey Road the greatest Beatles album.

This album is the real deal. It's the highest quality possible, all the songs are named and tagged for your iTunes needs, and has the original album cover and lyrics, hand-done by me.

Sidenote: Sadly, for PC users, this album is in Apple Lossless, the Mac version of FLAC. Although this makes Mac users insanely happy (like me), I hope you don't throw stones at me for not making this for PC. 

Sidenote #2: This is my first upload to the site, but I have many more albums just waiting to be uploaded! If you would like more albums, just tell me ;)
