The Diary of Samuel Pepys

From BBC Radio 4. Written by Hattie Naylor; Fact-based full-cast dramatisation.

On a freezing day in January 1660, a 26 year old man decides to start keeping a diary. It's two years since he had a life-threatening operation to remove a bladder stone and he's feeling pretty well - despite there being quite a lot to worry about. He's behind with his rent, he goes out too often, and drinks too much. He lies awake worrying about work, and despite being happily married, can't keep his hands off other women. For the next ten years, in his secret diary, Samuel Pepys faithfully records the day's events, and confesses his innermost thoughts. He gives us eyewitness accounts of some of the great events of the 17th century but he also tells us what people ate, wore, what they did for fun, the tricks they played on each other, what they expected of marriage, and of love affairs.
