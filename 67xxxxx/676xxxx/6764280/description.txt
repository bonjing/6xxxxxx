  2/4. Singer-songwriters Leon Russell, Nick Lowe and Paul Brady        
  perform and discuss the finer points of their craft at London's       
  Porchester Hall. Oklahoma-born Russell, who was inducted into the     
  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011, sings some of the hits he wrote   
  for other performers, including Song for You and This Masquerade,     
  and veteran pop craftsman Lowe performs a selection of his            
  best-known songs, including (What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love and   
  Understanding. Irish folk-pop star Brady also demonstrates his        
  talents with versions of his songs The World Is What You Make It and  
  Smile.
