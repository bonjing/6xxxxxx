Look, we support your enthusiasm, ""hey, FSX, add-ons, internet and yet another free hosting site. woo hoo""
This place, ThePirateBay, is for sharing software that is otherwise difficult or impossible to find without BUYING it. All you are doing is clogging the torrent trackers with yet another freeware compilation, stuff people are already able to find if they want to look for it, so what does that make you, ""Google?"" Google with the special gamerhariz8 filter: ""this is what I've selected for your enjoyment."" You don't even give credit to the original authors who gave us this software, Thomas Ruth and Opensky Project. It would be better to post this as links in the comments and save everyone the gigabyte download. 

On the other hand, it appears you have yet to learn how to seed your own torrents so the entire point is moot -- except for the clogging the trackers part."
