Lately your releasing stuff almost a week late, and your not seeding the stuff you release.

Like this for instance, released yesterday, yet i'm at 99.6%, but NO FUCKING SEEDERS.

How the hell am I supposed to seed anything if I can't even finish downloading torrents you put out the day before?

Yes, this is free, and i shouldn't complain, but your fucking up on what your doing.  If your not going to do it right, then stop, so we can not waste our time downloading and seeding (if we can even get that far) your stuff.

I'm a loyal person, I like what you have been doing, up till the last couple weeks, where you been sluffing like a motherfucker.

Please get back in gear, thanks."
