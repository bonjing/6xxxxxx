Subtitles: None?
More like embedded subs. Can't be disabled. Don't bother downloading this if you don't want annoying as hell subs throughout the entire movie."

Stupid people like you are reason enough why there should be a requirement to have a license to procreate. At least, that is one way to keep idiots like you from putting mini-idiots onto the planet we all have to put up with."
