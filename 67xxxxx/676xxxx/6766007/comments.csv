Recently a friend recommend me about your uploads and you live upto my expectations.
I am doctor and some of your health related uploads are very valuable to me.
When ever i try to download, most of ur torrents failed to start , this has never happened before :(
Am i doing something wrong or most of your torrents are dead (including new uploads) ?
Pz do reply if you have time. Waiting eagerly ..."
