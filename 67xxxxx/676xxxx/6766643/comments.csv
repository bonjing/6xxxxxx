,Local-Man,2011-10-24T05:21Z,"Thankx.
But I have a need for seed."
,aParadox,2011-10-24T05:46Z,"You do know torrents are NOT like http downloading, right? Not many people have the full file, and hundreds of fans jumped on this show within minutes.
Wait an hour and watch your speed skyrocket, kiddies.

Thanks for the high-res upload, Sceneline!"
,zardex,2011-10-24T07:35Z,No reason to download this one... eztv will soon upload a HDTV version that hasn't been packed in to rars and is trusted and graced by more seeds.

,throwing_wheel,2011-10-24T14:56Z,"And not just to the dl's, to the ul, too: It's better to ul a single playable file, at least in this case.  A single file is easier to maintain on the dl's drives so that more people will end up seeding, and, the size advantage for the compressed versus the uncompressed mkv is negligible and not worth the extra effort on either end, neither for the ul nor the dl's."
