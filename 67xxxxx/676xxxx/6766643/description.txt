"A Horse of a Different Color"

Much to his own surprise, an emergency 
with Harrison and a new tableau from 
Gellar and Travis has Dexter leaning 
on Brother Sam and an unexpected 
winged messenger for support as he 
questions the idea of faith; with 
proof of a religiously motivated 
killer, Homicide hunts for a zealot, 
with Debra giving her first official 
press conference.

18/Slow
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
