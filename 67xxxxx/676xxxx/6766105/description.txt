The More than Complete DC-Now More Completerer!

This forty-fourth alphabetical installment is: DC from Superb-Swd  - Skipping titles beginning with Superman which are in torrent 45, next.

What's This?
     It's a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.
       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those "Pre-DC" comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some "Post DC" comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c.875-885gb in total. It will take as long as it takes. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.

=================================


Some changes have been made to the previously announced makeup the rest of the torrents - small changes are still possible. I plan on 11 more.  Approximate sizes listed based on what I have now. I still have duplicates and replacement scans to weed out and additions are possible. The big Batman one was popular so I'll do the same with Superman. The Superman torrent will be around 43-45gb, depending on how many replacement scans are in the folder now. I think it's a lot. I will not rush part 46, so as to give you all time to download.

Sizes given are the current size for the folder. Things may change.

The fill torrents continue to grow, as they will. It's possible there will be three. On the other hand there's a lot in there that may or may not be better scans than what I already shared. So there will be last minute shrinkage, which in this case, is far less embarrassing than another example I can think of.

Sizes given are the current size for the folder. Things may change.

45 Superman                45gb
46 Swe-Td                  14gb
47 Te-Tn                   15gb
48 To-Unk                  15gb
49 Unl-Waq                 16gb
50 War-Wn                  18gb
51 Wonder*                 14gb
52 World*                  13gb
53 Wo-Z (-Wonder, World)   17gb
54 Fill Torent A-D         20gb
55 Fill Torent E-Z         19gb


=================================

You know what's annoying but darn near inevitable? Shortly after every torrent I upload, new comics appear, or new scans of old comics, that should have been in it. Its as if the scanners were watching and waiting, just to drive me crazy. The hate me I know they hate me. Jealous of my rubber-chicken-like wit!

The latest, and I feel the most egregious, example is that the *day after* I uploaded the "STAR" torrent (#42) DC releases the first of a six part crossover with IDW! Time-Warner, owner of DC, is too lazy or disinterested to find out my ISP and send me a cease and desist. So they do this out of a petty desire for revenge. Yeah, I know these things are determined and announced far in advanced but they are clever and sneaky. They found a way. But the jokes on them - they ARE my ISP. So really they wouldn't have to look too far, (Unless I am making that up)

Oh and I also am well aware that if I read any comics news I'd be well aware of upcoming releases and could have waited a day or two for the new release to be scanned. But I am not dancing to DC's tune! They're not the boss of me. My wife is the boos of me!

So what is the IDW/DC crossover. What cool linkage of similar type comics have been "leveraged to create synergy" as they say in "corporation speak"?

It could have been "G.I. Joe" and "Sgt. Rock"!

It could have been "30 Days of Night" or "True Blood" with "Supernatural"! OR 30, True Blood AND Supernatural - Suggested title "30 Truly Bloody Supernatural Nights" "American Vampire" could make a cameo

It could have beeb "Transformers" and "The Metal Men"

It could have Been "Doctor Who" and "Doctor Thirteen"!

It could have been "Ghostbusters" and ""Hellblazer"!

But these guys are more imaginative then me. What they did was, wild, ridiculous, highly implausible, and absolutely the coolest crossover ever done.

The Legion of Super Heroes meets freaking James Tiberius Kirk and crew. Brainiac 5 and Spock, together in one story!
When and where do they meet? It's the 23rd century, on Earth - in what looks to be an even mores evil mirror universe than the Star Trek mirror universe we've seen before. I've only flipped through the first issue, but this evil Earth empire uses a symbol of two daggers through the earth, not just one. So they must be twice as bad. It stands to reason. I can only assume the Spock of this Universe has two beards, or at least a forked one. Uhura's uniform will be half as big as the mirror Uhura. Sulu will have two scars and Captain Kirk will have two "Captains Women" Twins, perhaps.

Even more twists Legion planets like Durlan, home of Chameleon Boy, exist in this alternate universe.

Well, on to the comics.
