,brizownthepi,2011-10-24T17:16Z,"No problem - sorry Vuze uploads so slowly, I've looked all over google trying to increase my upload speed but I'm stuck at right around 41kb/s... My connection is much much faster than that.  uTorrent locks my system, so I'm stuck with Vuze.

I would like to upload the ""Formerly the Warlocks"" box in both FLAC & MP3, but my FLAC Disc 6 is corrupt.  Can anybody help?  I won't upload an incomplete version of the FLAC files..."
