[V],HolyRoses,2011-10-25T04:19Z,"Just updated to Apple TV 4.4.2.  Looks like the old Dolby Digital bug they introduced around 4.2 has finally been resolved.  Old videos start fine now without goofy workarounds.

note regarding 4.4.2:

,thefan23,2011-10-25T06:25Z,I think I might get the apple tv for christmas but not thrilled about updating to itunes 10..
[V],HolyRoses,2011-10-25T16:14Z,didn't see any harm in updating to itunes 10.5.  apple tv is a great toy and isn't a lot of money.  its the best netflix experience I have seen.  It now supports dolby digital and subtitles from netflix.
,thefan23,2011-10-25T18:10Z,okay that doesn't sound bad. I do like the price for it. sounds like I should get it soon so i can view these high quality movies of yours on my tv.
[V],HolyRoses,2011-10-25T18:58Z,you wont be regretting your purchase.  I think I would be ok recommending it to anyone.  you could also check your local ads or whatever to see if someone is selling a used one for some reason.
,fedeval,2011-10-25T19:12Z,"thanks HR for the uploads, and for having you back. "
,afg1987,2011-10-25T23:40Z,"Hey, HR what's your 6 lucky Numbers I will play Lotter for you.. :) and thx for all the wonderful movie HR..."
,ftservd,2011-10-26T00:21Z,Just asking but any reason why no star wars uploads since the whole set has come out on BRAY now.  Best work done for us ATV users I have ever seen HR you Kick major Ass
[V],HolyRoses,2011-10-26T07:01Z,never tried it without internet access.  might work but would be sort of boring.  You connect to your home network via wifi or a lan cable.  It plays whatever is in your iTunes library.  or you can send it stuff to play from an ipod or ipad over wifi.  search for reviews or whatever utube.
