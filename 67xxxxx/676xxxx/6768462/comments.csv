Did you try to close Origin and then run the crack in your Battlefield 3 folder. If you PRELOAD the game with Limited Edition and ues the crack it should start it will take some time to load. Make sure you also have newest drivers if you have NVIDIA card:

That .Dude. gave us and had the issue with the menu screen not coming up. The problem for me, and for most of you probably is you applied the Registry Edit without downloading and installing the language file. THE LANGUAGE FILE IS NECESSARY!

Sorry mate we've got to do what we've got to do. If you've already DLed all the pieces from the pastebin link make sure you have executed the instruction in order. It really shouldn't take more than 10 mins. Also if you have copied the English language files into the battlefield 3/data/win32/loc folder, then all you have to do is do the registry edit. Make sure you execute the registry edit AFTER you place in the language files, even if you have already done it. It worked for me, and should fix the No menu problem. It doesn't however fix the broken key rebinding, as that is an issue on a different version than the one this is meant to fix. This is meant to fix the leaked Russian release. Cheers and GL."

Ah ok so to activate the english files you installed. Make a notepad file anywhere you want and put this text in it:

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Electronic Arts\Battlefield 3]
""Language""=""English""
""Locale""=""EN""

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Electronic Arts\Battlefield 3]
""Language""=""English""
""Locale""=""EN""

Then save it as ""bf3.reg"" This will turn the notepad file into an auto registry edit file. After you save and close bf3.reg go to where you saved it and merely double click it. A confirmation box will come up, just hit ok. Close everything, and launch the game. You should be g2g. Cheers!"

ppl like u never read comments!!stop living on weeds and let ur brain cells work and coordinate with ur eyes and find the solution..i knw u cant..cz ur doped!this question has been answered by several ppl over a number of times by now.

delete the freaking (tm) part from the folder name which goes as ""BATTLEFIELD 3 tm"" and name it as just battlefield 3. in case u dont even understand this..this is the name of the folder where u installed the game."

for the bug prob in operation guillotine try changing resolution and reduce it for a while..like..play from the last checkpoint using somewhat low resolution than tht ur actually playing in!might just do the trick!i had got stuck at a point where i had to breach a door and a freak would almost jump on me!

,mr.at,2011-11-09T21:19Z,"ALL THOSE WHOSE GAME IS CRASHING/NOT WORKING...

I found this out after a lot of bullshit. The only proper working crack is the 31.3 MB one. Remember: It's just the .exe file you have to replace. No bullshit patches/cracks/dlls.

Just replace with the right .exe file (31.3 MB), and rename the God damn folder from ""Battlefield 3™"" to only ""Battlefield"".

The game crashes only because of the ™ in the folder name. Some fucked up. Don't know why that is.

Worked for me!"
