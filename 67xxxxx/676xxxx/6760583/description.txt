Mark Nielsen and Shawn Miller, of the University of Utah, lead a team of media and anatomical experts in the creation of this powerful new DVD, Real Anatomy. Their extensive experience in undergraduate anatomy classrooms and cadaver laboratories as well as their passion for the subject matter shine through this new, user-friendly program with its intuitive interface. The 3-D imaging software allows students to dissect through 44 layers of a three-dimensional real human body to study and learn the anatomical structures of all body systems from multiple perspectives. Histology is viewed via a virtual microscope at varied levels of magnification. Professors can use the program to capture and customize images from a large database of stunning cadaver photographs and clear histology micrographs for presentations, quizzing, or testing.
