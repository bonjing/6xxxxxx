During the '70s, the notoriously decadent Dragon was among the biggest rock bands in New Zealand, gaining even greater success on the Australian circuit. Dragon's history begins with brothers Todd and Marc Hunter, natives of the North Island town of Taumarunui; from childhood on, the siblings performed professionally in their parents' jazz band, with Todd learning guitar and Marc picking up the drums. As the years passed, both Hunter brothers played in a variety of local bands, both together and independently; Dragon emerged in 1973 from the remnants of Staff, a group featuring Todd on bass, in addition to singer/pianist Graeme Collins, guitarist Ray Goodwin, and drummer Neil Reynolds. Personality conflicts quickly emerged, and soon the clean-living Collins was sacked by his hedonistic bandmates in favor of keyboardist Ivan Thompson. That left Dragon without a singer; however, the situation was quickly solved when Marc Hunter signed on as lead vocalist. After Reynolds was replaced by drummer Neil Storey, the classic Dragon lineup was in place. The group favored a heavy progressive rock sound which quickly earned them a growing cult following, and in early 1974, they took home top honors at the Auckland Festival's all-day Rock Marathon. Their success led to a contract with Polygram Records, and within months, Dragon's debut LP, Universal Radio, appeared, becoming one of the best-selling "underground" records of the period.
