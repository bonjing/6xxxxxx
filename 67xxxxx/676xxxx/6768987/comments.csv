The file's fine - I just went for one that had a larger pixel ratio since that file was only about 20mg bigger than this one. I forgot to check what the pixel ratio on this file was. It would nearly fit a mini-notebook screen though. I can't find a high definition copy of this film-short though. :/
Decent upload though."
