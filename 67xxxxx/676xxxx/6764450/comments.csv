,ashtonkusher,2011-10-24T07:14Z,"Synopsis:

Written by Andrew Erin and Jason Bourque

When astronomers discovered the phenomena of magnetic tornados on the planet Mercury, they were amazed by the destructive power of these gargantuan solar-fueled magnetic fieldsâ€¦but they never imagined witnessing the catastrophic forces in their own backyards.

Samuel Planck is head of the HELIOS PROJECTâ€”a high tech facility tasked with storing and converting solar rays into an endless supply of renewable energy. After years of research and millions of dollars, it is now time to test the system out. The scientists cheer loudly as initially things go according to plan. But when the facility is unable to control the massive amount of energy coming in, the cheers turn to screams. The charged particles begin swirling around themselves, creating a massive magnetic vortex that quickly becomes the first magnetic tornado on earth!

Planck and his team try to abort the procedure but itâ€™s already too late--with a trillion watts of power to draw from, there is nowhere this monstrous force of nature canâ€™t go. The mega swirling tornados are soon ripping steel from buildings, cars off the street, and planes from the sky as they pulverize everything they touch!

Now Samuel Planck and his team must find a way to stop these metal tornados before they destroy all of us"

,bangskie,2011-10-26T14:43Z,Always very good ups extremzone :-) But the the movie is a low fucking budget.....
,greylion,2011-10-27T21:51Z,"Have you seen The Storm (miniseries)? - this movie is a lot like it; some large-scale scientific experiment goes wrong and creates havoc near and far. Some greedy, egotistical b*stards pretends the havoc has nothing to do with the experiment, and blunder ahead with total disregard for consequences and safety.
Much later on, it becomes blindingly obvious to even them, that it's too dangerous and has to be stopped.
A few bright people who saw how it began, and warned repeatedly against the danger, at last figure out how to stop it."
