,Milenko1234,2011-10-24T17:57Z,It is a bit slow but I'm only looking at 2 days
,iceman5533,2011-10-24T18:50Z,"well its getting better i'm looking at a few weeks now, no big deal though, i appreciate the upload and letting us download for free. I'll seed when i'm done downloading for same amount of time it took me to download it :)"
,EminemHBK,2011-10-25T22:13Z,Seeding's pretty slow. Speed is going at an average of 50 KB/S and 17 hours :)
,EminemHBK,2011-10-25T22:15Z,I'm definitely gonna seed 'til I bleed :D 
,EminemHBK,2011-10-25T22:18Z,"Btw, this is an early release because it's not the 3-Disc Set"
,KOATV,2011-10-25T23:04Z,Can this also work with DVD???
,the_deft,2011-10-26T00:54Z,"This isn't an early release. The DVD set is 3 discs, but the Blu-Ray set is only 2 discs (and this is a rip from the Blu-Ray)."

,Spinal101,2011-11-04T03:47Z,Did the ironman match have commentary by Shawn and Bret? Or did I read the description wrong?
,BPIV1127,2012-06-03T23:55Z,This took me about an hour and a half. I was downloading at 1.2-2.0 MB/s
