Based on the old games PANZER GENERAL & ALLIED GENERAL

this is a great remake for windows (even windows7) which

includes:

a) Panzer General  1939-1945
b) Allied General  1940-1945
c) Kaizer-General  1914-1918
d) Austro-Hungarian General  1913-1918


Whoever loved the old games will sure love this one.

After Unraring in the directory you will find the according .bat files

Run ag.bat     = allied general
Run kaizer.bat = kaizer general
Run kuk        = austrohungarian general
Run pg         = panzer general

As you will notice this gam is a bit more AI elaborated and it is a great fun
