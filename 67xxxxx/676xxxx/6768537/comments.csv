,abhinav.atul,2011-10-26T07:15Z,Can anyone tell if this is original 3D release or just 2d bluray converted to 3D?
,Origin64,2011-10-26T12:07Z,"This is REAL 3D, not a 2D conversion."
,sherooji,2011-10-26T23:24Z,Half-SBS ???
,Origin64,2011-10-27T00:11Z,"Half-side by side. Read the description...
If you're wondering what the difference is between half and full SBS:
Half-SBS means that two 960*1080 images are shown side-by-side. Full-SBS is 2 1920*1080 images side-by-side."
,sherooji,2011-10-27T03:45Z,so i can play it on my samsung 3D tv with black glasses?
,Origin64,2011-10-27T13:40Z,"Sherooji, it's side-by-side 3D, so either your TV recognizes it automatically when you play it, or you need to use a media player program which supports 3D (such as PowerDVD 11 Ultra) and set the output to 3DTV in the options. At least one of these 2 methods will work on a 3D tv."
,sherooji,2011-10-27T19:28Z,thanks a lot Origin64
,JOEY3D,2011-10-27T19:58Z,"The 1080p width is 1920. (1920x1080).
 So FULL-SBS would be 3840x1080 per frame, which at present no current TV can handle. Half-SBS is 2 x 960x1080 half-frames joined side-by-side and sent to the TV in one 1920x1080 frame. SBS simply became more common. Probably because psychologically when you look at the whole frame in 2D mode you see the left-eye image squashed up on the left and the right-eye image squashed up on the right, and mentally it just ""seems right so your torrent in 3d is 1920/1080 and not 960/1080 hope this helps"
,vaalross,2011-10-29T14:59Z,"@ joey3d what? full sbs means 1980x1080 per frame, the thing is it only shows one side at a time but switches really fast and is synced with the glasses so each eye only sees one frame, but both eyes get full hd 1080p resolution "
,franciscoomega1,2011-10-29T17:09Z,"what mean SBS AND FULL SBS? Can not see this movie in my Computer? my screen is HD 22"" i always see movies there but i don't know how to do to see this in my pc if this is Side by Side???? "
,Origin64,2011-10-29T20:48Z,@Francisco to watch this on your computer you need to have a 3D-ready display and media player software that can play 3D (such as CyberLink PowerDVD 11)
,RipMin2,2011-10-31T16:23Z,"or have a 3D HDTV and/or BluRay player.  FYI, my 3D HDTV has a USB port so I just copy a flash drive and plug it in; to play files larger than 4GB the flash drive needs to be formatted NTFS and your 3D player needs to be able to read NTFS."
,Origin64,2011-10-31T17:37Z,"@Ripmin, the TV or bluray player will also need to have codecs for MPEG4 and support for the .mkv container to be able to play the movie. They don't all have that, as for as I know. 
I don't know much about it, though. I only watch 3D movies on my monitor and for 2D I just connect my tv to my computer and play it that way. In my opinion a media player is a waste of money if you have a perfectly good PC in the same room, which there usually is. And it's on all day every day anyway :P"
,Sub20hz,2011-11-01T05:41Z,what is the audio in this...AC3 or DTS?
,Origin64,2011-11-01T11:36Z,DTS
,JOEY3D,2011-11-01T18:50Z,"vaalross half sbs is 1920x1080 and full sbs is 3840x1080 please do your research fella if i convert my movies in full sbs no 3dtv will play this as the resolutions are not supported i buy 3d blurays convert them and upload them so i think i should no

,xander007,2011-11-07T14:28Z,"@origin64= i hav a samsung led tv,full hd,will it play dis movie??? or it will need a special 3d player.. or can i play it on my windows 7 os? do reply.."
,Origin64,2011-11-07T15:52Z,@Xander: You will need a 3D-ready TV or monitor and a 3D blu-ray player or 3d media player program on your pc.
,frey7777,2011-11-14T10:50Z,Is this come with the subtitle as well?
,Origin64,2011-11-16T20:34Z,"No, there are no subtitles included. I'm sure there's plenty to be found on the web, though."
,ravester2k3,2011-11-23T02:20Z,"hey origin64. thanks for the upload. 
works perfectly on LG Cinema 3D TV"
,Neonridr,2011-12-10T17:02Z,"Joey3D : you are the one who is mistaken buddy.

Full 3D movies are shown at 3840x1080.  TV's can handle this.  Active Shutter TV's block the signal going to each eye alternatively - meaning that each eye is only getting 1 image at one time.  Half the image goes through, and half is blocked out.  Meaning each eye is getting 1920x1080.  Passive 3DTV's don't allow a full 1080p image to each eye.  Because they aren't showing two separate images (one for the left and one for the right) - but rather showing one full image - each eye is actually only getting 540x1080.  Do some quick research and you will see that this is the case.  That's why I prefer Active Shutter technology because it allows you to get full 1080p to each eye.  And they achieve this by doing 3840x1080 simultaneously."
,SteveEBell,2011-12-28T20:12Z,"Ive gat a LG movie 3D tv and it wont play the audio part of the film , picture quality is brill."
,magd,2012-01-27T00:28Z,"The file playes fine, but I cannot fast forward or jump to a certain point in the movie. Anyone else having this problem?"
,howyeman,2012-01-27T23:02Z,"TO ALL LG 3D TV USERS!
DTS is NOT compatible if you plug your usb hdd directly on the TV, don't panic, just use this tool http://www.videohelp.com/tools/MKV2AC3 and it will remove the DTS from the movie!
I takes around 20 min to get the work done, but it does an amazing one! Good luck LG 3DTV users!"
,neilung,2012-02-11T13:32Z,"Right to play on ps3 first use MKV2AC3 to process audio. Then use that output file on mkv2vob, now either burn to bluray or use a media server like tversity. Play perfectly on Lg and Samsung."
