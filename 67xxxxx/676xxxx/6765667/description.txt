Second Floyd Trance upload, you can find the first one here
 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6756531/Pink_Floyd_-_Trance_Remix_2_Albums_%28MP3%29

Ripped from the original CD in my collection and converted to MP3. 
I purchased this in the early 90's. The CD has a sticker still on it 
saying it's limited to 250 copies . Like it or loath it, I don't care.
( Not a big fan myself give me the original any day )
Review comments found on the web below.

"This remix is also a little uneven. The "Speak to Me: Breathe" suite
begins with lots a drum machine noises and samples from the songs. 
"On the Run" and "Any Colour You Like" are nice with lots of added 
keyboard sounds to make the already ambient feel of the songs more potent.
Surprisingly, both "Time" and "Great Gig in the Sky" are weak. Parts
 of the songs are sampled over and over again, and make Clare Torry's 
beautiful voice nothing more than a nerve grater on this one. Lots of 
potential lost on those two. "Money" has been turned into a typical dance
tune that is nothing special. "Us and Them" is the strong point of disc. 
Echo effects and spacey vocals abound. "Brain Damage" is sparse at best. 
Don't rush out to listen to this one with headphones! Good try: B-
