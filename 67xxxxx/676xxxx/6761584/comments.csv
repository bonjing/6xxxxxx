,Uberlime,2011-10-21T20:08Z,"& it's written by the dude who made ""OZ"", an old director of HBO is also  involved, 1st time i see  a french series with that kind of pizzaz, njoy !

Ofc it's a different one from ""the Borgias"" whose season 1 just ended (even tho this american prod also featured som european actors... weird i know, but hey...)"
,Uberlime,2011-10-21T20:21Z,"Pardon my french, check there it's well explained : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1582457/board/nest/189126880

""Oddly enough, the french network Canal+ is also producing a TV series on the very same subject, written by Tom ""Oz"" Fontana. The first episode will be aired in november 2011.

It's quite surprising that two networks work on the same time on the same subject... """

[V],manOtor,2011-10-29T00:04Z,"Great Uberlime!
Please go ahead and upload the rest of the series :).

FYI: As Uberlime already stated, this is a different series than the American SCHOWTIME series ""The Borgias"". Just wanted to second that.
It is a European production and airs currently in various European countries like Spain, France and Germany for instance.

If you are interested, read more about it here:
