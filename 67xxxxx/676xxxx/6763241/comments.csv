Your opinion on A & V would be better also a vote on quality + or – would be more beneficial than being belligerent for the sake of it.

Very good movie for people working in the financial sector (I'm an accountant, mostly in the FSO sector). It was very relevant, and I like it."
,sxp64,2011-10-22T22:24Z,How do you get such shitty video-quality from a R5 DVD?

,pxpierre,2011-10-23T01:15Z,"Thank you extremezone & seeders!

And since it's not a request thread then I don't have any."
,fwee288,2011-10-23T01:33Z,"I seriously hate all these annoying ppl that keep requesting things.  He uploads things as soon as he gets em or he waits til he has a good copy worth dnlding.  Other than that, just say thnx and give a comment towards the quality stead of putting stupid comments unrelated to the actual torrent.  ""gee mistah uploader, i sure want blah blah blah, can u spoon feed me?"" 
N e ways, thnx for both the uploads and the standard of quality u adhere to.  I've heard good things bout this film from ppl that work in finance.  "
,movie_fan,2011-10-23T02:45Z,Please seed if you of think of it. DL is s-l-o-w.  Cheers.

Cheerz!!"
,bilper,2011-10-25T01:15Z,"Screenwriters, producers and actors seem to be playing for sympathy for these thieves.

It should have ended with them going to jail. But then we don't put wealthy and influential people in jail in this country - do we?

The acting STINKS.

Final scene - Spacey﻿ buries his dog.
He should have jumped in with him clutching the screenplay."

,dlarrym1111,2011-10-27T08:09Z,"@bilper: 1st - No need to mention parts in the movie and perhaps ruin it for others. 
And no the VERY LAST thing Kevin Spacey's Character does (Sam) is NOT burying his dog. 
2nd - You must be a teenager, This is an excellent movie. It is a thriller played out in an unusual setting. 
If you are a person that pays even a little attention about all the crap going on in real life on WALL St., you'll appreciate this film. 

IMO, this is an excellent film, with a great cast: Demi Moore, Jeremy Irons, Kevin Spacey, and a few others.

V-10/A-10 IMO plot/story-10 

A fresh and unique twist on what makes a story/film a thriller!! Very cool film. Thanks EZ, great quality as USUAL!"
,bilper,2011-10-27T16:54Z,"I am 58 years old. This movie doesn't even come close to describing the meltdown that occurred and is still in play as we bicker. 
In my opinion the movie and acting are trash. They are good actors but the jumped at a bad script."
,bilper,2011-10-29T05:08Z,"I could not possibly ""ruin it for others"". How does one ruin a train wreck of a movie? 
Now, I'm going to tell everyone the best parts of this movie: Nothing, nothing and nothing."
,forboyler,2011-10-29T22:18Z,thanx extremezone !

,scottsasse,2011-11-04T00:16Z,"@bilper, No way you are 58 years old and came here 4 fucking times on four different fucking days to leave 4 different ignorant fucking comments to troll for fucking people to fucking fuck with. So fuck you!! You are maybe 15 at fucking best. Don't even write a fucking response because no one fucking cares. I as an adult won't be back here to even fucking read it!! I know my fucking use of the fuck word is ridiculously fucking repetitive, but that's the whole fucking point. DON""T be repetitive!!  "

It amazes me that it is so easy to “push your buttons”. If the Prozac is too much for you, I urge you to stop taking it."

,car1015,2011-11-12T06:18Z,"People please stop complaining, because someday these guys like extremezone, bone, froggie etc. might just say one day the hell with it, and then what, we will have to go pay for the movies. And yes we all have the right to our opinion but remember the movies are free, even if the movies are not the greatest ups then we have to wait until they came out on dvd rips> I know myself that I can't always afford to go to the movies so I appreciate what these guys do for us."
,13l4ckb34rd,2011-11-12T20:25Z,extremezone youre the man!!!
,MrStillwell,2011-11-13T01:23Z,"bilper is absolutly right. This movie is a joke and does not in any way descripe what has been and is still going on. Nothing but nonsense. Don't call people naive, when you are the one who is naive and uninformed."
,Lucian_,2011-11-13T22:40Z,Thanks for this. Never even hit the theatres where I live.

,jpmabrey,2011-11-17T03:04Z,"To those of you who complain:  How many of you seed what you download?  Or better yet, how many of you hit and run?  How many of you actually know what seeding means?  Don't complain about something that you don't contribute to.  Uploaders like exteremezone are doing you a FAVOR.  They don't have to.  You download the movies for FREE, do NOTHING to contribute to any of the torrents, and yet have the BALLS to comment on the likeability of the movie.  Who cares?  The likeability is a matter of opinion, and thank GOD we don't all share yours.  I know I do not have the resources to upload movies for everyone to enjoy, and I am deeply grateful to those that are able to get these movies for all of US.  So thank you extremezone, your work is greatly appreciated by many.  And to the complainers, whiners and otherwise ungrateful bastards that seem to plague these torrents, I can only say that I am sorry you do not have the mental capacity to completely understand what FREE means."
