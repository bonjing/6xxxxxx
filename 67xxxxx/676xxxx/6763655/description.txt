Windows 8 introduces a new style of application, called 'Metro', along with a new API for building this kind of app called 'WinRT'. This course shows how to use WinRT, in conjunction with XAML, to build Metro applications for Windows 8.

With Windows 8 a new application model called Metro was introduced, along with a new runtime called WinRT (Windows RunTime.) In this course you'll learn the fundamentals of developing Metro apps in C++ using language extensions called C++/CX, XAML, and the WinRT libraries. Leverage the C++ skills you already have and develop Metro apps for Windows 8 with the same libraries as C# or Javascript programmers.
