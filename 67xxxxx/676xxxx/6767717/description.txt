Product Description: Written for a first course in circuit analysis at the EET level, this updated edition provides user-friendly, easy-to-understand coverage of fundamental circuit analysis topics including standards of DC and AC, methods of analysis, capacitance, inductance, magnetism, simple transients, and more. Unique learning features enhance every chapter, such as "Putting it into Perspective" historical vignettes and "Putting it into Practice" applications. A hallmark of this edition is the inclusion of two popular computer application packages, MultiSIMâ„¢ and Cadence PSpice, both in their latest versions and integrated throughout to help users learn via hands-on simulation and to permit exploration of "what if?"-type scenarios.
