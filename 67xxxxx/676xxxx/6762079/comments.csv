[V],globeplus,2011-10-22T00:13Z,"HI everyone , i am inviting all of you to watch the PREQUEL (that means the before sequence in the storyline from the main movie) of THE THING , one of the most fascinating science-fiction films from 1982 by John Carpenter , if the 1982 movie was already watched then this one it is a kind of imperdible because certainly that THE THING was fantastic as a movie to the fans of this type of film , but if you didnÂ´t watched the 1982 movie then follow the next idea because this movie is a prequel from the main movie : watch this movie first then download and watch the 1982 movie then you will get the impression that you are following the correct sequence of the main story in  time and that it is great ... well in one case or another HAPPY MOVIE TO ALL OF YOU !!!

,Ashleyroo0,2011-10-22T02:25Z,doesn't work !
,Ashleyroo0,2011-10-22T02:26Z,Doesn't Work !
,Crabbmann,2011-10-22T10:21Z,176mb can't be good ..
[V],globeplus,2011-10-22T10:27Z,"To AshleyRoo0 : i have to say that your comments caused to me a little constransgiment in the way that it is a kind of enigmatic saying that the movie file doesnÂ´t work , i tought for an instant to myself : what the hell he used to play this RMVB that makes the file doesnÂ´t work ? Mystery ! Well the best options for a player to run this type of file are Mediacope or the RMVB Player , this programs runs perfectly RMVBs but have a little bug when you put the video on the player saying : ""Problem playing the file"" but beside this when you close the message he start running the movie without any problem , i have to confess that iÂ´d like to see a new version of the programs without this no sense messages at the start of the video but doesnÂ´t matter , for the moment it is like that and beside the message this programs really work fine , other suggestion is to grab the favourite video converter and convert to an high quality avi or mp4 for example to watch in any player probably or maybe convert to a video type for the cellphone like 3GP , 3GPII or Blackberry depending on the cellphone and watch the movie on the bus or sitting in a piecefull garden or maybe making a long train trip ... who knows ?... , ok just a little joke around with the possibilitys but wherever you look this video file WORK in many ways , sometimes it is a matter to understand what it is going on with the video and reading the description of the file can always be an help potencially ... see you and nice watching to you ."
[V],globeplus,2011-10-22T12:14Z,"To Crabbman : i understand what you mean about ""176mb canÂ´t be good"" but that only shows that you donÂ´t know nothing about RMVB video type files , the RMVB is one of the best if not the best video type for lower size videos , why ? because he keeps a great picture definition in fullscreen for small bitrate , where when for example for the same bitrate the flvs have the tendence to a pixelization of the screen in fullscreen and the avis or mp4s get too many particles on the picture background with a kind of a little unfocus , to finish i have to say that presently all the new nice movies normally have 2 files to download in file sharing services : an avi with 700mb or more and an RMVB with 300 mb or something , and this happen in many useful sites to download new cams for new movies , in my files you get the advantage of the black borders that happens often in fullscreen and the top and the bottom of the movie removed to a perfect fullscreen view and the colours improved and the particles on the picture background reduced to the minimum , finally always you can convert with a video converter the file maybe for a giga AVI if you want but to download was only 176 mb and that is great to all the possible users , so wherever you look you can believe and trust on the work , it is a matter to understand the philosophy of this movie type file .

Thank you for your comment and it is talking that we can understand things better ... see you ."
,chair_tard,2011-10-22T13:24Z,"globeplus: Are you fucking kidding me??!!! Where are your screens?... you took such care to give as little info as possible. Please... PLEASE stop being a douche nozzel.

My guess this is MiSTERE source re-ripped *inexplicably* to RMVB. Any care to confirm? Should be a fast download... all the RMVB posts are in the top 100      ((((/wtf"
,Crabbmann,2011-10-22T14:48Z,"Globeplus.
Ok I hear what your saying and will give it a try , your right I know nothing of the format and have never heard of it.
Still I'll dl and check it out so far it's taken a while (over an hour) and thought thus would be quick due to the size. "
,Crabbmann,2011-10-22T14:54Z,2h 40m really?????
,Fittler,2011-10-22T15:30Z,Yo bro! Are you uploading through a 0.5 KBs modem? Does it take this long to dl a 176 mb file? 
,Fittler,2011-10-22T16:21Z,"Well i reached 90% started up the thing, and it looks like pure crap. 

a: 0 
v:0"
,sarsapil,2011-10-22T16:45Z,"Although it's only 90% down I could test it, it's the same version with the chink subs, good sound, only it's taking ages to download, wonder why..."
,Crabbmann,2011-10-22T17:13Z,"Yup it's the same as the subbed one
V-3
A-7
Nice try but not worth the time it takes to dl wait for a better version
Thanks"
[V],globeplus,2011-10-22T21:35Z,GOOD MOVIE TO ALL OF YOU ... see all of you around .
,jediboyuk,2011-10-23T01:44Z,"Don't matter what format it is in - the source is the same as others and there is 20 minutes of footage missing and it's waaay too dark to enjoy the creature effects or, indeed, work out what is happening in the action scenes. Sound is good, vid's OK until 30 minutes in or so."
,dogman514,2011-10-23T18:52Z,"download the RMVB to AVI converter then you can use VLC player it works GREAT,this will link you right to the converter http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3976480/Allok_RMVB_to_AVI_Converter. the quality of the movie is somewhat better but the captions are a real pain."
[V],globeplus,2011-10-23T22:18Z,"Hi again and this comment is to say that i agree with the jedyboyuk and all of us always expect the besr possible picture but for new cams we have at least on the first week or something to be condicionated with what it is possible to get to watch but you can trust me that the better work possible under the circunstances of the original was done , thank you for your comment and that is construtive comments talk looking forward to improve if it is the case with the present possible video file .

To dogman514 : thank you for your comment and for the suggestion and it is true grabbing a nice converter it is a valid option to convert the rmvb to some other more common video type and watch on the prefered player , i can give a couple of suggestions too for converters but i remember that the final option is always up to the user of course :
- Aimersoft Video Converter Ultimate 
and 
- WinAVI All-In-One-Converter 
this are my couple of suggestions and probably this converters can be available on piratebay ...

Happy movies to all of you . "
,dogman514,2011-10-24T02:28Z,"i dont know whats happening now,it seams like one person uploads a copy and everybody else copies it and re-uploads it ,you check movie after movie and there all the same crap do they even bother to check the qualty of the movie,i think not,lets get back to where we had good quality movies,take a little pride in what you do."
,5amjr,2011-10-25T21:59Z,"It's been like that for years but in the last 2 years its got worse. Uploaders take a cam with subs, crop the subs out and reupload under a different name as their own.
There's 56 Cowboys and aliens ppvrips and they are all the same file. Re-uploading should be banned as it saturates PB with the same shit.
Dunno if anyone feels the same but every 10 torrents DL'd 6 are a waste of bandwidth + require deletion."
,5amjr,2011-10-25T22:00Z,P.S Globe whats constransgiment mean on earth?
,carlsonjon33,2011-10-26T21:43Z,Can you please put a watchable copy on here?
,asmaflora,2011-10-29T16:33Z,fuck
,beeker21,2011-10-31T01:40Z,"I really wan to know why there are 10 versions of the same shitty movie? The first one was shit, why must you keep putting out the same crap. This should be banned and furthermore I should not have to sift through all this garbage to just find 1 honest to good movie fuck all you fake A-holes congratulation someone noticed you!! "
,drivengreedy,2011-10-31T13:11Z,"globeplus, you don´t deserve a skull!"
,5amjr,2011-11-04T05:25Z,"because some of these guys want to be able to say they have uploaded 200, 2000 torrents etc.
It's about quantity with these guys today not quality.
Any uploader who expects respect with 90% of their files being non original re-uploaded cams needs to be told to change or leave.
You will still get neds thanking these guys for the effort!!!! lmao"
