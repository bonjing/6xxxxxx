SIR2 is an easy to use native audio-plugin to use for high quality reverberation. It's available for the plugin formats VST and AudioUnit. It offers zero-latency processing with low CPU-consumption and non-destructive audio processing of impulse responses. SIR2 includes high definition impulse responses (HDIR) of *real* places produced by Pinguin, Hamburg. You can also use various impulse responses from free or commercial sources.
