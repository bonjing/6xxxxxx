In Paris, IsmaÃ©l, a young Tunisian, cares for two brothers, Nouredine, a cripple, and streetwise Mouloud, 14. In haste, IsmaÃ©l and Mouloud go to Marseilles where an uncle lives. Nouredine has died in a fire, and IsmaÃ©l feels guilt on top of grief. IsmaÃ©l becomes friends with Jacky, a white man whose father and brother hate immigrants. Mouloud hangs out with cousin Rhida who breaks Islamic rules and deals hash. IsmaÃ©l decides Mouloud must return to Tunisia, but the boy runs off, becoming an acolyte to Rhida's supplier. IsmaÃ©l and Jacky's Arab girlfriend start an affair, friends betray friends, and the racism gets ugly. Can IsmaÃ©l rescue himself and Mouloud or will life in France crush them?
