Peggy Lee - Latin ala Lee! OlÃ© ala Lee! Latino Special CD
with xtras 320k (musicfromrizzo)

We didn't find a nice mp3 folder for this and instead had to convert
from FLAC files to get these great quality mp3s instead - sometimes
they don't convert them well I'm afraid to say, of mp3 files you
might come across now and then. However when its done right such
as it is here, who's to tell the difference except for the meter that
measured bandwidth shared per torrent!

This is Latin flavoured music although many of the titles
will seem familiar and even greatly popular already!

Enjoy this great gal of our own dear spirit Stateside!
