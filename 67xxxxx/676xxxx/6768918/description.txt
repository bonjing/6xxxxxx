
Jane's Advance Strike Fighters is set in the fictional country of
Azbaristan. The once great nation has been torn apart by a decade of civil
war. The ten year war resulted in huge territorial gains for the Northern
Peoples Republicand their controlling political party. This gave them
control of almost the entire country, except the oil-rich province in the
South.
The southern Azbaristan Democratic Front has only managed to hold off the
North with the aid of the West, which supplies military and logistical aid
to the tiny state in return for oil exports. Players will assume the role
of squadron leader Razor and lead the fight to reunify Azbaristan and
protect the West's vital interests.
J.A.S.F is an intense modern flight sim featuring 16 epic story based
missions that will take air combat to the next level. Engage enemies using
30 authentic licensed fighters as you battle over expansive battlefields.
