This is the ultimate Total Annihilation torrent I have made. All my previous torrents are more limited. I have spent some time programming a custom installer program for Total Annihilation, because it was so complicated to install it manually, even more complicated when and if you wanted to add a custom mod to the game.

In the installer program you can choose which profile you want to install from, you can choose to install the demo version, the first version of the game (v1.1) or the complete and latest version (v3.1) with all expansion packs.

You can also choose to install an optimized version, which I have made myself. The best part is that I have integrated 4 highly popular mods that you can choose from.

Switeck\'s TA Bugfix mod, Twilight 1.9 mod, Escalation 5.0.1 and Mayhem 6.2. So you have alot to choose from. Personally I prefer Escalation and I highly recommend it if you want to have alot of fun. ALOT of fun.

I have included mind boggling 780 extra third party maps on top of the 100 existing ones. You have almost 900 maps to play with. Of course you can choose not to install the extra maps, that is part of the installer options.

There is an option to install a build queue patch also, I have coded the patch myself and it will increase the mouse-click frequency when queueing units in your factories from 1 and 5 to 1, 5, 100 and 1000.

Mouse Click = Queue 1 unit at the time
Shift + Mouse Click = Queue 5 units at the time
Shift + Ctrl + Mouse Click = Queue 100 units at the time.
Shift + Ctrl + Alt + Mouse Click = Queue 1000 units at the time.

If you are an old timer of Total Annihilation and you want to install the game manually, I have included an option for that too. Open up the installer program, Press and hold CTRL key, then click your mouse anywhere on the screen and it will allow you to extract the cd iso files, patches and music to a folder so you can perform a manual install.

However, you want to avoid that except for in extreme cases, because I have fine tuned the installer to be absolutely precise. It is reliable.

So basically this torrent offers everything related to Total Annihilation. You can now install any version you like, even the demo. And you also have the top 4 mods for the game to choose from. These mods are large mods and offer brand new gameplay. Like I said, I highly recommend the Escalation mod if you are unsure what to try out. However, Twilight is also good. But my top pick, with no hesitation, is Escalation. :-)

Please seed as long as you can. I want this torrent to live for quite some time, and it was not made in a day or two. There is hard work behind it, so I ask you if you like it, please seed as long as you possibly can. And if you don\'t want to seed, please check in here from time to time to see if anyone is asking for seeders.

Enjoy!
