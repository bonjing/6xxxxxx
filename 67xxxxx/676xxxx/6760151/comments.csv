,emdeec,2011-10-24T04:27Z,Was just wondering if this included all the ''bonus'' units that one could download from Cavedog's site at one time. I've got them stored away somewhere.
,DelphiUniverse,2011-10-24T04:47Z,"The bonus units you are talking about are the 6 extra cavedog units, they are included. Absolutely everything related to TA is included, also 4 mods, custom patches and music files too, even intro videos."
,DelphiUniverse,2011-10-24T04:51Z,"You can also extract the original ISO files, patches and music files so you can perform a manual install, if you don't want to use my installer."
,Meh4589,2011-11-04T08:29Z,I hate when the seeder stops seeding when you are almost complete to force you to keep seeding a torrent. Despite this however I will continue to seed because these torrents should be kept forever. It's hard enough to find good compilations as it is.
,Meh4589,2011-11-04T10:12Z,"Finally finished downloading, everything went smoothly thanks to the great installer supplied by DelphiUniverse. No virus warnings from either AVG or Malwarebytes. Will seed till I have re-seeded at least 3-4 times which is a big commitment from me as I have a very low upload ability. Many great thanks to DelphiUniverse for supplying a great game with so easy a install.

Please re-seed after download people we cant afford to lose such well created game packages by these great up-loaders :)"
,Yashima638,2011-12-01T22:46Z,"Very nice package. A little too big, but worth it. Gonna help seed this indefinitely. Cheers."
,Tracker7,2011-12-05T00:46Z,"Ok so I used your custom installer and installed each one one by one into a folder called C:\TA\Cavedog etc etc. Each version of the game created it's own folder. The ""Complete"" version works but the other 4 that I installed gives me an error when it is loading the skirmish (map, texture progress indicator) and the error is ""Recond ""AraRock02"" missing from the feature files. What am I doing wrong here? "
,Tracker7,2011-12-05T01:17Z,"BTW, Windows 7 64 Ultimate, i7 Quad 3.2Ghz, 24gigs of ram... etc etc. I am considering running these installs inside a vm instance of XP Pro. I'll allocate 2 processors and 4 gigs of ram and see if I have better luck running the other mod versions. "
,Yashima638,2011-12-08T02:53Z,"Strange, it works perfectly for me, also have win 7 64bits - though with a lot weaker settings."
,thunderbird40,2011-12-11T12:03Z,hey does anyne know why mines in a different language instead of english? pls tell me anyone : (
,thunderbird40,2011-12-11T12:06Z,ive tired going to the options but i dont see anything thatcanchange the language. its like playing totala in half english half foreing language
,ss2dom9269,2012-01-14T23:47Z,"im having trouble using the installer, i select a file location then it just freezes and wont go any further... any help? Really looking forward to playing the game again, have been seeding for days now.... "
,Brain_Smasher,2012-02-02T16:27Z,"After you unpack from winrar, your left with 5 bin files that cannot be opened. Which are not compatable with ultraiso, daemon tools, poweriso, or winiso. Junk"
,mag62,2012-03-17T09:55Z,"I installed the game and everything seems to work fine except the music.  I don't really know how to get it to play.  I really like this game's music and in my opinion, it really adds to the game."
,stuXter83,2012-03-28T14:11Z,Works great for me. (win 7 x64)
,vinnonaut,2012-05-07T07:46Z,"Hi DelphiUniverse,

Great work this torrent. It works for me. The (addon, mod, extra unit) files you offer within this torrent are not available on the rest of the web. So thanks."
