70s Best SuperHits of the Seventies and more 320k (musicfromrizzo)

Hi again folks, this is the best collection of the best music of the 70s 
I'm aware of that anyone has available at this point! Great song selections
many lovely remastered tracks, flac converted tracks and direct from disc
too. We started out with a collection called 200 Superhits of the 70s and
found that some 80 tracks just didn't make the grade as good enough picks
and so here we now are with an expanded collection that's double the size
almost at 2.8GB Great library for you! All approx 310 songs are 320k except
for five or six at 256k or 192k - yet sounding as good in this case!

There are some songs that are even more of an oldies pick and some that are
even more recent than the seventies - yet they all meld in nicely into this
line-up of substantially 70s classic greats across the board!

This is one you wont want to have missed out on - enjoy and please seed

Thanks y'all once more!
