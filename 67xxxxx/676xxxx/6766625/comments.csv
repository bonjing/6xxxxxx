,orel71,2011-10-25T04:37Z,the fuckers at my cable company sent me a nasty email about downloading from the pirate bay and I learned what gets you is seeding.. how should I seed and not incur the cable company's nastygrams?  any help would help...  
,scottsasse,2011-10-25T05:35Z,Try using Peer guardian or peerblocker!! Google them for more info. My guess is you probably have comcast or cox. They are real cocksuckers!! Also some people fall under the radar by limiting their up and down speed under bandwidth allocation(right click on torrent while downloading to adjust) to around 200kbps or less. And yeah it will take 30 minutes instead of 3 minutes to downlaod but those really are the only two solutions I've heard of. Good luck!!
