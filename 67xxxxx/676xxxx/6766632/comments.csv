,OneSwede,2011-10-24T08:23Z,"Something is wrong with this. the entire torrent downloaded and it said is was an SS torrent, then the file disappeared and i cant find it. I tried to re-download the torrent and it wont let me. Has anyone been able to download and watch this successfully? "
[V],psspss,2011-10-24T12:37Z,"with 1300 plus seeders think it must be ok torrent and avi.. although I watched it and the ending comes across as clipped.. I really hate when they cut the end too much before credits roll.. 

i say you have corrupt fat32 or something.. try deleting your web cache folder then run a scandisk on drive..

also try saving the tornet instead of autoloading in torrent associated then manually load into the p2p client direct that shoul work for you"
[V],psspss,2011-10-24T12:39Z,if all fails try the magnet link instead they always seem to work.. sometimes isp can block torrent file downloads and they can be corrupted in cache
,jlkjlkjlk,2011-10-24T12:56Z,"this download worked for me and fast, but is it the full episode or is it missing the last 15-20 minutes like one of the other ones?? ive only skipped to the end and watched it fade to black without credits so im assuming so..."
,DalittleBIGmen,2011-10-25T12:44Z,"@psspss or anyone else

What is the difference between ""download this torrent"" and ""magnet link""?

Thanks"
