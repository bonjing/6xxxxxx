Thank you!"
,sonicbum,2011-10-30T19:46Z,"OH, BUT U REALLY REALLY NEED TO CHANGE THE NAMES OF THE EPISODES!!  

IT SHOULD SAY:

EPISODE 01

NOT:
EPISODE 1



THEY GET ALL SCRAMBLED WHEN I PLAY THEM FROM A FOLDER BECAUSE OF YOUR NAMING SYSTEM...  IT PLAYS 1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 2, 3....

SO, IF U CHANGED THE NAMES TO 01, 02, 03...10, 11....  THERE WOULDN'T BE THIS PROBLEM.."

,MabitzaRitchie,2012-01-27T16:04Z,"Had to sign up to thank you. Awesome quality, looks and sounds fantastic on my TV when played via MPC (choppy in VLC though). 

10/10"
,costenitasoy04,2012-03-06T14:55Z,Did anyone find the English subtitles for this? Thanks! :)
,mwalgreen,2012-04-07T12:51Z,"If you want to watch this at your full HD tv, do NOT download this crap.. it shouldnt even have the name 720p its like a dvdrip. Im useally not a complainer, but this is not 720p quality.  its watchable but a dvd rip aswell. A = 8, V = 6"
,ThatTruth,2012-05-26T07:21Z,"Just wanted to say belatedly, though I downloaded this a few days ago, thanks for the upload. I decided to replace my current low-quality rips with these (and your seasons 1-3 and subtitles) and the downloads were incredibly fast!

The quality is great and it's ironically smaller in size than the AVIs I had before. I never really liked MKVs that much, but these have convinced me otherwise: great quality, good size, and the subtitles are a nice touch that makes these perfect. I feel like I missed a lot watching through this series the first time without understanding the Spanish dialogue!

Thanks again."
