,espg_007,2011-10-25T00:27Z,I found something very suspicious. This torrent http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6329066/PES_2011_MAC_OSX is for PES 2011 and has the same size and data structure. Weird.

,okharonvn,2011-11-05T05:22Z,"Hi everyone
Do not know anyone on gamevn play PES 2012 on MAC LION ?
1 - I download the installer from thepiratebay on, set okie, no matter what
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6763807/PES_2012

2 - If i change the screen resolution to 1024x768 i can play without errors ,but if my screen resolution is 1440x900 crashes at the first screen

3 - I've read the manual download is the latest crossover (10.1.1) to creat new Bottle  and run setting file in the directory
Contents -> Resources -> TransGaming -> c_drive -> ProgramFile -> PES2012 -> settings.exe

Running okie, i can change the screen resolution 

The problem is - when I get out , then run PES 2012 crashes at first screen ,
Resolution has not changed,

If you repeat Step 3, the setting at 1440x900 was saved, but it does not changed running PES

Can u pls tell me how ? or can u send me the setting file with screen resolution 1440x900 for my 2010 macbookpro "

No license for more clubs then a can shake a stick at.   The only thing i see that's cool is Champion's League and when you start Man U is the only English team they have in it  lol.   You guys are crazy if you think this is half as decent as Fifa 12.  Call me an idiot or whatever you want,  I'm right.  ( And who cares if you can download and patch the real club teams)  Why would you in the first place?"

mine got scramble.. even i've change correctly in setting.exe"
,iamtddmj,2012-04-04T00:55Z,"Hey, i got an idea to get the thing work.

The instruction is from a Chinese website

First you must check your computer's resolutions.

Then run crossover 10.1.1 from the PES 2012 dmg file

Then find the setting.exe file and copy it to whatever you want (the author suggests to copy it onto the Pro evolution soccer 20012 file, from KONAMI in documents). The address is gonna be: Contents -> Resources -> TransGaming -> c_drive -> ProgramFile -> PES2012 if you want to find the setting.exe file

Then use crossover to run the setting.exe (for 21-inch mac user it might cause a little trouble but just clikc ok on the bottom if you want to ignore it)

After that, copy the KONAMI file to Contents -> Resources -> TransGaming -> c_drive -> ProgramFile -> PES2012->%USERPROFILE%->My Documents. 

And i think that's it.

If there's any inconvenience.......tell me pleaz
