NASA Mooned America - Moongate - Apollo 11 Mission Report

NASA Mooned America by Ralph Rene
--A major expose of fake Apollo Moon landings

"Our space shuttles routinely blast off to orbit the Earth. There is not a single doubt that man is in space! However, there is much doubt that any man has ever gone beyond the radiation shield provided by the Van Allen belts. As you will eventually learn from the chapter titled Sunstroke, once beyond that shield space is riven with deadly radiation from the Sun. The Table of Contents should be on this page. However, since NASA MOONED AMERICA! is a unique book it required a different format. The old adage, "A picture is worth 10'000 words" still holds true. We shall immediately present four pages of NASA-derived photos that will absolutely prove that NASA began to doctor photos three years before the Apollo missions allegedly landed men on the Moon."

That's the book Bill Cooper talked about, the book that was mysteriously stolen from US mail - stolen many times. Lies, damn lies and NASA!
