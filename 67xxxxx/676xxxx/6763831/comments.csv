Only among the ignorant and stupid. This crap has been thoroughly debunked not once but many times."
,jjaworsk,2011-10-22T18:21Z,"@sistromo - Yes!, there was a recent report that 'thoroughly debunked' this theory.
This report was compiled and presented by ......wait for it......NASA.
Whether true or false on either side will probably never be known in our lifetime, the real question is - do you think that the USA establishment was/is capable and willing to perpetrate and perpetuate such a hoax??

Uhm... so a so called ""independent"" expert spews out some conspiracy theory, and when NASA responds, your problem is that the report was compiled by... NASA. Who the fuck should respond to such accusation if not the accused party? 

As to the question: no, I don't believe that such a huge organization as NASA would be able to pull off a perfect conspiracy. Leaks happen. (like Wikileaks). People talk. People get pissed at their bosses, employers, even at their own nations, and steal secrets (or simply tell other people how to get them). Consider this: if a NASA employee would be able to provide hard evidence that moon landings were faked, he or she could get millions of dollars from the media (enough to buy a new identity). Not everybody is a patriotic angel at NASA, and even if they have been carefully screened, there would be a weak link in the chain. It would have happened by now. There is no such thing as 100-percent control over a secret when an organization grows beyond a certain size."

They employed as many people as the ENTIRE AUTO INDUSTRY in making the first atomic bombs - which fell in the utter amazement and surprise of the rest of the world. Secrets CAN be kept - maybe not by you and yours, but in the real world ""Ve Hav Vays ov making you zilent!!!"
