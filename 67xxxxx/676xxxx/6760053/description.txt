From Wiki:

hHead were a Canadian alternative rock band in the 1990s. The band consisted of Noah Mintz, Brendan Canning and a succession of drummers. They were originally known as Head, but added the second h after discovering that another band was already recording as Head.

The band's first album, Fireman, was released independently in 1992. It became popular on Canadian campus radio, and the band landed a contract with IRS Records in 1994, releasing their second album, Jerk, that year. However, IRS Records was at this point in financial trouble, and the band was not well-promoted. The band then moved to the Canadian independent label Handsome Boy Records for their final album, Ozzy.

The band broke up in 1997.

Mintz is now a mastering engineer for artists such as Hayden and The Dears, and has recorded solo material as Noah's Arkweld. Canning joined By Divine Right for that band's third album Bless This Mess, and then formed Broken Social Scene with Kevin Drew. Broken Social Scene's album Bee Hives includes a song titled "hHallmark", alluding to the unique typography of hHead's name. 






Fireman 1992


Fireman is the first album by Canadian alternative/indie rock band hHead released in 1992 (then re-released in 1994-1995 by IRS Records).

It was first released independently by hHead themselves, as a cassette and then released under Jam Entertainment Records. After hHead signed to IRS Records in 1994 to release Jerk, they also re-released the CD version of Fireman. There was also a version of Fireman released, that had 14 tracks (Under Jam Entertainment Records).

Jerk 1994



Jerk is the second album by Canadian alternative/indie rock band hHead, released in 1994. The prize money that hHead won from a CFNY-FM contest went towards paying the costs for making this album. Some critics say that this album sounded a lot more 'produced' than the previous album, Fireman, mainly because of the style change, from a garagey sound to a more professional sound.[citation needed]
