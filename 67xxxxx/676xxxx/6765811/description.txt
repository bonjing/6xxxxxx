Plot:Make Mine Music was originally released on laserdisc in Japan on October 21, 1985, and on VHS and DVD on June 6, 2000 under the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection title. Before, two of its segments (including Peter and the Wolf) were released on home video individually with additional cartoons added to them in the 1980s and 1990s. This release was edited to remove "The Martins and the Coys", because it had "graphic gunplay not suitable for children." The Japanese laserdisc includes all the cuts made to the VHS/DVD versions. No other release has been scheduled. It is the only film in the Disney Animated Classics canon never to see a release on Region 2 or Region 4 DVD.
