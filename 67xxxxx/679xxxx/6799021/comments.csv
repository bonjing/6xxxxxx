I am having a lot of trouble getting my vids to sync (even the downloads seem to stuff up the audio on this show), and absolutely no time to find out what is going wrong. Therefore I will not be uploading any more episodes of The View.

As said I just don't have the time to properly upload decent files, and it's not me to do things like that. The time inbetween uploads have been to long, and now the quality is suffering too. And I have to make priorities in the little spare time that I have at the moment, and have decided it is best for me to quit uploading, for the near future.

Who knows, maybe we'll see eachother again someday.

Wishing you all the best!
