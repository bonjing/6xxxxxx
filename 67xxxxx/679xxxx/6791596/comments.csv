,rcthebearcub,2011-11-03T13:59Z,"Info I should have added for those who care:
Tracks are edited/segued together slightly in a way that is consistent with Roger and Floyd's albums and collections to make for a more enjoyable listening experience.

Sources:
1. ""Legend of 1900"" soundtrack cd
2. ""To Kill A Child"" amazon 320 kps mp3 (sorry no WAV.. I can't afford the $200 2 track Japan single and can't find the WAV or FLAC of it)
3. ""Amused To Death"" Gold Disc
4. ""Amused To Death"" Gold Disc
5. ""In The Flesh Live"" cd
6. Promo Single ""For Grammy Consideration"" cd
7. ""Flickering Flame"" cd
8. ""Leaving Beirut"" 320 kps Amazon mp3
9. ""Flickering Flame"" cd (Originally ""Radio KAOS"" but this seems to be a cleaner mix)
10. ""In The Flesh Live"" cd
11. ""Amused To Death"" gold cd - intro/outro edited for length
12. ""Flickering Flame"" cd
13. ""Flickering Flame"" cd
