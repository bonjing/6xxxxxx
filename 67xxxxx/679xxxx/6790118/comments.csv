,Pimbax,2011-11-02T13:03Z,For now.. Yes.
,Constant_Ramble,2011-11-02T13:36Z,"Not sure I want this...

I can look at my staff screen and weekly awards already...

I'm going to pass, given the further glitch, but if I do get staff screen issues I'll download it later.

Anyone else NOT having an issue with the staff screen?"
,meeyou,2011-11-02T15:24Z,"@Constant_Ramble
u are such a moron, sure u can look at staff screen but u wont be able to look at STATS OF ANY OF STAFF! HOW DO YOU HIRE ONE WHILE GAME KEEPS QUITING?
this crackfix fixes this problem"
,iCrimz,2011-11-02T16:30Z,"just downloaded this and first thing what happened is: the game quit when i clicked on one of my staffmembers..

how can i solve this? i deleted the crash dump report and file."
,iCrimz,2011-11-02T16:39Z,"nevermind my previous comments, wrong torrent. this one just fixed my problem! awesome!"
,Constant_Ramble,2011-11-02T18:37Z,"@meeyou

WHAT?!?!

I'm telling you, I can see the staff stats fine and can browse the staff area on the old update.

I have however had ONE crash dump whilst searching for staff, but generally it works fine when ran as administrator.

I have since downloaded this fix though, and it makes a HUGe difference to my CPU. Seems to run a lot smoother, just waiting for another update to fix the issues with this fix.

But once again, very grateful to the SKIDROW team for recognizing and fixing the issues."

,BlueHefner,2011-11-03T01:02Z,There is now another patch 12.0.4  http://www.sigames.com/news/5467?newsid=5467
,gmoujik,2011-11-03T05:15Z,"Great work! On Vista copy only fm.exe. The game takes longer to start, but after that, it works the same as before. "
,SFKTeam,2011-11-03T13:18Z,"There is also bugs on the opposition instructions page, Sometimes it wont allow you to set instructions (closing down. marking, show on foot)for left sided players and will reset them before the match.  The awards also really need fixing, im sure theres lots more bugs we have not realised or played enough to notice yet.. please make a fix.. 
Dont blame tools for fucking up the code when the code was already fucked :P"
,meeyou,2011-11-03T18:23Z,"@SFKTeam
u have changed your staff team or ur knowledge about opposition team is too small
stop blaming game for lack of ur knowledge"
,LeeeRoyy91,2011-11-03T22:43Z,can any 1 help me tel me what to do plzzzzzz
,SFKTeam,2011-11-03T23:00Z,"@meeyou your english is crap and your contribution of 0 uploads to TPB is just as bad.. You need to pull your tongue from skidrows arse for a few mins and notice this crack is FULL of bugs.

I have played this game since 92/93 Amiga500+ when it was published under Domark and was called Championship Manager, belive me when i tell you i know how to do something as simple as opposition instructions. "
,pfmac,2011-11-04T00:36Z,"I don't know if anyone is experiencing it as well but I can't change squad status (from ""not needed"" to ""key player"" and etc). Either that or the Squad page does not ""refresh"" after I've made changes to it."
,meeyou,2011-11-04T01:06Z,"@SFKTeam
i do not experience such problems in every game except those with foregin clubs I CAN SET OPP INSTRUCTIONS"
,meeyou,2011-11-04T01:11Z,"@SFKTeam
and believe me or not, run fm11 hire new asistant and try to set opp instructions or just play with any foregin club, ofc start managing small club
nice try mister (www.thedugout.tv/community/archive/index.php/t-66127.html)"
,SFKTeam,2011-11-04T04:05Z,"Found even more bugs tonight, make sure you go back to tactics after doing substitutes in the second half. It will put most of your players out of position.. I brought a striker on and it put him in midfield and swapped my midfilders around so they were also playing out of position , i had to go back to tactics and appy the change back to attack 4 times (each time it would put a different midfileder in attack lol)  before it stayed like that. Game is awful and far from cracked."
,cfc1991,2011-11-04T11:50Z,"It will never be cracked completly because if they fix one bug then a new one will appear, and before they release 12.0.4 SI will throw out 12.0.5 lol"
,meeyou,2011-11-04T12:15Z,"@SFKTeam
this never happened to me, and noone but you complain, maybe u have changed tactic to a backup one? and then some players might be out of positions"
