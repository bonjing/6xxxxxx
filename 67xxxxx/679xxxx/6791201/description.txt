Georgina is first very upset about having to spend her time together with her cousins. But after a while the children become friends. Georgina (George) brings her cousins to Kirrin Island. They get caught in a storm. The waves threw up a big shipwreck. When the children explore the wreck they find a box with a map. A map to find "ingots". What are "ingots", if not.... GOLD!
