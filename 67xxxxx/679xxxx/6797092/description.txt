He's back! (sadly)

One of North Britain's best loved comedians finally 
brings his record breaking Tour That Doesn't Tour 
Tour to DVD.

With his first live tour in 7 years, playing to over 
one million people, this hilarious new show, sees Peter 
back on nights, doing what he does best, live stand-up comedy.

Only Northern English people like this guy, hence why he never
actually toured and just stayed in one place. If you're not
from the North of England, I'd give this a miss.
