latest Version of a HL2 mod
a total conversion of hl2 adding new weapons, animations, enemies, 8 player online coop, etc


installing will be up to you to figure out cause i haven't even fully downloaded this yet.

Dont Forget to snag some of my other online playable torrents








NOTE: i think this requires hl2...but might only need a game that gives you source sdk...so might be usable with tf2 instead (i read that somewhere but it may be wrong)
