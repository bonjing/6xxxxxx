Making full use of her brand-new, four-piece band Cotillion, Brighton-based folk singer Mary Hamptonâ€™s second album, Folly, may be a slightly more expansive record than her sparsely produced 2008 debut, My Motherâ€™s Children, but itâ€™s still her ethereal gliding vocals which remain her most valuable asset. Whether theyâ€™re swooping effortlessly over the gothic cello drone of â€œForget Me Notâ€ and the string-soaked adaptation of the Emily Dickinson poem, â€œNo. 32,â€ or providing an eerie sense of melancholy on the achingly tender ballad â€œLullaby for the Beleagueredâ€ and the a cappella, sea shanty-styled closer â€œPear Tree,â€ Hamptonâ€™s mixture of whimsy, eeriness, and intensity somehow manages to bring something new to a sound steeped in tradition. Indeed, its nine tracks couldnâ€™t be more old-school if they tried: check the fluttering flutes, enchanting steam pipes, and drum roll rhythms of opener â€œThe Man Behind the Rhododendron,â€ which evoke the Victorian era which the empirical lyric themes are based on; the gentle brass section of â€œHoax and Benisonâ€ which lends a wartime jazz feel to the yearning torch song, and the Middle Eastern-tinged acoustic balladry of â€œKiss Vâ€ sounding like something that would be played during a medieval coronation. Indeed, itâ€™s a testament to Hamptonâ€™s songwriting skills that the originals feel just as timeless as the two covers on offer here, a haunting birdsong-sampling rendition of mid-17th century folk tune â€œBenjamin Bowamaneer,â€ and a lilting, banjo-plucking interpretation of Blind Mamie Forehandâ€™s gospel-blues classic â€œHoney in the Rock.â€ Of course, with its focus on the historical Folly is unlikely to be embraced by the current nu-folk mainstream, but itâ€™s a spine-tingling listen which should enchant the majority of those who happen to stumble across it.
