,2old2bs,2011-12-04T07:09Z,"A couple months ago I suffered a catastrophic loss of Data (about 8TB) and hardware. I have so far DL 897 Gb, it is movies from 2000 and on and Galactica.  My question is this, how can I move the completed torrents to my daughterâ€™s laptop that uses a different internet connection and just seed full time? I thought of starting the new DLs from there but as I like to â€œdriveâ€ the Torrents downloading it will be impossible for her to go on line. This way I will free space here to keep downloading. I tried to copy some completed torrents to her laptop and then installed bit torrent but it did not â€œseeâ€ them. If you can help it will be seeding 24/7 for at least a couple of months on all I have so far. When my next batch of DL is done (it will be early movies 40,s 50,) I can move the completed torrents to an external drive and keep seeding from the laptop while I move on to the next DL batch.  I will repost this as to improve my chances of an answer.   "
