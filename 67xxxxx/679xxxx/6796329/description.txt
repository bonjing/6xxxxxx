Greed Corp HD, the turn-based strategy, at its finest!
The award winning console and PC strategy hit is now available to your Android tablet!
Greed Corp is a fresh and fun strategy game situated in a rich Steam-Punk world, offering a long-lasting single player campaign and a variety of multiplayer options for up to four players.

Find the delicate balance between harvesting the land for resources to fund your war machines and preserving it to stay alive.
