                Misfits returns for the third series, and new kid on
                the block Rudy gets a rude awakening in his first few
                days of community service, learning that with the
                keys to the infamous locker room comes a great deal
                of running, screaming and, in some instances,
                killing. But that really is the least of his worries.
                More pressing is just how to keep his secret
                superpower, well, secret. And is it super? As in, is
                it from the A-List? The rest of the gang are also
                back with all-new powers. So, just how did that
                trade-off with Seth the superpower dealer go down?
                You'd hope that at least one of them has a power
                approaching something halfway useful. Is Simon any
                closer to fulfilling his destiny as Superhoodie? And
                just where does he learn to do all that nifty
                parkour? With Seth still trading powers, zombies on
                the loose, havoc being wreaked with events from the
                past and present, things haven't got any quieter for
                the gang.
