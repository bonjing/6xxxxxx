,listenherenow,2011-11-06T16:46Z,"2010 movie - this ones trailer really sucks. LOL   no joke, took a little while to even find the trailer.
   never heard of this movie and theer is no reviews on it anywhere that I can find. 

 looks like it blows really bad so I have to download it i guess and see for myself.  feels like I am going to be wasting a little life on this however.  "

Can someone confirm if its me or the download. Thanks."

But IMHO, it is undeniably the most shithouse film I've attempted to watch in some time. I say attempted because I couldn't finish watching it.
