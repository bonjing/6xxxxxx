...................................NFO:.................................................You better pay attention - because you're about to get schooled! When the legendary underground superstar TK Kirkland takes the stage it's more than stand-up comedy, it's a seminar, and the subject is real talk on relationships, lovemaking, self-esteem and just plain common sense. The inimitable Hip-Hop comedy bad boy has performed for sold-out crowds opening for stars including Jay-Z, 50 Cent, Kid Rock, Keyshia Cole, Lil Wayne and Nelly. Check out TK's raw style on his first-ever DVD - and if you're easily offended, please back away now. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS? No? Good.
