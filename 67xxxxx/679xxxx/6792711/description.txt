Cassius is the French duo behind this year's superhit "I &lt;3 U SO", but everybody of course also still remembers their late nineties hits such as "1999", "La Mouche" and "Feeling For You". Cassius was one of the originators of the gigantic French touch movement, but they're still on top of the game, now on one of the hippest labels of the moment, Ed Banger.
