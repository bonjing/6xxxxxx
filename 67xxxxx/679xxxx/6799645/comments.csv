thanks a lot"
,watermelonseeds,2011-11-07T20:58Z,Does this have subtitles for the ape speaking parts?
,robson1969,2011-11-08T13:36Z,"watermelonseeds, I doubt it. Film is prob ripped off foreign blu-ray  so would have full English subs or none at all. PS, Is your name taken from the film Jean De Florette?"
,havor,2011-11-08T15:01Z,"First of all my tanks for the upload!

But one thing i don't get, why suds a big file, if i have downloaded it, i re-encode the movie down to 2GB, without any real loss of quality.

It just takes 6+ hours on a i7 2600 to re-encode, but if i only see a difference between the 10GB and the 2GB video file, during pause and doing a AB comparison on a 2.4m wide screen, projected with a  Panasonic AE4000 1080p projector.

Whats the point then of these big files ?"
,chang104,2011-11-10T04:05Z,"havor, can I please find out what kind of software or hardware do I need to re-encode large movie files to a smaller size one, without any real loss in quality, like what you have mentioned? I am new to this."
,forkushty,2011-11-11T03:20Z,Averaging 5.0kb/s Please seed people. Will do the same!
,eric0wns,2011-11-11T13:11Z,There are no subtitles included. Also there are no hardcoded subs. So when the apes speak you are SOL.
,imnangler,2011-11-12T00:20Z,seeeeeeed pleeeeease...I'm at 95% and really wanna watch it tonight! BTW - I thought watermelon seed made a good joke...you really need ape subs?
,Skram0,2011-11-12T08:36Z,Anyone know if the 720p CHD Subtitle release will work with this release?
,imnangler,2011-11-12T14:11Z,"V=10
A=10
Fantastic movie...and there are NO ape subtitles to worry about. Just watch and enjoy."
,Skram0,2011-11-13T00:53Z,I think I'd prefer to worry about the ape subtitles if there were any. How are you to know what the apes are saying? It's like watching District 9 without alien subtitles.
,havor,2011-11-13T11:37Z,"@chang104
Handbrake will do nicely but there many other picks.
http://handbrake.fr/downloads.php 

And http://www.videohelp.com/ is the place to find all information and help there is to find on encoding."
,bbb_ozoz,2011-11-15T00:13Z,"abit slow but all good. Thx BOZX!!!!

,chang104,2011-11-17T04:58Z,"@havor.
Thnx.  Will check them out."
,shinobiung,2011-11-18T13:14Z,"no subs for ape speaking parts, but I think it doesnt detract from the quality ofthe film.

a - 9
v - 10
m - 10"
,lotust251,2011-12-15T00:28Z,"great quality,  so what the file is large.  "
,b2db,2011-12-22T18:02Z,"Listen guys.. about the whole ape subtitle thing.. instead of the same question being asked again..and again......... and again....... someone just provide a link to a site which has the right subtitles for this file..

as for me..lol.. I dont care.. i just wanna watch some ACTION! hehe.. 

CHEERS."
,Skram0,2012-01-01T03:15Z,"English Ape Only Subs: http://engsub.net/?p=subtitle&id=121526
This is from the 720p rip from the same group. There's only 8 sections of text. Seems match up almost exactly to the timing from the English 'all subtitles' found elsewhere for this exact rip. Maybe only a difference of about a second or so.

You can merge this into the MKV file if you want using MKVMerge. And set the 'force' flag so it should show up even if you have subtitles disabled, at least playing in XBMC."
,Polymathj,2012-01-11T04:28Z,Thanks for the BRIP and MANY THANKS for not using MKV!!!
,Hallfing,2012-01-14T03:53Z,"Does anyone else get artifacts around 1:02:20-1:02:21 &  1:02:33  ??? Please tell me someone else is also getting it ~_~"""
,Terozer,2012-01-29T06:31Z,"This is not 1920x1080.

This is 1920x something lower than 1080.

It is not HD format."
,scrunter,2012-03-27T11:37Z,@Terozer if it's 1920 wide then it must be HD format. However if you're playing a 2.35:1 aspect ratio movie on a 16:9 aspect ratio TV then obviously the height won't be the full 1080 pixels ;)
,xxbel,2012-04-17T15:00Z,1080 yes!
