,richardashcroft,2011-11-30T10:58Z,There's also another edition with a different tracklist around: https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6801183/VA_A_State_Of_Trance_Classics_Vol.6_%284CD%29_%282011%29
,tavery80a,2011-12-05T00:43Z,"This is NOT vol. 6....these are the 50 songs that came on the bonus USB drive from Pioneer when buying Vol. 6.  These 50 songs are the basically a ""best of"" collection from Vols. 1 thru 5.

Look elsewhere for the actual Vol. 6. - it has 4 CDs of 9 songs, like the previous 5 Vols."
,tavery80a,2011-12-05T01:22Z,"CORRECTION - this is actually a mash-up collection...

Tracks 1 thru 21 are on Vol. 6.

22 thru 50 are from Vols. 1-5.

I started seeing some from Vol. 6 so I checked."
,alijonguh,2011-12-21T16:09Z,THANX!
