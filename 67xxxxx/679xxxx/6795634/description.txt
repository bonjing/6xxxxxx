Tony Stark travels to Japan to supervise the construction of an Arc Station.

will replace Tony when he retires from being Iron Man. Tony later holds a 
public event to show off the new model. However, during the event, something 
goes wrong with the Dio and he crashes. When one of the pilots tests it later, 
he gets brainwashed and attacks the other pilots. Tony equips his classic 
Iron Man armor and manages to defeat it. However, he is attacked by a strange 
warrior named Scorpio who comes from an order called the Zodiac. 
Tony defeats him, but the Dio armor disappears.

Tony recalls five years ago when he was attacked and captured by terrorists, 
receiving life threatening injuries. Agreeing to make weapons for the terrorists, he was saved by fellow prisoner Ho Yinsen who installed a magnetic chest plate to keep him alive and helped him realize the deaths his weapons manufacturing has caused. This led to the creation of the mini arc-reactor and, subsequently, Iron Man,but Yinsen sacrificed himself to give Tony a chance to escape. Meanwhile in the present, a race driver named Kawashima, who had broken his legs and desires to drive again, is given cybernetic enhancements on the condition that he kills Tony. When Tony is targeted, he is saved by the sudden appearance of Logan, who is in Japan investigating A.I.M. Iron Man later fights against Kawashima, who controls the Zodiac warrior Taurus but is soon taken over by it. With the help of Logan, Iron Man defeats Taurus and rescues Kawashima, but soon comes face to face with Dio and is shocked to find what appears to be Yinsen inside.

Using an experimental coating to protect him from the radiation, Iron Man launches into space with the help of Sakurai to face the Zodiac. However, he is at a disadvantage in zero gravity and is taken inside where he is exposed to high radiation.

As Tony tries to learn more about the whereabouts of Yinsen, Laboratory #23 is 
attacked by a virus which causes the robotic cleaners to go berserk and greatly 
reduces the temperature in the complex. Tony and Chika try to shut out the virus with a firewall, but this allows the virus to infect computers around the city and even takes over some fighter jets. In order to lure the culprit out and protect the Arc Station, Tony takes the virus into the Iron Man armor in order to fight it. Hearing Tony's promise to protect people, the culprit, a boy named Sho who was approached by Zodiac, is reminded of his promise to his late mother to protect others and destroys the virus.

They learn that her parents died two years ago and she was adopted by a strange group six months ago. Tony later learns from Aki that her parents died when Aki's powers went out of control and caused their plane to crash. Later, Sakurai takes them both into custody, explaining Zodiac were planning to use her powers for a weapon. Just then, they are attacked by the Zodiac warrior Virgo. After admitting Aki into Lab #23, Iron Man goes to battle Virgo, but soon learns it is synchronized with Aki's brainwaves, meaning destroying it would kill Aki. As Iron Man tries to prevent Sakurai from destroying Virgo, it incorporates Aki and produces a destructive field. Iron Man breaks through the shield to rescue Aki and shut down Virgo. As a result, Aki loses both her powers and her memories but is much happier.

As Iron Man heads towards the location, he is attacked by Sakurai in Ramon Zero, but Tony manages to snap him out of it before they are attacked by another Zodiac mech. While Iron Man fights the Zodiac mech, Sakurai heads to the location and discovers Zodiac's weapons factory, also learning their leader is Kuroda, who plans to rebuild Japan as a military nation.

Kuroda enacts a coup d'etat and declares martial law over Japan.

Just then, Kuroda approaches them in his Retetsu armor and takes 
control of Chika, who had really been a Zodiac warrior, and has her attack Tony. As Tony tries to get Chika to believe in herself, she stabs herself to break free from Kuroda's control. Tony leaves Chika in Nanami's care while he goes to fight Kuroda, who was resentful due to his grandparents being killed 
in the Nagasaki bombing. Meanwhile, Chika decides to transfer her consciousness into the arc reactor program in order to take control of it and transfer its energy over to Iron Man. With the massive power provided, Iron Man unleashes a massive Unibeam that completely obliterates Kuroda, but Chika dies as a result of the transfer. A month later, the Arc Station is finally activated, providing clean energy for Japan, and Tony is seen returning to America.
