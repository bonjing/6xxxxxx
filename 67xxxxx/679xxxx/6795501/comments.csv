This is due to the way the patch works, but it's really not a virus. If you want confirmation of this, look on my previous uploads as downloaders have confirmed it's safe. 

Cheers."
,dolceVita18,2011-11-05T11:22Z,"Thank you for yet another Mac OS VM.

It works for a while but then I can't click anymore on anything. The keyboard sort of continues to work but its kind of useless. Command-Q works, but not always, so I have to force power off and restart to continue.

I think this is something related to the video driver I installed after first boot. I noticed this start to happens after opening the app launcher, but also happens when I just live it installing XCode, with no further action."
,dolceVita18,2011-11-05T11:24Z,"This problem appears to happen also while resizing the launchbar. Definitively something related to video driver.

Appreciate if you can tell us ow to uninstall the VMware video driver."
,SoulUploader,2011-11-07T20:25Z,It can't be related to video if your Trackpad/USB isn't functioning correctly. I'll have a looksie.
,lectrick,2011-11-08T15:45Z,MSE (MS Security Essentials) flags the decompressed file as having the PWS:Win32/Prast!rts virus. FYI!
,lectrick,2011-11-08T15:48Z,"Actually, it's the unlocker/hardware virtualization bypasser exe that has a password stealer trojan in it. You have been warned."
,johnhatten,2011-11-09T13:08Z,"""Make sure to watch the video link...""  but after a 4+GB download, the YouTube link says, ""This video has been removed by the user.  Sorry about that.""

So without the directions, can this VM work?

Proceed at your own risk.."
,nobodii,2011-11-10T16:22Z,"Encounter ""Unsupported compression method"" when using 7-Zip 4.65 to uncompress. Is this correct?"
,SoulUploader,2011-11-11T11:07Z,"Yeah, read my top comment. 

And make sure to have the latest 7zip as it's in LZMA2."
,SoulUploader,2011-11-11T11:09Z,As for the video just go to youtube and the video code is: w7QFmPd7LO8 
,SoulUploader,2011-11-11T11:10Z,"@lectrick I already told people about that in the top comment, if it really was a virus do you think I'd openly say it?"
,dolceVita18,2011-11-14T00:22Z,"I'm seeding this for days now. This is good stuff. Has a little annoying problem with mouse some times, but it generally works well."
,boscoboscowitz,2011-11-16T18:33Z,"Thank you for this upload. Will attempt on Lenovo T400 (Dual Core T9400 @ 2.53 GHz) with 4 G RAM. My best machine I can test this on is only an Intel Quad Q6600 with 4G RAM.

Does anyone know if either of these machines is possibly OK for this install? (I can put whatever version of windows you want on any of them)"
,georgecle,2011-11-20T14:29Z,I have update to Vmware 8.0.1-528992 and after running the unlocker the virtual machine with lion 7.02 does not work anymore. We need a new unlocker for 8.0.1!!!!
,ata01,2011-12-13T13:02Z,"I've been using it on VMware 8 for a couple of days now and while it's running looks like it's working properly, so thanks for that. However I have one annoying problem. Whenever I stop or pause the machine and try to run it again it reboots my PC. After reboot I can run it again, but then if I stop and try to run it I get another reboot. Do you know how I can fix this issue? I'm using Vista Ultimate 64 SP2 on Intel C2D E8400 with 4GB RAM."
,Urrr,2012-01-02T20:43Z,"Works great. Thanks a lot!
BTW, the guest unlocker for vmware workstation windows 7 also worked for my vmware workstation windows 8.0.1. The one unlocker provided for the 8.x version did not work - it is probably writen to work with another version/build of the workstation 8.

Cheers!!
Urrr "
,Urrr,2012-01-02T20:48Z,"Does anyone know how to trick Final-Cut to work on  the mac OS X VM?

During install, it requires minimum of 128MB VRAM and Graphics support for ""crystalize"" or something like that. "
,Darkcyder,2012-01-12T03:27Z,"I also have issues with the mouse lockiing up while resizing windows and randomly left click stops working completely. Any fix for this yet? Other than that great release. VMware Workstation 7.1.3, Windows 7 Ultimate 64Bit on a Core i5, 8 Gb of Ram."
,dolcaer,2012-01-28T10:42Z,Will this work on VMWare for linux?
,IiTzShAnE,2012-02-03T15:45Z,Thanks for this =]
,dvdm,2012-02-15T13:06Z,Also having issues with the mouse after a while. Only way to fix this is to restart the VM. Any fixes?
,camorista,2012-02-29T08:55Z,"Hey, on YouTube it says ""Video is private""...wtf man?"
,billozy,2012-03-11T12:35Z,"I just downloaded the file but when i try to unzip it I get errors, tried winrar and 7zip but still not working... what could possibly damage the file?"
,kinabr,2012-03-28T23:41Z,"@Urrr

Works on VMware Workstation 8.0.2, only, I think"
