"Silk follows a group of barristers from a chambers in London. The series' main focus is on Martha Costello (Maxine Peake) and her ambition to become Queen's Counsel as well as on her rival, Clive Reader (Rupert Penry-Jones), and the chambers' two new pupils, Niamh Cranitch (Natalie Dormer) and Nick Slade (Tom Hughes). The chambers' senior clerk, Billy Lamb (Neil Stuke), also features heavily.

The series' writer, Peter Moffat, also wrote the series Criminal Justice and North Square, as well as an episode of Kavanagh QC. Before the series started, Moffat said in an interview,"I wanted Silk to be full of politics and intrigue. From my [Moffat's] experience at the Bar, I felt life in chambers had all of those components, with big stories and lots of courtroom dramaâ€”but I wanted to make it as much about barristers and their life in chambers as about the trials"
