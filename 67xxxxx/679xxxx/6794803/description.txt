This outstanding show gives us the rare opportunity to not only listen to one of the most important and influential tenor saxophonists in jazz: Ben Webster, but to see him in performance, exquisitely backed by the Oscar Peterson Trio. This performance marks their final collaboration (and their only known recording together after 1959), as Ben died less than a year later, on September 20, 1973.

NOTE: Although German TV recorded  a further 3 tracks, they were not filmed, as the original broadcast was shorter than the actual concert. [. Ben\'s Blues, . In a Mellow Tone, . Autumn Leaves] 

Ben Webster (ts), Oscar Peterson (p), Niels Henning Ã˜rsted-Pedersen (b), Tony Inzalaco (dr).
