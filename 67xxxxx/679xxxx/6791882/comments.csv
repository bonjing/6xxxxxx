,jvi3ortiz,2011-11-07T14:52Z,why does abgx say it doesnt recognize game as xbox360 game or stealth file???????? please repy
,auroken,2011-11-08T07:49Z,"@jvi3ortiz

abgx doesnt support games using the XGD3 security protections, you will have to wait for that functionality. as others have said tho this game requires LT+ 2.0"
