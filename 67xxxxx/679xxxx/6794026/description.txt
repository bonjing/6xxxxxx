TurboGrafx-16, fully titled as TurboGrafx-16 Entertainment SuperSystem and known 
in Japan as the PC Engine, is a video game console developed by Hudson Soft and 
NEC, released in Japan on October 30, 1987, and in North America on August 29, 
1989.

The TurboGrafx-16 has an 8-bit CPU and a dual 16-bit GPU; and is capable of 
displaying 482 colors simultaneously, out of 512. With dimensions of 14 cm Ã— 14 
cm Ã— 3.8 cm (5.5in Ã— 5.5in Ã— 1.5in), the NEC PC Engine holds the record for the 
world's smallest game console ever made. (Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition 
(2008))

In the United Kingdom, Telegames released a slightly altered version of the US 
model simply as the TurboGrafx around 1990 in extremely limited quantities. 
Although there was no full-scale PAL region release of the system, imported PC 
Engine consoles were largely available in France and Benelux through major 
retailers thanks to the unlicensed importer Sodipeng (SociÃ©tÃ© de Distribution de 
la PC Engine, a subsidiary of Guillemot International).

In 2009, the TurboGrafx-16 was ranked as the 13th greatest video game console of 
all time by IGN.



Turbo Engine is a PC Engine/Turbo Grafx 16, SuperGrafx and CDROM2 / Super CDROM2 
emulator for Windows. Turbo Engine 16 was developed with an emphasis on 
accuracy. The system requirements for Turbo Engine 16 are a bit steeper than 
some of the other emulators. The author recommends a minimum of a 2.2GHz Pentium 
4. Turbo Engine shares the same plugin system as the Genesis emulator Kega 
Fusion so it can use any Kega Fusion compatible video plugins.
