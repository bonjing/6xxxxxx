,george1052,2011-11-04T23:00Z,Thanks subha1561! I noticed at the beginning (2 minutes) that there's a couple of places that skip. Nothing major. I was just curious if this goes on throughout the movie? I really want to see this but will wait on a better copy if the skipping goes throughout the movie. Thanks again!

Did you fail at finger painting?
