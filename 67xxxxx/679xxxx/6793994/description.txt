"The Memories in the Shallow Grave"

When the Jeffersonian team identifies 
the remains of a woman found in a 
paintball field, they discover two 
missing-persons reports in her file. 
Booth and Sweets interrogate the 
victim's husband and learn that she 
suffered from amnesia. When squint 
Wendell Bray learns that the victim 
also survived a bullet wound, 
inconsistencies in her medical 
records uncover a surprising crime 
linked to her murder. Meanwhile, 
Brennan and Booth adjust to their 
new life as an expectant couple and 
deal with the forthcoming changes 
in their home life.
