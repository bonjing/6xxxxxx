Judas Priest
Stockholm, Sweden
1/21/1984
Isstadion

A fantastic sounding, evidently low-gen show taped very early on during the Defenders Of The Faith Tour. Defenders had only been out for less than 3 weeks and Rob and Company only play 1 song from it. Great show, great performance and great sound.

Received via a snail mail trade many moons ago â€¦ donâ€™t know how rare this is or if it has been upped before. If so, I apologize, if notâ€¦

Enjoy!!
