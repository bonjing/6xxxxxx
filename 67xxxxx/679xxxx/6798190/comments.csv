,jersson,2011-11-06T01:46Z,Works very good. Thank You
[V],AlbaGuBrath,2011-11-06T02:10Z,It sure does :) Thanks for the positive comment Jersson!!
,Blickity,2011-11-07T21:50Z,This doesn't work because I can't seem to take the read only attribute off the folder.  How about you just put the cracked files in a folder so we can install them manually rather than use that program that doesn't work?
,johnny5a,2011-11-09T16:28Z,"Possible Trojan attached.

Norton removed the nitro.pdf.6.x.+.7.x-patch.deepzero.exe patch program because it said a Trojan.Gen.2 was attached.

Trojan.Gen.2 is a generic detection for many individual but varied Trojans for which specific definitions have not been created. A generic detection is used because it protects against many Trojans that share similar characteristics. 

Trojan horse programs pose as legitimate programs or files that users may recognize and want to use. They rely on this trick to lure a user into inadvertently running the Trojan. Often a Trojan will mimic a well known legitimate file name or pose as a particular type of file, like a .jpg or .doc file to trick a user."
[V],AlbaGuBrath,2011-11-11T17:15Z,"@ johnny5a There are no trojans or viruses or anything attatched, this is clean and working, 

Enjoy!!

,jersson,2011-11-22T00:38Z,"For all you guy's out there. This is clean and works like a charm. All keygen, patches and cracks are concidered as a virus by virusprograms but that's false positive. I've been using this for a long time and it's a great upload. This guy is REALLY SERIOUS SO STOP THE WINING"
