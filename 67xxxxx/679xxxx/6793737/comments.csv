,bitzer00,2011-11-06T00:59Z,"Downloading at 13 kb/s, kinda slow. but anyways i have the same question as the fellow mike, will i be able to play co-op with this when it is finally downloaded?"
,Aredyn,2011-11-07T07:39Z,"@Mackey18 You can play ""online"" with Tunngle.
And btw don't believe the dumb reviewers, this game is effing epic, and co op with 2 others makes it even more.
Graphics are par with Dragon Age 2 I'll say."
,km1luci,2011-11-08T01:50Z,seeed plssss in plm.
,dreadzzz,2011-11-08T11:58Z,Virus inside Kaspersky didnt even allowed the full download.....
,MicroBalls,2011-11-08T16:36Z,"@dreadzzz

Relax, Kaspersky acts like a freeware suit, get F-Secure Internet Security instead they are lightyears ahead of Kaspersky and often the first to update definitions."
,VisExp84,2011-11-08T21:54Z,"Works perfectly for PVE at least.

,Buzz_Meeks,2011-11-09T09:59Z,For me it looks as if the lights and graphics are all screwed up. There are no shadows at all .... is that a game option thing or id the dl just missing thge files?
,woutmoe,2011-11-09T12:49Z,"Torrent stopped at 63.1%. It said that there was a file missing. Does anyone know what to do?
"
,BLACKASS2,2011-11-09T12:54Z,HMM SO tell me how to install .(make it simple please pretty much of a noob here)
,sujeet25,2011-11-09T15:28Z,can i play as single player
,groovdog,2011-11-09T17:48Z,"@woutmoe, force a recheck, turn off the appropriate parts of your virus protection and start the DL back up. I had to do it twice and separately download the offending file (the executable to run). Little nervous about the detection given its the first one I have ever gotten but if Bone says its clean I bet it is."
,woutmoe,2011-11-09T20:14Z,The witn.exe file is removed in the attached map. So I cant copypaste and overwrite it. What am I supposed to do? Is there a crack that will help or do I have to download it again?
,woutmoe,2011-11-09T20:19Z,And I already turned off my virusprotection before I started the download
,woutmoe,2011-11-09T20:26Z,attached file=crack file
,groovdog,2011-11-10T02:33Z,"If the only file you are missing is the executable due to the false virus reading then just shut off your AV and download it separate (its faster to do the graphics only crack). Be specific (AV software and exactly what happened, is it your dl or is the file getting deleted everytime you extract it or run it?) and maybe someone can help if this doesnt solve your problem."
,groovdog,2011-11-10T02:39Z,"On a side note, anyone having an issue with the attack where you defend the dwarves? My mouse just basically stops working. Exit the program give it 15 secs and its fine again. Running i7, with GT-330M (1GB graphics card) and 8GB of RAM. It is a laptop but this is the only program this happens with including basically ever shooter including crap out this month (BF3 etc.)"
,BLACKASS2,2011-11-10T09:22Z,omg no1 ever bothers to tell me how to install
,Hokrollo,2011-11-10T14:17Z,"Really crappy game. Not worth downloading, however thanks as always .BONE."
,RaW-D-Coy,2011-11-10T15:49Z,"i really love the GFW games but when u buy it from steam GFW doesn't come with it and u can't get xbox achievements =,("
