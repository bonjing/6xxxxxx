19 songs, 28 performances, 72 minutes of live Clash footage !

Filmed as a fictional documentary, Rude Boy the movie follows punk Ray ( Ray Grange ) as he quits his job in a West End sex shop to become a roadie for the most exciting live band in the country - The Clash.

Capturing The Clash during their 'Clash on patrol' & 'Sort it out' UK tours of 1978, Rude Boy is an unparalleled film document of one of the best live bands ever to take a stage.

Follow the band as they tour the length and breadth of the country and headline the legendary 'Rock against racism carnival' in Victoria Park, London. Gain exclusive access to the rehearsal rooms and recording studio, as they lay down tracks to their second album 'Give 'Em enough rope'.

Set against the backdrop of late 70's Britain, Rude Boy is a unique piece of film making and is by far the best document of music and attitude of the times.
Rude : Simple, unsophisticated, uncivilisised, uneducated.
