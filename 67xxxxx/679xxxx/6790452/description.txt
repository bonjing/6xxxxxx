An alien spacecraft and its pilot are attacked in deep space by an Antebios, a supposedly extinct predator that can exist in the vacuum of space.

The explorer immediately sends a distress call, but must stay alive for six hours until help can arrive. Knowing that he has mere minutes until his ship's hull is breached, he purposely crash lands on the nearest planet in hopes of temporarily dazing the creature.

He is reminded by his superior officer before entering the atmosphere that the law must be upheld at any cost. If contact is made with any pre-stellar lifeforms, those lifeforms must be terminated. No exceptions.
