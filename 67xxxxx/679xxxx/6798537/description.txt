::Plot::
London architect Martin Kennedy (Cillian Murphy) and his journalist wife Kate (Thandie Newton) often visit a small, remote and uninhabited island off the west coast of Scotland, Blackholme Island, for their holiday retreats. Fairweather Cottage, the only dwelling on Blackholme Island, is seasonally operated by the owner Doug from the mainland and only reachable by ferry across freezing water. After Kate suffers a miscarriage, her relationship with Martin becomes tense and begins to suffer, and in an effort to rekindle their marriage the couple decide to stay on the island one last time. A few nights into their last retreat, the generator in the cottage explodes, burning Martin's arm and leaving the couple without electricity or a phone. The Kennedys use the CB radio to call Doug on the mainland, who agrees to ferry out to help them.
