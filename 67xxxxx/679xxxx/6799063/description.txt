Symphony - 1. Genesis and Genius
	
Simon Russell Beale presents a radical reappraisal of the place of the symphony in the modern world and explores the surprising way in which it has shaped our history and identity.   The first episode begins amidst the turmoil of the French Revolution with the arrival in England of Joseph Haydn, dubbed the Father of the Symphony. It continues with Mozart, the genius who wrote his first symphony at the age of eight, and Beethoven, the revolutionary who created the idea of the artist as hero and whose Eroica Symphony changed music for ever.   The music is performed by the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, conducted by Sir Mark Elder.
