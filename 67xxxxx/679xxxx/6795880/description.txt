Have.I.Got.News.For.You.S42E04.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 107MB]

[/b][/color] Based on the weeks news, Have I Got News For You is fronted by guest hosts and features two regular team captains, Paul Merton and Ian Hislop.
Each week the show invites two guests to cast a jaundiced eye over the weeks news, resulting in a fast flow of anarchic, spontaneous and hugely entertaining wit and humour.
 Guests typically represent the world of politics, comedy, show-business and journalism, and are often themselves particularly newsworthy participants.
The final touches of Have I Got News For You are put together only hours before recording, allowing guests to comment on the late-breaking news stories of the day.
