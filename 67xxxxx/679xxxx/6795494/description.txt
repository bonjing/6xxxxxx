Integrating PHP Projects with Jenkins


Todays web applications require frequent updates, not just by adding or upgrading features, but by maintaining and improving the softwareâ€™s existing code base as well. This concise book shows PHP developers how to use Jenkins, the popular continuous integration server, to monitor various aspects of software quality throughout a projects lifecycle.

Youll learn how to implement continuous integration to automate processes for building and deploying regular software releases. The book also shows you how to use Jenkins to monitor and improve your application through continuous inspection. Youll come to understand why reducing complexity and eliminating duplicate code is just as important as introducing new functionality.
