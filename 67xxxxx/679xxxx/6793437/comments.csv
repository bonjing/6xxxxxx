When it's done installing and such, activate trial mode. Go to enter key, and unplug your ethernet/disable wireless. Enter ""T1JVS-NNMBD-K1QTN-SUBP8"" and click next. It will tell you it's wrong, and at the bottem there is a browse section. Click it and find the torrent. Open the KIS 2011-2012 and click the first one. You now have 91 days, so plug your internet back in."
