Release Notes:

Glasgow folk-band Kassidy have released various EPs over the past three
years, but now they have released their first full album, Hope St. and
as the title of the album suggests, if this record is anything to go
by, these guys have a very hopeful career in front them indeed.

Fans of the recent Brit-winners Mumford and Sons should rejoice because
they have a new band to add to their favourites. Kassidy combines
traditional folk with a striking contemporary edge to create something
truly spectacular. The record kicks off in a flamboyantly loud fashion
with Stray Cat; a precursor of what one should expect for the rest of
the LP. Anthemic and powerful, the complexities of the production on
this track are visible. And this is obviously not forgetting the chants
that will stick in your head for hours. The hits keep coming with I
Don't Know, an indie-americana track that has a very unusually
commercial edge to it. Soothing the psyche, this is sure to do
amazingly well across the boards. Aligning themselves with the Kings of
Leon, The Lost is a steeplechase ride into folk touching on grungy
rock. Again using folk traditions but adding a modern twist, makes this
a catchy track that not only captures your attention directly but
probably is one of the best tracks on the record.

However, it is not all upbeat and boyant. That Old Song, a track that
sounds like something from a Jimmy Cash back-catalogue, exemplifies
sedated folk that is haunting and moody - even up to the final tragic
notes that linger on. Even Waking Up Sideways, as its title suggests,
has a hung-over and comatose feeling that allows it to stand apart from
its peers. Similarly, Take Another Ride follows this poignant sound
that Kassidy are attempting to achieve; this hippy track is sure to go
down amazingly well in the summer festivals to come. Adding a level of
intricacy to their music, Kassidy are able to combine beautifully
produced music with a sense of real longing or emotional fulfilment.
The album's title track captivates the senses with a real emotive and
touching pull. It's only regretful that the track doesn't last for
long.

The only problem that lies with this record is the lack of a huge
amount of new material. Consisting essentially of a collection of the
three EPs previously released, it probably would have been nicer to see
a larger variety of new material present on the record. But for new
emerging fans, this really is the best of the best for Kassidy. Every
track sounds different from the other, and you never reach the feeling
of de-ja-vu on this record. Creating unique and enchanting music, this
may signify the birth of Kassidy as a force to be reckoned with.
