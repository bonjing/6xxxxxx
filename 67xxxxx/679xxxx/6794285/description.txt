Revoker - Revenge For The Ruthless

"Thereâ€™s no detection in Revokerâ€™s aggressive metal assault that they hail from the Welsh valleys as their debut record fits easily into an established metal genre which is crossing over into the mainstream heartbeat of the radio waves, whether you like it or not. â€˜Psychovilleâ€™ and â€˜Stay Downâ€™ are full of the blood-pumping energy of youth which haemorrhages throughout â€˜Revenge For The Ruthlessâ€™, drawing clear comparisons with their fellow countrymen Bullet For My Valentine. Tracks such as â€˜Not Be Movedâ€™ will allow Revoker to be at the forefront of the UK metal scene for many years to come."
