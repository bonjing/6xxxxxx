Do you need a RECHARGE?
Most people do. Even the most talented people get bogged down every now and again.

Recharge will revitalise your entire approach to business. Each of the 52 performance-enhancing lessons is designed to be read, absorbed and acted on in 60 minutes or less: from your management style to your financial decision-making to self-motivation. Inside you'll find jargon-free information that will help you achieve many of the things you have been putting off for months, or even years.

â€¢ Get you over a hump
â€¢ Get through an issue
â€¢ Get fired up
â€¢ Get into action!
