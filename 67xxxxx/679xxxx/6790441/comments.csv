,synchronicityii,2011-11-05T10:57Z,"What the hell is your problem man? Who the hell writes the score of the game in the damn title of the post?!?! Plus, exactly when the score is scored and by whom!

Where's the fun in watching a game when you already know the outcome?! I'm not keeping this for my damn archives. I'm downloading this because I don't have access to it in my country.

Thanks from me and from everyone else you ruined the game for who happened to have searched for the game, asshole!"
