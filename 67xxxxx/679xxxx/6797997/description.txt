10 10 "Sight Beyond Sight"   November 4, 2011 (2011-11-04) 

While driving through the desert, Panthro tells Lion-O that the Book of Omens has 
detected one of the three magical stones. During a race between the Thunder Tank, 
Lion-O, Tygra, and Cheetara, Wilykit and Wilykat accidentally sets off the missiles 
which they evade. Upon arriving outside a giant temple, the ThunderCats end up 
meeting a group of Elephants led by Ahbern and Ahnet where they ask where the magical 
stone is. Under the suggestion of Ahnet, Lion-O ends up using the Sword of Omens' 
power and is told that he must be in harmony with the Sword of Omens. During the training, 
the Elephants' village are attacked by the insect-like Wraiths who are after their harvest. 
Following the Wraiths attack, Ahnet states that they have some food left to harvest. 
Ahnet tells Lion-O to be in harmony with the Sword of Omens are Lion-O vows to get 
the stolen harvest back. When Wilykit is playing her flute, Ahbern and Wilykat end up 
joining in on her performance which attracts the attention of the other Elephants who 
join in as well. Meanwhile, Lion-O climbs up a cliff leading to the Wraith's lair and 
loses his grip when they attack. Luckily, Lion-O uses his Claw to grip onto the side 
of the cliff as the Wraiths swarm all over him. Lion-O dives into a hole in a cliff 
and ends up discovering that the hole is actually their hive. Upon getting out, 
Lion-O uses the Sword of Omens to seal the cave in order to keep them out. 
Just then, a Stone Giant awakens and finds some dead Wraiths. Later that night, 
Lion-O returns and learns from Ahnet that the "universe is out of tune" and that 
their sounds is what kept the Stone Giant awake. While the Elephants meditate, 
the ThunderCats do battle with the Stone Giant where they discover that every 
attack they do on it, the Stone Giant reassembles. Upon trapping the ThunderCats 
in a trap, the Stone Giant attacks the Elephants' village and starts eating their 
village. Wilykit and the Elephants end up playing some music loud enough for 
the Stone Giant to crumble. As the Elephants rebuild their village, Ahnet puts 
Lion-O through his harmony training again and is able to use the Sword of Omens' 
power to find one of the magical stones in a nearby hut through. When the magical 
stone isn't seen there, Ahnet tells the ThunderCats to go to the Forest of 
Magi Oar in order to amplify the Sword of Omens' power.
