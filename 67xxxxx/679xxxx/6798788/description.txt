Back of 4-DVD box set:

Stephen King Presents Kingdom Hospital is the
haunting new 15-hour drama series developed
directly for television by the award-winning,
best-selling master of horror. Using Lars Von
Trier's Danish miniseries "Riget" (a.k.a. "The
Kingdom") as a point of inspiration, King tells
the terrifying story of The Kingdom, a hospital
with a bizarre population that includes a nearly
blind security guard, a nurse who regularly
faints at the sight of blood and a paraplegic
artist whose recovery is a step beyond miraculous.
When patients and staff hear the tortured voice of
a little girl crying through the halls, they are
dismissive of any suggestion of mysticism or
unseen powers...but at their own peril.
