Vampire Diaries novels on which the show is based predate Twilight as a franchise by over ten years. If anything, Twilight is a copy of it. No denying that the popularity of Twlight got Vampire Diaries show made, though."

,legna69,2012-01-22T15:48Z,sorry but why did it stuck? 
,Sateda89,2012-04-14T22:41Z,"I can't believe people are saying that the Vampire Diaries, is a copy of the Twilight saga, I mean you do know that the books of the Vampire Diaries, written by L J Smith, were written in 1991-1992, and the twilight series was written in 2005-2008, so technically it's the other way around, if you want to talk about copying, not that I would, I watch the vampire diaries, twilight and true blood, and not one of the series is remotely like the other, which is what I love about them, they all have their own unique take on what a vampire should be like, I mean the one's in true blood have different things they can do as well, I mean Eric Northman can fly, and well Bill was supposed to be able to levitate, he could in the books, but they changed it, anyway it is in no way remotely the same, and if you want to get into it more, feel free to e-mail me: willowy2k@hotmail.com, or add me on msn!"
