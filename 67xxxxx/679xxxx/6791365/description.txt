The Hebrew Hammer (2003) is a made-for-tv film by Comedy Central. Very amusing. Offends nearly everyone, except maybe Hispanics. See http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317640/ 

Ripped from DVD using Handbrake, optimized for viewing on HD telly with AppleTV. I had to bump the audio quality down a bit to keep it in sync with the video, alas.

The holidays are coming, even if Hannukah isn\\\'t one of the high holidays. Please enjoy this film, and make it part of your annual holiday traditions.
