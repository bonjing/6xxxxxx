Gary Lineker presents highlights of the day's seven Premier League matches. 
Champions Manchester United welcome Sunderland to Old Trafford on what is a 
special weekend for Red Devils boss Sir Alex Ferguson, as the legendary manager 
celebrates 25 trophy-laden years in charge of the club. United's cross-city rivals 
Manchester City travel to Queens Park Rangers for the evening kick-off. 
Robert Mancini's multi-million pound City squad have been scoring for fun this 
season with Sergio Aguero already looking like one of the buys of the season. 
Rangers themselves invested heavily at the end of the summer transfer window 
and one of those signings, Shaun Wright-Phillips, will feel like he has a point to 
prove against his former side. The day's other fixtures include 
Newcastle v Everton, Arsenal v West Brom and Blackburn v Chelsea.
