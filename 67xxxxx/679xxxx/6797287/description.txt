Mike Sullivanâ€™s time-tested approach focuses students on the fundamental skills they need for the course: preparing for class, practicing with homework, and reviewing the concepts. In the Ninth Edition, College Algebra has evolved to meet todayâ€™s course needs, building on these hallmarks by integrating projects and other interactive learning tools for use in the classroom or online.
