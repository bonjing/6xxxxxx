[T],drock232,2011-11-18T12:07Z,"I had some problems with my proxy for like a week but I have been uploading allll of my torrents for a week now help seed and this won't be a problem. Once again I'm sorry that I wasn't seeding for like a week but, I will be seeding everyday and night until all my torrents are at 100%. I only upload a torrent now and then NOW cuz I have blockbuster online so when I get a new movie I rip it and upload it but, that doesn't mean I'm not seeding my current torrents."
