,wootle01,2011-11-12T10:23Z,Brilliant!
,useitright,2011-11-15T11:35Z,"The movie is actually quite boring up until the very end when the overwhelming anticipation gets the best of you.  Keifer Sutherland has a small part in the movie, and he is one of the better actors out there.  As for Kirsten Dunst, she has always had a rocking body and is not afraid to show it on this film.  Desperate nudity to draw your eyes to the screen of a very slow paced film??  I will let you decide. A/V-10---M-4"
,h-cat,2011-11-17T17:12Z,Don't watch this.You will stop before the end.I haven't seen a crap! like this for about 6 years.Do not waste your time

This movie was awful. I watched the whole thing. Don't waste your time. "
,yotonybo,2012-01-23T13:57Z,"I logged on as a member of the Bay specifically so I could defend this film. I think people that are most used to Hollywood films will not have the capacity to understand it. European film is often much more demanding to understand. Look up the film on Wikipedia to get an understanding of the slightly eccentric plot - follow the links to 'Tristran and Isolda' to understand how the story links into this classic Wagner opera. Go to you tube to hear the prelude to the opera (how it is unresolved) and then listen to the 'death of isolde' to hear how the music resolves at the very end of the opera and get an idea of how the deaths of Wagner's characters link into the death of the planets in the film - and to the death of Justine's depression in the film. That death is the only way that Wagner believed love can be concreted and concecrated. The planets seem to kiss as they destroy each other. Believe me with some effort this film is really beautiful and deep... The accents are American, but only because these substantial actors have such faith in an amazing European (Danish) director... an for good reason... Science fiction at it's very best..."
,mister-csh,2012-01-29T04:24Z,wish I listend to the comments. Thanks for the upload Extremezone.....great quality but awfull movie

Dude, don't worry.  Whenever a film get's bad reviews on Pirates Bay, I know there's a 50% chance it's brilliant.   My theoretical explanation for this is that so many of these pirates are tweens with the attention span of a gnat, and not enough experience of life to understand an adult movie.

I appreciate A/V quality comments here, but for movie ratings I look to IMDB..."
,sbizznet,2012-04-19T06:57Z,"Lars Von Trier has a different way of telling a story.
The look and feel of the movie are pretty bleak, and slow.
I highly recommend skipping this movie if you have short attention span, or if you're American."
,Boneybones,2012-04-27T04:31Z,"I'm American, and I really much enjoyed this film.
It's certainly not for everyone. 

But really, TPB has never been a trustworthy source for movie ""reviews""."
