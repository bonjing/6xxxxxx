Big Score is based around a classic story of police vs. criminals in a fight for a big score. The fantastic action will leave you breathless and will pump-up your adrenaline while you are rescuing your ball, trying to hit that last glowing target.

Big Score can be played by four players, where you will be able to steal points and achievements from your playing partners.

You will have to: risk a lot, airball a lot, save balls from jail, rush them across the bridge, break the safe code, play video modes, be precise and be quick if you plan to reach the final score.

12 modes and 8 mini-modes will guide you through the intense story where you will prepare, practice, steal, fight, chase, break-in, arrest, run and finally try to make your one chance for a Big Score.

The portrait mode is for true pinball fans. You can rotate your display, especially if you have 16:9 large LCD TV screen, playing SlamIt like no other game ever! It will look like you have a pinball machine in your home.
