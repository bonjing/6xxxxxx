Agents of Oblivion was an American alternative rock band from Louisiana that evolved from the ashes of Acid Bath. Fronted by Dax Riggs, their sound encapsulated psychedelic rock and blues-rock elements creating swamp rock.


After Audie Pitre died, Dax Riggs decided to form a slower band. That was Daisyhead & The Mooncrickets. However it only laid out the basics of what was to come. Soon after Agents Of Oblivion was formed, the band including two former members of Acid Bath, Riggs and Mike Sanchez.

The band released one self-titled album in 2000 and then broke up soon after.[1] Riggs went on to form Deadboy and the Elephantmen with Chuck Pitre. Alex Bergeron, formerly of local Houma band SlowTheKnife, joined later and continued on with Rigg\'s post-Deadboy solo work.
