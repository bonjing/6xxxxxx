Film One - The Youth of Peter the Great (1981). 
The first part of the two films about the Russian Emperor Peter the Great, based upon the novel â€œPeter the Firstâ€ by Alexei Tolstoy. Combined in this two-series epic are the colorful personality of Peter, the ever interesting â€œfatal minutesâ€ of world history, the literary talent of â€œRed Countâ€ Alexei Tolstoy and the mastery of one of the best Soviet film directors â€“ Sergey Gerasimov.
The years of the tsarâ€™s adolescence and youth were permeated with deadly danger coming from some of the Boyars, the rebellious Streltsy and Tsarevna Sophia who aspired for power. But already at that early time Peter demonstrates a profound, bright intellect, a strong will and the sense of purpose, which help him disarm both his open and secret enemies.

The second film - At the Beginning of Glorious Days (1987)
