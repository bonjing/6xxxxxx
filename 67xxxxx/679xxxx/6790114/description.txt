Here is the beloved DVD Shrink 3.2..THIS IS FREEWARE. I was on other torrents how people couldn't find this so I did the work for them. Just use WINRAR to extract this then run the setup. I take no credit for this program all i did was upload it here. Be warned this will not work on alot of newer dvds but its perfect for most and simple to use. Also try out the DVD HD decrypter here on TPB..........

DVD Shrink is a versatile freeware tool for fitting a DVD-Video disc on a single DVDR disc. 

DVD Shrink is capable of both re-authoring and re-encoding the movie. It features an intuitive user interface which makes it easy to choose what to keep, and what to lose. 

DVD Shrinks allow the user to select compression level for each video track separately to obtain the desired disc size (which is usually below 4.38GB). The software is capable of producing either an ISO image of the ripped DVD, or a VIDEO_TS folder for further processing, viewing or burning. 


I THOUGHT I WOULD UPLOAD THIS , AS SOME PEOPLE HAVE TROUBLE FINDING STUFF.....

ENJOY & SEED 

MANY THANKS Stumpie1971
