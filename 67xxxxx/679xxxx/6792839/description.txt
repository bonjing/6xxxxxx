Here's our loud and rude friends from Georgia.  This is a rip of a VHS tape featuring 5 music videos as well as various backstage footage.

Most of these videos are already available (thanks 2nafish) except for "I Stand Alone" which I've pulled out into a separate file if that's all you're after.

I've included scans of the front/back covers for complete details.  Enjoy!

Technical: VHS tape is coded to a single file, DivX compatible, 640x480, about 1.5kbps, with MP3 audio.  The mastering of the tape was somewhat mysterious to me (not NTSC with 3:2 pulldown) so, I de-interlaced it as best as I could but, the resulting product won't win any awards for clarity.  Still, it's watchable.

File plays fine in mPlayer, DivX Player, Windows Media Player (with DivX codec), etc.
