,kokabiradar,2011-11-07T23:22Z,This Kaos is one big motherfucker...All his uploads are shitty...He will never rip games like Bf3 & Rage...He fucked up Tintin....he fucked up this game also...he deserves an iron rod right inside is asshole..bastard...
[V],gansuk,2011-11-08T12:50Z,"@Subzero! np lol, we barly ever check the comments on public trackers now for the same reasons.
@kokabiradar nothing wrong with this game, you probbly didnt install PhysX_9.09.0203 as required. so the issue is with you im afaid. and as for games like bf3 & rage we checked the games out but making a release of 11 or 8gig is far to big for a rip to us so we gave them a miss.
