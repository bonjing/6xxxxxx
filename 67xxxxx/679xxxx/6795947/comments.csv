Tol fod zeymah win kein meyz fundein

by his honour is sworn
to keep evil forever at bay
and the fiercest foes rout
when they hear triumph's shout

Dragonborn for your blessing we pray
and the scrolls have fortold
of black wings in the cold
that when brothers wage war come unfurled
Alduin bane of kings
ancient shadow unbound
with a hunger to swallow the world"

,Oldmander,2011-11-09T20:50Z,"There is an other lyrics for the song:

For the King, For The King,
For the sake of Skydrim!

For our land, For our home,
For the Hrothgar s blood!

For the nords, for the gods,
For the sole single son!

Dovahkiin, Our king
who ll dawn with fire!"
