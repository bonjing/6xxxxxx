,Ears14U,2012-03-13T20:45Z,"HEY GUY'S PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU READ THIS POST!!!!! YOU MOST LIKELY (WILL) HAVE CONTROLLER ISSUES, AND HERE IS THE REASON WHY. AFTER YOU INSTALL THE GAME, ""DO NOT"" RUN IT YET! MAKE SURE YOU GO INTO YOUR FIREWALL AND MAKE AN EXCEPTION FOR IT (NOT) TO ACCESS THE INTERNET!!!!! SEEMS IT GOES TO THE WEBSITE AND BLACKLISTS YOU, DISABLING EVERYTHING BUT ""KEYBOARD"" CONTROL. AND I DON'T THINK YOU WANT TO FLY THIS FUCKER WITH A KEYBOARD. IF YOU LIKE THIS GAME, BUY IT AFTER FLYING SINGLE PLAYER. PERSONALLY, THERE ARE MUCH MORE REALISTIC FLIGHT GAMES OUT THERE. THIS IS AN ARCADE ADAPTATION OF ""FLYING"". I HOPE THIS HELPS. IF YOU ALREADY LOST ""CONTROLLER"" CONTROL ALREADY? JUST DELETE AND REINSTALL IT. IT WORKS FINE AFTER YOU FOLLOW WHAT I'VE TOLD YOU EARLIER. HAVE FUN, YOU MAY NOT BE ALIVE TOMORROW!   OH, YES IT DOES WORK ON WIN 7 64 BIT BTW!"
