Picking up where the original Nightmare left off, Nancy has grown up and become a psychiatrist specializing in dream therapy.
She meets a group of children at a local hospital facing Freddy Krueger, the same demon she once encountered in her sleep.
One of them is Kristen, who has the power to draw other people into her dreams. Working with a male doctor assigned to the case,
