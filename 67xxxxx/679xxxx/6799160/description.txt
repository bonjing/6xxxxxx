RichFaces 4 is a component library for JavaServer Faces, and an advanced framework for easily integrating AJAX capabilities into business applications. It lets you quickly develop next-generation web applications based on JSF 2/Ajax.

In this definitive RichFaces 4 book, instead of using JBoss Tools, the author bases all examples on Maven so that any IDE can be usedâ€”whether it's NetBeans, Eclipse, JBoss or even Spring. 

Practical RichFaces also describes how to best take advantage of RichFacesâ€”the integration of the Ajax4jsf and RichFaces librariesâ€”to create flexible and powerful programs. Assuming some JSF background, it shows how you can radically reduce programming time and effort to create rich AJAX-based applications.
What youâ€™ll learn

    * How to build rich Internet applications with out-of-the-box RichFaces components
    * Best strategies for implementing Ajax applications using RichFaces
    * When best to use the two libraries
    * How to create new skins for your app in no time
    * How to create applications without needing to write any JavaScript code

    * Java developers with good JSF knowledge looking to build next-generation web applications using RichFaces
    * JavaServer Faces users
    * Java programmers wishing to add Ajax to their existing programs
