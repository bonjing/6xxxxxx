""Not bought from iTunes""

Just laughing at your allegations. You're deluded thinking you're the only one as an uploader that has an iTunes account.

Clearly it was purchased:

(1) Given source: http://itunes.apple.com/ie/album/sticks-stones/id474830660
(2) Know the exact file size when purchased

iTune Size
----------

Sticks & Stones (Including videos) : 187.3MB
Sticks & Stones (Not including videos) : 70MB"

""Just quit uploading my purchased stuff lol. ""

How could one upload your purchased stuff when you clearly haven't bought it yet nor uploaded at TPB, KAT or your blog?

Stop before you further embarrass yourself.

You really want your skull to be removed.

People are deluded thinking you're a nice person. Only a handful of uploaders, who's been here for a long time or a while truly knows how you behave. 

(1) You spam the shit out of people - creating new ways to ""Promote your torrents"". Matter fact, even your followers are doing the same, or could this just be you using a new alias? Users that you've spammed throughout your time include PrimE-RulZ, love555, jainmehu, stumpie1971. Many more but it's a long list. Of course you don't do this at KAT because you're scared to lose your SU (Super User) status.

c. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6778404/Wale_-_Ambition_%5B2011_Album%5D


(2) You're completely deluded thinking you're the only one as an uploader that has an iTunes account. Think again, there's many piraters who has an account.
