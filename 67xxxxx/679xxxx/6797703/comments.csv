,dude596,2011-11-17T07:00Z,AH! D: Why no seeding? I'm stuck at 99.8%
,Narok_Gull,2011-11-18T20:57Z,Have always been seeding however not all time. Will try to let this seeding for a while 24x7 but I beg for those that download it that seed it too after finish.
,shawnxx7,2011-12-08T04:45Z,"Um, dude, maybe it's the torrent itself cause I'm still stuck at 99.8%"
,jackaloperex,2011-12-12T02:05Z,Any chance you could upload this again unzipped? No one seems to be able to get past 99.8% and can't open .rar
,hpune,2011-12-13T08:22Z,Please seed .. stuck at 99.8%
,gundog48,2011-12-14T18:57Z,Reckon you could get any of Lady Starshine's stuff? http://www.ladystarshine.com/hypnosis/menu/home.htm
,Narok_Gull,2012-01-18T15:58Z,"Hmmm, I'm not sure I can. For one, TPB doesn't let me to edit or delete my files. Additionally, it's been long I stopped seeding this one. I dont even recall if it was just one file or what. So, I'd have to re-assemble it and start a new file/seed. Anyway, I'll have a look on it and see if I can do it."
,Narok_Gull,2012-01-19T14:42Z,"Hi guys! I had to re-upload it under a new name (sorry but I couldn't get to re-seed the same torrent). Please, re-seed it after download, my disk is too full and I can't keep the file for too long."
,Narok_Gull,2012-01-20T15:40Z,"I see that some people have already downloaded the new file I uploaded and are seeding it. Please, leave a feed back telling if that file is OK. This one is dead. Thanks."
,PSV18-06,2012-02-22T20:12Z,"Hello, Do you have Jennifer Exgirlfriend revenge? "
,ftvgirl,2012-04-30T18:01Z,"there's a load (notice the pun) of us leeching this, but no seeds. we're all stuck on about 99%. we'd all love it if someone could please seed. if not, let's just say your gonads will turn purple and fall off. HAND."
,Narok_Gull,2012-05-22T21:34Z,"To ftvgirl: Notice that this torrent was replaced by another one in my list, namely: ""Jennifer I - Retry"", as quoted in one of my previous posts. Unfortunately I can't get to delete this one.

To PSV18: Yes I have it. I'll probably be uploading new files as soon as I have some time ... and disk available. ;)"
