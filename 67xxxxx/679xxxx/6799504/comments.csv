,MirrodinX4,2011-12-16T21:55Z,@markus1983: You're supposed to play it on a little and in-ear headphones. If you play it on your PC yeah then the quality is bad.

,shaneliny,2012-02-24T19:57Z,"Could not get on Ipod. it should be 'MPEG-4 video file' but instead it is 'MPEG-4 Video File'.
WRONG FORMAT"
,shaneliny,2012-02-24T20:00Z,^^It should be 'MPEG-4 Video File' but instead is MPEG-4 File Format
,MirrodinX4,2012-05-01T12:19Z,Hmm weird that it doesn't work on an iPod. I didn't test it myself because I don't have an iPod but I got this season from a friend who said it worked on his iPod touch.
