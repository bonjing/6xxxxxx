,1gfhf,2011-11-05T11:06Z,"Also, you can download the demo from here: http://www.ableton.com/download-live-trial"
,dreiboy,2011-11-08T03:30Z,"I'm getting an invalid authorization for this computer message, what can I do to fix that?"
,eponym69,2011-11-09T23:11Z,BAD.  This is the Live 8.2.5 Crack.  If you apply this to 8.2.6 it becomes 8.2.5.  Why are there so many seeders for something that should be nuked?
,Xfaded22,2011-12-20T10:31Z,"I had 8.2 Suite installed, DL'ed Live 8.2.7 (Program only) from Ableton, installed the program (upgraded from 8.2), and then applied this .auz.  Works like a charm in W7 x64.  
@ eponym69 : This torrent is great and I posit that though it's titled 8.2.6 and contains an .auz that is for 8.2.5, if you install 8.2.7 you won't change any of the runtimes/dll's so it should operate as 8.2.7.  I am running an .alp (Isotonik 8) that requires 8.2.6 and it is running fine.
GOOD work anon, thanks!"
,djmidnites,2011-12-22T09:37Z,got the demo and downloaded the torrent. copied the exe to my ableton document folder. it keeps saying that the file doesnt compute with my computer. help please?
,stallionvik,2012-01-20T00:53Z,"I already had 8.2.6 Expired, so I downloaded 8.2.7 and downloaded the torrent. When I click the 'Live 8.2.6.auz' file, it says 'This authorisation on this computer is invalid'..any help please?"
,MeNu25,2012-02-01T04:08Z,GREAT JOB THANK YOU
