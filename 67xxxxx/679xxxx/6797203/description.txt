This is an excellent neo-noir crime film directed by Johnnie To.It is in in French but set in Hong Kong and Macau and it has some English dialogue.It has English subtitles for the French and Cantonese language.

It is very good quality from a DVD 5 (640 x 272) 5.1 channel avi and it comes in two parts.

Please comment on the quality annd let me know what you think of the film.Thanks.
