this is the theatrical release at 109mins, (that is on Bluray as well).. NOT the remastered special edition Director's cut that is 113mins long containing certain vital scenes deleted from the theatrical version.
The stated length of the movie/file is not accurate.
Disappointing, I had hoped it was the Director's edition. The Director's cut is only available on  standard DVD."
