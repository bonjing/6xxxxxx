
Thinkwell's Physics I is a calculus-based college-level physics course, intended for physics majors, as well as engineering and science students. It covers all of the topics found in the major Physics textbooks, so it's the perfect study aid. Watch Thinkwell videos for your assignments instead of using an old-fashioned textbook, and you'll show up for class fully prepared, which means better grades. Because Thinkwell Physics I is taught by the best Physics professors available, is available 24/7, and had one fixed price instead of an hourly rate, Thinkwell is much better than any tutor.
