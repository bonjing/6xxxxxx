"Treehouse"

Hanging out with Shorty (Chazz Palminteri) 
and his girlfriend, Darlene (Jennifer Tilly), 
makes Gloria envious of how much those two do 
as a couple, so she gives Jay an ultimatum to 
step it up for a night of salsa dancing or 
else. Meanwhile, Cameron take a bet a little 
too far when Mitchell and Crispin challenge 
him to get a hot girl's (Leslie Mann) number 
at the bar, and Phil builds a tree house for 
Luke, but ends up being the one to make a 
new friend (Kevin Hart).
