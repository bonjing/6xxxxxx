     Sam and Leo Cleary have grown up hating each other, and neither likes their 

juvenile delinquent kid brother, Douglas, to whom they've only recently been 

introduced. The sons share the same father, a womanizing drunk, but all have 

different mothers. Their father died a rich man and when they're brought together by 

their sister Nina to learn which of them will inherit the old man's fortune, they are 

handed an unpleasant surprise. A requirement of the will is that the three estranged 

siblings go into business together as bail bondsmen. Their first job is to bring in a 

parole violator who has left Leo with a $250,000 debt. Their search will take them 

into the mountains of Mexico where they encounter a drug lord and uncover a 

kidnapping plot, masterminded by an embittered entrepreneur that will endanger them 

all.
