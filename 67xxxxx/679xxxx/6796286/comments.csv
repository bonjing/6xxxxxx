,wfmu.org,2011-11-05T12:48Z,"thanks, really super to get the great Thom Hartmann and Randi Rhodes shows. i have the Android app, Tunein Radio, it can get the live strams of Randi and Thom, but i really need to time shift the shows. 

Hey, there is a video show that Thom does each day. i use BeyondPod Android app to get it each day. 

i think his radio shows are better, but you all should get the free video show to see it also.

I mistakenly uploaded test files I was messing around with from years ago and just forgot they were disposable files. I am going to upload a much better quality version as soon as TPB upload is functional again. Thanks."
