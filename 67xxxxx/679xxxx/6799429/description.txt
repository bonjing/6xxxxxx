The Asskickers, by Ago Games, is a new beat-â€™em-up with a retro feel that released this week. This is Ago Gamesâ€™ first release into the gaming world, and with it they hoped to bring back the feel of the classic beat-â€™em-up like River City Ransom or Renegade, but with a new thematic direction â€“ along with that classic arcade-style game play comes some comedy and an interesting story line.

The Asskickers is not without its faults, but as a first release I wasnâ€™t expecting perfection. Before we get into its problems letâ€™s take a look at some of the stuff that was enjoyable about this first outing.

This style of the beat-â€™em-up game is hardly seen anymore, especially when it comes to PC and Mac releases. I was reminded of some of the games I used to play at the arcade as a child, which IMHO is always a good thing; itâ€™s got classic cartoon-sounding punching, grunting, and kicking sounds as well as a fitting soundtrack that really adds to the whole throwback vibe AGO was going for. It also offers co-op mode that unlocks new dialogues as well as extra powerful dual attacks, which proved rather fun to test out.
