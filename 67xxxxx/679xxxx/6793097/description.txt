The landmark 1966-67 album by the Beach Boys, scrapped 45 years ago but now finally here for our listening pleasure.

This is the vinyl release of the album, recorded on first play (yes, the first time I played them out of the shrink wrap), giving you the crisp, clear sound that only mint vinyls will give you.

Recorded using Audacity from an AKAI AP-30 w/ diamond stylus, exported as FLAC @ 3000 kbps, 24 bit, 96 kHz.

Vinyl-exclusive bonus tracks included.
