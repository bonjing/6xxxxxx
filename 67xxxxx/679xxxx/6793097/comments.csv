If anything this is sub par;

24 bit x 96 kHz x 2 channels = 4608 kbps"
,lilduff90,2011-11-04T00:41Z,"hoaxse7en, remember that this is a mono release, only the D-side tracks are stereo.

cruzman, if you want your lossy mp3-shit, get a different torrent."
,hoaxse7en,2011-11-15T03:17Z,"lilduff90, you're right it is mono... sounds really good with this -  http://www.head-fi.org/t/447089/5-1-headphone-experience-foobar-configuration-for-all-stereo-music-files"
