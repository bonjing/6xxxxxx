,bewais,2012-03-29T19:22Z,"All beings are not equal; the true meaning of god is sovereign ruler (truly sovereign, uncontrolled ruler); and to worship means to accept at least as lord, if not also as king. Anyway, real worshipers of the supreme being that many people call Allah are hard to find, let alone muslims, real muslims; believe it or not, Allah is and remains Lord of humans, King of humans, God of human, as well as the Creator of humans, and the Life-Giver, and the Life-Taker; and please be very aware that true knowledge about Islam is in the Quran, a book which is often mistranslated by fake muslims, and a book which is often contradicted by Hadith.
