Islam Rising - Geert Wilders - A Warning to the West

Geert Wilders lives with a constant death threat over his head. Al-Qaeda has vowed to kill him. As a Dutch parliamentarian and outspoken critic of radical Islam, Mr. Wilders must travel with four bodyguards and sleep in a safe house, each and every night.

His short documentary film, Fitna (included in this DVD) set off a firestorm in the Middle East and Western Europe immediately upon its release. The controversial film showed how Islamic terrorists are following the literal dictations of the Quran. 

That message can be seen here in this DVD, with striking clarity in film, photographs and a special message from Geert Wilders himself, who came to America with an urgent and terrifying warning.
