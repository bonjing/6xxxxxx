This worked great on my phone. You can download the android-sdk tools if you don't have them and take advantage of the voodoo lagfree kernel if you root with the enclosed file."
,mobitzoo,2011-11-06T14:16Z,Another advantage to rooting using drhonk's method is that you can 'adb reboot recovery' into CWM and do a nandroid backup of your phone. Fantastic.
,r1chee,2011-11-10T21:52Z,I'm going to try to this out because after flashing over to gingerbread 2.3.6 and then rooting i no longer have a wifi signal but how do you change the root rom to drhonks kj1 kernel? so i can have wifi still
,mobitzoo,2011-11-11T00:53Z,@r1chee- Just follow the instructions that are on the last page of the PDF and you'll be fine. Please post your results.

Torrent includes odin, drivers, roms, and drhonk's root kernel with cwm. If you rooted with a different rom and lost your wifi try this one. It should get it back, worked for me."
