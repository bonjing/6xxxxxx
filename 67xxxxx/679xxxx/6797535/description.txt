This is everything that you need to flash the Samsung OEM 2.3.6 (Gingerbread) rom to your Samsung Galaxy S 4G

* I added instructions for flashing GB and rooting- including screen shots.
* I added 32 bit (along with 64-bit) Samsung drivers.
* Includes 2.3.5 and 2.3.6 Samsung Gingerbread roms
* I changes the root rom to drhonk's KJ1 kernel. This keeps the wifi working.

When I flash and root using the methods described in the PDF that is in the root directory of this torrent everything works, and works well.

If you have problems- backup tith Titanium Backup and do a wipe and restore before flashing GB and rooting.
