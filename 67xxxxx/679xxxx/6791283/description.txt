Requirements: Android 2.2+
Overview: The first console-quality water racing game for mobile, exclusively for Tegra.


Riptide GP is the first ever console-quality water racing game for mobile, created by Vector Unit, the developers of Xbox 360 hit Hydro Thunder Hurricane.
Rev up your supercharged jet ski and take a wild ride through twisting canals and rivers, futuristic cityscapes, and mysterious research facilities. Skill, stunts, and speed will be your best allies as you grab massive air off huge waves, kick out death-defying tricks, and boost your jet ski to victory across a dynamic, ever-changing torrent of foam and spray.

NEW: RIPTIDE GOES WIDE!
We now support many Android devices, including the Galaxy S, Nexus S, Droid X, Xperia Play, and many more.
Please note that Riptide GP is a processor intensive game. We strongly encourage you to try the game immediately after buying to test compatibility with your device.
