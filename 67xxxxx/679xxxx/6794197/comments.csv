,marios127,2012-03-18T21:44Z,"Guys, just i case you didn't know.(I'm telling you this, because I had that stupid problem xD) Well, if you have in your computers the original NCSoft Launcher... (Simply open the original launcher and at the right top of the laucher press ""File"" and the press ""Exit""... More simply, open the original launcher and press Ctrl + X) Once you have close the original launcher, go to the file you downloaded from bns.atomixro.com (Custom Launcher) and open the file named NCLauncher... right click on Blade & Soul, select properties and browse the Client of the game in the directory you saved it for example : Program Files/NCSoft/Blade & Soul/bin/Client and then press OK...When you press OK, press update, let the update complete... Once the update is completed an error will show up (maybe not) nut just ignore it, it will just say ""error during last operation"". (but it's ok :D) Right click after that on Blade & Soul (I speak for the window of the Custom Launcher just in case you didn't understand :D) and select ""Force Play Without Updating""... If you didn't create account, go to bns.atomixro.com and press Register an account. Once you created your account open the game window and put the username you registered and the password... Have a nice game guys... :)"
