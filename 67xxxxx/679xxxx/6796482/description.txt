This is the short story that was removed from The Matrix website very early on in the life of the The Matrix web comics series in both pdf format and also in the original jpg format.

The Matrix collection of fictional works includes the trilogy of movies, anime videos and web comics as well as the video games which include The Matrix Online AKA MxO a (discontinued) MMORPG. The interesting thing about all of these works is that each one contributes to the storyline of The Matrix universe. For example, the games include movie footage filling in parts of the storyline or continuation of the story.
