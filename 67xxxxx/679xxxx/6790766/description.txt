In the original text that I had downloaded elsewhere in PiratBay, all the lettercombinations 'fi' and 'fl' were removed.
So the word 'definition' became 'denition', and 'five' became 've'.
I've done my best to put everywhere in the text the letters 'fi' and 'fl' back where they belonged.
I guess I've missed some occurences, but most of the text is recovered.
