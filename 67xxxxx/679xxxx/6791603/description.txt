"The Rematch"

Harry and Adam defend former prosecutor 
Josh "Puck" Peyton, who stands accused of 
aiding and abetting a kidnapper; Peyton 
successfully negotiated her safe return, 
but did so behind the back of the FBI. The 
case brings Harry into a fierce rematch 
with D.A. Roseanna Remmick who is back 
with a vengeance and determined to outdo 
Harry and put Puck in prison. Elsewhere, 
Tommy ropes Cassie into an ethically 
questionable divorce proceeding involving 
his oldest clients.

Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
