China Mieville's Embassytown
Embassytown takes place in the title city, on the far-off planet Arieka. Immerser Avice Benner Cho has returned to her childhood home, from her adventures in the Out. It is a planet on which humans and â€œexotsâ€ co-exist with the indigenous, enigmatic Ariekei â€” otherwise known as the Hosts. Few people can speak the language of the Hosts; those who can are genetically-engineered linguists known as Ambassadors. The relationship between humans and Ariekei has proceeded in relative tranquility for many years. Then one day a new, utterly unexpected Ambassador arrives and the delicate diplomatic balance is tipped towards war.
