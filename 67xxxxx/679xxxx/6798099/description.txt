Following his student misadventures in "Doctor in the House" (1969), Michael Upton (Barry Evans) starts out on an equally fun-filled but disaster-prone solo career. He moves through a variety of jobs in general practice, including one with Dr. Maxwell (Arthur Lowe), before returning to St. Swithin's Hospital as a junior registrar.
