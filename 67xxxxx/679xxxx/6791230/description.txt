During the latter half of 1888 a notorious serial killer nicknamed Jack The Ripper terrorises the East End of London by murdering prostitutes in a terribly violent way. Public outrage follows.

Inspector Frederick Abberline is assigned to the case but finds that it is not just a simple murder enquiry. Based on a real life event, this film claims to have had access to top secret Home Office files and believe that their ending is the correct solution to the age old mystery.
