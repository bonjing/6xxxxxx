,Gliktch,2011-11-06T03:02Z,"It seems a bit unusual that there are so many downvotes on this torrent...  Is it because people are stupid enough to not realise that those votes are meant to be for the technical quality of the upload (which is mostly objective) and not the actual entertainment value (which is largely subjective)?

Haven't downloaded yet, I was just very surprised to see such a rating on a YIFY offering.  O.o"
,Dr.Cwb,2011-11-06T03:34Z,"@ Gliktch

that are 1 or 2  S...H.... that think there know better  

quality is AWESOME (for 650MB) better than any movie from FXG or good old aXXo (I love those 2 but YIFYs movis are better)

V 10/10
A 10/10

If you watch them on your PC and got problem with sound .... just download KM player  :)"
