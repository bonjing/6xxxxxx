=======

Don't write songs to make money
I write them for people to sing along
(x3)

There will come a day
When our flag will sway
Everyone will say
We're all The Pirate Bay
We're all The Pirate Bay

You will never have to pay to hear this song
You will never have to pay to sing along
(x3)

Don't write songs to make money
I write them for people to sing along
(x3)

There will come a day
When our flag will sway
Everyone will say
We're all The Pirate Bay
We're all The Pirate Bay

You will never have to pay to hear this song
You will never have to pay to sing along
(x3)

We're all The Pirate Bay
We're all The Pirate Bay
We're all The Pirate Bay
We are all The Pirate Bay
