Je heb geen wachtwoord/serial nodig.
Gewoon de bestanden in de map crack kopieren naar de originele map van Driver Reviver.
Zorg ervoor dat het programma niet draait, ook niet op de achtergrond!!"
,Spiros1488,2011-11-29T22:57Z,helper.dll = trojan !!!
,Spiros1488,2011-11-29T23:00Z,"asohelper.dll = Trojan.ADH

Thanks!"

[T],djjlicious,2011-11-30T00:05Z,"No trojan, false positive mate.
I check all my torrents with: Eset, Malwarebytes and Hitman Pro"
,Spiros1488,2011-11-30T18:04Z,"norton internet security 2012 deleted asohelper.dll and driverriviver.exe for the reasons Î mentioned.
Anyway I will not try again."
[V],cristo,2011-12-02T03:47Z,"Works flawless, Nice job"
,Ruchand,2011-12-15T18:29Z,Awsome.. clean. Checked with kaspersky Internet Security 2011.. no problem.. Great
,russell887,2011-12-28T01:31Z,This is a great up!!  Thanx uploader..... AVG's Internet Security 2012....Malwarebytes....Superantispyware  & Hitman Pro all give this torrent a clean bill of health!!  Was finally able to get rid of the occasional buzzing sound I was getting by installing the sound driver update given by the program were as device manager was saying I had the most recent update. My CPU was running a bit high after updates (core- 1 & 3) but after a simple power performance tweak everything is much better! This is one of the better driver update programs out there...funny to see this one is the only one with seeds on torrentz!!!
,hexena,2011-12-28T05:18Z,"Nice work Thanx.. works perfect..

10/10"
,hexena,2011-12-28T16:15Z,"There is a problem.. 

License status shows "" Active""

but license expiry date is 2001-01-01

checking foe update works fine but when i try to download update SOMETIME  it shows ""number of user for license have exceeded"" some thing like that...

I think Replacing files won't work correctly since the application checks the server to validate its license before downloading...

application should be patched to bypass this license check...

I am not a pro but this my point...."

,rouf.tpb,2012-01-19T22:35Z,"NIS 2011 detected the ASOHelper.dll file as Trojan.ADH. But the other files are ok. Anyway, thanks to uploader."
,ADDOriN,2012-01-22T20:47Z,Love it thanks! My NOD32 client detected some of the files are troyans but they are wrong. Thay are not troyans and wont harm your computer. Its very simple to install and update. Thanks! 
,slamminuk,2012-01-24T22:37Z,"Thanks for the upload, however after update a couple of my drivers, I now get the message
