The Girl in the Kremlin is a 1957 American thriller which puts forth the premise that Joseph Stalin (played by Maurice Manson) faked his own death in 1953 and then moved to Greece with a fortune in Soviet currency. Zsa Zsa Gabor plays a dual role, Stalinâ€™s nurse and lover as well as her twin sister who, unaware of Stalinâ€™s plot, hires an ex O.S.S. agent (Lex Barker) to find her sister.
This was the last film directed by Russell Birdwell who later became a well-known publicist.
