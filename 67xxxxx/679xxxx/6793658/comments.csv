,ealingTC,2011-12-01T22:42Z,"I am really confused.
I have copied all the files into the right folder.
I go into package manager and click install.
I can't find a .rpk or .rwp files anywhere
Where can I find them?"
,Mentalpen,2011-12-02T14:46Z,"@ ealingTC

you don't use the installer

simply move all the folders/files or merge them into the installation folder.

the class 150 will them be in the scenario list"
,mrantcorr,2012-01-10T02:24Z,"hey just downloaded this and it the class 150 has a coupling problem with 2 carriage train when you get so far into the scenario the train splits up into half, when you not touched anything and does it on its own,  is there anything solution to this problem?"
