Is this real? The other releases don't include ""The Ride""
"
[V],focused1804,2011-11-07T14:47Z,the song the ride is fucked up
,atndigcrk,2011-11-07T17:37Z,the ride hasnt been leaked have no idea why its here....THE RIDE and 2 others are bonus tracks only 16 tracks have leaked - i jus uploaded official p2p release untouched also 
,its_Zackry,2011-11-07T23:00Z,Good quality but every single song is sped up slightly. It's annoying but tolerable.
,guccicar,2011-11-08T06:00Z,This torrent was uploaded on the 7th but you said Drake made an announcement on the 8th. You are anonymous? Wierd. This maybe Drake or someone authorized by him to pioneer to bootleg his music. But uh don't complain that you losing money because of pirating.
,beverageking,2011-11-08T11:13Z,DON'T DOWNLOAD ALL THE TRACKS ARE SPED UP
