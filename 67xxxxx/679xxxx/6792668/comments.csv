,Yourrid,2011-11-03T14:21Z,"922 MiB???? Forgive me for calling Bull Shit on this. (As much as I have been anticipating this game)

I hope I am wrong through, just seems fishy to me."
,DeFl00d,2011-11-03T14:57Z,The size doens't tell if its a good game though.
,wowme,2011-11-03T15:05Z,"extremezone and bullshit don't go together :D

The only thing to worry about if any, is if it has a crack yet, since i don't see anything mentioned. "
[V],blaze69,2011-11-03T15:43Z,"Seems Like JASF.exe Is The Crack. Try to copy it to where the game Is Installed Overwriting The Original File. 

Have Not Tested Yet as I have Not Finished Downloading.

Thanks for the up extremezone :)"
,DeFl00d,2011-11-03T15:54Z,"Btw, THETA always produces quality releases."
,Cerebral222,2011-11-03T16:35Z,"Neat game, works well, crack is in the folder titled ""Files"". Thanks yet again extremezone for your quality uploads, +1 from me. Cheers."
[V],blaze69,2011-11-03T16:39Z,"ok.. Just finished Downloading ..

,akshaii,2011-11-03T17:27Z,"FAST DOWNLOAD, EVERYTHING IS AWESOME IN THIS GAME : ) : ) : ) TY EXREMEZONE : ) : ) : ) "
,kindred3006,2011-11-03T18:00Z,"Yourrid have you seen how this game looks like?
No wonder it's so small.
BTW, does anyone have problem getting the game to run?
I get ""stopped working"" after the first screen."
,paladan26,2011-11-03T22:50Z,"Only problem I am having is ZERO sound.  Notta can be heard.  No Music, No General Sound, Or Anything..  "
,malouka,2011-11-03T23:57Z,OMG :o janes its back this games is awesome  
,WV25705,2011-11-04T03:49Z,"Thanks, game and crack works fine in Win 7 Ultimate 64.  Sound is quite, but works fine.  Game is 1.15gb installed."
,mangler66,2011-11-04T05:28Z,when i try to run the setup it just freezes and causes windows explorer to restart any idea why?
,Maurox,2011-11-04T06:01Z,"Before you download this, be aware that the game doesn't work with Saitek X52 at least. I don't know about other joysticks, somewhere I've read that it doesn't work with joysticks AT ALL."
,Cobain67,2011-11-04T07:32Z,"This isn't a true JCS game.  In fact, it's a slap in the face to put the Jane's name on this game.  This is HARDLY a simulation.  This is an arcade style game.  I own, and still play every once in a while, Jane's USAF and F/A-18.  This game can't even come close to touching them.  Was excited when I saw Jane's in the title, only to be let down.  If you like the arcade style of play, then this is your game, but I am solely looking for realism in my air combat games."
,paladan26,2011-11-04T07:45Z,"@Cobain67  I agree 100%, but I do look at it as a possible good sign of future games with Janes name that might be more like the GREAT sims of old.  Can only hope.."
,doboyboy,2011-11-04T08:23Z,"Hi guys! Game graphics is OK, looks nice, however, i can not use my joystick (mid price) for this game?? tried to set buttons and other, but no help! Donno what's wrong!!!"
,paladan26,2011-11-04T08:36Z,"Developer Menu: Left Shit + Left Arrow while flying.  Gives cheat, and lot of other options. Too bad it doesn't fix sound.  :(  Have fun. (Found it on accident after resetting my controls)"
,szakal18,2011-11-04T10:13Z,Waiting for Lord of the Rings War in the North - Ez ! Hope you up soon :)
,Maurox,2011-11-04T10:15Z,"@doboyboy
I have the exact same ""problem"".

I checked my other joystick, this crap wasn't probably even tested on PC, because I can't believe they forgot to check THE F....NG CONTROLS. I guess we have to wait for a patch (if it will ever come)..."
[V],DeGun,2011-11-04T13:05Z,"-=-=-=-=-=-=- THX ExtremeZone ! -=-=-=-=-=-=-


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- JAH BLESS -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-"
[V],DeGun,2011-11-04T13:10Z,"BTW : people expecting this to be a real simulation game ought to be kidding ! first the size 950 Mo about and second RATED + 7 . 

yuh ve known MANY kidz able to play simulation game at 7 years old ? can be a few here or there but never enough for THS to rate it for ANY kidz of 7 ... 

Jah blessings"
,Cobain67,2011-11-04T21:54Z,"@ DeGun

You are right, the size should be a good sign that this is not a simulation, however, that being said, by using the name Jane's and putting ""Jane's Advanced Strike Fighters is an action-packed flight simulation with both single-player and multiplayer modes"" in their description, it kind of leads people to think that it is, regardless of size. It's a bit misleading considering Jane's was all about simulation.  I am not putting down arcade style game play because everybody has their own taste.  I just don't like it with flight combat games.

@ Paladan26

I do hope they gear more towards the simulation aspect.  There are some good combat simulators out right now like Lock On and Falcon 4.0, which is an older game, but VERY in depth with the F-16.  Still, I'd like to see something newer with the graphics of BF3 and an aircraft selection like USAF.  I realize that the more aircraft you have to select from, the less in depth they go into each, but honestly, I'm more into blowing other planes out of the sky and not as much worried about wether or not my instrument panel is identical to the real thing."
,Cerebral222,2011-11-05T15:23Z,"I used Xpadder to play this game with gamepad, as it works perfectly with almost all gamepads & joysticks, alot more fun than keyboard. BTW, you have the option to go from 1st person mode to 3rd person mode; 3rd person mode is more like arcade, as with 1st person is more like simulation. This is no high def game, but overall graphics are good considering the size of the game."
,ivanhoe68,2011-11-07T17:18Z,"Im having trouble with the plain steering automatic to the left, i have tryed my other pad as well, same issue. Anyone else having these issues?"
,Rivven,2011-11-08T08:19Z,"@ivanhoe68

Same problem for me, tried a normal pc gamepad, xbox 360 wireless controller and just keyboard, left rudder/yaw is always stuck."
,stedee100,2011-11-08T15:33Z,"thanks fast download and working for me

,killswitchzz,2011-11-17T00:53Z,done downloading its great (if its extremezone its the best) 
,dublinsteve,2011-11-18T10:48Z,"I have the same problem, pulls to the left on take off and crashes into buildings (of course), tried reconfiguring, xpadder etc - no go for me...

anyone found a fix? looks ok otherwise

Win 7 64bit Ultimate"
,gunner341,2012-01-05T06:36Z,"I downloaded quite fast and didn't use the crack in the ""files"" folder and the game works great (win 7 64bit home).  

However, the game recognized my joystick but when I mapped the axis and buttons I wasn't able to play using my joystick.  Playing the game with the keyboard is challeging and isn't fun.

On the plus side, the graphics and sounds are great.  If you don't mind playing a flight sim with a keyboard, this is your game, if not pass..."
,nerminfanatikos,2012-01-18T20:35Z,"great game...    :)
easy to instal, fast instal....  love it...   :D"
,nerminfanatikos,2012-01-18T20:37Z,"it works on windows 7...no errors, no crashes...no problems...
thx extremezone... :)"
,Ears14U,2012-03-13T20:40Z,"HEY GUY'S PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU READ THIS POST!!!!! YOU MOST LIKELY (WILL) HAVE CONTROLLER ISSUES, AND HERE IS THE REASON WHY. AFTER YOU INSTALL THE GAME, ""DO NOT"" RUN IT YET! MAKE SURE YOU GO INTO YOUR FIREWALL AND MAKE AN EXCEPTION FOR IT (NOT) TO ACCESS THE INTERNET!!!!! SEEMS IT GOES TO THE WEBSITE AND BLACKLISTS YOU, DISABLING EVERYTHING BUT ""KEYBOARD"" CONTROL. AND I DON'T THINK YOU WANT TO FLY THIS FUCKER WITH A KEYBOARD. IF YOU LIKE THIS GAME, BUY IT AFTER FLYING SINGLE PLAYER. PERSONALLY, THERE ARE MUCH MORE REALISTIC FLIGHT GAMES OUT THERE. THIS IS AN ARCADE ADAPTATION OF ""FLYING"". I HOPE THIS HELPS. IF YOU ALREADY LOST ""CONTROLLER"" CONTROL ALREADY? JUST DELETE AND REINSTALL IT. IT WORKS FINE AFTER YOU FOLLOW WHAT I'VE TOLD YOU EARLIER. HAVE FUN, YOU MAY NOT BE ALIVE TOMORROW!"
,StressedYeti,2012-04-13T06:14Z,"I tried uninstalling and firewalling JASF and the controls still pull left all the damn time.
Any Idea wtf is going on"
,SpaceCadet6969754,2012-05-26T12:22Z,Works fine first time didn't need the crack works by itself.
