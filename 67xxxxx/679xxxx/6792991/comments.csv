,Calamakuya,2011-11-06T08:02Z,"I beg you forgiveness but a 4.02GB DL for a TS and with hard-coded subs doesn't register right in the realm of common sense.

I mean no offense to the up-loader, on the contrary, I recognize the hard work invested in this and appreciate it... Still, from the Dnloader's point of view, it doesn't look that good."

,RebelwithoutaClue,2011-12-08T13:10Z,"@balooga
We use subtitles, because kids don't know English very well yet. And because it's common in the Netherlands to leave audio intact and subtitle the movie, we learn the language as well. 
Many countries, such as France and Germany, synchronise the movie in their own language."
,SphekS,2011-12-09T10:57Z,"same as kluelos at 2011-11-05 03:30 CET:

,Ozi-miner,2011-12-17T08:12Z,"Check out the uploaders name:
NL = Netherlands (who speak Dutch).
All NLUPPER002's torrents have a high number of seeders so I'd say that there are plenty of people out there who want the Dutch subs & TS2DVD format that he/she supplies.

@ Brenton66: fair enough comment mate. But personally if I watch a foreign movie I like the subtitles to be in my native language (which is English) & I'd venture to say that you would too (or would you prefer to watch a Japanese movie with Japanese subtitles for example?)

Just for the record, I don't download NLUPPER002's torrents because I'm not Dutch.  I came to this page to check out which torrent he/she used as their source so that I can go check out the quality of that one.

Rather than bitching & whinging how about the rest of you English speakers do the same."
,Marelazaez,2011-12-17T11:44Z," DVD movies are much better quality than TS. TS lacks in contrast and brightness. When you make a DVD from such lousy material as TS is, then this is a waste of bandwidth. Such a movie could be watched as a divx of 700 Mb in size. I dont'understand, why is NLUPPER002 doing this. 
You get TS from recording a movie in cinema with some cheap camera. You can see pople walking in front of canvas, etc. I mean really really bad. At least he is honest.  You wont get better quality increasing the size of movie. This is nonsense. I don't know crazy maybe, retarded. "
,jasonr2000,2011-12-25T05:52Z,"oh my ive read some shit in my time but this takes the piss stop argueing its a bloody movie just watch it and enjoy subtitles or not cant we all just enjoy it instead of banging on about who is from where and shit

Erm hello? If speak those many languages why do you need the subtitles? I have nothing against subs myself, but I think hardcoding them is just... well, dumb. 
Oh, and I speak Spanish, German and Italian. "
,BinkyDeath,2012-01-15T21:23Z,"Holy crap! What an evil-minded bunch of racist retards!! o.O
Ozi-miner - well said.
For the rest of you bitching and moaning about the flaming LANGUAGE of all things!!.... I can barely believe your stupidity! o.O
Loads of people with English as their first language think other languages aren't necessary - and that's pathetic.
Loads of people who have English as a second language think that they're more clever than the English-speaking people just because they learnt English - and that's just as pathetic.
Neither of you are better than the other. In fact, you're just as bad as each other.
Around 500 people speak my native language and I would LOVE subtitles to be available in my native language, but they're not. No doubt they never will be. The reason my language has died is because of the English pratts that came into my country and demanded that none of us speak our language anymore and only speak English instead. It was sick of them to rape us of our heritage like that, especially the way they did it. We're struggling to keep our language alive, but it's hellishly difficult against that type of thinking.
I don't think I'm better than others just because I can speak more than two languages. English is one of the easiest languages to learn too so it's no big deal if you've learnt it as your second language.
As for hard-coded subs - they are useful to some people (especially if you have a Player that can't cope with optional subtitle files for example). If you want OPTIONAL subs, then go download another version. It's THAT simple.
Watching a movie with subs in a different language is a great way to get used to a new language.
And despite nearly everyone bitching about the written language - you didn't read the description did you? So what use was the language you claim to love and want when you don't USE IT by reading the description??
Jesus...... small minds.... just such small minds.

Download this if it's the version you want and enjoy; but don't whinge about the language for crying out loud. "
,HexOnSox,2012-01-19T23:46Z,"WHY, every body keep screaming, over and over again when it's cam... TS = CAM!!!

,DarkWolfDK,2012-01-23T18:37Z,"Im sick and tired of IDIOTS like NLUPPER002, that cant figure out NOT to post TS/Cam in DVDR section. DVDR was created for uploads containing ripped original DVD's.
Its just sad he/she thinks that because you make a dvd structure, it becomes a DVD rip. Fortunately you so kind as to write TS in most of the uploads that its possible not to waste time downloading.
This is a plea for NLUPPER002 to stop uploading the wrong places. Please use TS/cam section instead."
,DarkWolfDK,2012-01-23T22:58Z,"@HexOnSox
I'm trying to make a point!
That its a waste of time downloading this TS shit, that should belong in the Video.Film category!
DVDR category is for DVD rips. He is uploading a TS and yes, usually i avoid the TS by not DL them. But this guy has made an efford to spam this section without understanding the how the sections works or atleast should.
And please try to not degrade yourself by making presumptions.
