,Thomps6o,2011-11-04T07:40Z,"i find that there is always some kind of error or extremely bad artifacting with most of these new ""smaller"" files. its always the same, i will prolly go back to downloading 350mb files, as they are more reliable. this one starts artifacting and cutting sound at around 06:32, i figured id just tuff it out but it got so bad i gave up.
 maybe, someone can give me an explanation to why these 150mb files are always screwed up? i thank you for trying to help out though"
