[T],thetorrentlord,2011-12-30T02:13Z,@javelent: Just saw your post and checked it again. It is out of sync for about 3 1/2 min. It then plays in sync till the end. I check several places in each upload but no one has time to check every second of every upload. Once it has been made into an mkv I do not know how to correct such an issue without the original file which I no longer have. Sorry for the small glitch. But it does play correctly from the next cut in the video.
