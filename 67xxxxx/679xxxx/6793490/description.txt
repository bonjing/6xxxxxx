This is the last CD from my collection that I couldn't rip.

I think it's the one that broke my CD player, and the only drive I cold find that would actually play it thanks to the DRM was my cheap sub 20 DVD player, Everything else barfed. not a single one of my many PCs/laptops


As a consequence it's a Audio-out capped with Audacity through the DVD LR phone out, via a stereo USB line in dongle with everything set to default (Except to request separate LR channels) so If I understand what I've done these are something like 16bit 2CH 44.1Khz raw digital encoding of  probably poor quality audio out. 

So it might be complete rubbish if you're an audiophile. If so, let me know rather than just whining and maybe gimme a few pointers, but they seem to sound okay.

Files have been split on intra track silences by hand, so again they could be a bit hit and miss but only in the sense of the length of the leading/trailing blank I don't think I cut any actual sound.

Those files were then subsequently renamed and tagged with MusicBrainz-picard-freeworld.

Disk 1 is widely available through a TPB search but I could only find requests for this though it's possible I didn't look hard enough. I also don't do this much so expect it to go wrong and account for the fact that my ISP caps me on-peak, so it may be sporadic if it works at all.


I'll shut up now
