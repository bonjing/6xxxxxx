Tere Mere Phere is a story about a newly married couple, Pooja and Rahul, who have a perfect love affair and a perfect marriage and set out on a perfect dream honeymoon in a motor home, driving through the breath taking Himalayas â€¦ but then can life ever be perfect?! If â€œdistance makes the heart grow fonderâ€ then too much proximity should have the reverse effect! And it does ... As Pooja and Rahul get too close for comfort, the gilt of romance begins to rub off, a series of absurd fights follow and soon they get embroiled with a local Himachali small town guy ( Vinay Pathak) and his girl Muskaan, the â€œPahadi Mirchâ€ (Riya Sen).
