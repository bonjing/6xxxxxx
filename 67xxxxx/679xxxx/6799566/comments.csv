[V],maximersk,2011-11-06T22:27Z,"Hey, AlbaGuBrath, Skulls green (VIP)
How did you do that ? 5 Pages and me 11.


I hope that you understood."
[V],maximersk,2011-11-06T22:29Z,"Thanks, RaSe_77 !"
,steevo-be-thy-name,2011-11-06T22:39Z,"Thanks for the update  RaSe_77 . the last time something like this happened all the comments disappeared from my uploaded torrents . 
And they never returned . 
yeah , sorry for using freaktorrent07 upload as a post board , on the upside , cause this is the last upload people will download this book to read while they wait ."
[V],AlbaGuBrath,2011-11-06T22:50Z,"@ maximersk Maybe because your so hung up on the colour of your skull and bitching about others, dont worry about it unless you really are doing what your doing for self gratification rather than sharing for others benefits in the spirit that TPB was created for!! it aint about you or me or any 1 individual, its about the collective masses!! Capiche? "
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-11-06T23:20Z,"@AlbaGuBrath
Bollocks. How do you explain this:
http://thepiratebay.org/user/mkvgod/
Why is he so special to become vip?
I believe it's all about ""arse-kissing"", the more arses one kisses the sooner he'll become green. period.

maximersk got a good point.
I apologize freaktorrent07,
 you're the mega-star of the day ;-)"
[V],AlbaGuBrath,2011-11-06T23:46Z,"@ mkvonly it aint jack about kissing arse!! ive never kissed anyones arse but also nor did i ever request my skull, it just happened!! although tbh im surprised by your uploads that your not a VIP although im sure they have there good reasons, maybe its your attitude? "
[V],maximersk,2011-11-06T23:49Z,"@ AlbaGuBrath,
I deserved my skulls pink (Trusted)!
I'm sharing for others people !!!!! "
[V],maximersk,2011-11-07T00:02Z,"@ mkvonly

"
[H],freaktorrent07,2011-11-07T02:50Z,"LOL  now as i can see my uploaded torrent became a post board or maybe a new thread`s place....well guys i really dont care about it but i would suggest following the rules on TPB creating a new thread on Suprbay, there it will be a great idea... so i hope you guys dont get me wrong iÂ´m not angry or anything like that just trying to be clear and fair!
thank you!"
[H],freaktorrent07,2011-11-07T02:56Z,"@Aimier59
IÂ´m not sure if i have these titles available right now, they are a bit hard to find it even if you google it but probably i should be able to get it and uploaded as soon as i can!
thank you."

,Aimier_59,2011-11-09T21:22Z,"Ok, freaktorrent07 ! I can tell you I am waiting for those book if possible to be uploaded here! They are necessary for my daughter who studies English at a university in Romania! ( I myself am a teacher of English in Romania. I do not find the books! All I can find on net is ads on e-bay to buy the books, but it is impossible for me to buy English books as they are extremely expensive as compared to our monthly salaries! )
Thanks again!"
