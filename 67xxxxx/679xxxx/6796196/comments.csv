,User897,2011-11-05T05:35Z,This is glitched.  Do not download.  Picture and sound go out intermittently.
,Jigman117,2011-11-05T09:20Z,"It wasn't glitched for me. The audio was good, but the video was a little grainy. Was a damn good episode also."
,ImSoJaded,2011-11-05T10:22Z,"Nothing wrong with the audio, user 897 is either using a crappy player or a good player on a crappy computer or he is simply a troll. I used KMPlayer and playback was smooth as silk."
,User897,2011-11-05T17:30Z,"Wrong.  I am using the latest K-Lite and this is the ONLY file I am having the trouble with.  So, go troll yourself."
,ImSoJaded,2011-11-05T18:48Z,"So because it does not run with your shitty K-Lite pack, the release is the only thing to blame. Maybe try to play the file on a different computer and with a different player, troll boy, before coming here to whine. I played it without problems even from a pendrive on my LG Blu-ray player - unlike you, I am at least testing it properly, so next time maybe you should do the same and you won't look stupid. "
,User897,2011-11-06T01:33Z,"Fuck you, asshole.  I have every right to report on things that I download, and I DID test the file on more than one player.  I even downloaded it again to be sure.  The exact same glitches happen in exactly the same places.  So up yours."
,erroneus,2011-11-06T12:42Z,"You know, he may be talking about the glitch between the scenes where commercials would have been.  It wasn't seamless.

That said, I hope that second and/or third runs of the shows are also shared because they have less of that in-line advertising crap and there's a better chance the video will be cleaner as well."
,User897,2011-11-06T17:53Z,"Actually I'm not talking about the commercial breaks.  It happens throughout the entire episode.  Sometimes the audio stays, sometimes it doesn't.  The screen just goes black for one or two seconds at a time, in the exact same spots each time.  It happens with both of the current 720p versions of this episode and is maddening.  Then I have assholes like ImSoJaded calling me names, saying it's my computer, and accusing me of trolling.  I played it on WMP and MPC K-Lite with the same results before I reported it.

If someone can repack it or something, I would be grateful.  The only version of this episode I can watch is one of the low-rez ones."
