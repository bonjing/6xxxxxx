""what was released online is an older cut. In America, after we were purchased by Big Air. We went back in and were able to correct a lot of things that the budget didn't allow us to originally. The mix, the VFX, the sound, the overall edit""

Interviewer: So there are two versions of the film? 

D: ""We were a small budget, and our post was condensed. The movie that was leaked was the first cut that was screened. After it was bought, about 2 more months of editing and post went in to it""
