This update of the 2002 edition is by the original authors. Petit (The Natural Solution to Diabetes; The Encyclopedia of Endocrine Diseases and Disorders) is the medical director of the Joslin Diabetes Center at the Hospital of Central Connecticut. Adamec, a medical writer, has coauthored several Facts On File publications. In the foreword, Petit writes that many entries have been revised and new topic overviews added, covering subjects such as diabetic eye diseases, alternative medicine, and lifestyle adaptation to diabetes. An introduction outlines the history of the condition from ancient times to today, including information on the discovery of insulin. Most of the 246 entries have references, the majority of which are to books and journal articles. In addition to a bibliography, 11 appendixes include listings of websites, periodicals, organizations, and research centers. The encyclopedia is geared toward a high school reading level and above because of its easy-to-read format. There is an alphabetical list of entries, but none by categoryâ€”a feature that could give readers a better idea of the book's contents. BOTTOM LINE Since it has been almost ten years since the first edition, libraries that own that work should consider purchasing this title as well as Omnigraphics's Diabetes Sourcebook (5th ed., 2011) or the American Diabetes Association Complete Guide to Diabetes (5th ed., 2011). Recommended for academic and public libraries.â€”Rebecca Raszewski, Univ. of Illinois at Chicago
