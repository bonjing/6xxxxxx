,listenherenow,2011-11-05T15:07Z,"I don't get it. why does no one even comment on the deal here? 

  the sample is better than the movie quality, also the samples sound is all teh same and perfect and does not cut off and change to some other format 30 seconds after the film starts liek the film does. 

  why is all that nessesary?  why can't it just be like all the other kick ass ones. 

really aggravating.    - all this looking shit up and getting new codecs to play shit that should just play right is getting to be a real bummer, i am getting too old to keep  trying to figure all this stuff out. 

I don't understand the reasoning behind it all.  I mean, what was it like 8 years ago you could get a flick  that was 700 megs and it played perfect, the sound was great, it burned to dvd if you wanted, you didnt have to convert shit or hook two files together or anything. LOL 

  now i have to master software that is a bitch to learn and gets outdated every two to three months.     lol

  thanks for the movie, i will be able to watch it in about a week when I figure out how to hear the sound. "

Just wanted to stop some of the confusion and frustration around here...some tips on the following issues

No Sounds:

1. Update Codecs..
2. Or just download VLC (Videolan)

=======================
Slow Download.. 

1. Get Broadband 

2. Get uTorrent

3. Use a search engine to get settings to optimize uTorrent

4. Check Ratios of Seeders / Leechers
NOTE: If number of leechers is 2 or 3 times seeders then move on to another torrent 

Some you guys just gotta get some more research done to solve your issues...

uTorrent's protocol encryption doesn't break throttling for my ISP, at least, in this area. (Comcast) 

After switching too Halite (Binarynotions dot com) my top downstream more than tripled. Previously I had used uTorrent since 1.4 or so until they started cramming it full of useless features and nonsense. (It wasn't until recently, around July I discovered the encryption problem.)

I'm betting there are alot out there not getting full bandwidth due to similar ISP tomfoolery and the fact that uTorrent is full of fail now."

People with stupid comments like this need to have their internet and PC rights revoked entirely. Update your codecs, get a better video player than whatever crap you're using, and try again. 

It's such a basic suggestion as to almost be common sense by now. Or at least it should be, although apparently some people still only know how to click and push buttons, having no idea how actual things work in the wonderful world of PC's...go read a book or something, geez."

,Cryptical654,2012-01-06T10:42Z,@Warden: Just put the file on a USB flash drive and put it in your Xbox. Or you can stream it from your computer to your Xbox through the PC Media Library (you'll need Windows and the internet).
