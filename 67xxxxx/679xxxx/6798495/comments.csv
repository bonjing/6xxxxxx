,chaiyont2,2011-11-06T16:14Z,"This works - thanks a lot. 

It worked on an installation where mini-KMS_Activator_v1.051.exe had failed, so I was not optimistic, but it did, and without reinstalling Office. 

It took a few attempts - probably because I did not precisely follow the instructions with this activator. I suspect if I had, it would have worked first time."
,killabaz,2011-11-07T13:47Z,thanks for the activation. Can someone please confirm how long it will last because when i checked the activation it says i have 180 days? what happens after that? cheers
[T],AmpleNM,2011-11-07T17:48Z,@killabaz: after that download a newer version of Activator or re-activate using the same

[T],AmpleNM,2011-11-09T21:28Z,@McCore24: try re-installing your product

,jkfw,2011-11-12T10:52Z,"Worked without any problems (others I've tried failed or had trojans) and didn't have to reinstall Office. 

THANK YOU!!!"
[T],AmpleNM,2011-11-12T13:02Z,@Benefit1: your AV might be blocking the application. Try disabling Anti Virus
,chaverta,2011-11-13T06:09Z,I have a netbook with a office starter kit and i tried installing this to activate the full office but i get the error code /sethst:127.0.0.1. any clue what it is about and how to fix it? thanks
[T],AmpleNM,2011-11-13T09:46Z,@chaverta: i think the starter kits are not meant to be activated they are just the demo version to let you know about the product. You need to download some other version and then try the activator

,coolnsexy19,2011-11-19T16:36Z,"All Hail AmpleNM
It worked after many attempts.
Ran Windows update and nothing came for activation related. Files open without any hassle.
Just turn off the antivirus ( i had bitdefender 2011 total which is # 1) so i ran activator through safe mode it got activated after 7-8 attempts. 
Dont give up if u fail first few attempts keep on doing it. 
Again, All hail AmpleNM. you rock"

,AngeliqueElf,2012-03-24T02:17Z,Works perfectly but contains a Trojan. Allow all to activate the program then go C:Windows and remove the autoKMS.exe file to remove Trojan. Then remove from your firewall exceptions.
,gsftx,2012-05-07T15:21Z,"https://www.slimwareutilities.com/community/info.php?id=14791&type=startup

You should keep AutoKMS in start-up if you are running an illegal pirate copy of MS office 2010. 

If you were sold this copy of Office as genuine, you should immediately contact Microsoft as you have become a victim of software piracy!

YOUR ACTIVATION WILL NOT BE PERMENANT WITHOUT AUTOKMS.EXE!! DO NOT DELETE!

AUTOKMS = Auto Key Management Service
