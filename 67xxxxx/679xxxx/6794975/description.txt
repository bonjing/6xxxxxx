here it is another fresh new beta build of vlc media player 1.2.0-git from today : november 4
not official yet and still under development.
Don't forget to erase and delete your cache and preferences every time you will 
go to install any new version.
Uncheck : "check automaticaly new update" as it does not work anymore for this specific version.
Btw  : GPU accelerated decoding must be only enabled if you will watch a real DVD,HD DVD,BD and BD-3D.
Untouched and delivered such "as is" for personal testing purpose only anyway.

enjoy and cheers ;)
