I don't have the time anymore to properly upload decent files, and it's not me to do things like that. The time inbetween uploads have been to long, and now the quality is suffering too. I have to make priorities in the little spare time that I have at the moment, and have decided it is best for me to quit uploading, for the near future.

Who knows, maybe we'll see eachother again someday.

Wishing you all the best!
