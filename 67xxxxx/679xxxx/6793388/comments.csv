For anyone looking to download, please be aware that I currently have nineteen leechers fighting it out for four upload slots, and I only have an upload speed of 80kB/s.  Expect this torrent to run EXTREMELY slowly until we have more seeders.  I had made a note of initial slow speeds on my Demonoid release, but that comment was deleted when it was posted here.  Please be patient - I do seed 24/7, but right now I am getting hammered due to this unexpected release on TPB."
