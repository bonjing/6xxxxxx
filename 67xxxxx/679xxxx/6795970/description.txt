Description

Plot: What has happened to us? Despite the most advanced medical technology in the world, we are sicker than ever by nearly every measure. Cases of diabetes are exploding, especially amongst our younger population. About half of us are taking at least one prescription drug and major medical operations have become routine. Heart disease, cancer and stroke are the countryâ€™s three leading causes of death, even though billions are spent each year to â€œbattleâ€ these very conditions. Millions suffer from a host of other degenerative diseases. Could it be thereâ€™s a single solution to all of these problems? A solution so comprehensive, but so utterly straightforward, that itâ€™s mind-boggling that more of us havenâ€™t taken it seriously? FORKS OVER KNIVES examines the profound claim that most, if not all, of the so-called â€œdiseases of affluenceâ€ that afflict us can be controlledâ€¦
