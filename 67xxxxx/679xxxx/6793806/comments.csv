About the artwork:

Could you please ask qussay86 to provide the template for his cover? This way we could simply create additional covers for episodes where the artwork is missing."

big thanks -inspiron- and congrats buddy on the new skull you definitely deserve it :D
I'm sending the covers now
@richardashcroft
I will be sending him too the template (.psd file) so guys can use to create the missing covers."
