
Only in her very early twenties and already a global superstar with album sales in the multi-millions, Taylor Swift is the possessor of a rare talent that includes singing, performing, song-writing, musicianship and acting, all topped off with the face and body of a goddess. To suggest that the future looks good for Taylor would be the understatement to top all understatements!
And it would appear that her fans, who come from all walks of life, love and admire the Keystone Stateâ€™s favourite daughter for her honesty, grit and decency alongside her extraordinary music - but respect is also due for the fact she is as far removed from the homogenised pop-bimbo of the current age as itâ€™s possible to get.
This CD contains over 70 minutes of interviews with the girl herself in which she talks about a huge variety of topics close to her heart and during which she is often candid, sometimes cute but always highly entertaining, cryptically enlightening and absolutely delightful.
