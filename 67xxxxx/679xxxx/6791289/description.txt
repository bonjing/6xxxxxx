Our goal is to bring a new slant to fitness publications. No celebrities or professional atheletes. Real lives..real results. People with 9-5â€™s, families, and all of lifeâ€™s demands that squeeze that last hour and figure out how to maximize it. â€œSidewalk scienceâ€ is what matters, not university studies or information from celebs and atheletes paid and sponsored to look and perform greatâ€¦or those that call them clients. YOU are the pro!
