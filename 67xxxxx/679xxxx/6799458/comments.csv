,Phntzm79,2011-12-24T17:18Z,"Gh057man! you are back for more abuse? Complaining again! Is that all you do you! Your complaints are like a broken record, same shit different day! What do you know about FLAC files? If I upload the Video Games track in FLAC will you be happy and stop bitching? or is it in your very nature to bitch because you had a troubled relationship with your mother who didn't give you enough love as a child? You seem to keep coming back for more hoping for a different outcome? If my files aren't up to your standards, why do you keep coming back? What's wrong with you?Phantazm79. I can't encode everything in FLAC that would be too time consuming and the files would be too large, but for Gh057man, I will encode his one favorite track in FLAC and upload it soon!Peace to all and Merry Christmas!"
,Gh057man,2011-12-25T12:17Z,"LMFAO. I love our little banters Orgasm79. How can I best describe this relationship? .... I am the Bugs Bunny to your Daffy Duck. 
Why did i come here? ... I clicked a Torrentz link (and therefore had no way of knowing this would be your upload) in the hope that there was a long overdue FLAC version of LDR's music available.  I would not have to 'investigate' this upload if you actually did the torrent community a proper service, and not a half-arsed one :), and included the format of the files in the torrent. 
Anyway ... I saw your comment ... and silly me, instead of getting the f*** outta here I couldn't resist poking the dog back with a stick. mwhahaha! 
In all seriousness, unless you have a computer from the Ark it shouldn't take that long to encode all the (original) music you have uploaded to FLAC. I can't speak for the capacity of your internet service of course. If you change your mind I recommend Switch Sound File Converter Plus which has many options and does a very good job. 
Hope you had a great Christmas Phntzm79.
Peace on Earth and goodwill to all uploaders:)"
,Gh057man,2011-12-25T12:26Z,"BTW. I'm not totally ungrateful, I just demand perfection :)"
,Gh057man,2011-12-25T12:31Z,Ooops I just read from your previous comment that you have a Mac. My commiserations. Converting to FLAC probably would take a long time in this case.
,Phntzm79,2011-12-25T23:55Z,"Gh057man, you are a special case so I must consider what I learned from a very eminent professor in medical school, he said, ""Never argue with crazy people as it will prove to only antagonize the damaged mind""! Your assertions are again incorrect! You aren't Bugs Bunny but you wish you were, as for my contributions to the torrent community, they are small in scope but superior to yours. As for the time to convert to FLAC, if you think it shouldn't take that long, then why don't you do it and contribute to the torrent world instead of just complaining? And the final comment, UNIX based operating systems are superior for many reasons, stability, lack of viruses, Trojan horses, worms and other dos Windows crap. The main reason for not converting everything to FLAC is that the end result would be files 3-4X bigger than VBR LAME Mp3 and most people don't care about Lossless Audio codecs [FLAC, ALAC, OGG FLAC which are mainly PC (bound) only and FLAC/OGG hybrid portable media players are still a minority. For now, VBR LAME MP3 is the best choice! Phantazm79"
,Phntzm79,2011-12-26T01:35Z,"Gh057fag, if my torrents are so half-arsed as you say, then why do many people continue to download my torrents? Why are my L.D.R. torrents all over the internet? Your torrents are dead and never even lived! This is the harsh reality!

,Phntzm79,2011-12-26T01:57Z,"The evidence is clear, your contribution to the torrent world is not impressive by any standard! All you are capable of is bitching and complaining like a little girl about wanting better quality fucking FLAC files, file glitches in one song etc. You are a waste of carbon atoms and we can all hope that your DNA will not be propagated on this earth to infect the planet with more bitches!  If you really are Bugs Bunny, then it's hunting season! Phantazm79"
,Gh057man,2011-12-26T03:53Z,"1. Your quote: ""Never argue with crazy people as it will prove to only antagonize the damaged mind"". - yet you continue to antagonize my mind. :) Just one of many contemptible acts on your road for the quest of glory. :)
2. I refuse to be fleeced and a slave to the CrApple merchandising machine - I don't care how great their OS and/or software is supposed to be.
Maybe if you hadn't overspent on your computer you could afford a better internet service and uploading FLAC formatted music would not be a huge issue. :)
3. If I had the original material of course I would upload it in FLAC format. I don't, you can, you should! 
LDR's stuff is just the sort of music an audiophile would rather have in FLAC format.
The point is this format can still be about half the size of up to 700Mb that a full audio CD is and retain the quality. Being lossless also means it can be converted to create the audio CD so it can be played in both PC or stand-alone optical disc players. Many people do not own icrap or other lossless audio players or *shudder* a computer. They just want to listen to a music CD in their car or lounge. Lana Del Rey's stuff is just the type of music the more tech savvy of us might want give to their parents to enjoy or see if they like, ie. those music listeners who only have and use the older music technologies.
I recommend you upload the shortest LDR album you have and see how many downloaders you get.
4. All you see of my torrents are those in PBay under Gh057man and not the many others as an anonymous uploader - because I'm not in this for the glory. Once again ... I didn't know this was a competition. These uploads were all audio files in both mp3 320 CBR and FLAC. So ... let's stop swinging our dicks around and provide the torrent community the stuff they want.
As I see you have done here: 
https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6909944/Lana_Del_Rey-Video_Games_EP%5B2011%5D%5BFLAC%5D-Phantazm79
Nice work. Peace."
,AMerryCan,2011-12-26T06:04Z,He he. This is some hilarious shit you two. Have you thought about getting a room :P Gh057man made a few good points tho [I also think Apple suck ass] and not everyone wants mp3 for more collectable music so thanks for the link Gh057man - and the flac upload Phantzm79. Cheers Emery.
,Gh057man,2011-12-26T06:42Z,No worries Emery. A room? LMAO! I did think of it actually. It would have to be 100% padded with bars on the door glass. I would be standing outside with the key pointing and laughing at Phantzm79 ... who would be sitting inside covered in a pool of his own drool. :-()
,Phntzm79,2011-12-26T06:59Z,"Your missing the point ant just trying to fight back by making baseless assertions!I'm not in this for Glory or anything else! I'm simply willing to share what I have with others who might like these files. When you make accusations or assumptions without evidence, you are revealing your true nature! You started this war, remember? You are the only person who has ever complained about the quality of my files! I know all the details about why Lossless audio codecs like FLAC produce a representation of digital data that can be expanded to an exact digital duplicate of the original audio stream. The fact is, for most people, FLAC is a format that is limited to computer use. As for your motivations for wanting FLAC files, they are reasonable but I didn't realize I was here to serve your wants? Let's call a truce to this battle of words and stop antagonizing each other! I will consider your request. Peace,  Phantazm79. I get no Glory from this work, all I get is the satisfaction of sharing! The end."
,Phntzm79,2011-12-26T07:04Z,"Gh057man, your back to your old self?"
,Gh057man,2011-12-26T08:37Z,"No worries Phntzm79. 
My comments have all been tongue in cheek. My previous apology in one of your other uploads (of sorts) for the way I commented about the glitches in one of your original uploads, as I agreed it probably was over the top :), still stands. 
However, I won't back down from my stand that FLAC is a more popular and appreciated format than you may realise. Even if it isn't as convenient as compressed formats. Eg. do a Google search on ""(EAC-FLAC) oan"" or check http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5864283 out (as one example) and you will find that many of us appreciate quality music preferably in the FLAC format, particularly if performed with Exact Audio Copy. This is to say your efforts with FLAC would not just be for my benefit. 
Now, if I had asked you to upload files in OGG or WMA format (for example), I would have no qualms if you had told me to go jump. Obviously, as you know, these formats could be created by the user from the mp3s you already uploaded. They would also seem to be a lot less popular than lossy mP3 and perhaps even the lossless FLAC.
As it is ... my personal thanks for the FLAC upload which essentially provides the music in its original state without the bloat of WAV or CDA. Now I and other downloaders can convert it to any damn format we like. For me ... I can burn my mother a decent sounding rewritable CD copy of that album, as an LDR sample, and if she likes the music she can seek it out for herself. 
Meanwhile, you get the satisfaction of providing the music you love to not just the downloader but a wider audience and hopefully the artist benefits in the long term. I hope that's how torrents are supposed to work, right? Peace and truce. Gh057man :)"
,Phntzm79,2011-12-27T16:58Z,"I uploaded the Nevada Master Album torrent in FLAC format. Peace, Phantazm79"
,Phntzm79,2011-12-28T12:32Z,"Gh057man, you were right about the popularity of FLAC format files. About 20 minutes after uploading the Nevada Master tracks album torrent[FLAC], I was getting leechers. Now this could be attributed to a number of factors; Hard core LDR fans, FLAC lovers, fans craving any new LDR music because her catalog has been very limited since she changed her name twice, changed recording companies and they have been actively trying to suppress her previous material!It also could have been the timing of the upload and other factors. The fact remains, many people like FLAC. So whenever I can, I will upload FLAC + HQ Mp3. Peace, Phantazm79"
,Gh057man,2011-12-29T03:22Z,"No worries Phntzm79. I didn't realise LDR had changed her name. What was it before? I got the feeling there was some funny shit going on with her releases. Australia's national alternative/youth radio network (Triple J) raved about her latest release (Video Games) which I initially heard  played a few times several months ago but I can't say I've heard much more about LDR. Phntzm79 - You may also like this artist: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6720432/

,Phntzm79,2011-12-29T03:59Z,"Her real name is Elizabeth Grant and she has been singing since she was 17.She lived in a trailer park in New Jersey but she went to private school in Connecticut and is the daughter of a millionaire.Her first EP was released under the name Lizzy Grant, then her handlers at the new record company changed her name to Lana Del Ray and then to Lana Del Rey after Lana Turner and the Ford Del Rey car.

,Gh057man,2011-12-31T02:46Z,"@goddaughter However pointless the images and/or videos may be to you I'm sure your torrent client will allow you to select only the files (the music?) you want to download with  relative ease (i.e. untick boxes). Having not downloaded any tracks from this torrent myself can I ask why you rate the quality as no good? A direct rip of the tracks, which I assume this is, at 320 mp3  is perfectly adequate unless you prefer lossless audio. "
,Gh057man,2011-12-31T03:02Z,"Phntzm79 - Maybe the difference is encoding with VBR instead of CBR? I use CBR because I've never been 100% happy with VBR audio quality ... but then maybe I haven't used the best encoder for this.
Also ... If you don't already, you should use Exact Audio Copy or similar (yes, there are versions for MACs) - essential when ripping audio CDs. Peace Gh057man.

,katieanna,2012-03-11T16:53Z,"Phntzm79, your defence of Lana Del Ray sounds a little psychotic. It is like you are obsessed with her.

""If I know one thing about women, it's that much of their self worth is related to how they see themselves in relation to beauty! ""

First of all, I expect you know very little about ""women"". The first thing you should learn is that we are all different, individual people and it is very unfair to tar us all with the same brush. Many of us have far greater things to worry about than whether our aesthetic is appealing to you or not. Sorry.

Secondly, if what you say about women is true, then surely you are adding to the problem by calling women who are not to your own taste ""ugly bitches""? Yeah, that'll really help. You yourself are being even more judgemental than Amy Klein or anyone else who criticises LDR.

""If you have seen a photo of Amy Klein, you'll quickly understand why she is so pissed! She has a face only a mother could love!""

So just because she's apparently not as ""beautiful"" as LDR, she's not allowed to have an opinion? Dare she state her opinion, if you are unhappy with it you will put it down to the fact that she is ""ugly"" rather than that you just both see things differently. If a male journalist were to write an unfavourable review of an attractive male singer, I doubt that you would reduce his entire argument down to jealously of the singer's looks.

So in summary: Take critics reviews less seriously. If you like the music, then who cares what others say? I disagree with most reviews about things that I like, but I shrug and move on.

Also, stop being so smug. Quit being so sexist and dismissive of women, and so nasty and judgemental about their appearances.

This is unfortunately true,at least for 99% of women.
And I think Lana Del Rey is very talented artist, no matter how she looks."
,Phntzm79,2012-03-16T22:35Z,"Katieanna, no not obsessed with anyone! far too jaded for that! Just disgusted with the state of the world and the animals that live in it! You make some good points and I agree that everyone is unique but the fact remains that females are just as competitive and can act as 'Ugly' as males. Females have for much of recorded history, been viewed as the weaker sex in terms of power, but the reality is quite the opposite as females exert their power in more subtle ways with words and scheming!Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and real beauty is much more than looks, it's a quality that is hard to define. But I know ugly when I see it and Amy Klein is more emotionally ugly than anything else! The fact remains, we live in a culture that values beauty above almost everything else! Amy Klein's opinion is wrong and that is a fact because I know Elizabeth Grant.She tried to intellectualize her opinion about LDR, but the truth is that she was just jealous of all the attention Elizabeth was getting!Amy Klein is an insecure person as evident from her attack.Have you studied psychiatry at all? If you had, you would know that people who denigrate others do so because they are lacking in self worth and try to make themselves feel better at the expense of others! My ugly bitch comment was related to Juliette Lewis who happens to be a crazy Scientologist so all her credibility is clearly out the window!People who believe in Scientology are delusional and quite frankly insane! Sociological studies have shown a statistically significant relationship between negative beauty image and irrational behavior! I will try to take your advice as you seem to be a thoughtful and intelligent person! Power to all who deserve it! Peace. Phantazm"
