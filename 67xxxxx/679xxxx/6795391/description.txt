The first Oldfield to be divided into more than two movements, it is the second longest work Oldfield has ever released. Originally released as a double album, the current CD issue fits the entire album onto one disc.

The album was re-released by Mercury Records on 25 July 2011 as part of a deal in which Oldfield's Virgin albums were transferred to Universal's label. Standard and Deluxe versions were available, as well as some signed vinyl copies from MikeOldfieldOfficial.com. The standard edition contained a remastered mix of the album, as well as "Guilty". The Deluxe edition contained the disc from the standard edition as well as a second disc containing singles and other smaller pieces.
