,Joe17Pro,2011-11-05T07:54Z,why does it turn into burn notice? i feel like im missing a part of it bc when sanctuary comes back on they the last part was 12 hours earlier.
,WoundedWolfgirl,2011-11-05T08:21Z,"Yeah, I dl'd from VTV and had the same problem as Joe. About ten minutes in, it switches from Sanctuary to this other show, and doesn't switch back till about the 15 minute mark. What's up with that?"
,highlander777,2011-11-05T08:23Z,Looks like it's missing about 5 minutes (10:43 - 15:42) when it switches over to Burn Notice.

,Giri20,2011-11-30T15:21Z,5 mins of Burn Notice in between and that part of Sanctuary is skipped. Don't download this rip.
