This is the complete set of The Matrix web comics series 1 thru 3 collected from The Matrix website before it was closed down. The series later went to print and was published in 2 volumes which introduced 3 new stories that were never posted on the website. In the early days of the website there was a very short story called The Man Who Knew Too Much which was removed from the website for unknown reasons and you can download it here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6796482/The_Matrix_web_comic_lost_story-The_Man_Who_Knew_Too_Much_by_W_W 

The Matrix collection of fictional works includes the trilogy of movies, anime videos and web comics as well as the video games which include The Matrix Online AKA MxO a (discontinued) MMORPG. The interesting thing about all of these works is that each one contributes to the storyline of The Matrix universe. For example, the games include movie footage filling in parts of the storyline or continuation of the story.
