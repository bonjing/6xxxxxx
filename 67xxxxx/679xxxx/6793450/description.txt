    For Masterchef's John Torode, British beef is his          
    passion. His quest is for heritage beef and is shocked    
    to discover that five breeds are on the critically       
    endangered list. He heads to Scotland to meet a beef      
    farmer dedicated to reviving the fortunes of the           
    original, traditional Aberdeen Angus. Amongst the         
    dishes he cooks in the Revival kitchen is a stupendous   
    slow roast four bone rib of beef complete with            
    Yorkshire puddings. If anything will persuade you to       
    try rare breed beef it will be this incredible Sunday     
    roast.                                                   
                                                              
    Seafood supporter Valentine Warner wants to reverse the    
    fortunes of British cockles and mussels. He discovers     
    that the vast majority of our mussels are exported, and  
    our cockle industry has shrunk to almost nothing. He is   
    determined to remind us that these nutritious and          
    plentiful fruits of the sea are fresh and available       
    right on our doorstep. To encourage us to start buying   
    them Valentine rustles up some delicious dishes in the    
    Revival kitchen to show us how easy our shellfish is to    
    cook.
