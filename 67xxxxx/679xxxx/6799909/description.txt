                        Confucious, THE DOCTRINE OF THE MEAN        

 Confucious was a member of the upper class, but he believed education and knowledge belonged to anyone who had the desire to learn.

He opened a school in his home, and legend has it, some of his poorer students lived with him.

He insisted on honesty, hard work, and teaching by example. 

He taught through conversation, by asking questions and expecting his pupils to find their own answers.

He wanted to prepare his students for public service, to develop compassion and respect for others.


    Real knowledge is to know the extent of one's ignorance .....Confucious
