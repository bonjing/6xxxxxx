,midge8,2011-11-04T01:09Z,This is the same as episode 22 so it is not episode 24
,ishmaelxx,2011-11-04T01:24Z,"This is episode 22, not 24."
,NutFlush,2011-11-04T11:36Z,"Yes, the same as episode 22 - different file size, but the same content!
So episode 23 ends with 12 players left > one more episode missing before 6th november :-)"
,TheRedSeal,2011-11-04T11:59Z,If youÂ´re in a hurry watching the last episodes before the final table go to youtube. There youÂ´ll find the last episodes in 15min clips
