The seed is only 90kb/s, so set it off to download/upload and forget about it for a few days, the seed isn't going anywhere and we'll all have it if we all share what we get with each other, there will be only 1 seed to release this."

I am very gratefull for your upload. I cant find the LivePE you seem to use for the installation. The folder LivePE.cd is empty. Can you please help me to find it. Thanks in advance."

The LivePE can be found in \Sources\boot.wim

Once you burn or create a Bootable USB disk with LastOS you'll have a hard time not finding the LivePE ;)"
