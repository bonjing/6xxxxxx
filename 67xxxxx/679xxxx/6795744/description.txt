For thousands of years, cultures across the globe have generated dark prophecies warning of doomsday scenarios that will bring the world to a cataclysmic end.
History reveals the most chilling of these prophecies in an attempt to find correlations between today s unfolding events and the predictions that may have foreshadowed them.
 

A broad range of experts deconstruct the prophecies of Nostradamus, as well as those contained in the bible, within mythology, in hieroglyphs and across other ancient texts, identifying remarkable correlations between today s unfolding events and prophesies of the past. Scientific evidence supporting the possible association between these prophecies and corresponding future scenarios will be uncovered, as the connection between the prophecy in question and prophecies from other cultures are explored.
