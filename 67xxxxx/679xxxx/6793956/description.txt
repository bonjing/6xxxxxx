This project started with a curiosity about the questionable circumstances surrounding the murder of Nick Berg, a US entrepreneur in Iraq who reportedly was in the wrong place at the wrong time. That curiosity led to research, which led to this report. Herein is a story â€“ a true story - that needs to be told. Even without the â€˜needâ€™ for it to be told, it represents a mesmerizing story of intrigue, assassination, mystery, scandal, fraud, theft, cover-up, and twisted patriotism. It is a true story about real individuals, the list of which includes terrorists, spies (KGB, Mossad, CIA, FBI), murder victims, assassinated corporate heads, politicians, billionaires, international bank board members, Russian Mafiya, American mafia, Nazis, an Imperial family, and even a Grand Master of the Teutonic Order (Templars) from the crusades! It is a story about money laundering, illegal gold, securities fraud, conflict diamonds, weapons trading, drugs, espionage and international stock market manipulation. It is a story about a several layers of faÃ§ade and false leads. It is a story in which the motive for the crime is measured in hundreds of billions of dollars, and has relatively little to do with oil. It is a story which explains the execution of seemingly innocent civilians in Iraq, the attack on the World Trade Center, and the attack on the US economy. It is a story that provides coherent meaning to what has been viewed as a collage of seemingly inconsistent, contradictory, inexplicable and just plain inconvenient facts.

The search for an acceptable explanation for the death of Nick Berg in the summer of 2004 engendered more questions than answers â€“ at first. The answers to these questions resulted in an interpretation of current events in the Middle East and the US that seemed far removed from any currently available explanations or hypotheses. The conclusion of this investigation is that Nick Berg was in all likelihood an agent of an Israeli secret service, executed by elements of the Israeli secret service, for reasons that are explained in the report. That hypothesis was so seemingly incredible that it begged â€œchallenging.â€ The hypothesis has been challenged numerous times, and each time there are multiple accounts in the media that provide answers that are consistent with the conclusions presented in the research. Examples of such â€œif â€“thenâ€ tests (such as if X happened, then shouldnâ€™t Y happen?) are:

â€¢ If the hypothesis used to explain the reasons for Nick Bergâ€™s execution is accurate, shouldnâ€™t it also be valid for subsequent executions by the same group? (It is!)

â€¢ If the Deutsche Bank was attempting to cover-up illicit gold movements, should one expect to find news which links the Deutsche Bank to illicit gold hoardings, measured in hundreds of tonnes? (There are such reports!)

â€¢ If the German banking cartel had responsibility for initiating the September 11 attack, should one be able to demonstrate their ability to activate Muslim and Mossad agents. (It can be demonstrated, with multiple connections.)

In none of the testing of hypotheses did the available information contradict one of the major conclusions of this paper: the official US government interpretation of terrorist activity confronting America is deliberately misleading, and the list of â€œbad guysâ€ is totally different than what the public has been led to believe.
