Kindly pray for me and share this torrent as much as you can! May Allah bless you, me and all of us alive and all of those before us! Islam is the only one true religion. Pray for people who are non muslims and thank Allah every day that you were born as one! Realize what value you hold as a Muslim. Pray 5 times a day and do not judge people. Allah is the greatest. Make him your friend. You will be successful if you made him happy. If you have all the money in the world and Allah is not happy with you, you are a failure and must take steps to make him happy. Allah is the greatest and the most merciful. I love Allah!
