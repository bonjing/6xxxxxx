The three goddesses Al Uzza, Al Manat and Allat.

The God/The Goddess = Allah/Allat.

Can a single god have a sex? Male (Allah) and Female (Allat).

If Allat and her sisters allowed Muhammad to return to Mecca from his exile in Ethiopia, are they not equal to the deity ""Allah"" too?

Salman Rushdie is the savour of all those souls that have been subjugated under the sole of the religious oppression of Islam, just as christianity have lost its grasp of the people to science. Think about all those people that lost their free will to the dogma of christianity and Islam!

Knowledge shall set the world free from tyranny! No more killing for false prophets! Poor peoples that are born into this bubble of ignorance to the real beauty of the fantastic cosmos! No imaginary deity can replace the awesomeness of  the REAL universe! Ignorance is NOT bliss! STOP killing in the name of ignorant religions!"
