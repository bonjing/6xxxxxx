The entire comic series current to Nov 2011 of the Walking Dead by Kirkman et. al. especially formatted for the kindle.

The kindle can read the original cbr files, but I found I had some trouble with them, so I converted the whole series to MOBI format which the kindle handles very well. It's not 100% perfect, but the convenience of reading the entire series on a kindle is worth it.

People often talk about the kindle's potential as a comic-book reader, with color often mentioned as a drawback. TWD's in glorious black-and-white, and looks great on my device.

These aren't my scans, kudos to the original scanners - their details remain in the files.
