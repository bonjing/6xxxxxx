There is a sceneline torrent but the seeder stopped at 52%. I was able to get this episode from single-source downloads and the video stops at 1:15:31. At least you get to see the actual performances before it stops.

At 1:15:31 the picture freezes on the last season's winner's performance. From there out it's just the elimination announcement. So, if you don't mind just listening to the results then I will upload this episode and get it on here later tonight.

The problem isn't with this version I acquired, I believe it's a problem with the actual recording or conversion process.
