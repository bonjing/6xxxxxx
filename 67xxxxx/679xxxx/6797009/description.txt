Drawn from studio sessions, live performances, and rare tv and radio broadcasts, the box set from Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble, and covers the years 1977 to 1990, chronicling everything from the bandâ€™s early sessions up through their penultimate performance at Alpine Valley. The members of Stevie Ray Vaughanâ€™s band, Double Trouble, consisted of Tommy Shannon (bass) and Chris Layton (drums), later joined by Reese Wynans (keyboards) in 1985. 

In addition to three audio CDs, this Texas-sized tribute also includes a DVD (digital video disc) which features five never-before-released performances from public televisionâ€™s "Austin City Limits" from 1989, taped one week after Vaughanâ€™s 35th birthday, and less than a year before the gifted young guitaristâ€™s life was taken away. These performances were captured during the regular taping, but due to time constraints, were never aired.

This is a monumental, career-encompassing project that begins with a previously unreleased track from 1977 of Vaughan playing lead guitar and singing lead with Paul Ray and the Cobras ("Thunderbird"). The set cover virtually every year of his career (in depth, with multiple tracks) right up to his next-to-last concert on August 25, 1990, at the Alpine Valley festival in East Troy, Wisconsin ("Things (That) I Used To Do," "Let Me Love You Baby," "Leave My Girl Alone"). On August 27th, at 1:00 a.m., the helicopter that was carrying Vaughan from the festival back to Chicago crashed within seconds after takeoff.
