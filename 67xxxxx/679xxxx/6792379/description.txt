This is my second try to upload this torrent.


Some info on the torrent:

This material has never been released on CD and probably never will.
All the recordings were mastered using Adobe Audition to manually
remove the cracks en crackles so they are now more or less like the
original masters. And of course the flacs were tagged at the end of
process so they should easily blend in in your current collection. 


The torrent contains the following albums:

- 1984 Jam Science
- 1984 Jam Science (Y Records)
- 1984 Knowledge, Power, Truth And Sex
- 1984 Mercy Dash (12 inch)


Hope you enjoy my hard work and even more the work of the band. And
don\'t forget to buy Shriekback\'s music which has been released on CD.
