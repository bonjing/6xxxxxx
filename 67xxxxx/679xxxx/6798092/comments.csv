,listenherenow,2011-11-06T05:21Z,"what happened?   is this one different from the one I loaded a week and a half ago? 

  the comments are gone if this is the same one."
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-11-06T21:05Z,This is the same one as last weeks. I needed to edit the title and the only way was to delete it and re-upload it.

,urieaal,2011-11-07T08:08Z,"@Toilet_sniffer_V hay man i couldnt find a way to send you a message through tpb, so i just wanna say thanks for all the torrents seriously been looking for all the Star trek Dvdrips, was going to actually buy them but there 300-500$usd a piece way to expensive for me.

even the used ones are still 200$+ but i just wanted to tell you thanks saved me a ton of money i dont have honestly. i would purchase them if they were'nt so expensive but i dont nor do i know to many people with 300-500$ to just through around when you have bills XD. 

Thanks again."
,urieaal,2011-11-07T08:09Z,throw not through lol XD its late..
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-11-07T15:11Z,I don't do 175MB files. I've already done Lie To Me. You can see what else I've done by clicking on my user name.
,Norris-sirroN,2011-11-10T20:33Z,"I'm assuming if this is a DVDRip that it is uncensored.  Is that right? 
Thanks!"
,acexnz,2011-11-11T10:17Z,Are DVD commentaries included?  If not where can I find them?
,malcolmjb,2011-11-16T23:01Z,"Hey Sniffer me ole mate, Do you have weeds all available seasons?"
,voyeurman,2011-11-21T05:42Z,i am assuming SEASON 4 is NOT dvdrip as its just recently finished?
,voyeurman,2011-11-21T05:51Z,"By the way, Season 3 episode 4 got  the wrong audio. That episode got audio from episode 3. 

I was talking about ur previous upload, Breaking Bad Season 1, 2, & 3 DVD Boxset + Extras (Minisodes etc) DVDRip HDTV.

Just wondering if u have corrected already?

Thanks again for your upload!!! Beautiful!!!"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-11-21T21:41Z,"Yes season 3 is perfect. The HDTV rips were replaced by DVDRips. I always use DVDRips where possible, it's only current seasons where I have to use HDTV rips as the DVD's aren't available when the seasons ends. "
,Dutchy1982,2011-11-27T09:04Z,So should I download this or not? People are talking about season 3 being stuffed with the wrong audio. Has it been fixed or not???
,StanleyTheManly,2011-11-30T02:24Z,Season 3 is good so far (I'm 3 episodes in).  The only thing is that it took me about 11 hours to download season 3.  
,Nevodaniel,2011-11-30T08:02Z,thank you for the share! Downloading was abit slow but its finally done. Will continue seeding!! :)
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-11-30T16:57Z,"As I've already said, all of season 3 is perfect as is everything else. Last year I did a different torrent with season 3 from HDTV rips and one of the episodes had the wrong audio. THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH THIS ONE. IT IS PERFECT.
I'll say it again, this is all spot on. The comments were relating to a completely different torrent with completely different files."
,StanleyTheManly,2011-12-01T01:05Z,"Season 3 is absolutely perfect.  It's just as good as all seasons 1 and 2.  They are exactly the same.  No audio fuck ups... nothing.  Thanks Toilet_Sniffer_V for the upload, it's most appreciated."
,Nevodaniel,2011-12-03T09:21Z,"Okay, so after watching three seasons and now im on the fourth, i have to say, there is no problem with the audio and this is a very nice share! Thanks! Just only wish it was alittle better quality since i got 1080p and i can see its not perfect HD. Still, nevertheless, great torrent and share, thank you!"
,Diagoro,2011-12-03T16:47Z,Are all seasons uncensored?
,Diagoro,2011-12-03T16:55Z,"Just to clarify, are all of these uncensored?"
,moogbert,2011-12-04T08:46Z,"@Diagaro

Yes, it appears to be uncensored."
,nameless.twisted,2011-12-09T03:47Z,Seed please! I can't believe I'm just getting 7 seeds... 
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-12-09T04:44Z,"I've also done a bluray season 1, 2 & 3 of Breaking Bad for those who want more resolution. They're big files though. The DVDRips are good enough and a lot smaller."
,Asmael,2011-12-25T18:24Z,do these rips have hardcoded subs in the spanish spoken scenes in season 3?
,Nekhetyo,2012-01-01T14:40Z,"Are the subtitles with this torrent? I mean for the Spanish scenes. Previous uploads of BrBa have had some sort of encoded subtitle in the video itself, but during the El Paso scene, there is no subtitles when the two officers are talking about Hank."
,Wyldefang,2012-01-02T07:46Z,I believe there is an issue with s03e04 - Green Light. Either the audio is way out of sync or it's a different audio source. Or it's just me :P
,wcestlox,2012-01-04T03:27Z,"No, it doesn't look like there are subtitles for any of the Spanish scenes. It'd be nice if you could fix that, and thanks for the download, this show is great!"
,radical.ralph,2012-01-08T06:29Z,"Are these uncensored??


Are there subtitles available for ur rips????"
,tucotight,2012-01-28T13:57Z,"Fantastic torrent, will seed, but there are no hard-coded or otherwise subtitles, which makes many scenes pointless. Hank in El Paso, the Danny Trejo scenes, the narcocorrido in Negro y Azul.

Anybody know where matching subtitles or the like could be found?

Will seed :)"
,megz2608,2012-02-09T14:08Z,Loving this sniffer .. Any news on subs or do ya no anybody thats is willing to translate for us and post it on here or FB .??????  
,midurix,2012-02-09T17:19Z,Season 3 Episode 3 is rather hard to understand with all the Spanish and no subtitles in this rip!!!!!!! haha
,panzent,2012-02-29T01:16Z,come on guys SEEED!!!!
,druhklam_orbowetsch,2012-03-31T13:25Z,"Many many thanx, you rule!!!!"
,benrf,2012-04-08T02:57Z,no subtitles. great upload mate but no subtitles sucks entirely. not good enough really. anyone who has them please provide info for everyone accordingly....cheers 
,NordicF1,2012-04-18T17:50Z,Thank you
,ruther24,2012-04-29T13:11Z,what video format are these in?
,Validated,2012-04-30T06:23Z,"@ruther24

The episodes are all .avi files, and the extras are all .mp4 files. Great torrent package as always TSV. Keep up the good work."
,jtwood1978,2012-05-06T06:47Z,is there anywere i can get subs for this series?
