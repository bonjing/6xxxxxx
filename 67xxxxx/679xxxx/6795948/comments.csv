GO VEGAN"
,greatmoviewatcher,2012-01-04T15:08Z,"So many small-minded people like Lupin out there who don't care.. until you go vegetarian / vegan, you don't realize that meat-eaters are part of a cult. I always thought it was the vegetarians that were part of some religion when I ate meat years ago, but once you are vegetarian you quickly realize that meat-eaters have irrational faith in meat as if it were a god. I don't bother telling people I'm vegetarian because you can't change the ignorant, and meat-eaters will just see you as significantly different and treat you differently... and ask you over and over about it, and say how much they like the idea, right before they eat a burger. People are just a waste of time. Great movie but it will probably just cause the shallow minded to say its great right before they do nothing about it. "

,spunkster,2012-01-22T04:56Z,"Omnivores are 100x more judgemental about vegetarians than the other way around. People know a vegetarian diet is healthier. But when you eat in front of them, it forces them to confront their own behavior, which is threatening. The less mature of them react through insults and mockery."
