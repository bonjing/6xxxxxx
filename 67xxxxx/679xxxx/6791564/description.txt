[/b][/color] Rab C.
Nesbitt is a drunken, string vested lay about who lives with his long suffering wife Mary and his two sons in the working class area of Govan in Glasgow.
When he's not getting drunk with his pals that include the devious, womanizing Jamesie Cotter.
He's offering his philosophical outlook on life to whoever will listen.
