,Ipmark,2011-11-12T01:36Z,"First, you have to install the package on the PC.
Then, send maps to GPS with MapInstall."
,petrulp,2011-12-06T23:08Z,"hi 
any guide for loading these maps in my nuvi255? I am seeing 3 torrents available for europe maps each one with different files. A link to an 101 how to replace maps in your garmin will be useful. I have original maps but now I have to update and it s quite expensive . Thanks"
,webspyder,2011-12-07T15:07Z,"I  have successfully D-l and installed the other (3.9GB) Garmin NT 2012:30 (I loaded the WesternEurope files to a SD card, in a Garmin folder) and installed to the GPS) 
The files here in this torrent, are they files that can upgrade (flash) the Garmin unit? I have a n端vi 255. If it is possible to flash the unit then I don't need the SD Card... Hopfylly you can answer me ;-) Thanks in advace "

http://www.mydigitallife.info/download-garmin-mapsource-for-free-and-install-without-media/
Just install mapsource first and then install this torrent to your pc. When you open mapsource you have the unlocked map and can transfer selected maps to your device."
