Volume normalization is fulfilled with help of the Mp3 Normalizer, FLAC normalizer and Wav Normalizer.

The volume level is represented graphically and in percentage.

The Wav normalization, FLAC normalization and test is fulfilled on a peak level (Peak Normalization) and on an average level (RMS normalization). The Mp3 normalization and test is fulfilled on an average level (RMS normalization).

The Mp3 normalization is fulfilled under standard Replay Gain.

The Mp3 Normalizer allows to modify a volume of a scanned file directly without usage APEv2 tags.

The Sound Normalizer also allows editing ID3 tags (build-in Mp3, FLAC ID3 Tag Editor) with support for ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags, converting Wav to Mp3, Mp3 to Mp3 and Mp3 to Wav files (build-in Wav Converter, Mp3 Converter) using Lame MP3 Encoder 3.98, converting FLAC to Mp3, converting FLAC to Wav, converting Wav to FLAC, listening Mp3, FLAC and Wav files using the build-in audio player.
