,firegyor,2011-11-03T22:57Z,"They might, but other's won't. Its a matter of personal beliefs, and if you don't agree, its nbd."
,firegyor,2011-11-03T22:58Z,"I appreciate the reference though, I will have to check out some of their material."
,jyanendra,2011-11-06T01:27Z,Thanks - but is either module 7 or 8 repeated with the exclusion of the other?
,firegyor,2011-11-06T14:59Z,"Unfortunately, yes, module 8 is repeated twice. I've been working for the past few days trying to find module 7, and I'll be sure to let you know when I do. Sorry for any troubles you might have, but I've been through the whole series and missing module 7 did not affect me at allâŚEnjoy the download!"
