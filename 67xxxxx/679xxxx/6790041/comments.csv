It appears to fix the 12.0.3 crack+update issue from yesterday some people experienced which was the game crashing at the staff screen...

But it now has another bug, not showing the teams tab in leagues or weekly/monthly awards."

,gilatino,2011-11-03T11:54Z,"@cfc1991 : 
SKIDROW don't have a site. They are a scene group and scene groups don't have websites. All sites claiming to be SKIDROW's are fan sites."
,snozzlebanger,2011-11-04T19:57Z,Seems like a fair few people are having problems installing this and are getting the error - no berkelium.dll file. The fixes don't seem to work either so whats the problem?
