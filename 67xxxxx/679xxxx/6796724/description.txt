PLOT:

With barely anything to live for, Emman Toledo (Aga Muhlach), a former dancer, is just about to start his life all over again. He holds the good memories of his past dearly, knowing he will never be able to bring back his better days. An unlikely opportunity comes up when he is assigned to be the dance instructor for the upcoming Governor's Ball of the powerful political family of the Evelinos, a chance for him to rekindle his lost passion.
It will be at this ball where the engagement of the governor's son Dylan Evelino (Jake Cuenca), and Cedes Fernandez (Angel Locsin) will be announced. Despite her hatred for the dirty politics, Cedes has no choice but to succumb to the decision of Dylan out of her indebtedness towards the family.
Emman is drawn towards Cedes from the first time she catches his eye. As their lives intertwine through dance, Emman and Cedes find themselves resisting an affair: one that holds the truths to their painful pasts, and the memories of a boundless love. Pursuing their feelings for each other will only set fire to the dangers and trappings of their love, so much so that their love could cost them their lives. Can the strength of their love overcome the powers of the dangers surrounding them?
From acclaimed director Olivia Lamasan comes the 18th anniversary offering of Star Cinema: a story of two lovers ready to risk everything... in the name of love.
