,raenkae,2011-11-04T00:52Z,"Oh. Thank you, thank you, thank you. dohduhdah, It feels like you are a king of knowledge ;)

Just what i need. I see that they have released a lot of new ttc-courses. Hope that they will come to PB eventually, especially the video-course of unexpected Economics and secrets of human perception.

By the way dohduhdah! Have you found any new math tutor courses yet? Electronics is my major and I truly need that and the hp50-calculator tutor too.. Any luck finding those?

Thank you for your contributions so far. I know that you have helped a lot of studying people, myself included. Too bad that as an european i have difficulties buying the math tutor courses, otherwise i had done that by now...."

No new math tutor courses yet, sorry. But 'unexpected economics' and 'secrets of human perception' are in the pipeline and it looks like they will be available here within a matter of one or two weeks."
,raenkae,2011-11-06T21:39Z,Thank you for your efforts dohduhdah. What would we do without you? ;)

,mikeyt123,2012-05-06T06:13Z,"When I load the Magnet link, the folder shows up as empty. Has this been removed?

If there is anyway to get this active I would be happy to open my archive to you and seed or transfer anything I have that you would like (I have over 5TB of audio and video courses and similar books.  

I see the compressed torrent is working, it's 5x smaller in total than this.

AND this is the only one I have been able to locate who's thread has not been removed....

Will keep an eye on the comments here for any progress. Thanks. 

-Just lost a drive with this and really want it back, screw the HD recovery, that's not reliable enough..."
