Giggles Part Two | Nyssa Nevers  +Pics

Nyssa Nevers can really make some noise. She cries like a baby when PD starts to whip her. Her screams even echo though the rafters of the barn. When he is being nice she is no quieter, though. She begs and pleads for him to stop no matter what he is doing. Nothing is ever good enough for her. If that is the way that it is going to be then he really has no incentive to be anything but cruel to her. If she cannot appreciate his good moods then she will need to suffer through his bad ones.
