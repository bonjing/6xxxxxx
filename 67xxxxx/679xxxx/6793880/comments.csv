                  Notes: I keept all the extras and encoded it insted of removing it and keeping the video Untouched.
                         I did it so that the kids get everything on the dvd it gave a good bitrate anyways so why not let the kids have the whole dvd :)
                         Enjoy kids! hope you like it."
