Something a little different from what I normally read or UL. Steve Earle's I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive.  Steve Earle is a rock/Texas country musician who recently has been a character on HBO's The Wire and Treme.  As for the book itself it should come as no surprise that it involves substance abuse and seedy areas.  As wikipedia describes it:

The novel is set in San Antonio in 1963, and tells the story of a defrocked doctor and morphine addict. The doctor makes a living by performing illegal abortions and is haunted by the ghost of Hank Williams, with whom he was traveling when Williams died of an overdose.

I just finished reading it and I would definitely recommend it for any fans of the wire as well as casual fans.  A very cool read.
Enjoy and seed
