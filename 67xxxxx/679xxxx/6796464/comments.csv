,Trenaway,2011-11-08T20:14Z,"A10 V10 Thanks as usaul BOZX. The movie however is not that good. I like the original way better. The background of the story was good, just that they ruined it by the way the movie was presented. Terrible acting, along with directing of this movie. Could had been a lot better with a director that knew what they were doing! "

Video is great, but sometimes the image freezes.
Movie doesn't exactly suck, but the story is extremely childish, with lots of gaps.
Thanx again."
