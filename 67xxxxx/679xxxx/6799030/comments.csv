,xenoFLASH,2011-11-06T14:29Z,Are the subs hardcoded? Just wondering.
[T],kriss_kringle,2011-11-06T16:27Z,Do you even read the description?! Just wondering.
,xenoFLASH,2011-11-07T06:08Z,"Yes, I do. No where it is mentioned that they are or not. 'Subtitle: Enlgish,Romanian' tells me nothing except that you can't spell English."
[T],kriss_kringle,2011-11-07T12:39Z,"Well,actually it does tell you but if your tiny little brain can't understand that, it's not my problem.First of all, it says english,romanian, therefore there are 2 subtitles which makes hardcoded subtitles impossible, so that's strike one for you.If you did read the description and still went ahead and asked that stupid question, then that's strike two.If you were still confused after that,you could have opened the torrent to see if it does have subtitles or not, so that's strike three and guess what smartass,you're OUT! Next time please think before you ask these kind of questions.I have never ripped a movie that has hardcoded subtitles and I never will, unless I can't find any subtitles at all for a movie and it's the last resort.Hope that clears it for you once and for all."
,xenoFLASH,2011-11-07T13:03Z,"Was that so hard? All you had to say was, ""I have never ripped a movie that has hardcoded subtitles and I never will, unless I can't find any subtitles at all for a movie and it's the last resort."" Thank you for being an ass-hole."
[T],kriss_kringle,2011-11-07T13:26Z,"How am I the asshole when you ask something that's stated in the description?You said you read it but you didn't actually ""read"" it,you know what I mean?I'm really tired of telling people to read the description.If I don't include one then they'll moan because there isn't a description so that's a no-no but there is one and people still don't read it!! It's just a battle you can't win with some dudes around here.I know I seemed harsh but you're like the 100th person who doesn't read it correctly.Take it the logical way,how can there be 2 hardcoded subtitles?"
,xenoFLASH,2011-11-07T13:57Z,"I have seen it before(not two hardcoded subs, but one hardcoded and one not). I enjoy many of the movies you upload. Hoped to add another to the collection.
Also, I was taught that asking a question is not a bad thing(at least I didn't make a request). :)"
[T],kriss_kringle,2011-11-07T14:20Z,"That's true,you do get points for not making requests!:)) Also, having a hardcoded subtitle and a softcoded one make the movie confusing (if you add the softcoded one too).Glad you enjoy the movies,stay tuned because we're not gonna be lowering the bar anytime soon,lots of great ones are still to come!"

,xenoFLASH,2011-11-10T00:45Z,@jayawarden: Like I care what you think. Maybe you should read all the comments and you'll see why I asked.
