,Vicar in a Tutu,2011-11-10T16:38Z,"Just curious why you added Hiren's BootCD v10.0 instead of v15.0?

Otherwise thanks a million! Although I now use Windows 7 mainly, I have some older computers/laptops that just 'need' XP. Been using your TinyXP releases for years, this time i'm going to try out Tiny2003. Keep up the good work! "
,DarthBubba,2011-11-11T06:23Z,"Thanks, eXP!

Great contribution, as always!"
,marmat78,2011-11-25T13:21Z,"@ LegendofLeague: If you figured it out, could you plz post a comment/guide on how to make eXPerience releases bootable from USB.

@ eXPer1ence: Thanks for so many great releases! What boot system/files have you used to have the CD/DVD boot up into menu? Need to know in order to make a bootable USB... Any other tips on that subject?"

,SSVegeta,2011-12-31T23:40Z,"This is really great, it runs sooooooooooooooo fast and I really have no problems with it except........ when I tried to install and run unreal 2K4 it keeps giving me an error saying: The application has requested the runtime to terminate it an in unusual way. Please contact teh applications support team for more information"" this same game installed perfectly on my moms computer but not on mine only difference being that I'm running your custom win xp and she has the official slow as shit one.

,gergith,2012-01-02T13:16Z,I adore your releases :D This will be fun to try out. Any chance you have a new 2003 server 64bit?
,fakenstein666,2012-01-07T22:08Z,"For your next release ou could add slitaz linux (30mb).
http://www.slitaz.org/en/
This way there could be live os on the cd and we could go online for help and do other things."
,LinuxDeskIsFree,2012-01-23T03:37Z,"Just wanted to say THANK YOU for this!  I have a Dell PC that is out of warranty and did not come with a physical WinXP CD and the ""recovery"" partition was accidentally deleted.  Installed TinyXP, and now it's faster and better than it ever was! And XP is still supported by Micro$oft for over 2 more years! I also followed the OptimizeXP guide to make it perfect, along with dual-booting one of the excellent free Linux distributions..."

,bloodhand,2012-04-19T10:30Z,"Hey eXPer1ence. Using Tiny7 Rev01 for ages :D still the best windows yet. BUT when are you going to release TINY7 SP1 with all the updates `till 2012 ? I can't install IE9 on Tiny7 Rev01 and IE8 is giving me lots of errors. I've been trying to strip a Win7 SP1 to make it just like your Tiny7, but it still lags and takes up a lot of space."
