 CHOOSING DRIVERPACKS...

 On all installations of Windows - when the PC reboots for the first
 time during installation (just after Windows files have copied) then
 you will see a driver selector pop up. You have one minute to choose
 which drivers you want to include, if you let the timer count down,
 then the default drivers will be included which are: Chipset, CPU,
 Lan Ethernet, Sound and Wireless LAN. If you want to include the 
 graphics drivers then you will need to be there to tick the three
 boxes on the driver selector.


 UNATTENDED INSTALLATIONS...

 All six Windows installations are fully unattended. After installation,
 you should open the eXPerience desktop folder and then open the "Keyboard
 Settings" folder. With these unattended installations, all keyboards are
 set to "US English".


 WINDOWS UPDATES...

 All of these installations include all of the required "security only"
 hotfixes, updating the OS to October 2011. Later versions of Internet
 Explorer and Windows Media Player are not added. This includes the
 original IE6 and original WMP9/10 but they are also securely patched
 with their respective updates, to October 2011.

 ________________________________________________________________________

 - Windows XP Professional SP3

 This is the complete Windows XP Professional SP3 x86 updated to October
 2011 with security hotfixes. This edition has the original IE6 and WMP9.
 Everything is updated. Nothing at all is removed.


 - TinyXP Rev12

 This is a cut down version of Windows XP Professional SP3 x86 updated
 to October 2011 with security hotfixes. This edition has the original
 IE6 and WMP9. Everything is updated. Many items are removed in this
 version, which is approximately half the size of full Windows XP.
 This version removes Chinese, Japanese and Korean languages, Movie
 Maker, Internet Information Services (IIS) and various other items.
 To check exactly what is removed, open the "Last Session.ini" file
 here on the DVD: "XP02\$OEM$\Last Session.ini" and look under the
 section "[Components]" to see what is removed.


 - MicroXP v0.87

 This is a very small version of Windows XP Professional SP3 x86
 updated to October 2011 with security hotfixes. This edition does
 not include Internet Explorer or Windows Media Player at all.
 Everything is updated. This edition is about as cut down as it can
 be and is only intended for gaming and squeezing life out of the oldest
 computers, however, many people use this version full time and use all
 the same programs and play all the same games as on full XP. Programs
 most likely not to work with this edition are gigantic Microsoft apps
 like Microsoft Office. Other software that relies on MDAC or the Jet
 Database will not work, because  those items are removed. This version
 of Windows is less than a quarter of the size of full Windows. An extreme
 amount of components are removed, to check exactly what is removed, open
 the "Last Session.ini" file here on the DVD: "XP03\$OEM$\Last Session.ini"
 and look under the section "[Components]" to see what is removed. Then
 also look under the section "[RemoveFiles]" to see individual files also
 removed.

 - Windows Server 2003 SP2

 The three versions of Windows Server 2003 are roughly the same as the
 above XP versions in terms of what is removed. So the full Server 2003
 has nothing at all removed, Tiny2003 has the same items taken out as
 TinyXP has (but UDDI and Windows Media Services are removed in 2003)
 and the same goes for Micro2003, it has pretty much the same files
 removed as MicroXP does.

 WHY IS SERVER 2003 INCLUDED ANYWAY?

 I found all the way back in 2003 when Windows Server 2003 was released
 that it runs faster and better than XP. This is something home users
 simply do not know anything about, but once you try Server 2003 you
 will realize Explorer is faster, copying files is faster, loading and
 using programs and games is faster... but the catch is a few programs
 will not install on a Server (or as they sometimes call it a ".NET
 Server" operating system). Luckily these are mostly blocks on .MSI
 files and there are included fixes in the desktop eXPerience folder
 to get around this blocking of installation. Once installed, the apps
 work just as they do on XP and it is often the case that the only
 reason you couldn't use the program on Server 2003 was the MSI file
 that installs the program was coded to deliberately refuse to install
 on a Server operating system. For EXE files there is also a fix,
 using "Application Verifier" to fool whatever you're installing
 into thinking the OS is XP SP3.

 Server 2003 on this DVD is intended to be used as a workstation OS
 and all three installations of Server 2003 are tweaked that way.

 ________________________________________________________________________

 To install Windows from this DVD, set your PC up so it will boot from
 the CD/DVD-ROM in the PC's BIOS.

 You do not need any product key for any of the installations.

 DRIVERS

 You have the following drivers included:

 - Chipset --------&gt; (included by default)
 - CPU ------------&gt; (included by default)
 - Graphics -------&gt; (NOT included by default!)
 - LAN Ethernet ---&gt; (included by default)
 - SATA -----------&gt; (included by default)
 - Sound ----------&gt; (included by default)
 - Wireless LAN ---&gt; (included by default)

 When the PC reboots for the first time during installation (just after
 Windows files have copied) then you will see a driver selector pop up.

 If you do not catch this in time, or are not sat at the PC when this
 driver selector has timed out (after one minute) then all the drivers
 will extract - bear in mind, this will take a few gigabytes of disk
 space. If you do not want to extract the driverpacks, make sure you
 are sat at the PC after the files have copied and it reboots.

 The alternative to that is to make your own standalone ISO from the
 ISO folder on the DVD. This way there is no timer, or driverpacks.
