This is a beautiful album. Steve Tilston is one of the UK's finest acoustic singer-songwriters and a consummate guitarist. For some it would be a huge artistic risk to approach a whole album of "different" material but Steve is able to cross musical genres with skill and deftness - the trademark of someone who knows his craft well. Great integrity and artistry is evident here in his treatment of a carefully-chosen selection of traditional folk songs. The delivery and accompanying arrangements make this an album accessible to all - you don't have to be a traditional folk fan to like folk and this is the kind of quality and wow-factor that can make the difference for the "I'm-waiting-to-be-convinced" doubter. And while you're thinking about it you ought to check out Steve's other albums for a good helping of the best in English acoustic singer-songwriters, that shamefully overlooked but once-discovered, never-forgotten species.
