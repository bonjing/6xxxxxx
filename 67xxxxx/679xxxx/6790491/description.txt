Tomorrowâ€™s winning â€œIntelligent Enterprisesâ€ will bring together far more diverse sources of data, analyze it in more powerful ways, and deliver immediate insight to decision-makers throughout the organization. Today, however, most companies fail to apply the information they already have, while struggling with the complexity and costs of their existing information environments.

 

In this book, a team of IBMâ€™s leading information management experts guide you on a journey that will take you from where you are today toward becoming an â€œIntelligent Enterprise.â€

 

Drawing on their extensive experience working with enterprise clients, the authors present a new, information-centric approach to architecture and powerful new models that will benefit any organization. Using these strategies and models, companies can systematically unlock the business value of information by delivering actionable, real-time information in context to enable better decision-making throughout the enterpriseâ€“from the â€œshop floorâ€ to the â€œtop floor.â€
