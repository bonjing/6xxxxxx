The ten year war resulted in huge territorial gains for Northern Peopleâ€™s Republic Azbaristan and their controlling political party, the Northern Peopleâ€™s Party, giving them control of the country except for the oil-rich province that is all thatâ€™s left of South Azbaristan.
The Southern Azbaristan Democratic Front of Soyth Azbaristan has only managed to hold off the North with the aid of the West, which supplies military and logistical aid to the tiny state in return for the oil exports from their vast reserves. Players will have the chance to assume the role of squadron leader Razor and lead the fight to reunify Azbaristan and protect the Westâ€™s vital interests.
