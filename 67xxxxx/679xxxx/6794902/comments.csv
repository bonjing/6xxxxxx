,mkypr,2012-04-25T13:26Z,"Same Problem here! I tried all Serial Numbers as instructed above .. none of them works!
Please if anyone has a new one .. post it!"
,sg_vibhu,2012-04-26T21:07Z,"Well Guys there is a solution.
But we need a KEY for that first.
In my case and may be with many others, this would have happpened that the key was accepted first but after some days it became invalid. I got a solution for that problem.

For that we need to block the app. with windows firewall. Those who say that windows block all applications by default, should know that it does not and thats why the app calls home and checklist the serial and with many users using same serial the serial becomes invalid.

For those who dont know how to do this here are the instructions:-
1. Open windows firewall with advanced security in start menu (search index).
2. In the left most column, at top, you will find inbound and outbound rules.
3. As I mentioned earlier we need a working key for this first, so after entering the key when powersuite is fully functional,you need to do the next step.
4. Open 'outbound rules' and click on 'new rule' in right column at the top.
5. Choose 'program' and click next.
6. Then choose 'This Program path' and browse to the folder where you installed powersuite. (by default it is - c:program files(x86)powersuitepowersiute.exe). Then  click on powersuite.exe ,and click next.
7. Then you need to chose ""BLOCK THE CONNECTION"" and next.
8. Tick all the profiles (domain, private, public) and then next.
9. Specify a name and finish.
10. Your outbound rule is created.

With this outbound rule the app has no access to internet and cannot call home. It is a permanent solution. Also you cannot update your powersuite     but that is not a big deal, as you can download latest apps. from its home website - www.uniblue.com .(You need to do some extra work if you are getting a program for free).

This method may also avoid blacklisting (i am not sure) as the app cant call home and cannot specify the key.

But as I previously mentioned and is mentioning for the third time , we first need a working key for this.

If you find any problem with this method please comment."
,sg_vibhu,2012-04-26T21:12Z,Please guys if you have a working key share with us (if you want). But I garraunte that with my method there wont be any problem once your powersuite becomes completely functionable with a valid key.
,sg_vibhu,2012-04-26T21:24Z,"PS-VY64W-YQBKK-H7Q8P-HZSTT-7JG­­­GK-KDNMH

Here is one more working serial guys. Just got from another ""tazz's"" torrent, katph. Type it manually and also i would recommend that you create a inbounb rule with an outbound rule to completely disconnect powersuite from callin home and checklistilg the key. PLEASE do it to avoid any further inconvinience."
,tp003,2012-04-28T18:09Z,Thanks for the upload. Did have trouble with the serials but got past it. Regarding sg_vibhu's comment on blocking the connection for uniblue to call home using outbound rules....does this blocking method work in XP? I couldn't find the path.  
,sg_vibhu,2012-04-29T20:31Z,"sorry ""tp003"" not able to find out a way for xp. May be just try searching on google. It may help."
