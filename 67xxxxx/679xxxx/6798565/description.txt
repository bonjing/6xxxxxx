Louse Hay - Receiving Prosperity.avi

Are you as wealthy and successful as you'd like to be?  Whether you realize it or not, your level of wealth and success reflects exactly what you believe you deserve.

In this lively discussion with her audience, Louise explains how we can use our mind-power to attract anything we want into our livesâ€”more money, a rewarding career, fulfilling relationships, and more fun!
 
Feeling "not good enough," fearing success, and accepting our parents' negative attitudes and beliefs about money are a few of the feelings and patterns that can prevent us from having a prosperous life.  Once we stop our self-criticism and learn to move beyond our limitations, we will begin attracting more "good" into our lives.
