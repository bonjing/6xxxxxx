,I.Me.,2011-11-08T19:56Z,Seed pls .. m getting 5kb/s .. dont stop it the second u finish downloading ...
,lillem4n,2011-11-08T20:22Z,I downloaded this because of the quality reviews... but the video is more like 7/10. It is very highly compressed. I see no reason to download this compared to a normal divx DVD-rip.
,albokid89,2011-11-08T21:55Z,"awesome movie, reminds me of ""Prince of Persia"" if you liked that you'll like this as well. Thank you +1 

p.s. subs were way off and on night scenes quality was a bit off but hey it is what it is, thanks again!"

Excellent movie quality. I would like to note that the subtitles are inaccurate. They are paraphrased from what is being said, and they have some inaccuracies. Pretty minor all things considered. 

Thank you for posting this. I have wanted to watch it for a while now."
