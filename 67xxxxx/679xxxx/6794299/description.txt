Jacqueline Marie "Jackie" Evancho (pronounced /iËËˆvÃ¦Å‹koÊŠ/ ee-vang-koh; born April 9, 2000) is an American child singer described as a classical crossover artist. After entering some talent competitions, issuing an independent album, Prelude to a Dream, and attracting interest on YouTube, she gained wider popularity in 2010 with her performances in the fifth season of the America's Got Talent (AGT) competition at the age of 10, and finishing in second place. With the subsequent release of her O Holy Night EP, she became the best-selling debut artist of 2010 and the youngest top-10 debut artist in history,[3] and she went on in June 2011 to contend for the top position on American album charts with her Sony Music debut, entitled "Dream With Me".
Evancho impressed conductor Tim Janis and musician and record producer David Foster, who each included her in their concerts beginning in 2009. Among many post-AGT appearances, she performed at the 2010 National Christmas Tree lighting event in Washington, D.C., with President Obama present. Evancho is the ambassador for Mission: Humane, a Humane Society program that encourages children's involvement in the protection of animals. Foster produced her album Dream With Me and a subsequent PBS special and U.S. concert tour in the summer and autumn of 2011. Her forthcoming full-length Christmas album, Heavenly Christmas, is scheduled for release on November 1, 2011.
