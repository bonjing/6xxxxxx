Moorish Sc Tm of Am=US group founded in the early 20th century by Timothy Drew of California. He said it was a sect of Islam but he also drew inspiration from Buddhism, Christianity, Freemasonry, Gnosticism and Taoism. A core belief is there were Negroid-looking native-americans (not from africa) later confused with African-americans. They call themselves ""Asiatics"", ""indigenous Moors"", ""American Moors"" not ""African Americans"" or ""African Moors"" (Who once conquered Spain).
He said a high priest of Egyptian magic trained him in mysticism and gave him a lost section of the Koran  - that's this book (It's not the Quran/Koran of Islam)
Wonder how you tell if you are a ""Moorish Am"" or an ""African Am""?"
,kafiruwn,2011-11-09T09:59Z,"@joshua13 Timothy Drew of California???? (untrue) thats the thing about being an arm chair (internet) researcher, you fall subject to truths and also the lies posted by the blogger,

Noble Drew Ali went to egypt and after being taken down into the adept chamber his spirit was recognized by the high priest, as a great soul and holy prophet. sent to restore the birth rights and knowledge of self, back to the Moors in the Americas that were being called by the slave brands negroes, blacks,  coloreds and now African Americans, dont have tell if you are Moor or African American. because Africa is not a nationality its a continent with over 50 nation in it each nation is a distinct nationality, sudanese, nigerian, zimbawean etc. Peace to all!!!
