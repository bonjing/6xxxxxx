
Yma Sumac (born in Ichocan, Cajamarca, Peru September 10, 1922),is a noted dramatic coloratura soprano of Peruvian origin. 
In the 1950s, she was one of the most famous proponents of exotica music, and became an international success based on the merits of her wide-ranging voice, which ranges "well over three octaves"[2] and was commonly claimed to span four[3] and five[4]octaves at its peak.
She was able to sing notes in the low baritone register as well as notes above the range of an ordinary soprano.(wikipedia)
