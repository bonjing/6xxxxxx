,Thomps6o,2011-11-04T07:53Z,"i literally just copied and pasted this from another vampire diaries e08 file that had the exact same problem at the same time, these new files man....i do not know how u guys are making them but, damn, what is going on?? anyway read below....sigh?


i find that there is always some kind of error or extremely bad artifacting with most of these new ""smaller"" files. its always the same, i will prolly go back to downloading 350mb files, as they are more reliable. this one starts artifacting and cutting sound at around 06:32, i figured id just tuff it out but it got so bad i gave up.
maybe, someone can give me an explanation to why these 150mb files are always screwed up?

 i thank you for trying to help out though "
