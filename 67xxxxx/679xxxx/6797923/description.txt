Prince of Persia: Warrior Within is a video game and sequel to Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Warrior Within was developed and published by Ubisoft, and released on December 2, 2004 for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Microsoft Windows.[citation needed] It picks up where The Sands of Time left off, adding new features, specifically, options in combat. The Prince now has the ability to wield two weapons at a time as well as the ability to steal his enemies' weapons and throw them. The Prince's repertoire of combat moves has been expanded into varying strings that allow players to attack enemies with more complexity than was possible in the previous game. Warrior Within has a darker tone than its predecessor adding in the ability for the Prince to dispatch his enemies with various finishing moves. In addition to the rewind, slow-down, and speed-up powers from The Sands of Time, the Prince also has a new sand power: A circular "wave" of sand that knocks down all surrounding enemies, it is the first "Prince of Persia" game to be rated M by the ESRB.

Following Warrior Within, a second sequel and a prequel were made, expanding the Sands of Time story. Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones was released on November 30, 2005 and Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands was released on May 18, 2010.[citation needed] A port of Warrior Within was done by Pipeworks, renamed as Prince of Persia: Revelations, and it was released on December 6, 2005 for Sony's PlayStation Portable.[citation needed] The port includes additional content including four new areas not available in the original release.[citation needed] On the 3rd of June 2010, a port of Warrior Within was released for the iOS.[citation needed] A remastered, High-Definition, version of Warrior Within was released on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 on December 14, 2010
