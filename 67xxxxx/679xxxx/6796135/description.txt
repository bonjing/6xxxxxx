Calculus is advanced math for the high school student, but it's the starting point for math in the most selective colleges and universities. Thinkwell's Calculus course covers both Calculus I and Calculus II, each of which is a one-semester course in college. If you plan to take the AP Calculus AB or AP Calculus BC exam, you should consider our Calculus for AP courses, which have assessments targeted to the AP exam.

Thinkwell's award-winning math professor, Edward Burger, has a gift for explaining and demonstrating the underlying structure of calculus, so that your students will retain what they've learned. It's a great head start for the college-bound math, science, or engineering student.

Our complete Calculus package includes:
- Workbook (optional) with lecture notes, sample problems, and exercises so that you can study even when away from the computer.
