Bart's science fair project, a mechanical baby seal, outshines Lisa's brainy asteroid model and becomes a popular pet among the retirement home patrons. 

Meanwhile, Homer gets a new and eager assistant Roz (guest voice Jane Lynch), but when Homer quickly loses his job to her and discovers her evil past, he and Ned team up to reveal her true dark colors.
