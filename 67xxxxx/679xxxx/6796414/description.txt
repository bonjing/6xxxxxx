[excerpted from John Stossel's blog:]

This week I have to scream at the Capitol again.

Despite our growing debt, politicians continue to expand government.

Now the FDA says it wants to regulate medical apps on your doctor's iPhone.

Solyndra didn't work out, but they still say they must pick winners in the energy business.

They say taxpayers should pick up the tab when college students run up debt.

They ban cigarette lighters that don't look like this [pictures of novelty lighters in the form of the Statue of Liberty and a fire extinguisher].

And one California town says it's illegal to do what this boy did [photo of boy made-up to look like Stossel]: He dressed as me for Halloween.

[uploader comment: please excuse me for a little soap-box time]

I want viewers to pay special attention to the segment on China with Stephen Leeb. I think this guy is disastrously misguided to the point of being bent. Am I accurate to paraphrase his comment (near the 35 min mark) this way?

&gt;If you can't beat 'em, kill 'em!&lt;

With regard to the surge in Chinese productivity following introduction of private property recognition, and other government reforms, he clearly states that he doesn't want to live "like a Chinese, like the Chinese, I don't like them, that's why I say war. I love America and I want America to succeed."

Statements like that left this American gobsmacked. I rebuke you, Mr. Leeb.

As China becomes more like America _was_ (and ought to be), Mr. Leeb's answer seems to be to make America more like China _was_, or worse: to use our military to usurp a voluntary market. It's a notion that gives me fits.

Reactions?
