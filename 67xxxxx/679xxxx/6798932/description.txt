Notes...........: Somewhat weird Canadian Blu-Ray that seems to have hastingly
put together (much like the cheap Mill Creek BDs).
While the picture quality seems good, the highest available audio on it is
AC3 2.0 640k. No subtitles included either.
With no other release of this movie in the near future (that we can see)
we figured it's better than nothing.
