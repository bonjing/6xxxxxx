,Kidaeshus,2011-11-04T07:18Z,"Some idiot put a 7.22Mb sample video into the archive that overlaps into the first kb or so of the actual video AVI. No one can get that last little bit. I've been stuck at 99.7 for 5hrs.

Run away from this torrent as fast as you can. The EZTV version is much better download."
