here it is another fresh new beta pre build1 of vlc media player 1.2.0-git
from today : november 7
now called as 1.2.0-Pre build1 for new test anyway.
Not official yet,still as beta stage and still under development anyway.

few details now on changelog between 1.1.11 and 1.2.0-pre1 :

Changes between 1.1.x and 1.2.0-pre1:
------------------------------------

Important notes:

 * Start/end titles/chapters are now specified with # rather than @ to fix
   conflicts with some URLs and file names. For instance, this plays a DVD
   from the 2nd chapter of the 1st title up to the 4th chapter of the 3rd
   title:  vlc dvd://#1:2-3:4
 * The 40+ --*-caching options were simplified and dumbed down to 4 options:
   - --file-caching specifies caching for local files,
   - --network-caching specifies caching for network resources,
   - --live-caching specifies caching for capture devices and
   - --disc-caching specifies caching for local optical media.
   All values are expressed in milliseconds as in previous versions.
 * HTTP server IP address, port, and TLS configuration is now centralized:
   - The --http-host option sets the address, e.g. "--http-host=2001:db8::1".
     By default, both :: and 0.0.0.0 are used.
   - The --http-port and --https-port options set the port numbers.
     By default, 8080 is used for HTTP, and 8443 for HTTPS.
   - The TLS credentials are configured with --http-cert (public certificate),
     --http-key (private key), --http-ca (optional CA) and
     --http-crl (optional CRL).
 * RTSP server IP address and port are updated similarly.
   Use --rtsp-host and --rtsp-port respectively.
 * The --miface-addr option does not exist anymore. To select the multicast
   output interface, use --miface instead, e.g. --miface=eth0.
 * The Windows version will only work with Windows XP SP2 or later.
   Windows 2000 SP4, Windows XP &lt; SP2, Windows 2003 SP0 are now unsupported.

Important changes for packagers:

 * The default builds now assume that the operating system uses UTF-8 for
   its file systems and files content (except the Windows port). If this is
   not acceptable, pass --enable-non-utf8 to the configure script.
   Non-UTF-8 file systems support will be removed in future versions.
 * The VLC plugins path can be overridden with the VLC_PLUGIN_PATH environment
   variable. The --plugin-path command line option was removed.
 * The default tarballs are now compressed with XZ/LZMA: .tar.xz
 * OSS support is not compiled on Linux by default, pass --enable-oss to the
   configure script if you use OSSv4 or really want to use OSS emulation.

 * The NPAPI webplugin has moved to git://git.videolan.org/npapi-vlc.git
 * The ActiveX webplugin has moved to git://git.videolan.org/activex-vlc.git
