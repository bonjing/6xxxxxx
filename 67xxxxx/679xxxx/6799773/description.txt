I saw no torrent with a normal installation, the latest patch, a crack and a keygen so I made one.

Installation came from: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4526292/Unreal_Tournament_2004 (I extracted the .iso)
Crack came from: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3583353/Unreal_Tournament_2004_v3369_crack(online_play_enabled)

-----------------------------------------

Installation Instructions:

1. Start the UT2K4_Keygen.exe and copy a key or use one of the following:

	DEV2K-DEV46-DEV78-TJ74H
	K6T1V-M28ZP-DEV69-8JGY3
	2467K-43287-69437-TJ74H
	3333H-44444-55555-BKVA9
	62KYT-D3EAX-A2AVE-D76GR
	NE87K-BEWWT-CE263-TJ74H
	DAMNN-EYCHE-CKSUX-888XL
	6969B-THNKS-34267-DZ268

2. Start \"UT 2004 Installation Disc/Setup.exe\" and use the key from the keygen. Wait for the installation to finish.
	The SpeechRedist installer that comes after the main install is for the voice functions of UT2004.
	I suggest using \"C:\\PROGRA~1\\UT2004\" to both install in \"C:\\Program Files\" and prevent any problems with the space.
	You can use \"C:\\PROGRA~2\\UT2004\" if you have an x64 system and want to install in \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\"

3. Start \"Official/ut2004megapack.exe\" to install the mega pack 2 (latest patch and bonus content)

4. (Optional) Install \"Official/ut2k4_winxp_extra.exe\" for some extra official bonus maps

6. Check if you can play online
