,Chiggin,2011-11-04T15:03Z,Wait Sonic Generation?
,enterthehole,2011-11-04T15:03Z,Are those blue hobbits ? ;P
[V],.Dude.,2011-11-04T15:18Z,"Oops,sry for the wrong Image :P
Its
Lord of the Rings: War in the North-Black Box "
,SuperFulcrum,2011-11-04T15:21Z,@.Dude. is this sonic generations or lord of the rings war in the north??? 
,SuperFulcrum,2011-11-04T15:21Z,THX :D
,prince__vlad,2011-11-04T17:31Z,does it work? I mean did this kit get rid of those nasty graphic  issues ? Please confirm
,dareangel11,2011-11-04T21:34Z,"May I know what are the differences of the following and which is the better download.

1. Black Box
2. Repack
3. Unpacked
4. Reloaded
5. [FULL+CRACK|MULTI-5]
"
,SteXmaN,2011-11-04T22:42Z,Graphic options working ?
,xRevolution,2011-11-04T23:21Z,"@Dareangel11

Black Box = Release group
Repack = Mostly .RAR in .RAR
Unpacked = You dont need a WinRar or something.
Reloaded = Release group
FULL + CRACK | MULTI 5 = Full game with crack and with 5 languages

My conclusion: Pick the one with the most seeders"
,Chit91,2011-11-04T23:29Z,The game is really choppy... anyway to fix that? Got a i7 etc.. high end comp... dunno why its doing this. I also have the graphics patch fix. 
,scouten139,2011-11-05T02:52Z,"i had to find my old password for this account just to post that Black box always has Quality torrent/Releases and @chit91 obviously your shitty ""High End Dell"" cant run this game go back to minesweeper"
,SteXmaN,2011-11-05T04:55Z,"@scouten139 @Chit91 rig is not the problem the game is
many users are complaining about stuttering issue on forums and official web site
there will be patch released soon to fix ""the problem"""
,Noodley,2011-11-05T07:34Z,"When did the game start stuttering for you?
Mine is running fine at the moment, though if it does I'll post back

Only reason I'm downloading this is because I've bought basically all LOTR games and I'm a little sick of them being sub par... if this is actually any decent I'll buy but alas, they fooled me one too many times and I learned my lesson for the time being. :P"
,Noodley,2011-11-05T07:34Z,"Also, when I load the game a dialog box pops up with a bunch of random characters, etc. Any idea what that is exactly?"
,zero_uyoku,2011-11-05T07:46Z,Im on the highest settings but the images kinda look fuzzy.
,Noodley,2011-11-05T07:54Z,"Images as in Cutscenes, or actual gameplay?

The cutscene/movies whatever you want to call em were encoded to a smaller bitrate, ie: lost quality in exchange for smaller file size.

As if it's gameplay, I don't know what I'd tell ya."
,scouten139,2011-11-05T13:07Z,"@zero_uyoku that's because of the shitty Dx9 they got in this game 

im just waiting on AMD to release a crossfire profile for this so my one card is not completely useless"
,Adamxgr,2011-11-05T16:29Z,Sorry could you tell me if trojan.Win32.generic is an integral part of this torrent or just my anti-virus software is going crazy
,bobby358,2011-11-05T18:30Z,How to install this game?
,T-MAC61,2011-11-05T18:41Z,How do you run it ?
,bobby358,2011-11-05T18:48Z,"OK nvm got it, thx"
,T-MAC61,2011-11-05T18:56Z,"This has no crack , how do you launch it"
,T-MAC61,2011-11-05T19:39Z,"I'm going to rate this down pretty soon, **There is no possible way to launch the game**"
,Noodley,2011-11-05T22:38Z,"TMAC... you're an idiot.
Learn to read the NFO... there is no need for a crack install since it's Black Box, you just use the default EXE since it's already cracked... 
I'm going to rate your comment down right now **Doesn't know how to fucking read**"
,bitzer00,2011-11-06T00:56Z,downloading at almost 5 kb/s... yay!
,aerosouls,2011-11-06T02:34Z,"The crack from Ali213 has a virus, I thought it was a false positive so I excluded it and the game run.
However after the virus definitions updated, I found it generates a file within hidden system folder everytime I run the game.
And the generated .exe file has identical size of witn.exe.
Now I am worried."
,Katody,2011-11-06T03:42Z,Can't play LAN or online co-op. Any workaround for this?
,T-MAC61,2011-11-06T04:29Z,"@Noodley Okay sweet dumbass, the reason I thought you needed a crack was because **The Deafault exe. does not work** just to let people know"
,T-MAC61,2011-11-06T04:31Z,"System Error ""The program can't start because binkw32.dll is missing from your computer.""

There you go asshole"
,tyrosxps,2011-11-06T05:53Z,Why split in hundreds of .rars? To piss us off?
,Noodley,2011-11-06T06:58Z,"Tmac well then you fucked up somehow because it works perfect from the straight install
Failure."
,Noodley,2011-11-06T07:00Z,"@Katody, depending on how the MP/Co-op stuff works, maybe you could use hamachi to create a lan? unless you need to be logged into a system of some sort."
,Noodley,2011-11-06T07:04Z,"also if you weren't totally inept at computer you could google what ""binkw32.dll"" is. 
which is for ""Bink Video"" I assume it would be the opening cutscene's player.

and thus all you would have to do is go download the DLL from the million dll download sites out there and toss that into your sys32 folder. but no... you need your hand held through everything it would seem.
Get a brain."
,T-MAC61,2011-11-06T07:23Z,Well don't you just get pissed off easily. You got a girlfriend? Oh wait did I offend you by asking?
,T-MAC61,2011-11-06T07:29Z,"Nope , that didn't work either, thanks though"
[V],.Dude.,2011-11-06T08:27Z,"tyrosxps: i dont lyk shouting at any of you,but some of you force me to.Man,if you dont know anything,y the hell do you post a comment."
,raghud,2011-11-06T10:07Z,.dude great work man!!i really appreciate ur hardwork...u r really saving lot of money of us...i download all ur games from tpb....i never faced any problem man...but dude i am sorry to say that i am facing a problem with this...my antivirus(kaspersky internet security 2011) is detecting trojan in .exe file...and it is raising high alert and deleting .exe...without this execution file no one can launch the game...plz help me man and i am seeding for this...
,raghud,2011-11-06T10:12Z,guys don't download crack of ali213..it contains trojan and my antivirus is raising high alert..wait for a proper crack...my antivirus is kaspersky internet security 2011
,shigli,2011-11-06T12:25Z,"For everyone having any problems with virus related witn.exe file; the problem is that your antivirus is blocking the execution of this file. 

I had the same problem where I was getting virus alert and the game wouldnt start. I then uninstalled my AVG antivirus and tried again and it worked perfectly. Im sure there are other ways like granting special permission or something but that works at least.

You can also play the multiplayer on LAN as long as you give the game permission through the firewall. (A popup will appear on deskop when you search for games)

Fun game, thanks alot uploader!"
,scouten139,2011-11-06T12:35Z,"it makes me LOL when i look at game torrent comments *OMG MY SHITTY ANTI VRUS HAS FOUND A .EXE IT HAS TO BE VIRUSEZ DUNT DOWNLOAD* awesome torrent mediocre game it feels unfinished poor voice acting and sluggish combat controls defiantly a very poor console port i am disappointed  and lul @ T-macs ""You got a girlfriend?"" comment what are you fucking twelve? "
,nasos95,2011-11-06T16:13Z,"Is this TRULY LOTR: War in the North, or SONIC Generations? :/"
,T-MAC61,2011-11-06T17:38Z,"^

,Flawz7,2011-11-06T19:18Z,how the hell do i chaange the language????

,bitzer00,2011-11-06T22:45Z,".Dude. i have the game, can play it and everything but i have one question. Is there anyway to play co-op when it is torrented?"
,Khellus,2011-11-06T23:08Z,"I have an question - Why do I get bunch of rare stuff with supreme sword - Anduril on the very beggining? 
Btw. The best torrent for this game so far. Shadows works fine, applied instalation. Thanks a lot! 
I'll seed from time to time."
,Khellus,2011-11-06T23:30Z,"Ah, Isnt it preorder/DLC stuff? Kinda wierd it is, Anduril cannot be in two places at one time. "
,ChaosSabre,2011-11-07T09:27Z,Lol why is it showing a picture of Sonic Generations? XD
,lame21,2011-11-07T16:19Z,"i got the same problem as t-mac

i finished the install and it asked for the binkw32.dll i downloaded it put it in wont/original and in system 32 and then it said that this file is not created for this bla bla bla...anyway to fix this?"
,T-MAC61,2011-11-07T20:36Z,@lame21 I just put the binkw32.dll file in the game folder where the crack was then reinstalled. Don't know how but that worked. Just mess around with putting the file places.
,keroro185,2011-11-08T01:55Z,"Can I just ask, Why is this torrent 2.59GB, where as the one by TheGFW is 7GB? Is this torrent missing something or what? Do I loss anything if I download this instead of that?"
,Kortzen,2011-11-10T21:29Z,Its a real shame this game ain't as fun as I hoped it would be :(
,grnlajohn,2011-11-10T21:54Z,I'v been playing for a couple days now with 0 problems (thanks btw!) but I go on today and I click 'Start Game' and this message comes up 'Lord of the Rings War in the North has stopped working' and then the game crashes. Any ideas?
,grnlajohn,2011-11-10T22:04Z,"ok so I have been having the same problem with F1 2011 (game crashing on start up) there is a fix on their boards. Evidently auto save files get corrupted some how and they knew which files to fix, but I still dont know which ones to fix for this game."
,qtolnohof24,2011-11-10T22:12Z,"Hi - I have a weird problem where parts of my characters skin is missing (no face, no hands, no sword - just clothes and hair). Don't think it is my comp as it otherwise works fine on medium - high graphics. Any one had this problem/any ideas? Thanks"
,grnlajohn,2011-11-10T22:14Z,"FIXED If your game crashes on start up go to My Documents>ALI213>32800>Data (back up the Data folder before you go any further) go into the folder and delete both files (GameSettings.sav+Usersettings.sav) 

Start up the game, you will be prompted to recalibrate your game again but shouldn't have lost any save games. Sorry for the 3 consecutive posts I was just doing some Sherlock Holmeing and was updating what I found as I found it, Happy Gaming! "
,boltentoke,2011-11-11T23:19Z,worked fine for me. no problems. 
,riddick2011,2011-11-27T13:52Z,"never got it to run. after pressing ""ok"" on the weird message, it crashes."
,sajid1988,2011-12-03T17:54Z,its working sound and well in my pc
,thenuguy,2011-12-24T10:36Z,"I get an error saying ""THE FILE IS CORRUPT"" when I try to extract it... PLS HELP"
,joejoejoey,2012-01-13T17:52Z,"Why does the main .exe flag as a virus though? What is inside that .exe for my virus scanner to flag it?

Grudgingly it does work if I disable my scanner to open it, but it is a little worrying."
