,johnny5a,2011-11-09T16:29Z,"Possible Trojan attached.

Norton removed the nitro.pdf.6.x.+.7.x-patch.deepzero.exe patch program because it said a Trojan.Gen.2 was attached.

Trojan horse programs pose as legitimate programs or files that users may recognize and want to use. They rely on this trick to lure a user into inadvertently running the Trojan. Often a Trojan will mimic a well known legitimate file name or pose as a particular type of file, like a .jpg or .doc file to trick a user."

[V],gnv65,2012-02-03T04:38Z,"Keygens sometimes give the same virus signatures like real viruses.trojans & hence are detected as such by antiviruses, Norton is notorious for this!"
,Flawlessjess,2012-06-04T12:14Z,Norton is not an antivirus program it is a viris
