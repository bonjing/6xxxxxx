At times comedic and at other times heartbreaking, the series follows the intertwining lives of three Manchester couples at different stages in their relationships. At the start, Adam Williams and Rachel Bradley are a new couple. Adam's best friend Pete Gifford and his wife Jenny are adjusting to life as new parents. While Rachel's friends Karen and David Marsden fear the possible disintegration of their marriage. Other reoccurring characters include the Marsden's nanny, Ramona, and, in later series, Rachel's coworker Jo Ellison. Poignantly true to life but with fantastical twists the drama/sitcom explorers all the ups and downs of romance.
