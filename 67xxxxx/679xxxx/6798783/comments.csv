,Phoenix-III,2011-11-08T09:15Z,"hey mate been downloading every single one of your torrents...

but it seems you forgot to seed the earlier ones... 

Can I request to please seed 'NOW! That's What I Call Metal 57'  ???

Please!!"
,dragonbandit314,2011-11-09T13:40Z,"Brilliant, I too seed your contributions to 10:1. There are far too many 'HIT & RUN' merchants out there. They have no idea what SHARING is. Please keep up the good work. Cheers. T."

As there is some stress involved in editing and seeding that huge amount of songs the next one should be due when we reach #500."
