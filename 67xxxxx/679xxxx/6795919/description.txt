                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Reporter Peter Oborne and director James Jones travel to Russia, where they   
 offer an insight into the Nashi youth movement, which is dedicated to         
 protecting the country's interests and devoted to Prime Minister Vladimir     
 Putin. At the party's headquarters in Moscow, they sit in at a meeting and    
 learn why members have built a personality cult around Putin, before talking  
 to some of its critics and opponents.
                                         
                                 Enjoy!
