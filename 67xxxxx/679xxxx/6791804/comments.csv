,nogtci,2011-11-18T13:19Z,"Just for those that try to keep track, and since this one does not have the actual name of the episode, I just wanted to clear this up (Based on the screenshots provided)...

This is actually: S09E17 ""Drain Disaster""
This episode aired on November 2nd and involves these two myths:

""Will an explosion in a sewer launch a manhole cover as seen in many Hollywood films?
Various myths regarding truck bedliners.""

I can only imagine eztv, how busy you are, so I suspect that trying to keep up with all that you  do, and name/label your torrents correctly can easily become a daunting task at best. We are grateful for all of the hard work that you put in to provide us with quality torrents, and I am glad that I am able to contribute in such a small way to the great work that you do!!!

Thank you,
