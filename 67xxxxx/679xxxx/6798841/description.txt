Izamar Gutierrez is a trained and seasoned rookie here at Ultimate Surrender. She comes to the mat with a lifetime of wrestling experience, training and determination. She is unfamiliar with our rules, however her training, conditioning and iron hard will should server her well.

Bella Rossi (6-1) lifetime, has only lost one regular season match in her entire career. She was last season 2nd place runner up to the champion. She is a force to contend with. Bella is determined not to let this rookie taste victory her first match on the US mat.

All we are going to say is the winner won by only 15 points. Enjoy.
