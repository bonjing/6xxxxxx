This book was written by a senior lecturer in health science with a great deal of input from nurses. It highlights the burden of treatment and is a resource for non-medical prescribers in identifying adverse drug reactions and for recognising definitions and classifications. ... The sections on â€˜potential problemsâ€™ and â€˜suggestions for prevention and managementâ€™ were particularly enlightening. The book provides ideas for better patient consultations through discussions about medications and their effects."
