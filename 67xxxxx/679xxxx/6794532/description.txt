Guest Stars -- Andy Devine, Lawrence Tierney, and John Qualen.

This is one of a few episodes that doesn't have Barbara in the cast, 
although she still does the intro.  Andy Devine was a funny character actor, 
but this weak attempt as a pilot never would have worked as a series. 

Andy was much better in his next guest role in The Twilight Zone comedy 
"Hocus Pocus and Frisby".
