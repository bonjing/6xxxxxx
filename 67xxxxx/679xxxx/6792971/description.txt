Another Greenaway short culled from a greater DVD source of lesser interest.

This one mostly falls along the lines of "The Falls". Not very surprising, having been made the same year. The Nyman soundtrack gives this less fictional documentary quite a nice backbone.

Not that being struck by lightning makes for a guaranteed good story, but Greenaway shows he is quite adept at coaxing quite a few out of a thematic approach to documentary filmmaking. As if there was any doubt there. 

Chopping off the other 6 gigs of dead weight denies you the chance to judge for yourself just how badly others fare in attempting the same coaxing. You'll just have to trust me on this one.

So, shoot me...
