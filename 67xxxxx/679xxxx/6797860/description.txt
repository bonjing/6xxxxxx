 Buying the Right Photo Equipment: 70 Tips from the Top


We've all heard the saying, "Clothes make the man"; but does the photographic equipment make the photographer? One might think so when looking at new advanced cameras, dream lenses, and all the editing software out there. Others might disagree after admiring the wonderful photographs by Henri Cartier Bresson or Edward Weston, which were taken with relatively simple cameras and lenses.

 The real questions to ask yourself are: What kind of images would I like to make? And what are all these things that I see advertised as indispensable photo equipment really for?

 Geared toward the beginning to intermediate photographer, this book teaches about the variety of photographic tools available and what each is meant to accomplish. Learn about the benefits and drawbacks of various pieces of equipment and discover what kind of gear you need to realize your creative ambitions. The book is filled with beautiful images that illustrate how the type of equipment discussed can affect an image.
