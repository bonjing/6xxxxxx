,johnsmith25,2011-11-05T06:57Z,Please seed and sorry it is taking so long.
,fevez,2011-11-06T12:28Z,It's 5.1 not DTS-HD 7.1. Other than that perfect sbs 3D
,johnsmith25,2011-11-06T17:06Z,"Glad you enjoyed it! Not sure about the audio, I chose audiocopy during encoding, unless the program cannot keep 7.1 audio. Oh well, there's almost no noticeable difference in the 2 extra channels on animated films anyways."
,amoghthegamer,2011-11-06T18:17Z,great torrent. downloaded when there was only 2 seeders and now Iam upping. Is this a Blu Ray rip or did you make this?
,johnsmith25,2011-11-06T20:20Z,"The source is a Bluray 3D disk, I first made an ISO back up and then encoded that into the h264 SBS format for a smaller file size. Not sure where the 7.1 audio got lost, but I guess it's 5.1. I don't believe the software keeps the 7.1"
,MVC78,2011-11-07T23:43Z,"This came out like a mess, for me at least. The video and audio are sped up to about 4x what they should normally be, making it completely unwatchable. It's unfortunate this wasn't commented on, 10 Gigs and it's not a quick download. Only to find out it's a mess :(. Thanks anyway John, appreciate the effort"
,johnsmith25,2011-11-08T02:04Z,"Sorry MCV78, I don't know what the problem is with your download, but I understand your frustration. I know the filesize is big, and it takes a long time to download. I can promise you that every thing I post works well before I upload it. I have a Sony 3D TV that can convert SBS video sources, and I am sure most other brands can do the same, and the video worked great for me watcing it. Did you remux it at all to a different format or container for viewing? What are you trying to play this back with/on? I would like more to comment to see their take on it. I guess I could just upload my direct ISO and you guys could convert to SBS or rip however you want, but that file is about 47gigs, so if you thought this took awhile..."
,fevez,2011-11-08T10:58Z,"With 5.1 audio, it worked no probs for me. I play the mkv file on PowerDVD 11, on my LG TV and it was fine. The only decent 3D version of this currently out"
,MVC78,2011-11-09T22:12Z,"Hi john, sorry to besmirch your upload like that, it's a problem on MY end. Not your fault. It's been happening with a few MKV 3D files I've tried to play lately. They're all sped up to an unwatchable degree. And this is when I try to play them on my PC. I use Nero MedioHome to stream from the PC straight to my LG 3D TV. I'm not sure what the problem is, maybe I need a codec or something. Anyways just wanted to say this upload is FINE, please ignore my previous comment. And thanks again John!"
,aohammam1,2011-11-10T11:41Z,"thanx 4 the upload great quality. I have Sony BRAVIA KDL46HX800 46-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D-Ready LED HDTV, and when I tried to play the movie on my 3D screen it displayed it in two pictures side by side !!! how can I play it in 3D?????
thanx again"
,johnsmith25,2011-11-10T17:04Z,"Re: aohammam1 - I assume if your TV is a ""3D ready"" model that you need an adaptor and that you have one already. Towards the top of the remote, there should be a buttom marked 3D, push that, now your screen will become blurry, next hit the Options button and scroll down to 3D Menu, select that and go down to 3D Format, here you can scroll down to Side-by-Side and then select, then back out of everything and enjoy."
,aohammam1,2011-11-17T16:25Z,"Yeah, I have tried it and it worked. thanks a gain for the great upload "
,MVC78,2011-12-05T06:32Z,"john, any tips on using DVDFab for converting 2d to 3d? I'm still trying to get the hang of it, are you pretty much using the default settings when you do it because everytime I try my movie doesn't look very 3D at all :( 

Any help you can provide would be much appreciated, you are a godsend around here!"
,vinnni,2012-02-09T20:27Z,"Heey, I am currently downloading the file, nearly ready. ^^ However my Tv doesn't seem to play MKV files... Could anyone tell me how I can play mkv files on my tv. PS: I am using Nero MediaHome to stream it directly to my TV. Also the TV i got is a Samsung D7000. ;)"
,super64c,2012-03-02T22:26Z,"vinni:   a lot of tv's have problems with various sound and video formats.   i have found that a wdtv live plays everything i throw at it.   its great because i send all my files to it from my pc, then it plays on tv.  my computer doesn't have to be on when i watch movies because i have a huge usb drive hooked up to it.  before this i was converting all my mkv 5.1 back to 4.1 as this is all my tv supports.     

mvc78:  i wouldn't bother converting 2d to 3d.   sure you get a depth aspect, but you dont get any real pop out of the screen animations.   i would much rather prefer watching a 2d movie in 2d, then converting to 3d, its just not worth it."
,johnsmith25,2012-03-26T05:08Z,"Sorry I've been AWOL for some time. Like Super64c said, the Western Digital TV Live unit I can swear by. Just get yourself a 2 or 3TB external usb drive which have come down a lot. Load all your movies onto it, hook it up to the WDTVLive and have the time of your life. I also agree after doing several conversions that 2D to 3D is not hardly worth the time just to get a little depth... besides most tvs now will do that for you, and I've found that the passive LG sets actually look quite well with many of my Bluray movies using the conversion mode."
