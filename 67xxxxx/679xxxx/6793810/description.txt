Nature's Great Events is a wildlife documentary series made for BBC television, first shown in the UK on BBC One in February 2009. The series looks at how seasonal changes powered by the sun cause shifting weather patterns and ocean currents, which in turn create the conditions for some of the planetâ€™s most spectacular wildlife events. Each episode focuses on the challenges and opportunities these changes present to a few key species.


1/6 The summer melt of Arctic ice provides opportunities for millions of animals.
2/6 A look at the annual return of millions of salmon to the streams where they were born.
3/6 The story of a lion family's struggle to survive until the return of the great migration.
4/6 Looking at the sardine run, which happens each winter along the South African coast.
5/6 The great flood in the Okavango turns 4,000 square miles of arid plains into a wetland.
6/6 Whales and sea lions alike journey to the seas off Alaska to feed on the plankton bloom
