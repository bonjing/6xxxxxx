Stripped is another live album by the Stones, but it is very different from their previous live efforts. They play in an almost unplugged type setting, focusing on their acoustic based songs. Also, their are alot of album cuts from the Let It Bleed to Exile On Main Street period like the masterful "Dead Flowers", the great "Shine A Light" and the bluesy "Love In Vain". They do excellent takes on bigger hits such as the majestic "Wild Horses" and the beautiful "Angie". They dip way back into their catalog for cover versions of songs from their first couple of albums including "Not Fade Away" and "The Spider & The Fly" as well as an early Jagger-Richards number, "I'm Free". They had never recorded a Bob Dylan song in their long history, but they finally do here and it is appropriately "Like A Rolling Stone". It is a spirited version of the song. Stripped is a nice surprise from the band and a great listen.
