,psycotrip,2011-11-04T04:29Z,"This ISN'T RAR, its just a simple good old fashioned avi. WTF are you thinking, do you even confirm before your retarted postings... What a turd burgler."
,FeiticeiraOmega,2011-11-04T05:04Z,"uhm.. psycotrip, this is an mkv compressed into RAR. wtf are YOU thinking my friend? lol"
,UAofE,2011-11-04T13:02Z,Fucking morons. RAR is a compression format that kills torrent seeding.
,cyanidesandwich,2011-11-04T18:27Z,Why do you niggers upload split .rar files as a fucking torrent?  Why!?   You should all be lined up against a wall and hsot.

,clamsquadron,2011-11-06T07:51Z,"@matHAN2012
Just ignore the retarded kids who have contributed nothing and bitch about free things"
,DJGM1974,2011-12-01T00:47Z,"I have to agree with the comments against split n RAR on this. Except perhaps the use of
the racially offensive word used by cyanidesandwich. The fact remains, there is NO good reason to split n RAR a single 300MB video file that's uploaded via a torrent. It might be
the accepting norm on other older forms of filesharing, but it's a no-no on torrents.

It's needless, pointless, and an absolute waste of time."
