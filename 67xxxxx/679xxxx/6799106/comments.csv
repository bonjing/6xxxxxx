,kafiruwn,2011-11-06T21:19Z," Confucius was Chinaâ€™s most famous Philosopher. He lived in Ancient China during the Zhou Dynasty.

Confucius was a government official, and during his lifetime (he lived from 551 to 479 B.C. ) he saw growing disorder and chaos in the system.

Perhaps due to the turmoil and injustices he saw, he set himself to develop a new moral code based on respect, honesty, education, kindness and strong family bonds.
His teachings later became the basis for religious and moral life throughout 
China.
