Decent, entertaining movie. Don't expect anything too funny."
,danewera,2011-11-25T01:33Z,"Do NOT download this TORRENT>

if you are going to watch it on a PS3

it has the CINAVIA protection on it. this makes a big message that blocks the video pop up and also makes the sound mute."
,Mister_Wu,2011-12-01T20:29Z,"I've been reading about a lot of these torrents being tracked (including one for this movie, but not this particular upload)... So I was wondering if anyone's had any trouble with being tracked or warned by their ISP after download this file?

Also, i've researched some ""IP covering"" programs and was wondering if anyone could recommend a good one?

Thanks!

*PS*- Yes, I posted this somewhere else as well, but i'm not spamming it. The first one on the list had people admitting they've been tracked, the second was a CAM, and the third was a 3gb file that they said wasn't even a Blue Ray rip of quality.. so I deduced this was the best selection out of all of them, and therefore most likely for me to download... Hence me asking here. Thank you again for your time."
,Mister_Wu,2011-12-17T19:19Z,"So not a single gentlemen or lady had any problem whatsoever with being tracked, problems with their IP or anything of the such?"
