,orangewedge,2011-11-07T16:06Z,"kinda new to DL torrents.... I transfer everything to my PS3 and watch it on my TV. What's the best format to DL in? MKV won't be picked up by the PS3 and I prefer the better HD. Any ideas?
Thanks!"

Download MKV2VOB, it's a free & easy to use program that will turn BR movies into MPG in a matter of seconds, which makes them playable on PS3 & you don't lose any quality."

Much appreciated sir!!"
,TheSyPhER,2011-11-07T20:21Z,"This has to be one of the sharpest uploads I have ever seen. Very, very good quality 720p, I usually still get some pixels at this resolution but this was perfect. Thanks as always eztv."
,Kingman_Arizona,2011-11-25T08:50Z,Not eztv - She post them in AVI - not MKV
,Jonnie23,2012-02-15T20:23Z,Subtitles on every episode and they don't even make sense... Look elsewhere guys....
