Blue Slide Park is the upcoming debut album by rapper Mac Miller. The title was announced in July 2011, and is scheduled for a November 8, 2011 release. The album is named after a section of Frick Park known as Blue Slide Park, hence the album title, in Pittsburgh. The park section is at the corner of Beechwood Blvd and Nicholson Street, just two blocks from Allderdice High School where Miller attended. Mac Miller frequently got stoned in the park while growing up, which is why he chose to base his album's name on the park. Some of his highest times were spacing out at the blue slide, in this here park. The album cover was designed by Miller McCormick, who is Mac Miller's older brother.
