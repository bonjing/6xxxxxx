            Elliptical Orbit - Fifteen years after its last contact with our 
            world, a space freighter known as the Flying Dutchman requests 
            permission to dock at a remote moon base. This mysterious ship 
            carries liquid protons: a power source essential to the survival 
            of Earth's population. But before the precious cargo can be 
            delivered, the base is ambushed by galactic terrorists who seek 
            to destroy the new form of energy and issue a death sentence to 
            all of humanity.
            Symbiotic Planet - Against a backdrop of peculiar alien life forms, 
            Aon and Elena - star-crossed lovers from rival countries - struggle

            Their budding romance is thwarted by an outbreak of potent alien 
            fungus and the interference of a cutthroat militaristic madman. 
            To survive, the young couple must maintain their faith in each 
            other... and learn to trust the unique creatures which inhabit this 
            strange and wondrous planet.
