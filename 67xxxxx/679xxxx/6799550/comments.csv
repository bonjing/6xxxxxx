,steevo-be-thy-name,2011-11-06T22:52Z,"It's funny that the people who always moan and bitch are the ones that have never uploaded ANYTHING ......  AND THEN CALL THE REAL UPLOADERS LAZY .  

IRONIC ."
,Rich661,2011-11-07T02:37Z,"I said it was lazy of people just to reupload other people torrents, which is what would have happened in the case of this being yet another out-of-sync version. Maybe you should try reading more carefully next time
Also, what has me not uploading any torrents got to do with lazyness? I've got no idea how this stuff works, I'd rather be ignorant than stupid. "
,steevo-be-thy-name,2011-11-07T06:00Z,"You don't have to be a genius to upload , you already have an account , so you are half way there . and I can read fine , you just sounded ungrateful to people who use up their own free time . Whether its out of sync or not .
Anyway , seriously you shopuld give it a try and upload something , you may be surprised how simple it is . "
,Rich661,2011-11-07T07:07Z,"I would only be uploading other peoples stuff anyway, so what would be the point? If would find that particularly lazy, especially if I uploaded stuff that already had errors in it, which would only add to the frustration of downloaders."
