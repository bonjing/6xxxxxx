As the npower Football League moves into November, the Championship remains as open and 
competitive as everyone anticipated. Southampton's great start to the season is put to the test 
when they travel to the Ricoh Arena to face Coventry City. Elsewhere, two of the form teams of the 
division, Hull City and West Ham, meet at the KC Stadium. Two seasons ago, this was a 
Premier League fixture and given that it finished three-three back then it's a result that neutrals 
would love to see repeated. Meanwhile, having left Portsmouth to join Nottingham Forest, 
manager Steve Cotterill returns to Fratton Park with both teams desperate for the win that would 
ease them away from the relegation places. Presented by Manish Bhasin.
