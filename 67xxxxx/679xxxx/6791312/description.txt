This game is about war of human against computer. Every night
computer-controlled robots invade your base trying to wipe it off.
Every day you raid enemy positions located deeply underground to
acquire resources and samples of advanced technologies. The faster
you develop, the higher your chances to survive in this mission.
Like in a classic strategic game you collect resources, build units,

beforehand for the battle.
