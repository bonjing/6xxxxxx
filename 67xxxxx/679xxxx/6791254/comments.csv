,BadAsMe,2011-11-29T18:26Z,"Don't take this the wrong way, but without tags this is worthless as far as I'm concerned.  I do appreciate your effort, not trying to offend you in anyway... but when you have an 8 disc compilation of albums, I don't have the time to enter metadata for 100 some odd tracks.

Did you rip this from a flac file, is that why all the data is missing?"

,casputin,2011-12-11T04:16Z,"Hey, sorry about the tags. I know that editing and  re-saving a compressed file format can cause problems with reduced quality, wasn't sure if adding metadata to an existing mp3 would mess with the compression in that way so I left them tag-less. Hope that makes sense. If you know whether or not that's the case, please let me know. With the files being remastered and converted straight from FLAC it seemed daft to do anything that would risk the audio quality."

,zerosava,2012-04-15T05:39Z,Adding ID3 or APE tags will not affect the audio quality any more than writing your name on a brown lunch bag will affect the taste of your lunch.
,Cruci4,2012-05-21T22:35Z,I used Mp3tag to resolve the tag issue
