,Zoraster,2011-11-16T23:11Z,"I disagree Bob__dole, Some times someone needs an insight to spark that inner creativity which helps them see life and more important their own lives in a different perspective. You are a collective of events that occurred in your life and how you organized those events in your brain. Even you own senses can fool you as without your five senses there is really nothing ( NO THING) out there."

How about instead of all those video games, tv shows, and trashy movies you actually expand your mind with literature?

Not trying to be a dick, but if you can't read 100 books in a couple years there's something wrong with ya."
