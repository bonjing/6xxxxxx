[V],-jonny-,2011-11-07T15:30Z,CHD are a Chinese release group so they include Chinese audio when they can.

,hosiah210,2011-11-08T21:30Z,"at what point do the apes speak where the ""Ape Only"" subtitles are required? a specific time in the movie? i'm trying to get it to work on VLC."
,kingjoser,2011-11-09T03:35Z,"A better name for this movie would've been, ""Planet of the Apes Rises."" Rise of the planet of the apes, sounds retarded and is way too long. Too many of's in there. Who ever named the movie should be fired"
,muLineZu,2011-11-09T04:10Z,"Great rip! Best quality, and also an interesting movie with impressive special effects.
Although I'm a fan of the '68-'73 series, I must say that the new technologies used in this big budget films, outshine the stars of yesterday...
Thanks a lot!"
,Ciahast,2011-11-09T17:12Z,@kingjoser The original title was 'Rise of the Apes' which I think is much better.. but they had to throw in planet of the apes somehow so people would recognise the franchise :/
