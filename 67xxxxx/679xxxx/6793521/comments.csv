but you cant open with divx player (too slow and no sound)
you're better with windows media player and shark007's codecs"

Audio and Video were good only problem is there are no subtitles."

I had problems with VLC
Worked fine with WMP and shark007's codecs as el_kricket suggested"

To ALWAYS being able to watch all movies out there, get ""K-lite codec pack"" and player of choice.I use PotPlayer as it's AWESOME and the successor of  KMPlayer. I have never had any problem what so ever watching any movie on my PC at least since I got K-lite. Happy hunting!"
