,adgxv2000,2011-11-10T17:47Z,"This works great. Thanks a lot, uploader. As described, this is already patched, I didn't have to do anything, just copied it to the internal hard drive and started it with multiman. HOWEVER, there's one thing you need to know: since all languages except English are removed, it will only work if the system language of your PS3 is set to English. Since mine wasn't initially, I got a black screen first, it took me a little bit to figure it out. So for all of you out there who have problems getting this to work, if your system language is not set to English, that's what causing the problem. "
,PitchblakToxic7,2011-11-11T03:46Z,"Thanks adgxy, I didn't know that, my system's already set to English. I know that if you've tried the game before patching it and saved and are now reloading the saved game with the patched copy you can have some problems as well.

angel4life, to get it to work on an external I think you have to unpack each parsec in their respective folders. Doing so will get it to boot from an external, but at 5000+ files you'll have loading issues."
,pirate6662012,2011-11-12T11:56Z,does it mean there are no videos in this release? 
,angel4life,2011-11-14T11:12Z,"@ PitchblakToxic7

,Osborn619,2011-12-23T08:57Z,"I download the entire torrent and extracted the files . When I tried to copy the extracted files into my 320 (GB) external hard disk (FAT32) I got an error stating that some files are above 4 GB . So I sliced the files with ""PS3Splitted"" and then copied the files to EXHD . Connected the External Drive to PS3 and copied the entire game to Internal Hard Disk . Opened Multiman and when I select Uncharted 3 ..the game opens but get stuck at the initial loading screen (the ring spins at the bottom right corner) it goes on spinning and the game doesn't start"
,Osborn619,2011-12-23T09:02Z,Please someone help me out . The game gets stuck at the initial loading screen ( the ring sping and spins at the bottom right corner of the screen and the game doesnt start) :(

,Qua4ratic,2012-01-12T13:08Z,"did anyone resolve the not loading issue?
Like osborn i split and transfered with multiMAN, but now i only get the spinning ring :(

If anyone can help I'd be eternally grateful!!"
,Qua4ratic,2012-01-12T16:18Z,"For anyone suffering like i was, i resolved my issue througha slow and labourious FTP transfer, it seems splitting the file and rejoining it doesn't actually work.

Thanks to the original uploader!"
,bhushan_bmw,2012-01-16T14:40Z,"Hey guys this is very simple & works great on 3.55 Kmeaw 

1) First download the open manager tools 1.1 from the internet

2) then run open manager tools 1.1 & then Click on file & then click on chech folders.
after clicking 1 window will appear then u just have to give the path where your game is stored.
(for e.g like mine in my computer i have ps3 drive & in my ps3 drive i have games folder & in my games folder i have all my ps3 games then select one of them like i select uncharted 3 for me to split as u do the same) 

3) once u split uncharted 3 (100%) then u will see the splitted files in PS3_GAME/USRDIR/build/main
pak23.psarc.66600 (4.2 gb), pak23.psarc.66601 (4.2 gb), pak23.psarc.66602 (146 mb) & u'll also see 
pak23.psarc which is around 8.5 gb from the same directory just delete that 8.5 gb file & then copy the game into your external hard drive.

4) once u copy the game in to external drive then just plugged the external drive in to your 160/320 gb ps3. & then copy the game into internal hard drive & play that's it. but make sure 1 thing don't run the game directly just copy it in ps3 internal drive then play it. enjoy guys "

Wondering if anyone else is having this problem? and what a possible solution to it would be.  I tried running the game using the latest version of multiman."
