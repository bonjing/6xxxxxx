Uncharted 3 Drakes Deception re-ripped from Duplex release down to 28.5GB. Removed 3D movies and every other language except English. Already patched and ready to go, I've also included the fix and a text file on how to slim down the Duplex release if you've already downloaded that.

Unrar and transfer BCES01175-[Uncharted 3 Drakes Deception] to your PS3.

If you have trouble with subtitles, keep the original subtitles.txt before patching and then copy it back over after patch.

Thanks to Duplex for the release, mote on PSX-Scene for the fix and everyone else for keeping the scene alive.
