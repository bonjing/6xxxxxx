Quote:
House M.D. meets Fringe in the first Skybound original from Robert Kirkmanâ€™s new comics imprint! Meet Vincent Morrow, a doctor looking for a vaccineâ€¦ for the apocalypse! In this stand-alone first issue, a family needs Dr. Morrowâ€™s help with their sonâ€™s illness: Demonic possession. But when Morrow attempts an experimental cure, he discovers the boyâ€™s disease isnâ€™t all spinning heads and pea soup â€” itâ€™s like nothing youâ€™ve seen before! Horror gets a brain transplant in Witch Doctor, the book Warren Ellis calls â€œMental.â€
