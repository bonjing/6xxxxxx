,thunderbum,2011-11-04T03:32Z,"I wrote my thank you comment right after d'l the torrent. Hours later, nothing, zero, nada had been downloaded into my comp.  Odd this should happen. Don't understand at all but it's not a big deal and am still thankful for everyone's efforts to bring our daily Rush rush."
,BrianB420,2011-11-04T07:01Z,"Yeah, I wrote my comment before I realized it too. It's ok. Shit happens. Thanks for the try, though. "
,sharky3k,2011-11-04T13:00Z,Sorry.  Apparently torrent software didn't start seeding automatically (as it normally does).  Didn't see the comments until next morning.  Should be fine now.  Resist we much!
