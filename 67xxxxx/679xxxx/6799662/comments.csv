,useduser,2011-11-07T10:38Z,"@LaVicky88 What are you stupid? Of course a torrent is fake when you try to download an episode before it is even aired on TV. Don't say a torrent is fake before you check it. This torrent is genuine, nothing wrong with it.

Thx ettv for uploading!
"
,DickDickstein,2011-11-07T21:54Z,"Sorry mate, but trying to look like you are someone popular (eztv) is shady. Even if this torrent is legit I wouldn't download it from someone that went about it this way. 

If you upload good torrents people will recognize you just the same if you aren't trying to piggyback off a popular uploader. "
,piratiinho,2011-11-08T01:19Z,"Quality is good, thanks."
,pigpen123a,2011-11-08T03:07Z,"Thx again ettv and seeders, another fine U/L "
,pirateymarc,2011-11-09T14:24Z,"Why do idiots who have no idea have to make comments???
This is NOT fake and it's quality is great.

People stop making hassles for people.
If others are like me, they rely on comments and people like you waste our time.
Either check it for yourself or keep your mouth shut.
