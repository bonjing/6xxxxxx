,Skram0,2011-12-11T06:12Z,Another unknown format upload. PAL or NTSC? This guy does not label his uploads correctly.
,minihajen,2011-12-11T13:39Z,"After downloading, can i just burn it on a cd and play or do I have to do something else before that? Do i have to burn the CD on a PC or will it work if i'll burn it on a Macbook?  "

,rmjs,2012-01-14T17:57Z,"Works alright for a few songs, then get 'Reading disc ...' would appreciate some help with whether its an issue with the torrent or with the mod"

,cressdadd_1,2012-01-21T23:07Z,mine works fine just no color any ideas
,TheForces,2012-01-22T22:31Z,Is this NTSC or PAL? For people with color problem what do u have Pal or NTSC cause if u have PAL then that means the game is NTSC and vise versa.
,jc0321,2012-01-26T04:48Z,The Game is just fine but NO color .. just white & Black any suggestion?
,deathservent1,2012-01-29T01:49Z,"ok, noob usb loader user's. If the video is black and white, you have a different format. if you have ntsc and its black and white, then the game is pal and you need to ""Force video ntsc"" or vice versa. this will be in youre loader options. you're welcome"

      Greetings maximersk, 

     Ok, I appreciate the upload! And I am no NoOb, but this game does not work, well at least in game manager! I did forget to try to burn to a disk, but really didn't feel like making a coaster either ;) Again, thanx for the upload and keep them coming! I don't mind wasting time downloading, gives me something to do for the kid's while i'm doing serious comp sh#t, but rather making this comment for people who DO NOT like wasting there time or bandwidth on games that DO NOT WORK...

                                   Sincerely,
                               Mr. Mac Thizzle"
