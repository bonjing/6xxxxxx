Awesome release - thanks! And for the PS3 users out there, this unfortunately has Cinavia protection :("
,tester852,2011-11-07T17:20Z,Super quality! Thanks!
,Leopardi,2011-11-15T13:24Z,Absolute rubbish this HDChina. They have cinavia protection so dont even dream about playing through PS3 media server.
,CGN3,2011-11-18T18:58Z,"There is something called mkv2vob which breaks the protection and also can make permanent subtitles which play on ps3 without any problem , been using for years"

,Mister_Wu,2011-12-01T20:25Z,"I've been reading about a lot of these torrents being tracked (including one for this movie, but not this particular upload)... So I was wondering if anyone's had any trouble with being tracked or warned by their ISP after download this file?

Also, i've researched some ""IP covering"" programs and was wondering if anyone could recommend a good one?

Thanks!"
,yelloo,2011-12-03T07:31Z,Thanks BOZX.
,Mister_Wu,2011-12-17T19:19Z,"So not a single gentlemen or lady had any problem whatsoever with being tracked, problems with their IP or anything of the such?"
,noy86,2011-12-29T15:10Z,"Thank you BOZX!

I have never had a problem with my ISP. Not once. I use peer block. Seems to get the job done."
