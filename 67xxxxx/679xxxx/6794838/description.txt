Daughter's Hand / Tech Support
The wusses in old movies teach the boys that scoring with a
chick may be as simple as asking her father for her hand. Do
they have any idea what they're getting into? Or are they just
looking for a handout?
Just do IT: When Beavis and Butt-Head are accidentally hired as
Tech Support geeks, will they end up crashing the system for
good? Looks like Co Tech outsourced to the wrong dudes. Will
their cubicle mate Hamid be able to help, or will he fall victim
to their perverted pranks?

We know who we are, where we came from, and why we're here. Do you?
