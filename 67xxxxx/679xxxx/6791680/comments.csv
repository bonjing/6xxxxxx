tx

hmmm I would be inclined to call this S07E21 since S07SP01 was halloween 
special cant class that as a normal episode?"
[T],trialNerror,2011-11-03T04:19Z,"I'm just going off of TVRage.

720p release coming soon."
[T],trialNerror,2011-11-03T04:23Z,"Oh I should also add I don't wanna hear any shit about which episode number this is.
Some sites say 21 and others say 22.
More sites say 22 than 21 so I labeled it 22.
Don't like it? Name to whatever the hell you want after you download it."

Yes its 0721 according to them."
,Captain699,2011-11-03T04:30Z,oops sorry for the shit but thanks for the upload! :)
[T],trialNerror,2011-11-03T05:10Z,"Yes, I know Wiki and TheTVDb sites are saying E21.

But... Wiki and TVDb are also just a collection of peoples opinions, not really related to TV schedules such as TVRage, TV.com, and thefutoncritic.

http://www.tv.com/shows/ghost-hunters/episodes/ (E22)
http://www.tvrage.com/Ghost_Hunters/episodes/1065097204 (E22)
http://thefutoncritic.com/showatch/ghost-hunters/listings/ (E22)

Another site I upload to goes off of the TVRage schedule and it would've be categorized wrong if I had labeled this E21.

All that really matters is it's the new episode from November 2nd.  

Name it whatever you want after you've downloaded the damn thing."
[V],psspss,2011-11-03T05:29Z,"now now just pointing it out after all prev hallowseens
were called specials and called extra episodes

tvrage is always wrong though and  wiki too but think wiki has it right

it pays to get number right though as it gets messy later and peope dont know if 22 is this one
or the next one in the series..

its good you upload so fast here you just beat
crimson :)"
,ToneZone,2011-11-03T06:26Z,"tNe... just lable it however you want.  I appreaciate the uploads you do.  You put the ""Air Date"" in the description and that is enough to figure out the sequence.

Thanks as always."
