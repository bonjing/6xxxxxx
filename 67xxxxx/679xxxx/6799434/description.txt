Parallax is the upcoming third studio release from Bradford Cox's solo project Atlas Sound, to be released November 7, 2011 via 4AD. Production duties were handled by Cox and previous Deerhunter producer Nicholas Vernhes. It was recorded at Rare Book Room Studios in Brooklyn, New York (which is ran by Vernhes.) The artwork features a photograph of Bradford Cox taken by Mick Rock, who has previously shot photographs for albums such as Raw Power, The Madcap Laughs, and Transformer. 4AD also launched a website, depicting an image of Cox in Manhattan's Central Park, similar to the artwork of his two previous releases, his face is obscured by a lens flare. The website lists the genre as "Science Fiction."

A demo of "Mona Lisa" was originally released on the third volume of the Bedroom Databank series that Cox had released on the Deerhunter blog last year. "Te Amo," (originally known as "Untitled") and "Flagstaff" had been appearing in live Atlas Sound sets for about a year.

The album was announced on August 24th. Prior the album's release, more than half the album's songs were made officially available for streaming and/or download.
