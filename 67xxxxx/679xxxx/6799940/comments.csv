,Tiny Turtle ,2011-11-07T19:45Z,Given that this torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6799974/Dexter_S06E06_PROPER_720p_HDTV_X264-DIMENSION_%5Beztv%5D has the same name and weighs in att 1.23 GB your file is obviously a reencoded version. Why use the same exact name when it isn't the exact same file?
