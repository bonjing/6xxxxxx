No suitable decoder module:
VLC does not support the audio or video format ""undf"". Unfortunately there is no way for you to fix this.

What's up with this?"

VLC player should be able to read the .avi container.  Make sure you didn't accidentally change the extension to something you didn't mean to by opening the properties of the movie. Undf is VLC's code for any extension it doesn't recognize.

Also thanks for the upload!"
