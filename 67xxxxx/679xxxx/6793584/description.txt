Syndicate Plus is a combination of Syndicate and the American Revolt expansion pack, and continues the story of a man and his cyborg agents attempting to take over the world.

In the future of Syndicate, the world is controlled by a handful of global corporations (syndicates). You are the Marketing director (hit man) for one of these companies. It is your job to take control away from the competitors. The job is not one of diplomacy, but one of brute force and physical control. Advance your way to the top of the corporation by successfully completing your missions and managing the money you make from your territories.
