,prius4845,2011-11-05T20:25Z,@LittleAngel01 Please: beggars can't be Choosers!
,prius4845,2011-11-05T20:30Z,"@LittleAngel01 What are you talking about? The full album is already on here. Plus, I do this for the dummies who search by song and can't find it. They never realize if they searched for the album the song is on, the song could be on TPB."
,LittleAngel01,2011-11-05T21:09Z,"@prius4845 : I started with the word: Please :)

But thanks for feeling concerned with the ""dummies"""
,prius4845,2011-11-06T00:25Z,"@LittleAngel01 Wow, you actually replied. Wasn't expecting that. Was there any album in particular you were looking for?"
,LittleAngel01,2011-11-06T10:31Z,"@prius4845 : Have over 100.000 mp3's here, so I'll be fine. But thnxs for asking!!"
,prius4845,2011-11-06T13:58Z,"@LittleAngel01 I have about 1,500 songs and I thought I had a lot. I hope you have a backup somewhere. I would hate to loose all of them."
