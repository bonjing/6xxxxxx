,Steve504,2011-11-10T22:31Z,"Great torrent, I did have an issue with the game not saving but found an easy fix for it. Simply right click and run as administrator. None of it is corrupted, thanks .Dude"
,Amouros,2011-11-13T00:27Z,"So I managed to find a big problem. It seems the game won't save. Luckily it isn't exactly a long game, so I can beat it in a single sitting. This still irks me though, because now I can't really do all of the challenges. Still, I'm loving this game. I think I'm gonna buy it next time I get 30$."
