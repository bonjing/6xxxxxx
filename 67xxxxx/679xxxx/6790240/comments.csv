,rashid2006rmr,2011-11-02T13:55Z,oh man this xbox not PS3 change it 
,Arbiter89,2011-11-02T18:19Z,"Doesn't get any more fake than this. PS3, yet it has a Crapbox pic?

Recommend you steer away from this shit."
,CommonFacade,2011-11-02T18:35Z,lmfao right away i know this is a fake how you have a xbox 360 cover box for the ps3 release lmfao
,Reigefyre,2011-11-02T21:25Z,Xbox 360 cover image for a game rip filed under PSx? I don't think so... -1
,27378,2011-11-03T12:31Z,"Just because the picture is from another console, doesn't nessecarily mean it is fake, It's not like it's an official release, my guess is that the pic is just googled... Not saying that it does work though, I dont have a PS3, but it might :P"
,TheZys94,2011-11-03T15:32Z,"OMG! ofc this is an xbox360 release. You can tell that by reading the title (XGD3.0800.USA-PAL).
I guess the PSx was written by mistake.
So i have an xbox360 and i hope this will work for me cause other torrents are so slow....."
,Rianski,2011-11-03T19:36Z,"Fake, don't bother. File size is too small to be a current Xbox 360 game."
,kraftseeder,2011-11-03T21:29Z,"7.79gb?
Yesterday?
ANONYMOUS?

Sounds legit"
,salgadooliveira,2011-11-03T21:30Z,its real. people are already playing it in torrentday. Its the same size and is for xbox. 
,Piglesnout,2011-11-03T22:43Z,"ahahah get owned ps3 players

bitches gonna have to wait for the release, while i play on my 360

,Ki1l4U,2011-11-04T00:03Z,This is in the wrong section.
,CaptainTannen,2011-11-07T08:46Z,Life must suck for console gamers.
,steelllynx,2011-11-20T02:28Z,"Yeah I played this on the 360, load times are awful.  Graphics are silky smooth but don't look like 1080p...  I was just happy to verify a successful XGD3 burn on my iHap drive(s).  Plural.  Period."
,SSpatil,2012-03-27T11:09Z,is this ntsc-U or ntsc-J?????
