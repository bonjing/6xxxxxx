,hasibneda,2011-11-05T20:34Z,is it fake or real? and is there any torrent of nba 2k12 xbox 360?
,BlewSkrin,2011-11-11T07:04Z,The game is real and it works. Just need to burn it properly with iXtreme Burner Max.
,KingKool,2011-11-28T23:21Z,"C4E released the iXtreme LT+ v2.0 CFW for all versions of the Hitachi-LG GDR-3120L drive (â€˜PHAT Hitachiâ€™):

C4Eâ€™s iXtreme LT+ in association with Team Jungle & Team Xecuter

Official release of the iXtreme LT+ v2.0 for Hitachi drives
- Support for XGD3 ixtreme backups using LT-MAX for maximum capacity on standard DVD+R DL discs.
- Support for large capacity DVD+R DL media (no errors when burning)

About upcoming iXtreme LT+ 3.0 â€“ released after December 6th
Originals will need to be analysed by XBC to gain disc topology data. This data replaces the need for ap25/dae.bin data and enables any ap25 challenge to be answered correctly. The topology data method is very efficient using only 24k and is very accurate. Each title will need its own topology data as there are differences between titles, even xgd3 titles and backups can be detected if the same topology data is used between titles.
Backups will remain the same layout but will need the new topology data inserted by the new abgx or re-dumped with the new XBC for xgd2/ap25 or xgd3 titles.
Non ap25 titles will remain unchanged

Thanks go to Team Jungle for their hard work and efforts in the development process.
Thanks also go to Team Xecuter for their support to this project."
,Revoion,2011-12-09T19:02Z,it works! but the game sucks :P
,mishami123,2011-12-27T17:19Z,I keep getting an error in abgx360 that this iso isnt recognized as an xbox 360 iso or stealth file. why is it telling me that if you say it works?
,siddy1200,2012-04-07T11:44Z,"You need to use IHAS drive to burn it other wise the game screws up after the first misson and gets a read error.

Don't bother though cause its a crap game, the reviews, although not great, were lenient. If you have ever played a current gen shooter you can not play this, it is terrible. And it is too different from the original for any nostalgia. The multiplayer split screen has all new (crap) maps."
