You do this by right clicking the program and clicking ""Run as administrator"". Same goes to the frozen save screen ppl have been experiencing. To fix that you run the Sonic Generations application as administrator too just by right clicking and doing the same thing I said above.

,djdouberr,2011-11-10T15:39Z,"hey ppl im not saying this download is crappy but its not this torrent is worth downloading and the game starts up fine but there are 2 issues: 1. the game says its saving but it doesnt really save so if u download this u gotta wait for a patch just to be able to save it which is crap and 2. in some sections of the game while playing the game will completely freeze for about 7 seconds and then it starts playing again and will keep doing this throughout the game. on my laptop im am more than running the requirements for this game and ive tested the fps and it stays between 40 fps and 60fps which is good but freezing every other minute is a constant problem so if anyone here finds or makes a patch for these issues please let us know and thanks for the torrent ""extremezone"" :)"

,akb1ajay,2012-01-15T13:29Z,"I managed to play this game, here is the procedure I followed:-
1. Install the game from mounted image, after installation do not install Direct X and do not configure graphic settings(Just clear those two boxes which appears after installation). 

2. Go to the folder where you have installed the game and  then go the redist folder(in games installation folder) and then open direct X folder and look for direct X setup and run it as admin. Do the same for vcredist_x86(run as admin) which is in redist folder near Direct X folder.

3. Now in Sonic Generations folder look for Configuration Tool, run it as admin and set your graphic 
settings, then save and quit. 

4. copy contents from fair light folder which is found in mounted image and paste those contents in Sonic Generation folder and replace original files.

5. Run the game as admin, when you stuck at saving screen press A on your keyboard(I pressed A but nothing happened then I found out that pressing D is doing work. In the game whenever it was asking me to press A I had to press D and when it asked me to press B I had to press S. its A=my D and its B=my S. I do not know why. It may not be the case with you).

6. If you do not tuck at saving screen and you stuck at main menu screen where ""NEW GAME"" flashes then press A/D to start.  TO SELECT SOMETHING PRESS A/D. TO QUIT GAME DURING PLAY PRESS ENTER AND CHOSE YOUR OPTION TO SELECT ANY OPTION PRESS A/D.  

7. I think Direct X is the cause of any dll errors."

,itchibi99,2012-01-21T02:25Z,"CRITICAL ERROR!
steam client is not running!Please run the system client and try again!!!!

please help me to this error!!what should i do to fix it?"
,featherwolf09,2012-01-21T02:37Z,"Yes it works, by following akb1ajay's tips. 

For the steam error thing, just get steam and run it. Works for me. "
,Tardivex,2012-01-27T01:13Z,"it doesn't work for me, it says I have to configure the graphics but when I click save in the configuration menu a weird error pops up and I can't save, so I can't launch the game, I tryed following akb1ajay's advice but it didn't worked either can someone help?"
,sickboy09sumi,2012-01-29T03:17Z,"All the people who are having trouble with starting the game due to the DAMN Optimus technology in their Dell Laptop GPUs or the damn i5 or i7 series processors should do the following...

1. Get the Virtu Software which is available at this website (lucidlogix) http://wwwdotlucidlogixdotcom/driverdownloads-virtudothtml (replace dot with .)
2. Install the software and then restart your machine.
3. Then after the restart you will have the Virtu software window come up, where you can click the ""on"" and ""off"" button and turn it to ""off"" position. 
4. Then go to your configuration file in the installation folder( C:\Program Files (x86)\Sonic Generations) and configure your game settings to whatever you like (I have mine maxed out to 1080p with high settings all the way), you can also configure your gamepad if you want and then click ""save and exit"".
5. After that just run your game as ""Run as Administrator"" by right clicking your SonicGenerations.exe file. Ignore the Virtu box menu that will also be visible in the options menu when you right click the SonicGenerations.exe file and just select ""Run as Administrator"".
6. You can now start the game and play without problems..."

,unknown2all,2012-02-10T19:01Z,the game works fine but im trying to use my xbox360 controller i have it pluged into the computer i just dont know how to get the game to use it any help???
,angelicfeces,2012-03-01T06:46Z,"Odd bug? When I go to the omochao's shop or whatever it is, I have to keep pressing in a direction or the buttons before it registers when using a 360 controller. Pretty sure my controller isn't faulty since it works on everything else, including everything in this game other than my problem. The keyboard works fine in the shop though."
,senrai180,2012-03-03T18:01Z,"i copy the fairlight thing into the folder, put it dosent say anything about replacing. Sorry, noob at this, and when i start up, it says steam needs to be open. do i need something to fix? or is it the fairlight?"
,Demongorgon,2012-03-07T19:50Z,"Downloads and installs fine. I mount install and replace the .dll files and all that. But when i run the game it just gives me a black screen, then stops responding. What's up? :|"

,AppGenius,2012-03-16T23:26Z,"This torrent is good, although some of you may be experiencing some difficulties getting the game to work. For those of you who are getting the ""d3dx9_43.dll file is missing, try reinstalling the program to fix the problem"" error, navigate to this link:
http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?d3dx9_43
And download the .dll file fixer and run the scan and fix this problem. And then after you have rectified this problem, you may get an error message that says ""The steam client is not running"" to correct this problem, you need to download Steam, to do this, go to this link and download and install Steam:
http://steam.en.softonic.com/
Once you have downloaded Steam, I think that you need to update it so it runs correctly so make sure that you update it. After the installation of Steam is complete, double click the Steam icon and you will see a menu that says things like ""Create new account"" or new PS3 players etc. (or something) Ignore everything on the menu and just make sure that the menu is opened, when the menu is opened. this means that the steam client is running, so while the menu is still opened, double click the Sonic Generations icon and it should work fine. You nay get a message about your current settings does not match your hardware, all you have to do is go to the configuration tool and make sure analytics is enabled so tick the box which says that. If you get another error message which says some nonsense about access is denied, remember this for future use, whenever you get a message which says access is denied, just run the same program as an administrator. So in this case, right-click the configuration tool icon and click run as administrator and you should be able to change and save settings successfully. This is all I have to say so if you have any other problems, Google will serve as a useful tool, I hoped this comment has helped you."

And also, if you manage to get the game to start and you are at the screen where it tells you that this game saves data automatically and you don't know how to get past that, just press the letter ""D"" on your keyboard. The letters on the keyboard correspond with the letters said in the game are below, the letters in the game are on the left side and the letters on your keyboard (by default) are on the right side:
A- D
X- A

Problem #2 Sonic Generations PC Crash Fix â Crash to Desktop upon Launch / Startup
If youâre game randomly crashes upon launching the game, ensure or try the following:

Update your nVidia / ATI graphics drivers
Turn off SLI / Crossfire
Try using only one GPU first (turn the other one off via your graphics control panel)
Disable anti-aliasing and filtering
Disable V-sync
Disable background apps, and turn off your anti-virus software
Run through our list of general fixes, which will most likely resolve your problems.

The link for the general fixes is:
