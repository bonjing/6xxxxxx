,AceCreator,2011-11-04T14:41Z,any chance for a trustworthy scene grouprip soon? maybe from Reloaded or Skidrow... cause i usually don't trust these kinda rips.
,sanad2011,2011-11-04T18:44Z,Is this torrent working 100%?
,sanad2011,2011-11-04T18:53Z,is this working 100%?
,derpbay,2011-11-04T19:56Z,"Downloading it now, can anyone confirm if it's working? Any news on a proper RELOADED or SKIDROW release? Going really slow here."
,forsser,2011-11-04T20:10Z,does not work... im haveing the same problems as ricardozagada.....
,xxhiroshi21xx,2011-11-04T20:32Z,"Fake, faker than fake, fake crack redirects to Chinese website. No detection by MSE, but needless to say, skip this and string the uploader up."
,xxhiroshi21xx,2011-11-04T20:38Z,"Chinese hacker bullshit, report this, he keeps deleteing it, but it installs a backdoor."
,xxhiroshi21xx,2011-11-04T20:43Z,...
,RageDash,2011-11-04T20:57Z,"I had the same problems Critical error! (Missing files ect.) I managed solving the problem by running the crack as an administrator. After that I had to run the configuration tool , which gave me an error, but other than that, it runs fine. Try to run the game as an administrator as well, it might help."
,pirukire,2011-11-04T20:58Z,You have to run the executable as administrator.
,RageDash,2011-11-04T20:58Z,"I had the same problems: Critical error! (Missing files ect.) I managed solving the problem by running the crack as an administrator.

,pirukire,2011-11-04T21:22Z,"It works perfectly for me. I was having the same issues as you, but finally I made it to work.

INSTRUCTIONS:

- Copy the crack to the game folder.
- Run it as administrator. It will say something in chinese, then closes and open the browser to load a chinese website. Just close it.
- Run the fucking game. If it doesn't work (saying something about corrupt files), run it as administrator.

It works for me. Now I run the game with no admin rights, and continues to work.

Fantastic game :)"
,ghhtf,2011-11-04T21:43Z,It says I need a Steam client to run...and when I have Steam open the game runs fine but the saving doesn't work.  Anyone know how to fix this?
,ghhtf,2011-11-04T22:09Z,"Forget that, I didn't move the full crack in.
Games works perfectly fine, thank you .Dude."
,namtolng,2011-11-04T23:48Z,"Appreciate this, but not the apparent Chinese hacker bullshit :( Glad the game works and since this is +15 and only xxhiroshi21xx expects a backdoor as opposed to just an annoyance [from a trusted uploader] it seems a-ok. Also, hiroshi sounds japanese and he might be predisposed to hate Chinese stuff. "
,forsser,2011-11-05T00:17Z,"@ pirukire thanks for your instuctions finally got it to work :) @ dude thankyou for upload, game works perfect.. please ignore my last comment..awsome game and upload.....just follow pirukire,s instructions  :)"
,Dllfile,2011-11-05T00:27Z,"Works great, loaded Steam in Offline mode moved Sonic Generations to a different folder, ran regfix, fired right up.

,namtolng,2011-11-05T19:01Z,"Copied the crack and still says game files missing or corrupt please reinstall! 

How do I install anyway? There's nothing"
,namtolng,2011-11-05T19:17Z,NVM! You have to add this to your directory and use it. It brings  you to a chinese site... Hope it's not a malware site... not detected as one though by Norton either. http://www.meg*upload.com/?d=QRZCE2GN
,namtolng,2011-11-05T19:19Z,"It actually looks like an okay site, just a little annoying is all. But thanks for the great upload!"
,namtolng,2011-11-05T19:31Z,I can confirm 3dmgame.com is a good site. It's a minor crack group but anyway it's A-OK
,ss9417,2011-11-05T21:06Z,"Applied the crack, tried running game as Admin.
It gives me a box saying: ""Critiacal Error
The detected configuration does not match your current hardware. Please re-run the configuration tool.""
But when I try to run the configuration tool it instantly crashes...
Help me! Im on Windows XP SP3"
