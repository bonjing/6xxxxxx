Vicki and Jordan are supposed to meet for a coffee while she's in town for business. Instead they meet in her hotel room. There has always been sexual tension between them but neither one has acted on it because Vicki is married. But now alone, in a hotel, far from home...there's nothing stopping Vicki and Jordan from fulfilling their passions as well as a few other things...but was it worth the wait?
