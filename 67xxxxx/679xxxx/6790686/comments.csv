[V],boobsman,2011-11-03T08:33Z,"@ MrWalido, im a super mod on KAT, you don't get more trusted than that!!!"
[V],boobsman,2011-11-03T08:35Z,"@ kidmagic11, this game is 0800 ripped which give an error free copy, this means you do not need to patch for on line play but you will need to wait for the release date or you get banned for sure!!!"
,MrWalido,2011-11-03T10:48Z,@boobsman.. everybody knows you and i have been downloading 100z of ur uploads on kat.ph.. u r  simply the best ;-)
,lokolokomo,2011-11-03T15:52Z,"boobsman,I burn it using IMG,but it turn out Mixed Media Disc when I put it inside my xbox,pls advice and Thank's."
[V],boobsman,2011-11-03T17:44Z,@ lokolokomo have you got LT+2.0 firmware? if not this game will not work. Also have you followed the burn guide for XGD3 games?
,JornXD,2011-11-03T17:45Z,"HELP!, i burned it with CloneCD, and its saying file is too big, i just skiped but it wont work, help???"
,YouAreTheBest,2011-11-03T18:04Z,@ boobsman i understand you get banned if you play online but could i still play with my profile while offline? 
,TGOD_ROB,2011-11-03T18:38Z,Sooooo can u play this online when it comes out for everybody or should we wait for tha abgx360 to see ifi ts stealth patched
[V],boobsman,2011-11-03T19:21Z,"@ TGOD_ROB & YouAreTheBest, you need to wait until the game is released in the shops before you play online or you'll get banned, its an 0800 rip so does not need to be patched for online play.

@ JornXD, this is an XGD3 game so the iso is larger than a standard dual layer dvd, you need to follow one of the XGD3 burn guides for the correct way to burn the disc but remember you need LT+2.0 firmware or the game will not work!!!"
,JornXD,2011-11-03T19:34Z,"@boobsman I did, i already got  LT+2.0 firmware, it it saying Play the game, then it goes back to dashboard, i already followed XGD3 tutorials, 
Also says when burning @ IMGburn:
W 18:10:03 Set L0 Data Zone Capacity Failed! - Reason: Invalid Field in Parameter List

Also changes the Layer Break to: 2133520
Or should i use CloneCD? it also said disk too small"
,MrWalido,2011-11-03T20:37Z,"100% working... i used the following method and its working fine.. 
Sony DVD+R DL 8.5GB
LG DVD Burner
IMGBurn 2.5.6.0

1. Open IMGBurn and select ""write image files to disk""
2. Go to Tools>settings>write> select the option of ""calculate optimal"" for layer break.
3. Select Ace87.dvd (COD MW3)
4. Write speed should be 2.4x and start burning
5. You will come up with two options..select ""Truncate.. write until end of Disc""
6. Once you complete the burning process, install the game on your console and enjoy.

P.S. Not tested online and on verbatim DVDz"
,JornXD,2011-11-03T21:20Z,@MrWalido Do i need OPC Check on or off?
,madude1973,2011-11-03T21:50Z,omg are you all new here. lol have u not heard of Liteon iHAS*24-B DVD Writer to iXtreme Burner Max FW. new dvd burner that burns 100 % xgd3 games with imgburn .?????????????????????????? you lot need to push more buttons. 
,babbleM,2011-11-03T22:56Z,"question for anyone who can answer it, most of the new xfd3 releases like, Cod MW3, Batman arkham city, Battlefield & Rage say ""to play this game u need to install a system update, if u do not install this update u can not play the game""  - my question is, will installing this update flash my 360 to stock?

p.s. I have read that it is harmless but I want to be double sure to avoid the hassle of reflashing thanks "
,lokolokomo,2011-11-03T23:19Z,"boobsman,can this work in xbox NTSC/J?,Thanks."
,bazman101,2011-11-03T23:56Z,"hey, anyone else having download speed issues? getting 10kbs :/ uploading at 130kbs too"
,MrWalido,2011-11-04T00:07Z,"@JornXD.. The purpose of OPC is to improve writing quality when using low quality media.. but i dont prefer using that option on Sony DVD+R DL

@madude1973.. Thats the best option... but till i get a liteon.. still i can use my lg burner.. i already completed Driver SF and BF3 with no errors.. n playing MW3 "
,MrWalido,2011-11-04T00:20Z,@babbleM.... U neeed to reflash ur xbox with the new LT 2.0 firmware to play all XGD3 games
,v360961,2011-11-04T00:25Z,Just wrote this game on a normal Imation DVD DL using CLONECD (specifically) without a single problem on my normal burner which came with my laptop. This game doesn't have any CIV checks unlike Forza 4. Even Skyrim doesn't have any CIV checks. I've played both of em' just a couple of hours back and I must say......AMAZING!
,JornXD,2011-11-04T00:31Z,"@MrWalido Do i need OPC on Verbatim? And look, i still aint got it working, what do i exactly need to do? Download MW3, Open IMGBurn, and then what do i need to change before burning? (ive got verbatim 8,5gb) I did it before, but when i did the disk in the xbox it said play game and then it went black and went to the Dashboard again. HELP!"
,bazman101,2011-11-04T01:00Z,"just a heads up guys, GTA V trailers on youtube, i imagine not long til its release :D"
,MrWalido,2011-11-04T01:13Z,"@JornXD.. theres no way i can help you with cheap verbatims.. i dont use them and dont know anything about them.. I have 100z of games on Sony DVD+R DL & TDK DVD+R... They make real good copies and the best for XGD3 too

P.S.. For better quality burns update your dvd burner.. Just open My Computer and note down the model number of your DVD Burner.. google the firmware update for it and you are good to go.. i will make sure you play this game until tomorow :)"
,babbleM,2011-11-04T01:50Z,"@mrwalido I DO have the lt2.0 firmware. Battleflied 3, COD MW3, Skyrim, Batman Arkham City & Rage ask for a mandatory ""system update"" or else you can't play the game. what to do? is it a harmles update"
,babbleM,2011-11-04T01:56Z,"@JornXD - I use verbatims and i can assure you this torrent DOES work, as I've already burned it succesfully. This is how u burn verbatim's with imgburn: http://nickthegr33k.eu/XGD3burn.pdf
"
,MrWalido,2011-11-04T02:16Z,@babbleM.. so you dont have the latest dashboard update (13599) i guess.. and cant play any of those games yet..... well it depends on your console and xbox DVD version.. some gets flagged after the update or some gets locked so cant flash them again until replacing the PCB.. U neeed to update your console first and i mentioned the risks too
,MrWalido,2011-11-04T02:20Z,"But remember, it's always safe to reflash your drive to stock before updating your console anytime."
,Chutgur,2011-11-04T03:59Z,Hey guys! I downloaded it last night. But I didn't burn it yet. Is that really REGION FREE? My Xbox region is NTSC/J.
,brstarks,2011-11-04T04:02Z,We Need More Seeders!!!!
[V],boobsman,2011-11-04T09:45Z,"@JornXD, follow the guide given by babbleM, the game does work but DON'T PLAY ONLINE OR SAVE ACHIEVEMENTS TO YOUR HDD!!!"
,chronic2011,2011-11-04T18:07Z,"for anyone having slow speeds, i used xbox360iso.com to get the game and I was CONSTANTLY getting 1MB/Sec i don't use torrents anymore i use that site."

and when you burn a disc via IMGBURN it says
""overburn"" or ""truncate""
which option should I choose?
Thanks"
