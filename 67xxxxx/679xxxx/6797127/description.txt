Since the introduction of fluorescent calcium indicators and the subsequent development of capacities for real-time monitoring and imaging of calcium movements in the intact cells studied in isolation, in situ and in vivo, the complex and vital calcium signaling system has been illuminated, proving calcium signals to be excellent universal reporters of cellular activity. In "Calcium Measurement Methods", a team of renowned experts in the field contribute methods dedicated to calcium imaging in neural cells with a balance between the main principles of calcium imaging and specific applications of the technique to neural tissues. The book's contents show how the combination of different indicators and recently developed microscopic techniques lead to spectacular successes in the imaging of neural cells in the living brain in both physiological and pathophysiological models. As a volume in the successful Neuromethodsâ„¢ series, the chapters provide authoritative reviews including up-to-date detailed protocols of the most commonly used approaches in the field.

Cutting-edge and concise, "Calcium Measurement Methods" serves as an ideal reference to aid the many scientists worldwide engaged in calcium imaging of the nervous system.
