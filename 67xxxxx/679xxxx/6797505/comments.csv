,meeyou,2011-11-05T21:14Z,"@Skoxz 
No but this is no bug, its simply not available even with not cracked game, but in this there is bug causing crash during comparing players"

With this patch, the monthly awards bug go away?
I don't use the players comparision so.. it would be benefit to install this.




there was no such bug, you wont see award history if there isnt any, simple as that... you can add history with editor, which I did for country."
,purgiii,2011-11-05T23:40Z,thx ;) 
,Zapsta,2011-11-06T00:44Z,"@Skoxz Someone posted this screenshot the other day: http://i.imgur.com/lc5oN.jpg
3 months into the season, there should be histories for player of the month, manager of the month, etc, but they're still greyed out."
,meeyou,2011-11-06T08:58Z,"@sitakott
very true, if there is no month awards You wont be able to see them SIMPLE! go to editor and enable this for ur fav. leauge if u want so badly this"
,MaRkOvIc...,2011-11-06T09:12Z,installed it works great untill i wanna compare players with each other an error message pops up and it closes the game :(
,alp1n3,2011-11-06T12:38Z,"There is a bug in this crack release. When you want to compare two players according to their attributes, the game starts crashing."
,stas716,2011-11-08T19:40Z,Will skidrow or anybody release a fix? This comparison shit really annoys..

,DrFeffer,2011-11-29T01:08Z,I have a problem with transfer money. I've started quite a few games now but I haven't had any money at all for signing players. Bug?
,DrFeffer,2011-11-30T21:09Z,"Not a bug..
But what about the editor?? Doesn't work at all. The Data-stuff can't be found.

Other than that it works like a charm!"
