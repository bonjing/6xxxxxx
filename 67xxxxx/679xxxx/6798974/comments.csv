,ClumsyParasite,2011-12-01T00:03Z,"Great job, mate. Keep the updates coming though, 4.3 has got a lot of new stuff. And for you noobs, make sure you have an AUTHENTICATOR for your account. Not calling anybody a hacker here, just saying... watch out with downloading these guides."
,mario0029,2011-12-02T16:18Z,Well I have one on my account and I get the guide for the gf she is new. I have a 85 tank and hunter. But it's a very good guide. I guess he wont be uploading the newest guide it was fun while it lasted lol...

,gbs00,2011-12-03T19:03Z,"Hey ungrateful fucks, how about be happy that you even have it? Who cares if it's the latest version? Just be happy you even have it without having to pay that ridiculous $40."
,hootieman,2011-12-04T23:48Z,"Its 25 bucks, and it'd be cool to have it for 4.3 since their is a ton of new additions"
,mario0029,2011-12-06T04:23Z,Well I am far from ungrateful. I thanked them for the up. But the thing is the new version of wow broke the current version that is here. So before going off at the mouth get the story of why there asking for a updated version...
,ClumsyParasite,2011-12-07T23:31Z,"What are you guys talking about? I'm leveling fine with this AddOn... 4.3 doesn't BREAK the add on, but they will need to tweak it a lot due to the fact that the EXP needed to get from level 70 to level 80 was nerfed by... 33%. That's the only thing I see wrong with using this version"
,uflaccid,2011-12-10T19:02Z,"Hey Forland91, are you planning on updating for WoW 4.3? As of Dec. 10, this version of Zygor is out of date, and I rarely play without it. Thanks so much for continuing to post the latest guides here. "
,PsychoCarebear,2011-12-12T06:43Z,"Hmm, no word from Forland91 in over a month. I hope (s)he's OK..."
