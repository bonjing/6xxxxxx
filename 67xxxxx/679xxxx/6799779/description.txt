Tron 2.0 is a first person shooter computer game developed by Monolith Productions. According to Tron creator Steven Lisberger, Tron 2.0 was the official 

sequel to the 1982 film Tron, but was later declared non-canon by Tron: Legacy director Joesph Kosinski.[1] The PC version of the game was released by Buena 

Vista Games on August 26, 2003. The Mac version was released by MacPlay on April 21, 2004.

Bruce Boxleitner reprises his role from the original film as Alan Bradley. Cindy Morgan, who also starred in the original film, voices a new character Ma3a, 

although Lora Bradley (now Alan's wife, deceased by the game's timeframe) is mentioned by name. Rebecca Romijn provides the voice of Mercury. A new 'light 

cycle' design was contributed to the game by Syd Mead. The game explained the Tron arcade game, which appears in-game, and film as based on Kevin Flynn's 

experiences inside ENCOM in the original film.

The story is centered around Alan's son Jethro ("Jet") Bradley. Since the film's events, ENCOM has been taken over by a company called Future Control 

Industries (fCon). After talking with his father who is kidnapped while on the phone with Jet, Jet is digitized by Ma3a, Alan's AI computer system, to aid 

her in combating Thorne, an executive from fCon who was improperly digitized into the computer and is now a corruption spreading like a virus throughout the 

system. Jet is quickly, and mistakenly, identified as the source of the corruption, and is captured by Kernel, the systems security control program.
