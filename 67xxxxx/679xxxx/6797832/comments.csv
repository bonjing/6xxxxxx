,ColtraneExpress,2011-11-24T07:41Z,"Although I am absolutely grateful for this amazing torrent, I am a bit frustrated at how slow it is. I've been downloading non-stop for days and I've barely downloaded anything. There seems to be all these people not seeding.

I'm planning on seeding this for a long time (once I finally download the whole thing in a few years), so I hope things pick up a bit. Thanks again for this great torrent."
,fauxphony,2011-12-05T08:48Z,"I have completed this file in less than 48 hours and I have been uploading the file for more than 48+ hours at at least 3.5MB/s I Will continue to see for the next 12 days.  As of right now i've UL'd 400+ GBs of this file and only downloaded 75 so please hold your comments about me only seeding for 14 days.  

Big ups to the uploader.  I've been searching for this high and low and I got it a few years back but the quality was sh*t and this stuff you have is good to go in my book  Thanks a ton for all of your efforts.  "

,khardankov,2012-04-03T13:42Z,"would really appreciate either a .torrent file in addition to the magnet link, or someone to tell me how to download individual files from a magnet link without downloading the whole lot... just looking for the season 1 extras, really."
,msankalpa,2012-04-11T16:42Z,just added it to my box will seed it :)
,righteousaurus,2012-05-19T13:07Z,"Will comment on A/V when sample is obtained. For the clarification of magnets links: I use ""Transmission"" as my torrent downloader. After metadata is received you are given a list of the files and if it doesn't appear automatically you simply have to click on it and then click on the icon that look like to files and then you can check or uncheck what you want/don't want.

Comentará A / V cuando la muestra se obtiene. Para el esclarecimiento de los vínculos imanes: Yo uso ""transmisión"" como mi programa de descarga torrent. Después de los metadatos que se recibe se le da una lista de los archivos y si no aparece automáticamente sólo tienes que hacer clic en él y, a continuación, haga clic en el icono que se parecen a los archivos y entonces usted puede activar o desactivar lo que quiere / no 't quiere."
,righteousaurus,2012-05-19T13:09Z,"Oh and I recently started having difficulty with the magnets links, they wouldn't open and it just kept reloading the page. I set up an account and they began to work again. Not quite sure why yet. Hope this helps someone. 

Ah y yo hace poco comenzó a tener problemas con los enlaces de los imanes, que no se podía abrir y que sólo mantuvo a cargar la página. He configurado una cuenta y empezaron a trabajar de nuevo. No del todo seguro de por qué todavía. Espero que esto ayude a alguien."
