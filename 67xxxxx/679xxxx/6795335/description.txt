Storyline: Sam and Leo Cleary have grown up hating each other, and neither likes their
juvenile delinquent kid brother, Douglas, to whom they've only recently been introduced.
The sons share the same father, a womanizing drunk, but all have different mothers. Their
father died a rich man and when they're brought together by their sister Nina to learn
which of them will inherit the old man's fortune, they are handed an unpleasant surprise.
A requirement of the will is that the three estranged siblings go into business together
as bail bondsmen. Their first job is to bring in a parole violator who has left Leo with
a $250,000 debt. Their search will take them into the mountains of Mexico where they
encounter a drug lord and uncover a kidnapping plot, masterminded by an embittered
entrepreneur that will endanger them all.
