,steelllynx,2011-11-20T03:40Z,"we have a lot more bandwidth and a ton more hard drive space than we did five years ago.  why did NTSC DVDR (R1) disappear?

To all seeds, THANK YOU!"
,dlarrym1111,2011-11-23T22:54Z,"FYI: NTSC stands for:  (National Television Systems Committee). It is referring to the way that the picture is ""scanned"" onto your TV screen. The other main standard is PAL. 

PAL stand for (Phase Alternate Line) It is a little bit better as far as resolution but now, HI-DEF is pretty much the norm. and so much better then either of the fore mentioned formats, that it makes NTSC and PAL look like a joke.

@steelllynx: R1 NTSC DVD's still do exist??? Every DVD sold in the US is an R1 NTSC DVD. . . I think DVD's sold in Canada are also R1's and in NTSC. Are the millions of DVD's sold in the US not enough????

What are you talking about?????? or are you being sarcastic.???"
