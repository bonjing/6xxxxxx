,yesterdays_pirate,2012-04-16T06:05Z,"First of all, this is a very weird torrent because  a lot of people are seeding yet no one seem to care to add comments. Now, for those who are saying the crack doesn't work, they are doing something wrong since my installation went flawlessly. The crack does WORK. Although, there's one matter I don't understand since there isn't any installation steps(besides the crack installation) 

There are two files, SolidEdgeV104ENGLISH_64Bit and SEAccessoriesV104ENGLISH_64Bit. I don't know in what order they should be installed but what I did was to copy all the content of SEAccessoriesV104ENGLISH_64Bit and paste it into the SolidEdgeV104ENGLISH_64Bit and run the installation from there and it works(with the crack of course) Initially I had installed the SolidEdgeV104ENGLISH_64Bit only and it worked as well. Anyways, even though it works so far, what's the correct installation? Thanks."
,mark_3138,2012-04-16T08:34Z,Hi I tried both combinations and install orders. However while the software will run and pass the first license test if you try to open an old file or create a new one it hangs then crashes. 
,yesterdays_pirate,2012-04-16T12:04Z,"@mark_3138, I opened my older files done in SE ST3 and they open fine in this SE ST4. Although, these old files are in other formats(STL, IGS, SAT, etc.) Are your older files in the native formats?"
,mark_3138,2012-04-17T09:17Z,"no they are ST4 files, but even opening new files does not work. I had a trial license for a while as soon as i can save the $12K i will buy the software but at the moment i cannot afford to. So i am familiar with the software. It is possibile that there are registry entries from the previous instll i need to remove will try that. thks"

I like Solid Edge a lot, it's a very intuitive program to use. Therefore, I have downloaded a lot of versions through the years. One thing I found out is that the licenses that generally come to ""crack"" the software, have some kind of timebomb or tag, because after some time, projects that you made can't be opened anymore, it gives an error (This part has internal inconsistencies) and can't be edited. It was also tagged in some form also, as it opened with a legit license, it still gave the inconsistencies error but it opened anyway and you could edit it (if I recall correctly).
My guess is that the same guys from Solid Edge release this ""special"" licenses so pirates use the software but then get screwed.
The only license I have had good luck and hasn't failed me since a couple of years is one from Team-SolidSQUAD for Solid Edge ST2. Haven't tested recent versions though.
I don't know, perhaps something similar is happening to you."
