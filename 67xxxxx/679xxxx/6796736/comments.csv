,turrel,2011-12-01T04:29Z,will this stop the random crashes to desktop? because it's getting beyond a joke now
,turrel,2011-12-01T06:11Z,"thanks now it won't run at all.
could not open library file"
,ArrMetal,2011-12-04T01:06Z,"Hi man, 
I've installed updates 1-15 and update 16 in order to play with my friend the new additional co-op level DLC called ""Peer Review"", which was released on October 4 (I assume these updates you uploaded provide the new DLC, don't they?). 
Information about ""Peer Review"" DLC is available in the links below: 
http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2011/10/04/portal-2-quot-peer-review-quot-dlc-impressions.aspx
http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/10/04/portal-2-peer-review-dlc-released/

However: 
1. First of all, I press ""~"" in order to open this ""console"" window in which I write my friend's IP address and then start the coop mode level, but the console window won't open. 
Which key on the keyboard should I press in order to open the console window? 
2. Second of all, me and my friend have played coop mode in Portal 2 via hamachi and portal 2's ""Coop-Launcher"" program. My friend always handles the ""Coop-Launcher"" program while I handle the ""console"" window. However my friend said he hadn't seen any additional levels from this co-op-level-DLC called ""Peer Review"". Are these new coop levels actually provided in these torrents of updates 1-15 and 16? How are we supposed to play these new levels? Could you post instructions manual that explains how to play the new levels? In case the DLC isn't provided in your torrents of updates 1-16, could you please upload the DLC? I'd be grateful. 
Thanks mate!"

Or this 16 is enough after the ""1 to 15"" NoGrp one ?
Thanks :)"
,Notaplayer,2012-01-13T13:52Z,yeah thx :p now i get the same as turrel ...
,Notaplayer,2012-01-13T14:00Z,"@ Turrel & anybody else with same issue as we encountered..
I just got the crack fix from skidrow and voila the game works fine again"
,dothackjhe,2012-03-14T02:52Z,"I'm getting a black screen issue with the game. Updated it using the updates from noGRP (updates 1 to 15 & update 16) then applied the crack. 

It's not a video card issue I think since it's updated as of today, and this computer meets the system requirements for the game. "
