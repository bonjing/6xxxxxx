The game's fundamentals stay true to the previous games in the series. Your cab is equipped with a special boost, 

to gain leverage during jumps, drifts, etc. Earning money is the central point of the gameplay. Once a customer 

enters your vehicle, you'll be free to use any means necessary in order to reach a particular location on time. The 

basic idea is to make it a fun ride, so your fair would tip the cabdriver. Hazardous driving through crowded 

streets is the best way to earn extra money. Customers will be cheering as your cab flies into the air or rushes 

straight between two oncoming vehicles. The most important thing in the game, besides picking up passengers on the 

street, is beating the clock in order to gain extra seconds. Taking shortcuts is usually the best way to do this. 

As you ride through the city districts at high speed, you'll be running into plenty of obstacles that can slow you 

down; from lampposts, mailboxes, monuments, etc. Also, the sidewalks are crawling with people that go about their 

daily business. Unlike GTA: Vice City, Crazy Taxi 3 does away with blood and gore. No matter how hard you try, 

pedestrians simply won't allow themselves to be flattened by your cab; which kinda seems funny, when you notice 

grandpa Jo leaping sideways like a Ninja in order to avoid being hit by your cab.
