This is an ISO image from the CD of the first edition of Backyard Football by Humongous Entertainment, which was made in 1999. For more information about the game, see the link below. It's been tested successfully on Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft Windows NT 5.0, and Microsoft Windows NT 5.1. I don't know how it will behave on systems with something above XP.

My bandwidth is scarce, so it might take a little while to download until seeders accumulate.
