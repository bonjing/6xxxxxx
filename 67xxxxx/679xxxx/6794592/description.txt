    Saturday Kitchen's James Martin wants to convince us to    
    cook with different sorts of eggs, rather than always     
    choosing the tried and trusted hen option. He travels    
    to meet duck and quail egg producers who are trying to    
    revive the fortunes of these once popular eggs. Among      
    the dishes he creates in the Revival kitchen is a         
    magnificent sponge cake made with duck eggs which looks  
    nothing less than spectacular.                            
                                                               
    Irish-born chef Richard Corrigan is a keen fisherman      
    and is passionate about fresh fish but he is shocked to  
    discover that we export the vast majority of our          
    mackerel catch. He is determined to change our             
    attitudes to this rather overlooked fish by proving       
    that not only is it incredibly good for us but that it   
    tastes delicious too. He devises a range of wonderful     
    recipes which showcase the benefits of cooking with        
    locally caught fresh mackerel.
