Roger Waters - Radio K.A.O.S. (Definitive Edition)

This is an expanded edition of Radio KAOS that was released by Project KAOS back in 2000. 
It fleshes out the concept far better by including tracks that were used as b-sides and the When The Wind Blows soundtrack, and resequencing it all together to make a better storyline.
It also uses some clever reconstructing of "Billy" towards the end to recreate the dialog used in the KAOS vhs and concerts.

I am unsure of the kpbs of the original, but this FLAC is made from my CD that was created from the original mp3 files, which were available as downloadable MP3 only. 
After owning this for so long, I can only listen to this version anymore. It adds so much more to the "Billy" concept like the concerts did. Hope you enjoy as I have!
