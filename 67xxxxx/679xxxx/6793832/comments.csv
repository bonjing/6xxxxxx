,Grim-Reapers,2011-11-04T04:27Z,This is obviously not a fake !
,Grim-Reapers,2011-11-04T04:49Z,"I am sorry, i was wrong, this is nuked, there is some sort off problem whis this file, do not download.
But u can trust green skull uploader, just not this file!."
,Grim-Reapers,2011-11-04T04:58Z,"LOL sorry again but there is no problem with the file, but there is a problem if u play the file true uTorrent, then the file is just 1 minute long.
I didn't se this because i didn't unpack the file because i always play things true uTorrent."
,erroneus,2011-11-04T07:36Z,Love the confusion.  It was first thought fake because it was too soon to put here... and it was!  Most impressive getting it up here that fast.  But I have never seen a fake that was in a multi-segment RAR with a preview clip before... and still haven't because this one isn't fake.
,PTWraith,2011-11-04T11:10Z,I just really can't understand WHY THE HELL is the video split into a bunch of archives? What for? why couldn't you seed just one video file?
,ivanniksich,2011-11-04T11:32Z,"Thanks for the upload sceneline! You guys alwasy do it right, but plese no more rars. It really affects the amount of seeder in long therm."

,anichu,2011-11-06T21:52Z,"First of all, it isn't fake. Secondly, stop complaining about it being a rar file, it takes like 15s to unzip it. Thirdly, great upload, thanks :)"
