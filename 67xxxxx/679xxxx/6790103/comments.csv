first of all you need to go back to school and learn correct english, Secondly you 're a Stupid DOG, Obviously for the benefit of people that don't know, it's safe to wait till the release date before uploading gameplay online, people have been arrested before. You don't know how investigations are done. I'll REPEAT, DO NOT UPLOAD GAMEPLAY ONLINE, DON'T LET THE PIRATE BAY BE TARGETTED B'COS OF YOUR SELFISHNESS."

If you truly think that Activision is just going to roll over and let there billion dollar project run rampant on the internet you have another thing coming. The next few days are going to be very interesting to see how many of you morons get fined for copyright infringement.

No worries mate play it online and dont go crying when they ban you / fine you for it. No skin of my nose. Activision have already had a press conference stating they will ban and fine any players they catch playing it online. 

@Mrnexus

I will be waiting for my retail copy and i play on going to the midnight launch to pick it up, Im just shocked that a game of this magnitude that people would be actually stupid enough to try plan it online pre-release, I have no problem with people downloading it / playing it assuming you were going to be playing the campaign offline. To play the game online you have to log into THEIR servers, and dont you think they are going to be tracking people who magically have this game pre-release? 

Im all for TPB and kudos to the fine people who upload great torrents such as this one. Im aiming my comments at the moronic people playing it online that will be the ones who end up suffering the most. Im not going to push my luck and get slapped with a $5000 fine just to play a game a few days earlier."

To be honest besides Assasins creed, the COD games are the only xbox games i have even played in the past 2 years.

THANKS VERY MUCH TO: Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 3 RF XGD3 0800-XBOX360-[BTARENA.org]  ""AiTB"" to be first to release this so long time expected Game of INFINITY WARD n ACTIVISION!!!

10 EASY STEPS TO FOLLOW IN HELPINSTRUCTIONS BELOW:


It workes for me because I have Flashed/Chipped my XBOX 360, and updated to new Firmware LT+ 2.0! (NOT LT+1.9 or less) Check u Xbox 360 in System Settings > Console Settings > System Info > DASHBOARD Nr: 20135990

If U have Flashed/Chipped n it still donÂ´t work u can allways Update u Xbox 360 on this site below n burn to a cd, or better download the New Update to an empty USB-harddrive. Remeber to put the Update in the ROOT of u USB, n then just put it in any of the front Usb-gates of u Xbox 360 n start up - it goes autom! http://support.xbox.com/sv-se/xbox-360/how-to/update-xbox-360/system-updates

DOWNLOAD THE 2 FILES OF THIS COMPLETE GAME, (8.14 GB), PUT TOGETHER IN A FILE AT THE DESKTOP. CHECK THAT U HAVE DUAL LAYER BURNER IN U COMPUTER.


Normaly I Allways Test ALL Xbox 360 games and Verify it to 100% before burning the game with the easy program: ""Abgx360"". 

But now it don't even recognize the imagefile or dvdfile at all? But donÂ´t worry about that - It works 100% anyway. 


INSTRUCTIONS FOR BURNING XGD3 BACKUPS WITH IMGBURN: I recommended that you download and use the latest version of ImgBurn (v 2.5.6.0) downloadable at:
http://www.imgburn.com/index.php?act=download)

Older versions may handle this burningprocess differently and/or give a different set of errors in the game.


1. Click and open the >IMGBURN >HELP >About Imgburn. U now will see if u have the latest Imgburn version: (v 2.5.6.0) Coded by: LIGHTNING UK!

2. >Tools >Settings >Write. In Options itÂ´s allready selected: User Specified, and written 1913760 Change this numbers first to: 2133520 and then select >Calculate Optimal and click OK. 

3. Click >Write image file to disc

4. After ""Please select a file..."" U click on the yellow map: Browse for a file

5. Hold U Pointer abowe the top smallest dvdfile: 1 kB (35 bytes) and click On it.

6. On top it should now be written: codmow3 Check the write speed Maximum: 2,4x 

7. Click on ""Write"" at the bottom.

8. Choose and click on: Write until end of disc (Truncate)

9. It will now in some Xbox depending of witch drive u have, ask if U would like to burn the game that is oversized 8 534030 GB on u only 8.5 GB disc?
Click >Yes

It now burns the game for about 35 min. and then says: Operation Successfull! Just click OK, close Imgburn, and take out the disc.

10. Install this Complete finished burned 7.6 GB Game Disc to your Harddrive on U Xbox360 untill 100% is complete. Start the game. It works PERFECTLY A 100%!!!


THE ONLY WRITEABLE DISC WORKING A 100% IS: ""VERBATIM DVD+R DL 8.5 GB""

@zgangsta93 If you made it to 97% then tell it to finalize the disc. Use ImgBurn or CloneCD to burn it and when it warns you at the beginning that the file is too big, pick 'burn to end of disc'. This is known as truncate method. 
Tho i would highly recommend you look up the iXtreme Burner Max as truncating can be pretty dangerous as far as bans since the release of forza 4."

What firmware version are you using? You should be using LT+ 2.0. The version that added support for XGD3. It has a feature that fakes the truncated part of the disc. But you really shouldn't be truncating discs anymore. because its already been defeated by M$.

@123nanez
Verify XGD3 burns to the image afterwards. Just because it says it burned 100% doesnt mean it burnt 100%. If you run verify now, i bet you'd get an error right at 49%. This is right where the new firmware is doing its magic. 
I'd also bet your using something other than verbatim, which is what that firmware is intended for.
I use memorex and it requires some tweaking.

Heres a tutorial: 
http://forums.afterdawn.com/t.cfm/f-152/xgd3_pc_burner_max_memorex_a_cheap_media_tutorial-914320/

Make sure you run KProbe too, because it can still give you a read error and fail a civ check if the game has it.
Sound like a long process but it definately beats buying it. Once you get it working for media you can probably skip the IMGburn verify and jump strait to kprobe.


@ownurmom
Wow dude, your fucked. You never play games before release date online. Your console is already flagged on their servers. Some of those people are testers making sure the game is solid for release.
They wont ban you right away, because activision doesnt handle that microsoft does. They have a staff that does that. and theyre probably just waiting for you to lure the rest of the sheep to the slaughter.

They actually just started staffing for the next big ban wave so for the rest of us, tread softly."

my xbox has been updated with lt2.0 and i use imgburn to burn the disc. i use verbatim discs aswell


i have downloaded this, however when i burnt the disk my xbox says it is unrecognised. when i was burning i followed these steps from a similar game.,....

1. Click and open the >IMGBURN >HELP >About Imgburn. U now will see if u have the latest Imgburn version: (v 2.5.6.0) Coded by: LIGHTNING UK!

2. >Tools >Settings >Write. In Options itÃ‚Â´s allready selected: User Specified, and written 1913760 Change this numbers first to: 2133520 and then select >Calculate Optimal and click OK. 

3. Click >Write image file to disc

4. After ""Please select a file..."" U click on the yellow map: Browse for a file

5. Hold U Pointer abowe the top smallest dvdfile (37 bytes) and click On it.

6. On top it should now say: \rrod-gow3.dvd

7. Click on ""Write"" at the bottom.

8. Choose and click on: Write until end of disc (Truncate)

9. It will now ask if U would like to burn the game that is 8.7 GB on u 8.5 GB disc.
Click >Yes

It now burns the game for about 35 min. and then says: Operation Successful! Just click OK, close Imgburn, and take out the disc.


DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG?? lol"
,CrimsonRush,2011-11-06T17:59Z,"@mckeown2012
  It doesn't really help that much to know the steps you allegedly followed, it's better to post the actions you actually performed.
  That tutorial is moving in the right direction but there are a few things a bit off. I'd suggest you find a tutorial from someone that actually understands what it is hes doing, not someone that thinks the browse icon is a 'yellow map.' 
Its a folder, it has always been a folder, since the beginning of graphical operating systems it has been a folder.

Google is your friend."
,Fresh101,2011-11-06T22:14Z,"Can the ISO file that you download affect the quality of the burn? for example the end result for KProbe2. 

I am just asking as I burn Batman, based on Team Xecuter steps and guide, the KProbe was a great burn PI Max 17 PIF Max 3 but when it comes to MW3 I get crazy results PI Max 135 PIF Max 7.

Please help clarifying. Thanks

,CrimsonRush,2011-11-07T04:42Z,"@Fresh101
ISO no, game maybe.

If you down the same game from multiple sources, the ISOs, assuming they're ripped properly, will be identical.

I don't know enough to say that if the game your burning will affect it though. What i do know is kprobe doesnt check the integrity of the data, just how readable it is, which varies from disc to disc.
You might want to ask that on team-xecutors forum.

You can probably get away with 135 and 7, but you might want to install it on the harddrive when the release date comes.
17 and 3 is super good. Were you using the same batch of discs?"

,bigtony1986,2011-11-07T07:33Z,"I downloaded this and burned using the latest imgburn, did the truncate stuff, etc etc etc. The disc burned successfully with no errors by imgburn. 

However when I put it into the xbox i get halfway through a campaign or multiplayer level and it eventually exists the game saying the disc is not readable. 


So is the only way to make this fully working is to get a lite-on ihas drive? I know it's the only drive currently supported to flash the max burn firmware that says it fully burns the games correctly is why I'm wondering.

I will get the drive anyway this week probably but I am wondering in the meantime if there is a workaround."

well it isn't that i could not even play for a second, there is a specific place when this error shows up, 
eg in GOW 1, error came at the end of act 3 (belly of the beast) during the cutscene AND now in this MW3, I've completed two missions, i guess, the same error shows up during the HIMACHAL PARDESH mission

THANKS VERY MUCH TO: Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 3 RF XGD3 0800-XBOX360-[BTARENA.org] ""AiTB"" to be first to release this so long time expected Game of INFINITY WARD n ACTIVISION!!!

10 EASY STEPS TO FOLLOW IN HELPINSTRUCTIONS BELOW:


It workes for me because I have Flashed/Chipped my XBOX 360, and updated to new Firmware LT+ 2.0! (NOT LT+1.9 or less) Check u Xbox 360 in System Settings > Console Settings > System Info > DASHBOARD Nr: 20135990

If U have Flashed/Chipped n it still donÃ‚Â´t work u can allways Update u Xbox 360 on this site below n burn to a cd, or better download the New Update to an empty USB-harddrive. Remeber to put the Update in the ROOT of u USB, n then just put it in any of the front Usb-gates of u Xbox 360 n start up - it goes autom! http://support.xbox.com/sv-se/xbox-360/how-to/update-xbox-360/system-updates

DOWNLOAD THE 2 FILES OF THIS COMPLETE GAME, (8.14 GB), PUT TOGETHER IN A FILE AT THE DESKTOP. CHECK THAT U HAVE DUAL LAYER BURNER IN U COMPUTER.


Normaly I Allways Test ALL Xbox 360 games and Verify it to 100% before burning the game with the easy program: ""Abgx360"".

But now it don't even recognize the imagefile or dvdfile at all? But donÃ‚Â´t worry about that - It works 100% anyway.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR BURNING XGD3 BACKUPS WITH IMGBURN: I recommended that you download and use the latest version of ImgBurn (v 2.5.6.0) downloadable at:
http://www.imgburn.com/index.php?act=download)

Older versions may handle this burningprocess differently and/or give a different set of errors in the game.


1. Click and open the >IMGBURN >HELP >About Imgburn. U now will see if u have the latest Imgburn version: (v 2.5.6.0) Coded by: LIGHTNING UK!

2. >Tools >Settings >Write. In Options itÃ‚Â´s allready selected: User Specified, and written 1913760 Change this numbers first to: 2133520 and then select >Calculate Optimal and click OK.

3. Click >Write image file to disc

4. After ""Please select a file..."" U click on the yellow map: Browse for a file

5. Hold U Pointer abowe the top smallest dvdfile: 1 kB (35 bytes) and click On it.

6. On top it should now be written: codmow3 Check the write speed Maximum: 2,4x

7. Click on ""Write"" at the bottom.

8. Choose and click on: Write until end of disc (Truncate)

9. It will now in some Xbox depending of witch drive u have, ask if U would like to burn the game that is oversized 8 534030 GB on u only 8.5 GB disc?
Click >Yes

It now burns the game for about 35 min. and then says: Operation Successfull! Just click OK, close Imgburn, and take out the disc.

10. Install this Complete finished burned 7.6 GB Game Disc to your Harddrive on U Xbox360 untill 100% is complete. Start the game. It works PERFECTLY A 100%!!!


THE ONLY WRITEABLE DISC WORKING A 100% IS: ""VERBATIM DVD+R DL 8.5 GB""
THAT U CAN ORDER CHEAPEST DVDPACK OF 10, 25, or 50 DISCS = (1 EUR/DISC + mail price) DIFFERENT SIZEPACKS ON: http://www.sweburn.com/search.php?mode=search&page=1

NOTE: (IF) U HAVE OLD FIRMWARE less than LT+2.0: WHEN U DOWNLOAD ANY NEW GAMES, N U PUT THE DISC IN U XBOX, IT WILL ASK IF U WANT 2 UPDATE U XBOX JUST TO START THE GAME?
AND I PRESSED (YES)... WARNING..!!!! IT WILL MAKE U DOWNGRADE U FLASH/CHIP N U WILL ONLY PLAY ORIGINAL GAMES,

Honestly mate i cant stress enough how much more smoothly the burn goes with a burner max drive... every XGD3 game i have burned with lite-on drives has worked a dream... plus im on xbox live.

my advise would be to get yourself a lite-on drive i got mine from ebay for Â£15 flash the drive with the burner max firmware and use imgburn 2.5.6.0 check the iso is LB 2133520 calculate optimal and burn at 2 -2.4% max 

youtube comes in handy too...."
,zero423,2011-11-22T19:37Z,"@everyone whos xdg3's stopped working: its not your disc, its not your burn or any of that shit, xbl has pushed a silent dae.bin update to ALL counsoles connected to xbl, which activates a new ap2.5 challenge table which in turn fucks up your burnt copy... c4eva is working on lt 3.0 right now to counter this bullshit. there is a temp. fix that can be done. go to xbuc   dot   net and d/l the title update for the game you want to play, move the update to a xb configured usb drive using xtaf or horizon, clear the cache on your hdd, now plug in the usb drive with the update for the game you wanna play on it and load your game! works like a charm. for cod mw3, you must clear the cache everytime you wanna play it as it prompts an update when you load which fucks it up after you turn it off. all the others should work w/o having to clear the cache everytime... enjoy!"

C4E released the iXtreme LT+ v2.0 CFW for all versions of the Hitachi-LG GDR-3120L drive (â€˜PHAT Hitachiâ€™):

C4Eâ€™s iXtreme LT+ in association with Team Jungle & Team Xecuter

Official release of the iXtreme LT+ v2.0 for Hitachi drives
- Support for XGD3 ixtreme backups using LT-MAX for maximum capacity on standard DVD+R DL discs.
- Support for large capacity DVD+R DL media (no errors when burning)

About upcoming iXtreme LT+ 3.0 â€“ released after December 6th
Originals will need to be analysed by XBC to gain disc topology data. This data replaces the need for ap25/dae.bin data and enables any ap25 challenge to be answered correctly. The topology data method is very efficient using only 24k and is very accurate. Each title will need its own topology data as there are differences between titles, even xgd3 titles and backups can be detected if the same topology data is used between titles.
Backups will remain the same layout but will need the new topology data inserted by the new abgx or re-dumped with the new XBC for xgd2/ap25 or xgd3 titles.
Non ap25 titles will remain unchanged

Thanks go to Team Jungle for their hard work and efforts in the development process.

1) Download torrent, and delete .dvd file
2) Download latest version of abgx
3) Open abgx, load the downloaded .iso file from this torrent, select Level 3 on the Autofix tab and press launch (make sure you are connected to the internet so it can download topology data). This will make a new .dvd file as output
4) Open imgburn and load the new .dvd file, go to Tools->Settings->Write->Options and select User specified layer break with the value 2133520
5) Select 2.4x write speed, put in any DVD+R DL disc and press burn. When it asks you how you want to write, say truncate, and when it gives you an error after that, say continue.
6) Enjoy the game"

,Razkull,2012-05-18T03:27Z,"@ Moonyin 

You obviously have no idea what the fuck your talking about there bro.

Modern Warfare 3 is an XGD3 disc. Meaning? There is 3% worth of data at the end of the disc that you need to write. Truncate method seems like it works, but your missing this 3% and risking the chance of getting your console flagged and xbox live account permanetly banned. Only 6 burners on the market will write these successfully NO you can not substitute a burner."
,Powerslave0,2012-05-23T06:00Z,"For those who have FAT Xbox 360s, and are using WASABI with a Hitachi drive, with FIRMWARE < 78.  Contact WASABI for 

Wasabi_360_Ultra_Firmware_1.3_BETA_1_[PHAT_FIX]

It took me weeks of complaining to get them to get it done.  Then they said they'd have a FW for me to test soon, and that took 3 weeks.  SO anyhow, it works!  They asked me not to distrinute it, but you can get it.

This will fix your ""PLAY DVD"" errors with XGD2 ISOs, after selecting an XGD3 ISO that puts you back to the dashboard (rebooting Xbox will show the XGD2 title, and will play).    I was the first to test this BETA firmware, and it is not being released yet, but you can contact them; let them know you have a FAT model with A Hitachi Drive with firmware < 78.  These drives are incapable of AP 2.x checks, and WASAI available firmware forces these checks on drives that can't do it, thus the XGD3 ISO does not load.  This is also why these model hitachi drives ARE NOT flashed with dashboard updates. 

These FAT models with DVD FW < 78 should always be for Offline use only!  If you used WASABI, then a flag is set, because they're not supposed to be reporting AP 2.x data.  They know immediately the console is modded then."
