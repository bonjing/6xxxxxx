,somsdmc,2011-11-06T12:22Z,"Dude an RC rip is release candidate ( the final version that will be released on the BR )..

The quality will be good and scorp himself said that...

I dont think he will be releasing another blueray version of that movie...

So can u upload the RC version itself?... The screens on that look good too....
