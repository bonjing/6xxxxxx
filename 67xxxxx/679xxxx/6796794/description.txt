So this is the Expansion to Star Wars Empire at War. You can download my version of that on here as well. Let me know if it works for you.


How to install

1. The image is MIR-EAW.iso now that you have the image mounted with Daemon tools or whatever ISO mounting program you use. It should autorun and you can install. If it doesnâ€™t auto run go to my computer and manually start it.

2. Enter CD-key by using key-gen. Or google one for it yourself.

3. Copy the Crack into the GameData Folder in your C: Drive(or which ever drive you installed it on). (Easiest way to get there is  right-click on the desktop shortcut and then properties then open file location.)

4. Copy the SW:EaW:FoC Application or Launcher (doesn't matter which) in the GameData folder to your desktop and replace the old one.

5. Play the game. Give me feedback on if it works or not. Thanks for downloading. Enjoy!
