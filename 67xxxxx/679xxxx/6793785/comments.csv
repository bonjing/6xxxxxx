,Ipmark,2011-11-04T08:37Z,"Stay calm, please.
I don't seed my torrents overnight; so, if you do not like it, download another torrent.

Thanks."
,Ipmark,2011-11-04T10:10Z,"All these maps can be viewed on the PC with BaseCamp by simply putting them on a pendrive (FAT32, Garmin folder)."
,kurac111,2011-11-04T12:31Z,mapsource maps is better! this images can not be modified
,Ipmark,2011-11-05T10:28Z,"These are ""Ready to use"" maps.
But you can easily make a map that fit your needs simply download some maps and join them togheter with Gmaptool (free).
Howhever, today I will start the CNEUNT 2012.30 for Mapsource Unlocked torrent."

,happydundee,2012-01-06T13:27Z,"If I use the western europe IMG, does that cover all the countries that are also on this torrent separately? "
,herr_nygren,2012-02-13T18:02Z,"Thx Ipmark, great work, and great explains to a lot of people with problems, do you have one for me as well? I simply don't see any other maps on my Nuvi 205W, just the one in internal memory. Tried three different SD-cards and read all your'e advices but still nothing. Is it a to simple GPS maybe, but why should there be a SD-slot if it isn't working?"
