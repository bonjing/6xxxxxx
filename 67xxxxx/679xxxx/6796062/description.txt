Thinkwell's Biology covers all of the material from a typical two-semester college-level biology course. Taught by Emmy Award-winning biology teacher George Wolfe, it has the rigor necessary for a general biology course for biology majors. In fact, because it so clearly communicates even complicated topics, it is often used in introductory college biology courses, as well. Using Thinkwell's Biology as a study aid makes sure you'll be prepared to get the most out of your biology class. And it's better than a tutor because it's available 24/7 for one fixed price, instead of by the hour.

The topic coverage is very similar to high school biology, which makes this an excellent study aid for college prep or for biology homework help.
