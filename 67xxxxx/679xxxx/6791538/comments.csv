Simple, one-click patcher! Nice! Highly Recommended!"
,houta97,2011-11-07T03:50Z,"Hi thanks for the prog, it s working but the text section is empty after the crack, you can't add a text to the project. before cracking it works
For info, i am on XP SP3"
,iiWAN,2011-11-08T13:06Z,its the same on Win 7 64-bit SP1 no text types in the text menu 
,BigPeteOsco,2011-11-17T13:37Z,"This works fine as long as you install it in the default ""C"" hard drive and directory."
,HHug3,2011-12-12T06:06Z," do not own either the TEXT version of this, that is, avs video editor 6.1. When I open the Text menu, there is no text. completely empty. What shall I do?"
,z84,2011-12-13T00:02Z,"Here's the English Translation of the Introductions file in case someone wants (translated with Google translate)

1 .- Install the program, do not boot.
2 .- Copy the ""Patch"" to ""C: \ Program Files \ AVS4YOU \ AVSVideoEditor"" initiate the patch (in vista / 7 as admin) and apply.

Ready!!"
,z84,2011-12-13T00:09Z,aww man no text for me either everything else works tho!
,zraibagz000,2011-12-15T13:15Z,"tnx,, bro,,, nice work,,,,,,,"
,DBPoison,2011-12-23T21:03Z,This is perfect! thank you so fucking much for this torrent!!! 
,themancminsh,2011-12-28T08:16Z,Isolved the text problem by downloading this torrent http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6716009/AVS_Video_Editor_6.0.3.184____crack_Team_Rjaa and using the crack on this torrent - i now have text
,themancminsh,2011-12-28T09:54Z,erm an issue - it is not leting me produce projects as saved files or on the internet - i get the message 'couldn't get current profile. contact support' any work arounds please contact me theminsh at hm . com - thanks
,ron916,2012-01-01T16:33Z,AVOID!  VirusTotal says the crack is virus-ridden (17+ viruses).
,LunarisDream,2012-01-02T06:10Z,"Oh god, my school project is due in 2 days. I just finished it in here and now I can't produce the finished result - it just stops when I click Produce.
Wat do TPB users?! Help me please!"
,LunarisDream,2012-01-02T06:42Z,"Nevermind, I got it. Where there's a will, there's a way, I suppose.

Anyways, when you hit Produce, you have to click on ""Advanced"" and resize the aspect ratio (in pixels) of the file. I changed it to the lowest possible size, hit start, then stopped it. Then I changed the size back to the original, and voila, it worked!

Hope this works for anyone who has the same problem."
,LunarisDream,2012-01-02T07:11Z,"Sorry for these multiple comments, but I thought the problem deserved a complete answer.

After reinstalling, I realized that you have to mess with several of the ""Advanced"" options before the video actually Produces successfully. Just click Advanced and keep changing the options, and it'll work (well, it did for me).

Cheers."
,LunarisDream,2012-01-02T07:12Z,"(Last comment, I promise)

And hit the Play button in the last step of the Produce process, and skip around in the little preview video box."
,areinard,2012-02-25T01:05Z,This crack does not work. But themancminsh was right. The other one works perfectlly! THANK YOU!!!
,bluemystic01,2012-02-28T03:48Z,"Works wonderfully with crack provided. I wish AVS had a bundle package though. Think it sucks you have to get each program separately. That is my only complaint, and it is no reflection on you. You did great."
,Nickv451,2012-03-01T08:56Z,Good Upload.Thanks.
,mrpervert,2012-03-13T02:05Z,Thank you very much for the upload and seed.
,RichiiJm14,2012-03-15T01:53Z,thnx!
,themancminsh,2012-03-19T12:20Z,"Just found this out – to get some text features

1Open sample project
2.Left click on text line (over text block)
3.Edit text
4.At bottom -  export preset – with text highlighted
5.Name it – anything – hit OK
6.When you open your own project it will be in text 

Still trying to get the text effects to work  - but fade in and out work and can see all my own fonts – I performed a test and it works - hope this helps"
,Rianoris,2012-04-06T06:14Z,"GUYS! I discovered a patch that works with this AND makes the Text work! First, don't use the included patch.

1. Download it here: http://keygens.nl/crack/139932/

2. Click on ""Download only Crack and Keygen"".

3. Run that Crack in the install director (where the AVSVideoEditor is).

4. Click ""Patch"" and your done! 

5. Enjoy Text! It worked for me.

-- The other alternative I found was to download an older AVSVideoEditor.exe pre-cracked for older version 6.0.3, that worked too (one by Team Rjaa, here:http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6716009/AVS_Video_Editor_6.0.3.184____crack_Team_Rjaa)"
,ReaverTee,2012-04-06T17:49Z,"Good torrent, but a lousy software.

Poor cutting tools !
UI is appealing but lacking features !

This may be a nice simple app to add effects, but thats it ...

Thank you anyway for the torrent ! =)"
,DarkShive92,2012-04-16T11:10Z,"@ Rianoris: holy shit that actually works. That's one shady-looking website, though. I had to run four virus scans on it before I trusted it. "
,Flygkapten,2012-04-20T01:53Z,"Rianoris' solution worked for me too, you're a hero! :P"
,verstappen,2012-04-22T12:06Z,"Hey peeps really struggling here. I ran the file to load AVS VE on my PC but didn't launch once install was complete.
There was no file label 'CRACK' there is one called 'avs4you.all.products.activator.2011.(v1.1)-mpt. I ran that from the launch drive where the AVSVE.exe files are as the Admin a box came up which then said 'OK' in the bottom LH cnr (while playing Mortal Combat music). I closed that down opened AVSVE and it says thats a ""non-activated' version... What am I doing wrong?"
,Heromist,2012-05-07T23:18Z,dude its not working for me. i installed it everything applied the crack and shit and it still isnt working right..
,tetnem,2012-05-21T11:48Z,"thanks, mate!"
,vettukal,2012-05-25T09:41Z,"Worked like a charm! Applied the patch in programs folder. Avast had a warning, though not classifying it as virus. 
Great work! thanks mate"
,vettukal,2012-05-25T09:43Z,"And the best thing is that you can download additional softwares like audio editor and video converter for free...
Because you are a register user!"
,vettukal,2012-05-25T09:51Z,Please note: When you install the additional new software the crack instructions have to be repeated for every installation.
,glare9,2012-05-26T12:02Z,"IT'S A VIRUS FILE. CONTAINED TWO VIRUSES.
(A VARIENT OF WIN32/HACK.TOOL.PATCHER.T - POTENTIALLY UNSAFE APPLICATON)"
,metallicaisgod,2012-05-31T02:40Z,Finally got it working. Once installed launch that wierd file avs4you.all.products.activator.2011.(v1.1)-mpt as Admin for Vista/7 and select a future date in the drop down box bottom right corner. Then click on either white tiger thingy and done
,Dick Jerkins,2012-06-04T02:06Z,Trojan found.
