Do it yourself if you haven't got the decency to be grateful."
,fladdermannen,2011-11-07T21:35Z,"THIS IS NOT EZTV, its ettv"
,gianijoker007,2011-11-07T23:40Z,wtf is this who is ettv?? and where is eztv??????
,sLoZo,2011-11-08T00:20Z,"Video quality and sound is very good.
Thanks."
,DalittleBIGmen,2011-11-08T02:03Z,"V:9 (for the resolution and bitrate)
A:6 (it has autotune on making background noise pop up when no one is speaking. Pretty annoying with all the crickets then someone speaks and it stop then no one speak and it goes all up.)

Thanks ettv!
Seeding for all you guys!

Can someone explain me what does the cross sing mean in test pregnancy? Pregnant or not? Will be helpful to understand the end."

,ThePopov,2011-11-08T04:25Z,OMFG AGAIN!!!!!!! Some crappy compressor/normalizer on the audio!! V-E-R-Y ANNOYING . Bad upload.
,layneno5,2011-11-08T05:59Z,"i don't know what the hell you jackasses are talking about, but this is a good torrent. a-10 v-10"
,rubenking,2011-11-08T12:26Z,"Sorry ;) @Durxxa, my bad! They just start the same but are not x)"
,javialacarga,2011-11-08T16:29Z,"The video is ok, but the sound quality is pretty bad. You can hear the voices normally, but everytime no one is speaking the bakground noise volumen is turned up insanely, and the effect is really annoying. You go from barely hearing the backgroun noise to having a swarm of crickets 10 cm to your ears, and this happens constantly, in every conversation, in every two seconds pause any of the characters take..."
,amnesiac_radar,2011-11-08T18:40Z,"Thanks, it's watchable. I don't know why people whinge, it's free isn't it, some folk are so ungrateful!

,metalvegetax,2011-11-09T07:57Z,DAMN YOU PEOPLE DONT LISTEN TO SHIT THIS TORRENt IS MISSING the LAST 5 min of the episode DO NOT DOWNLOAD
,AndroidLove,2011-11-09T10:17Z,"How come there is no eztv upload for this episode? Anyone know what happened. Was checking back several times yesterday but seeing as someone said that the last 5 mins were missing, I thought I'd wait for the usual eztv reliable torrent but no scene. "
,straggler,2011-11-09T16:41Z,Audio sucks. Stop using limiters.
,shinobiung,2011-11-11T12:47Z,"this season really is poor, its like a completely different film crew made it, sort of similar to Star Wars - I am sure George Lucas had very little to do with the original 1977 series if the phantom menace is really his work."
,gordonflash39,2011-11-12T17:19Z,"Audio is utter shit. Stop using those compressors or whatever. 

V: 9/10
A: 2/10"
,PhattBouy,2011-12-11T18:50Z,"@ ettv - thanks for having a go but the quality is shot - you have a +10 score, as I write this, don't know what they can all see and hear that I cannot.

@ Instynt - you are so funny, you have a real instinct for it! See what I did there? Not half as funny as you funny man, of course, but I'll keep trying!"
,11S36001943ZZ2001,2011-12-29T05:31Z,"lol, theres a reason hes skull is pink....cuz hes full of SHIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,numse,2012-01-12T06:10Z,reported
,notouchx,2012-02-03T22:33Z,"Why does this particular episode - not a season premiere or finale - still have over 5000 seeds several months after it was released, and is the only Walking Dead episode still in the top 100?  Isn't that weird?  Shenanigans by ettv, maybe?"
,davejoy2,2012-02-07T23:00Z,Thank you for sharing :)
,nakedfromthewaistdown,2012-02-18T21:54Z,"Why is this still here? Seriously, I'm confused and a little angry..."
