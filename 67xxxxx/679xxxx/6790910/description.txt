- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

  Have you ever asked yourself what life would be like if you were an armless
  skater? Do you consider yourself a weekend warrior?

  Then State of Mine's fast and melodic skatepunk might be a perfect fit for
  you. Mostly influenced by the nineties Swedish skatepunk sound, and more
  established bands as Belvedere, Lagwagon and Man(d)y M(o)ore, State of Mine
  effectuated more than 75 shows on local and not-so-local stages in Belgium and
  abroad since November 2007. These shows included support slots for bands as
  SNFU (Can), Smoke or Fire (USA), Rentokill (Au), Mute (Can), High Five Drive
  (Can), Pendleton (UK), The Living Daylights (UK), Jet Market (It) and other
  massively talented, yet less known bands.

  A first release followed after nearly a year of constant rehearsing and
  performing. The DIY 'Geargrinder' EP sold out within the first months after
  it's release in October 2008. After a major change in the SoM line up (one
  guitar less, a replacement behind the drums and a new lead vocal), plans were
  made for a split CD with The Octopussy's, to be released under Kickass Records
  (the band's own D.I.Y. record label) by the end of April 2009.

  After a rushy 2009 filled with playing shows and promoting the split CD in
  Belgium, the band scheduled to start writing their debut full album
  'Accelerate!' around the end of the year. It quickly got clear that the only
  feasible option was to do the whole thing in a D.I.Y. fashion.
  Slowly, but steadily, the recording sessions for 'Accelerate!' started off in
  April 2010.

  And now, at the start of 2011, the band is extremely proud to be able to
  present the finished album.

  Next to that the need for a second guitar player became quite acute going
  through the recording process. Victor Navarro (ex-Struggling for reason)
  happily filled the vacant spot. As a fivepiece, State of Mine guarantees an
  energetic live show, spiced up with old and new skatepunk covers.
