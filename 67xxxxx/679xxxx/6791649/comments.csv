THANKS A LOT SEEDERS ! "
,hawkman57,2011-11-03T12:57Z,"To be clear, I'm grateful, but why the .rar?  I always get this tentative feeling downloading these files having been burned too many times, and do we all _really_ save that much bandwidth?"
,cuntmastermasterofcunts,2011-11-03T15:15Z,"It's RAR because thats what it comes as from the scene that rips the shows, unraring would make it take longer to upload the torrent and there is a sfv checksum file already done for the RAR's that would also take time to create for a unarchived file.

Please try to understand how this works, you download this for free stop complaining."
,UAofE,2011-11-03T15:50Z,"Please try to understand, people that upload RARs are morons. RAR files are antiques from the 28.8k and 56k era, they have NO place in the broadband world and especially no place in torrents.
Torrents are already broken up into chunks, they don't need broken down any more!"
,cuntmastermasterofcunts,2011-11-03T16:15Z,The scene does not care about torrents.
,biafra84,2011-11-03T19:33Z,it took me like 7seconds to unrar...
,SoundBarber,2011-11-03T20:59Z,"I think the episodes play in Canada uncensored on Friday(?) I don't have tv so I am not sure. 
What's the deal with beeps whenever someone says fuck or motherfucker? Is it not allowed on US tv?"
,organikbeaver,2011-11-04T01:07Z,Thanks for the torrent :)
,Albylion,2011-11-04T03:02Z,"South Park airs at 9:00 ET on Wednesday nights.  You can also watch full episodes (with commercials) on southparkstudios.com.

The idea used to be that if you had a hashfail, you could download only the RAR piece you needed, but torrents are broken into pieces anyway.  And now we have broadband.  This took me three minutes to download and ten seconds to unzip. . . ."
,Albylion,2011-11-04T03:03Z,"And Comedy Central allows lots of swearing, but Matt & Trey often choose to censor themselves when they think it'll be funnier.  I mean, nine-year-olds cursing is still a bit funny, especially when Cartman gets into it.  Bleeping just drives the point home."
,SoundBarber,2011-11-04T20:10Z,"UNCENSORED episodes are always broadcast here! They don't censor themselves its US tv. Example: here is the file title for the UNCENSORED version ... South.Park.S15E11.Broadway.Bro.Down.720p.WEB-DL.AAC2.0.H.264-CtrlHD.mkv.  So please get it straight.
p.s. I have found all the uncensored ones right up to and including 12."
,SoundBarber,2011-11-04T23:41Z,the UNCENSORED files are on fileserve
[V],maximersk,2011-11-06T12:33Z,Comedy Central !
