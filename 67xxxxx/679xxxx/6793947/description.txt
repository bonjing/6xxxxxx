       This was filmed in an interesting way - it is collections   
       of shorts about people's everyday lives on 24th July 2010.     
       The films were submitted by Youtube users then edited into     
       one piece in order to be submitted to the Sundance Festival. 
      Hope ya enjoy it :D
