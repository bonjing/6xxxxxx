::Plot::
It is 2016 and the United States is in a sustained economic depression. Air crashes and gasoline at $40/gallon have resulted in the return of railroads as the nation's primary mode of transportation. After a major accident on the Rio Norte line of the Taggart Transcontinental railroad, CEO James Taggart shirks responsibility. His sister Dagny Taggart, Vice-President in Charge of Operation, unilaterally decides to save part of the railroad by replacing the aging track with new rails made of the experimental Rearden Metal, which its inventor, Hank Rearden, claims is lighter yet stronger than conventional steel.
