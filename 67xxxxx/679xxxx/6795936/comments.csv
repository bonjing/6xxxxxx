,Skratchybug,2011-11-05T05:04Z,this is episode 6 not 7
,chandlerboy,2011-11-05T07:00Z,"This is indeed episode 7.

HOWEVER the sound gradually becomes out of sync throughout until it is unbearable and unwatchable for the last third. AVOID.

Recommend waiting for it to be fixed or getting it from another uploader."
,THE_UNDIETAKER,2011-11-05T10:56Z,"Yes this is episode 7 it starts in Japan
Episode 6 is about Route 66"
,arron255,2011-11-05T13:19Z,Out of sync!! thanks for uploading but unwatchable especialy towards the end.
,DavidMelb,2011-11-05T20:44Z,"I thought it was watchable, many thanks!"
,chandlerboy,2011-11-06T01:29Z,Interesting to see the uploaders don't care at all and aren't fixing the issue.
,johanneswiberg,2011-11-06T09:28Z,Had the same issue as chandlerboy. Using VLC. Yes I know how to compensate but I'd much prefer a fixed version many thanks.
,Jamie1408,2011-11-06T12:51Z,"Cheers for the upload. It's perfectly watchable really... last 15 or so minutes are out of sync, however most of that footage is in on a night vision camera, with Karls face not even in the shot. So it really doesn't ruin it that much. "
