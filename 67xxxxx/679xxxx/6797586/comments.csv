[V],AlbaGuBrath,2011-11-06T03:54Z,"@ manougiwrgos mine isnt compressed to RAR format so hence the bigger size but on the plus side you can see exactly what your downloading!!

,pfmac,2011-11-06T15:56Z,Did it fix the problem where you can't change squad status manually? Can anyone give it a try and tell me? Thx.
,Keanoboy,2011-11-06T17:13Z,"Do I need to start a new game with these update, or will it be put automatically in to the game I'm already playing?"

""crash dump on a player comparison screen---attributes""

Same shit happened to me. And it also crashed by just saving the game!!!!!!!"
,Mimsy,2011-11-06T23:15Z,It seems every patch has major problems with crashes. Sucks because the injuries on 12.0 are annoying
,meeyou,2011-11-07T01:44Z,"@Mimsy
hehe, yeah there is always added a hidden check, and they dont play that much to check every option and fail to make it 100% working"
,nbhnc,2011-11-08T14:24Z,"After downloading this, the game crashes rarely, but one thing thats really fucked up, is the offsides, im getting offsides a lot when not supposed to be, i mean what the hell"
,stas716,2011-11-08T19:40Z,Will skidrow or anybody release a fix? This comparison shit really annoys..

,aeiq,2011-11-10T15:51Z,"Have I need to install previous patch, (12.03) before this?"
,anibhat007,2011-11-10T17:10Z,"guys i'm facing a problem on fm12 would you please solve it?
After install 1-2 games when i start a 3d match the ground use to be totally black and stadium is crowdless,there is no problem with stadium colour,kits colour or anything else.To solve this i've to re install it and everytime after playing 1-2 3d match faultlessly it happens again.
I'm using windows XP with 4.0 frame and DirectX 10.Please solve it."
,sevghesh,2011-11-11T02:30Z,"i have windows 7 x64, and have no problems with the skidrow 12.0.2 crack.  i would recommend anyone who doesn't like crash dumps to use this version until 12.0.4 is fixed.

only problem with 12.0.2 is the goalkeeper training bug which is a problem with the game and not with the crack.  it is also not very noticable.  i prefer that to not being able to compare staff or players.  that is very annoying to me.

i wish skidrow would release a fix for 12.0.4. if anyone in the community is able to access boards with more information from legit sources on progress about this fix, please let us know. thanks"
,atomicJackass,2011-11-13T01:31Z,Will this fix the crash dumps issue? Thanks in advance.
,mirasxil,2011-11-17T17:41Z,I have also the same problem with crash dump on a player comparison screen. I'm waiting for the next update or fix.

,galobh,2011-12-02T01:04Z,"Is there any reliable cracker working on a decent crack for this game? I mean, Reloaded, Razor, where are you? Have the capitalism won the war? So it's the begin of the domination by the game makers. Just think about it, the price they can ask for the games right now. Infinite if they want."
,LouisC91,2011-12-15T02:31Z,"Someone pls help !!!! im follow the instructions but everytime i click on fm.exe it proceeds to load then stops and comes up with football manager has stop working microsoft is searching for a solution pop up, just need a simple explanation so i can install this correctly !!!!"

,aseru7,2012-02-05T06:21Z,"I installed this update and I think it broke my FM. I start the game, it loads the movies at the start then just closes."
,Critical,2012-02-06T13:50Z,What about the winter update? :)
,mattyspurs76,2012-03-11T21:45Z,Just to confirm this patch works but it is not and does not have the latest 'winter transfers' so its a bit of a waste downloading. Took me a few hrs to download and then i installed and was looking forward to finally playing with updated squads so it was a major let down to find the transfers wernt updated.  I guess we should wait for 12.0.5!!!!
,WiiBe,2012-03-25T16:37Z,Will 12.2 be cracked?
,Roncerno,2012-04-07T23:25Z,any support for newest one?
