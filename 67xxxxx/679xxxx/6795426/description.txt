Four Queens turn face-up in the hands, one by one, each in a more stunning manner than the last. 

Stunning. We mean it. The way that third Queen appears when he turns the fan around? We were stunned. Doing our best goldfish impressions. Mouths agape, eyes wide open. The whole shebang.

Taking inspiration from Guy Hollingworth\\\'s \\\'Waving the Queens,\\\' ShinSplint cranks the card-by-card inversion plot to overdrive.
