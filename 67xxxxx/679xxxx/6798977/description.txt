Most studies of depression focus on the psychiatric or medical interpretation of the experience. Sadness and guilt are human experiences, Keen argues, not disease symptoms. They involve the intricate layers of enacting a style for others, of coping with moral crises, and enduring disappointment. Keen maintains that traditional approaches to depression, its social meanings and stigmas, complicate and perhaps even obscure the experiences of sadness and guilt. By highlighting the uniquely human and moral content of depression, he contends that these are trials that must be lived through and survived, not only to transcend depression, but also to successfully cope with its roots.
