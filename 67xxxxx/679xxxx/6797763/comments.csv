,shellback1191,2011-11-06T01:55Z,"first of all thank you for up,second i have been looking for these files for months,can't tell you how glad we are my wife and i.my favorite st of all.will be deleting most of my downloads to make room for these files,pretty big! to all,spread the love,seed.:) hope it does not take years to DL."
,oasisfleeting,2011-12-13T20:28Z,"All of these files have to be re-encoded in xvid format to be watchable on my console dvd player. 
Doing a fast recompress in virtualdub cuts the file sizes in half also. 

Yet another ripper who doesn't really understand what they're doing. "
,oasisfleeting,2011-12-13T20:30Z,Season 1 went from 6.8 gigs to 3.5 gigs after one pass through virtualdub with little to no quality loss.
,oasisfleeting,2011-12-13T21:15Z,"Oh shit, and the audio is off. You suck at pirating."
,xodarap7,2012-01-05T08:10Z,"@oasis: Really?  Half size after ""one pass"" in Vdub doesn't even *mean* anything.  First of all, avi's suck - you can't package advanced codecs (with much better bitrate-quality ratios) into an AVI.  Secondly, why are you one-passing them?  Thirdly, the audio isn't off.  WTF.  YOU suck at pirating."
,bigBONG,2012-01-16T17:41Z,"Thank You  VERY much for this upload!

I just wanted to point out that I had no luck requesting the torrent through the magnet link. The other link worked fine though. Just thought I'd mention that!

Thanks again Toilet_Sniffer_V!"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2012-02-03T04:49Z,I see oasisfleet has no uploads at all. He's just leeching and complaining.
,scrunter,2012-02-29T14:26Z,What video/audio format are these please?
,scrunter,2012-03-01T14:00Z,"Downloaded one and checked :) xvid and mp3, in case anyone else was wondering."
,markusminix,2012-03-31T06:25Z,"Anyone, help me to find the english subtitles pack for this series,,  Download link please...
