To The Moon is an indie RPG/adventure game, about two doctors traversing through the memories of a dying man to fulfill his last wish.

Dr. Rosalene and Dr. Watts have rather peculiar jobs: They give people another chance to live, all in their head. But due to the severity of the operation, the new life becomes the last thing the patients remember before drawing their last breath.

This story follows their attempt to fulfill the dream of an elderly man, Johnny. With each step back in time, a new fragment of Johnnyâ€™s past is revealed. As the two doctors piece together the puzzled events that spanned a life time, they seek to find out just why the frail old man chose his dying wish to be what it is. And Johnnyâ€™s last wish is, of courseâ€¦ to go to the moon.
