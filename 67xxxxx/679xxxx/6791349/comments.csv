This is a truly mesmerizing game. Truly heart-wrenchingly beautiful...  Love it so much."
,TyMod,2011-11-26T17:19Z,"Thanks bro.  Just saw a preview and detailed info on the game on Game Informer which states the game has one of the deepest stories ever created within a game.

So thanks!"
,krod89,2011-12-08T06:00Z,"Hey guys, I'm having a little issue. It could be my computer (wouldn't doubt it actually) but I thought I'd check to see if anyone else is having the same issue. After I talk to the caretaker and choose to put the equipment down, the game crashes and my whole comp reboots. Any suggestions?"
,JMC17,2011-12-16T15:04Z,"Artemis trojan found by AVG.
On the other hand, the game works fine!
Oh and I doubt this one is a false positive, you should google it."

,p4tc0t,2012-03-24T17:05Z,"I didn't get any Trojan and I use AVG so I guess it's safe.

But I keep getting the same error :( the game won't start. It just crashes and says it has found an error and has to shut down. Does anyone have some helpful advice? 

Thanks in advance."
,p4tc0t,2012-03-24T17:37Z,And problem solved! Turns out all I needed to do was create an exception on the DEP settings. If anyone else experiences this program just follow this guide http://www.itechtalk.com/thread3591.html
