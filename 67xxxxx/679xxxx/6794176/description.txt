This collection of some of Michael's favourite tunes, as well as some self-penned tracks, boasts contributions from some of the leading lights in Celtic music including Capercaillie's Donald Shaw, Alan Kelly and Dezi Donnelly (1999 Young Traditional Musician Of The Year). There are also some class performances by Flook members John Joe Kelly and Ed Boyd, and drums and percussion from James MacKintosh of Shooglenifty.

The album also features guest vocals from Karan Casey and Capercaillie's Karen Matheson.
