Most HRM books on the market focus on teaching students to be personnel specialists--people who specialize in the Human Resources function. Gomez-Mejia et al. focuses on providing management students with the information they need to be effective managers, regardless of the size of their company and the department they work within. Throughout the book the authors emphasize using human resources as a source of competitive advantage for all companies, large and small.
