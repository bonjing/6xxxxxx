Thanks again."
,captainkhaos1966,2011-11-04T07:07Z,Thanks WMI
,shdwolf1,2011-11-04T11:37Z,"thx wmi; don't know how we'd get along without you. Just wish FG would post something worthy of your talent. 
said it before, will say it again: these poses look like a shoot for a dept store catalog. Not sure what the photographer, n Elle's goal is. Is it to put out sexy enticing photo's for internet viewers, or to build a varied portfolio for a traditional modeling career? The lack of anything resembling sexy in this set leads me to the later...thx anyways WMI."

Why are you posting Virginia pics?!?!?!!? This is Ella..."
,helpFG,2011-11-05T21:28Z,"Yes WMI, why do you only post Fame-Girls sets?  Why have you chosen to exploit and hurt only them in this way?   Is it because they can't afford to come after you with guns and lawyers?
Your membership with Fame-Girls includes mutual trust, trust that you betray every time you repost their sets.  Now that Sandra's role is diminishing, they will struggle even more to stay open.  Are you so selfish and thoughtless that you can't modify your plan so it helps you and them?  You have a working site, obviously thanks to Fame-Girls, now would it hurt to give a little back?  Your membership at Fame-Girls does not come with permission to repost the sets, in fact the opposite is true.  You are using their copyrighted material for profit and it has been tolerated enough.  Are you getting this message?  The writing is on the wall."
,fanofsan,2011-11-05T22:27Z,"I agree.  FG needs help to stay open.  Abuse it and we will loose it.  Just post samples that will make the horndogs want to go buy a membership.  Then maybe we might see some pink, and I don't mean a skull."
[T],webmodelsindex,2011-11-06T13:02Z,"@helpFG

1. I do not sell the sets I've paid for, so zero profit.
2. I've sent over 1 million hits to the FG site, which is giving me zero profit from referrals.
3. Since I am making zero profit from posting the sets, there is no copyright infringement (there is no 1 license contract).
4. People have been posting the sets, not only from the current site, but all of the previous sites way before I came along.
5. If I don't post them, someone else will.
6. Who are you to threaten me?

People don't just wander to this site accidently. You obviously came to this site in search of something without having to pay for it. Whether it be a movie, or music, or porn. Do not dare lecture me on the morals of thepiratebay when you obviously don't care about copyrighted material in the first place.

Btw, the FG makes tons of cash, whether the sets get posted or not. Even the people who download the sets either on here or some other site, will still sign up to support them.

Comes down to this. If you don't like it, avoid my torrents. You want to support FG? Buy a membership. Though I'm willing to bet you download from me anyways, and refuse to buy a membership to FG."
,helpFG,2011-11-07T00:26Z,"WMI.  My response number by number.
BTW:  You never answered the question why do you only post FG sets.
      Is it because you would not have the site you do without using their content?  Does your site have income streams from advertisers and referrals other than FG?

1.  You don't have to sell the sets to profit from posting them.
2.  Very commendable that you have a link to FG on your site.  We thank you for that.
3.  Spinning that like a true confidence man.
4.  So that make it OK for you?
5.  Yes they will, and eventually FG becomes aware and then struggles to have them stop.
6.  I did not threaten you, I only asked ""Are you were getting this message?""  which, it seems you are.  At least we have your attention.  I am a photographer who has followed Sandra's Internet presence since she first appeared on a Yahoo group in the year 2000.  From the first day that the Official Sandra-Forum opened, Sandra's photographer, and the site Administrator have  asked members to help police the misuse of their content.  Some of us original members, and many new members of FG, still try to help them, as the problem persists.  Those misusing the girls content come and go.  Did you ever wonder about that?  
We are now trying to be reasonable and only suggest you consider changing your business plan to move closer to complying with FG policy and to comply with the ""Spirit"" of Copyright laws.  Will you be reasonable, or will you join those that have come and gone?
You should be made aware that your policy of reposting entire FG sets just hours after their release is not beneficial to the success of FG.  If not by your response, I figure you are now so aware.
Be one of us, not one against us.  Respectfully, HelpFG "
,fanofsan,2011-11-07T03:10Z,"It makes good business sense JT.......adapt to changing circumstances.  No one will fault you for taking care of business.  Why I bet you can post samples and still keep your pink scull, if that's what's really important to you."
,oldschoolforsure,2011-11-07T04:37Z,"Hey WMI, it sounds like they are giving you a chance to be reasonable.   You must have known this would happen someday.  Once the lawyers get involved, your hosting service will drop WMI like a hot potato, and you'll have to start over from scratch.  My guess is that they have not ratted you out yet, but once they do.........
I for one respect the fact you built a fine website from the hard work of others.  I'm sure you have a lot of time invested.  Oh Well, it was a good run."
