Please continue to seed."

,OmniNegro,2011-11-03T23:45Z,"You CANNOT buy the bundles that are already past. You can ONLY buy the current bundle. That sounds like abandonedware to me.

If you decide to buy them, you get free updates and actually support a system that makes sense. Pay what you think it is worth, not what the developers and investors decide you must pay.

I have paid more for the HB games than most other I own. Why? Because I decide what it is worth. With other games I usually wait until it has been out for years, has updates to fix most issues, and is a tenth the price.

But with HB I decide how much. And I even decide the way the amount I pay is split. I can exclude a game that I feel did not live up to my expectations. I can pay a particular game in the bundle more than the rest. I can decide to exclude either or both charities from my purchase, or throw more to them than the developers.

I suggest you try the games and then ask the developer of the games you like to pressure HB to allow purchases of the previous bundles. Otherwise we are stuck with torrents as the only reliable means of getting the bundle."
