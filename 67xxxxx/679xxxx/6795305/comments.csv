,evilg0d,2012-03-02T02:20Z,"Thank you very much for sharing this.
Although this is a cam job, with four well positioned cameras that have the typical wobbles and people in front of them occasionally it is still well worth the download to remind me of the fantastic show I saw in Brisbane 2:02:12. Best $200 I have ever spent. Every part of it exceeded my expectations and they were high anyway.
I will certainly be buying the official DVD that is bound to come out after the tour is completed.
Thanks again luiehond69.   :-)"
