,HenkieR66,2011-11-02T16:45Z,"There is something wrong with this one: the letter-combination 'fi' and 'fl' is removed everywhere from the text.
So the word 'definition' becomes 'denition', the word 'five' becomes 've' and so on."

My copy is doesn't have that problem

I don't know why it's doing that.Your copy might have gotten damaged during transmission.It happens to certain books.Try using ""Foxit Pdf Reader"" instead of Adobe it might help"
,HenkieR66,2011-11-02T17:28Z,I downloaded it again and even with Foxit I got the same problem again! No 'fi' and 'fl' in the text!

Wow ,i don't know what to tell you.That's weird.

I do check my files before upload to make sure they are complete .This is the  first time text has disappeared from a book.

Well im really sorry about that.I wonder if anyone else is having this problem"
,annabelle31,2011-11-03T21:26Z,"The book is typeset with ligatures. The fi and fl combinations are replaced with special characters. These will only show up when you have a typeface available that contains those ligature characters. 

Easy example: if you do not have a font with a character ""A"", you won't see the letter ""A"". Makes sense, yes?

So, my guess is that HenkieR66 does not have the correct font installed, or an incomplete copy of the font. 

The text displays correctly for me, although there are a few locations where the ligature is slightly bolder than the surrounding text. Could be a font substitution. OCR is like that, sometimes.

Thanx for the info

That makes perfect sense.The text in my copy is complete so,im sure that's probably the problem"
