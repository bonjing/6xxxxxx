,Butch6673,2011-11-05T05:10Z,I'm new to this how do I copy to a dvd? thanks for any help!
,now192002,2011-11-05T06:08Z,"@Butch, you have to download a converter that will put it into DVD format, e.g. .vob files. Then you have to burn the resulting VIDEO_TS folder to a dvd. A good converter is winavi, http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4048003/WinAVI_Video_Converter_8.0_with_working_key. After it converts, google a program called DVDshrink, because it needs to be re-authored before it will play in a dvd player

Then, you can go to cnet and get a nice free dvd burner(there's lots of them). Hope that helps."
,INTIMID8R,2011-11-05T15:29Z,"Yes all you need is convertx, it is what I use and it works great, and I got it from here"
,Megamike1967,2011-11-06T04:03Z,"Not complaining, but asking a question. Need to know why 30 mins into movie the audio on my ps3 goes off and a message comes up and says I'm not athorized to watch this movie on widows media. Never have any problem before with any of Extremezone stuff. You can post answer here or send message to megamike1967@yahoo.com.
Thank You"

,billyboyd,2011-11-06T19:15Z,"Butch if your dvd player plays divx format no need to convert to dvd format, you can burn up to 6 movies on a single blank dvd depending on files size?.
If your dvd player  play divx, worth going out and buying one that plays divx you can picked them up for little or nothing these days will save you all the hassle of converting."

Terrible sound quality. 
Also the movie misses about 5 minutes in the final scene, making you miss out on some very important parts. 

Don't download this!"
,tefflonman,2011-11-09T11:53Z,@Butch6673 just download a program like easy avi divx xvid to dvd or ashampoo burning studio or xilisoft dvd burner. All u need to do then is to download the films and add them to the program and burn to dvd ok hope this helps.
,alf_hooker,2011-11-10T08:52Z,ConvertX to DVD 4 is what you want and its so easy to use

,moovees,2011-11-11T16:58Z,"Cinavia on PS3 is really easy to get around guys!! IT's kind of a pain but worth it.  After that half an hour when the audio cuts out, hit circle and get out of the movie.  Go over to your settings for date and time to exactly 1 hour back.  Go back to the movie - the banner will show up again.  Go back to date and time settings and set the time exactly 1 hour ahead. NOw go back to the movie and you will have another 20 mins before the audio cuts out and you have to do it again.  At least you get to watch the movie, and this process only takes a few seconds every time u have to do it."

,wallbrian,2011-11-27T22:38Z,Will it work if you use VLC to watch it?
,anamenobodyelsehas,2011-11-28T03:19Z,MediaSentry sent a DMCA disconnect notice to an ISP over this torrent... 
,POISONistheCURE,2011-11-28T03:59Z,IMPORTANT! READ THIS! : People are getting busted left and right over this torrent. BE CAREFUL AND PIRATE AT YOUR OWN RISK! Thanks (: I'm just looking out for my fellow PBers.
,andyb02,2011-11-29T22:04Z,Here's an easier way of getting around cinavia. If you have your computer on the same network as your ps3 all you have to do is change your network settings on your ps3 to allow media sharing. Once you do that you should be able to stream any movie from your laptop or desktop. Not sure if this works with mac but it works with windows 7. You will see a windows 7 emblem come up under your videos and you just select it and go into your videos folder. There you can access any video file that is your video folder on your pc. You can even copy the video file to your pc if you want to. Cinavia won't mess with it if you copy to your ps3. Some of this may sound complicated but it's very easy. Just enable media sharing and see if a windows 7 emblem comes up. If not just google how to set up a media server with your ps3. Hope this helped some of you. If will make your life A LOT easier.
,wookie907,2011-11-30T22:21Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT!!

,MVC78,2012-01-07T23:23Z,"This movie had SO much promise. Although the cast is full of hilarious people, they never quite make this movie achieve what you KNOW it could achieve with some better writing. 

And yes, it's a comedy, but the things that happen in it become so outrageously far-fetched that you feel more like you're watching a cartoon than anything consequential. 

It's just not very good, in fact it you may come away depressed by all the squandered potential contained herein. 

Great rip though -
