,tomoxicillin,2011-11-04T01:31Z,Complete waste of bandwidth!!!! Dont download it is not converted right. Its not side by side or even able to be converted on a 3d tv. because it was posted as one blered 3d image. not even the blue green or red green glasses work on this. Thanks but this neds to be taken down and converted properly then reposted.
,.h10.,2011-11-04T10:45Z,"acording to the picture, this is anaglyph. red/green paper glasses perhaps?"
,tomoxicillin,2011-11-04T12:11Z,"People are just wasting thier time downloading this. I tried blue/ red  glasses, I tried red green glasses. I tried every convestion mode on my tv. nothing it still stays blury. the ripper ripped the full 3d in 3d mode so the final .mkv is stuck in that blurred state. the tvs cant convert a blured image. it needs to be side by side.  I guess if you want to go through all the trouble of converting the mkv to a dvd file and then burning it maybe??? but i still dont see how that wold work because it would be the same burred image. who ever did this had no idea what they were doing. complete waste of time. yet look at the downloads they just keep going up. lol Guess no one reads the comments."
,tomoxicillin,2011-11-04T12:14Z,Or unless im missing something here. I will gladly appologize. but i have tried everything and nothing converts this to 3d it jst stays blurred. I have gotten tons of 3d material and had no problems viewing it but this file dosent convert. My guess is becasue it was ripped in the 3d mode and is now stuck in the blurred state.
,MVC78,2011-11-06T19:44Z,"PEOPLE please do yourself a favor and DO NOT DOWNLOAD this! It's nearly 5 Gigs of useless garbage, the 3D has been encoded improperly and it is completely unwatchable as a result.

,MVC78,2011-11-06T20:07Z,"It's too bad because I saw this in 3D at the theater and its right next to Avatar as one of my favorite 3D movies ever. It was filmed in 3D, not converted after the fact like most of the 3D superhero movies like Thor, Captain American, Green Lantern. And that discrepancy makes ALL the difference in the world. I can't wait until a REAL 3D copy of this movie becomes available. "
,MVC78,2011-11-09T22:31Z,"omg WHY are people downloading this still? And why has no one else come here to complain after they've seen it's rubbish? 5 Gigs isn't a fast download, your time has been wasted, are you not outraged!! "
,albertomHD,2011-11-13T02:27Z,Why don't you just download the sample first? 
,MVC78,2011-11-13T09:27Z,"That's actually a very good idea mon frere. I've always wondered what the point of samples were, but now that we're dealing with this large GiB files for 3D movies I definitely will take advantage of them. Thanks!"
[V],ExtraTorrentRG,2011-11-13T14:46Z,"@ all it was a test release,i wanted the feedback about the quality for 3D conversion, it was the best method i tried,with available programs. Don't worry, the quality will be as before. Sorry for this weird release.

,MVC78,2011-11-17T08:37Z,"Thanks ET, didn't mean to besmirch your work but just wanted people to know not to bother with the 4.5 GiB download, you've always done good work so I was surprised how this turned out "

THIS SHIt... COME on GROW UP"
,traylerc,2011-11-24T18:50Z,omg people just commenting DONT DOWNLOAD... why not as well click at top right and give it a Negative as well so then people can also see the rating it has.. 
,amoghthegamer,2011-11-27T00:50Z,make a SBS or a TB copy! That will be so much better. Thanks RG!
,MVC78,2011-12-05T06:30Z,"johnsmith uploaded a proper 3D SBS mkv of this movie here.. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6830691/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hollows_Part_2_3D_SBS.mkv

It's perfect and the 3D is spot-on! ExtraTorrent usually has proper rips but the encoding is all off on this one. DL johnsmiths instead. "
,123valivali,2011-12-18T21:08Z,"you guys are naive...isn't it obvious!this is realD 3D!
blur means it is RealD 3D.haven't you been in theaters  for the last couple of years!"
,123valivali,2011-12-18T21:09Z,this is reald
