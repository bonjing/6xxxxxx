The one reason I acquired this album was for the Chateau material, which is different from the stuff officially released on [i]Nightcap[/i] and includes additional material. Since this material runs at the wrong speed, I\'ve included a speed-corrected version. The real event is going to be a new release of the Chateau material, culled from the best available official releases and bootlegs, remastered to the best of my abilities. For now, here is this bootleg.
