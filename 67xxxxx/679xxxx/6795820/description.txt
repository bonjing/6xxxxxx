What's Wrong With Programming Today?

It's too complicated - Programming should be simple.  Most programming software is like the cockpit of a jet plane, with a confusing collection of gizmos that almost nobody needs.  Not Liberty BASIC!  For nearly 20 years we've been working hard to make programming as simple and easy as possible so you can get a lot done with less work and more enjoyment! 

It's too expensive - Programming software can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars, but for the cost of a video game Liberty BASIC gives you everything you need to write software right away.  Keep more of your hard-earned money!

It's not approachable - Most programming languages don't come with good documentation so you need to buy extra books to learn them.  With Liberty BASIC's special tutorial you can be writing your first program in minutes.  Also, our online community is one of the best and friendliest you'll ever meet, and has thousands of helpful members.  You spend more time doing things you enjoy, not banging your head in frustration.
any way apply the serial number in the text file and you will have a registered version of liberty basic 4.03 and you can upgrade it it 4.04
