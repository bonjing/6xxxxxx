Parallel Coordinates: Visual Multidimensional Geometry and Its Applications


This book is about visualization, systematically incorporating the fantastic human pattern recognition into the problem-solving process, and focusing on parallel coordinates. The barrier, imposed by our three-dimensional habitation and perceptual experience, has been breached by this innovative and versatile methodology. The accurate visualization of multidimensional problems and multivariate data unlocks insights into the role of dimensionality.
