This music is the work of Jack Wall, Sam Hulick, and the other composers for the video game Mass Effect 2 (ME2).  They are extremely talented musicians who will not be returning for Mass Effect 3. They certainly deserve your financial support if you enjoy this music.

First of all, please be aware that the original ME2 sound track  is not included here, but is available to download via bittorrent at

If you loved the original soundtrack, and want more, this compilation is for you.  I converted the game audio files to 192 kbps MP3, using the Gib\\\'s Mass Effect audio extractor (thanks Gib), and selected the ones which did not significantly resemble tracks in the original ME2 soundtrack, and which I thought were the best. Some of these tracks have been released as parts of other soundtracks, while others have not been released at all. The list includes

- Most importantly, the \\\"club\\\" songs in Afterlife, Eternity, 
  and Dark Star, which are unreleased
- The \\\"critical mission failure\\\" we all know and love so well
- Music from the Shadow Broker and Arrival DLCs (thanks Oze01)
- Shepard\\\'s radio (tracks are mostly from the original Mass Effect)
- Shepard\\\'s return (Hulick ME3 track written prior to composer change)
- My favorite: the music during the \\\"Swarm\\\" portion of the final fight.

Total running time is about 70 minutes.

I hope you enjoy this compilation. Please join me in wishing the entire Wall of Sound team the best as they move to other projects. And let\\\'s keep our fingers crossed that the new ME3 composer is able to do some justice to this wonderful game world, and at least incorporates some of the elements of the Wall of Sound music for thematic integrity\\\'s sake. I, for one, cannot imagine ME3 without Jack Wall and Sam Hulick, but am hoping for the best.
