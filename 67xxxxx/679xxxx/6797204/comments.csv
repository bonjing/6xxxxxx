,harryyyrrah,2012-01-15T20:46Z,is this a trial version or registered?
,neaai,2012-01-28T18:55Z,"This is the full version. The only catch is that after installing it, you have to run it with the first dvd in the drive, otherwise it will run in demo mode and only for 10 minutes."

,Taco92,2012-02-10T01:07Z,"This works for Mac too, right?"
