X-Plane 9

A very cool game/simulation software for various types of aircraft, civil and military. The lot of DVDs contain the terrain and sceneries, which cover almost every vit of the planet.

This is the first DVD from a total of six. Size 7.3G tested to work using Alcohol-120% in WinXP. It also works for linux, you will need to go to \\\\\\\"http://wiki.x-plane.com/DVD_Installers\\\\\\\" and get the linux installer to use with this DVD.

I can not seed for all the othet 5 DVDs at the same time. I will start with this one first, allow it some time to spread and then move on to the next DVD. Hopefully there will be others able to upload.

There is no viruses in this whatosever. All operations have been made using Linux and the test was on another machine with WinXP and also on yet another machine with Win7. In both it worked flawlessly.

Enjoy.
