[T],The_Duck1,2011-11-08T05:30Z,"Hmmm I cannot find anything why this should happenend, i hope you are joking becaus i normal made themepacks.
I loooked into the file and i can not find anything that is related to one of my theme's.
On my windows 7 pc there is nothing to see either."
,happymanoftheworld,2011-11-11T20:11Z,Hi Duck - sorry but downloaded and during download AVG (free) flashed up a few Trojans all to do with OnlineGames3. AVG removed one but couldn't access others. But thanks for trying.
,happymanoftheworld,2011-11-11T20:14Z,Hi Duck - just posted but it isn't showing so trying again. AVG flags up Trojans from OnlineGames3. Sorry about that.
[T],The_Duck1,2011-11-11T21:32Z,"Hello happymanoftheworld,
I don't think your problem of the virus has something to do with my torrent. I use AVG by myself and i have no problems at all.

Here below you can see a link to virus total, you can see that there is no virus in this torrent.
