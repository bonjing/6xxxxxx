"Advanced Gay"

When Pierce (Chevy Chase) learns that he 
and his Hawthorne wipes have become 
extremely popular, he decides to throw a 
big party, until his overbearing father, 
Cornelius Hawthorne (Larry Cedar, 
"Deadwood,") shows up and puts the kibosh 
on the plans. Meanwhile, Troy (Donald 
Glover) finds himself being courted by 
Vice Dean Laybourne (John Goodman) and 
his secretive Air Conditioning Repair 
Annex, as well as Greendale's resident 
janitor, Jerry (Jerry Minor, "Lucky 
Louie").
