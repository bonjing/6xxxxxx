Everyone in this movie has a good line or a shining moment. Many familiar faces and characters. Christopher Reeve's performance is memorable.

The movie reflects some interesting signs its time. Of particular note are the idle activities of the reporters around the press room, perhaps playing off the film's title (screenshot "J").

For Final Fantasy VII fans, a regular voice actor for Sephiroth has a prominent supporting role (screenshot "K"). Newbern, who shares a remarkable sequence with Reeve (screenshot "F"), has voiced Superman as well.
