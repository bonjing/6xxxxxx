Awesome first torrent! Just a note that cbr/cbz comics are already compressed so zipping or raring doesnt really do much"
,slackator,2011-11-03T23:17Z,Any way we can get an unrared version of this? I love the idea of complete collections going up but I only need issue 33 and dont want to download 900mbs for it
,No301,2011-11-04T02:44Z,"@jakcreed thanks for the advice, I'll keep that in mind

@slackator I'm sure there are other #33 on here but ill upload it up un-rar format later tonight"
