,Radscar,2011-11-10T07:01Z,Does this version have the movies re-encoded or completely removed?
,Vasquish,2011-11-10T19:21Z,"@rip2234, if you are on windows 7 what you need to do is go into the sonic generations folder and run the configuration file as administrator. then set ur video settings, save and quit. to get the game to save all you have to do is run the exe as administrator. Is anyone else having a problem with sound? i cant seem to get the stage music to play. everything else is fine"
,dirty_tuna,2011-11-10T21:05Z,Im also not getting any music. No idea what the problem is. Music plays on the title and options menu though.
,Radscar,2011-11-11T05:40Z,"Okay here the reason, BlackBox has removed all the movies and most of the cool soundtracks.Read the description :/"
,Pentecostal,2011-11-12T00:06Z,can someone here post a link with the sound files
,Bamxcore,2011-11-12T08:33Z,"Hey .Dude., Any chance of seprately uploading the music files ? game kind of feels empty without music :/"
