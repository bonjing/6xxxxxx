
Myrath, formerly known as X-Tazy, is an Oriental metal band from Tunisia formed in 2001.

Myrath (which means Legacy), a metal band from Tunis, Tunisia, started out as a teenage cover band formed in 2001 by guitarist Malek Ben Arbia (who was 13 years old at the time) and became in just a few years, a respected band by the international prog-power metal community. Myrath performed in a couple of highly rated festivals as well.

Their first two releases are â€œHope" in September 2007, and "Desert Call" in January 2010. Their style is mainly defined as "Oriental Metal". Myrath's distinctive metal style is blended with oriental rhythms, scales and harmonies. Myrath has filmed a video clip for a song out of "Tales of the sand", their latest album, and will support Orphaned Land in a one month long European tour starting in November 2011.
