,extremeBONE,2011-11-04T07:50Z,Why is there a .rar file in the subs folder
,jebusg,2011-11-09T05:42Z,"a 10
v 9.5 could be crisper"
,supbon817,2011-11-09T10:53Z,Great quality upload once again thank you BONE!!
,scottsasse,2011-11-22T06:38Z,"@extremeBONE, Really dumbass?? Subs are usually rar or srt. The real question is why did you feel the need to combine extremezone and .BONE.'s usernames to make one of your own? And what is your plan, to try and take over TPB? No one will download from someone who calls himself extremeBONE!! See if the name DUMBone is taken:) ..................................................@81tarr, Great comeback, you had me laughing:) ..................................................@jebusg, Technically anything short of an exact lossless rip COULD be crisper:)  ..................................................@.BONE., THANKS for yet another awesome torrent and overlooked movie by most uploaders!!   ..................................................A/V=10 (best you can ask for in a 700MB rip)  "
,Kovo1,2011-11-23T21:13Z,Thanks
,jackdarwin73,2011-12-04T12:41Z,gud print....
,BigG_Oz,2011-12-11T00:58Z,"@scottsasse Nice one Sir, you saved me the time and trouble to write a somewhat similar riposte.........
@81tarr Succinct, true and funny to boot............
@jesbug........... Could be smarter!
@extremeBONE............. Listen to your betters, appreciate what others do for you and then sit down and ponder the wisdom of these words and never darken these hallowed sites again.
@.BONE. Effort 10 A/V 10...TY again for great quality work you are one of the few uploaders I trust to do as such and who's name I look for in particular..............
@ALL Uploaders & Downloaders...Merry Xmas & A Happy Seed Year."
,vipernickle99,2011-12-19T05:11Z,As always thanks Bone 
,ltdeamon,2012-01-07T17:51Z,"okay so im just going to assume that extremebone has done something elsewhere to annoy people, because i really  dont want to believe that you guys are going at it just because he asked a question..."
,pedmacedo,2012-03-14T01:46Z,"Subtitles: NL
Nice... why not latin? or maybe esperanto?"
,teamholmez86,2012-04-30T21:56Z,"@ itdeamon i totally agree with you ! theres just no need for half the comments ive seen over tpb  lately !! jesus christ !!!! he was only asking a question, GROW UP !! anyway thanks for this one bone, great quality as usual :):)
