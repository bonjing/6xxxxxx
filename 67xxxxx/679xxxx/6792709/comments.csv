There are plenty of 'fast' browsers out there with full source code available for the squeamish (e.g. Mozilla Firefox), this appears to be 'closed' source based on 'open source' with the copyright claimed by the poster. If the poster enclosed the 'full open source' with the post, I might give it a go, otherwise, I wouldn't touch this - not even with yours."

I have designed this browser myself and is very safe to use. I also do not give any of my source code for security reasons. The is one of the fastest browsers around and if you dont like it its up to you, then dont install it but i have lots of happy people using it and I'm always updating it for them."
