Video is very grainy/noisy in many areas
Not a great Blu-ray rip"

[V],3Li,2011-11-08T06:49Z,"the movie source was grainy, and bluray too.

,jamzkie,2011-11-10T12:19Z,"very good copy 10/10!!! the bluray transfer of the film was intended to have heavy grains. been looking for a very good copy for ages. thanks 3Li. i just highly suggest the audio will be AC3 than AAC. AAC is soft audio.
I hope you do Kung Fu Hustle (2004) in dual audio. thanks."
