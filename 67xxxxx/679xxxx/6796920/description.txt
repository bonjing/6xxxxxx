This release from Myra Melford's first Extended Ensemble tour -- trumpeter Dave
Douglas and saxophonist Marty Ehrlich were added to a trio which included
bassist Lindsey Horner and drummer Reggie Nicholson -- is revealing in that it
displays more than any of her other recordings; she's charting her own
development while in transition. Of the five pieces here, two, "That The Peace,"
and "Evening Might Still" were written purposely for the trio plus horns; they
score in lots of room for improvisation and dynamic while being closely
arranged. Of the others which were written for the trio and expanded upon, the
"La Mezquita Suite," which encompasses four different compositions, explores how
many pairings and trios can exist inside them. There is plenty of room for
soloing, but it is interesting to note how Melford's own role changes from one
movement to the next. The title composition is an exercise in both the interplay
of sonorities and in how, in various intervals, one instrument, when shaded by
others, can take on an entirely different persona. In all, Even The Sounds Shine
is a beautifully guided tour through Melford's musical psyche of the
time. Possibilities and problems present themselves with startling regularity
and are either resolved, transmuted, or abandoned. This is exhilarating
listening, and a historical look at Melford's development as a composer as she
moved from her trio setting into something more dimensional and challenging.
