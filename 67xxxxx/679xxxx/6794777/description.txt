	This is my new FAVORITE TV SHOW...EASILY!!!

	I'd like to introduce to you...

	   MTV's Bully Beatdown Seasons 1-3
	   --------------------------------

	Man! I LOVE this show. It's like UFC meets
	Punked with a dash Idol.
	Victims send in their videos explaining what
	their bully's do to them, and beg for help,
	so Mayhem (Host) does.
	The bully's get bum-rushed, and offered to
	"Pick on someone their own size".
	Someone their own size is an MMA Fighter,

	If the bully get's through 2 rounds, they get
	$10, 000. If they don't (and they don't) the
	Victim enjoys the cash.

	This is a must see, and enjoyed show.
	GRAB IT NOW!!!

		ENJOY,
			zzDJChris.

P.s Do me a favour and seed this for me for a little while. Thanks.
