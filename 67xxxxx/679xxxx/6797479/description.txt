=============================

The X-Men anime is written by famed English comic book writer/creator Warren Ellis, 
and borrows story elements from famed Scottish comic book writer Grant Morrisonâ€™s early 2000s 
story arch for New X-Men, as well as Joss Whedonâ€™s mid-2000s run on Astonishing X-Men.

Synopsis
----------

03 "Armor - Awakening" November 4, 2011
"Armor - Kakusei" (Armor - è¦šé†’)  April 15, 2011 

With Wolverine and Cyclops holding back their urges to kill Emma, the X-Men release Hisako and Emma, the latter of which denies having any part in that battle a year ago, since she had apparently already left the Inner Circle by then. As Hisako awakens, it is revealed that Emma was hired to be her tutor, 
since the Xavier Institute had ceased activity, and was captured when she went to Japan to search for Hisako. After defeating a group of cyborgs, the X-Men arrive at an operating room, where they are confronted by U-Men member Kick (who uses the data collected on the X-Men to gain an advantage). As he targets Emma, Hisako's mutant powers awaken, using her mind's energy to create a powerful armor which defeats Kick. However, her powers soon go out of control, but Emma manages to calm her down. As the other U-Men escape, the X-Men manage to free the other children. After making contact with Professor X, Kick returns and launches an attack at Hisako, forcing Emma to rush to protect her.
