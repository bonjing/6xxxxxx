,adrian20999,2011-11-04T09:31Z,WRONG SECTION!
,Steamcore,2011-11-04T11:16Z,"Dear Elfkrigen; I hope you heart stops beating. I also hope this happens because you are slowly yet thoroughly roasted from your feet up. I also hope that your entire immediate and extended family along with any friends you might have (doubt you have any though) will then be eviscerated and subsequently raped before your eyes while you're being slowly roasted. I then hope someone disposes of the remains of your worthless (lack of) friends and family and self by pressing you into urinal cakes to only be sold in homosexual establishments. Finally I would hope that everyone on the planet forgets about you entirely for the rest of eternity, but I know that will happen anyway."
,Dimmis80,2011-11-04T12:02Z,Thanks dude nice upload.:-)
,Wintermist,2011-11-04T12:08Z,God this music is as EPIC as Lord of the Rings! I can't wait for my pre-order to release!!!
,Elfkrigen,2011-11-04T12:43Z,"I can't change ""Type"" because when i press "" Edit torrent "" it says: "" EDIT - Temporarily disabled "".

,Undermand,2011-11-04T13:27Z,"dont hate steamcore, he's overtly a troubled person, and with all probability, a victim of strong psychological immaturity.

It troubles me, to see you under such pain."
,Barghetti,2011-11-07T09:34Z,"Thanks a bunch, My modded xbox is unusable right now (just the luck when skyrim is leaked right?), but I managed to replace my oblivion sound files with these, pretty cool experience"
