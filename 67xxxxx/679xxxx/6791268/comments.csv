,v360961,2011-11-04T00:25Z,Just wrote this game on a normal Imation DVD DL using CLONECD (specifically) without a single problem on my normal burner which came with my laptop. This game doesn't have any CIV checks unlike Forza 4. Even Skyrim doesn't have any CIV checks. I've played both of em' just a couple of hours back and I must say......AMAZING!
,JornXD,2011-11-04T00:28Z,@v360961 What did you do when it asked the disc was too small? What did u changed to CloneCD? Thnx
,icykle,2011-11-04T03:50Z,"Does anyone get a Disc Write Error? in imgburn (using latest version). It happened twice at 22%.

Burnt other XDG3 copies successfully, using DVD+R DL TDK... so not sure what the problem is. "
,chronic2011,2011-11-04T19:08Z,"for anyone having slow speeds, i used xbox360iso.com to get the game and I was CONSTANTLY getting 1MB/Sec i don't use torrents anymore i use that site. Oh and for burning errors just use clonecd instead, i never get errors with that"
,tRiPy,2011-11-04T21:15Z,"stupid question here im sorry guys, is there a way to play this without modded or flashed 360's??"
,tRiPy,2011-11-04T21:22Z,can i play this game without flashing or modding? sorry for the dumb question
,sfg132,2011-11-06T22:29Z,"For those who are having problems burning this you really do need to buy a Liteon DL DVD burner and flash it with the Burner Max firmware from C4eva. I used a liteon iHas 124 b bought for ĂÂŁ17.00 and flashed it. Used Verbitam MKM003 DL discs burnt with latest Imgburn at 4x with OPC enabled and advanced settings enabled (hypertuning, etc((there is a guide out there for imgburn for xdg3)). Then tested burnt disc with Kprobe2 ( settings from guide) my results for this game were PI max 47 and PIF 4. Within specs as i've read. Anyway what you need to know is out there in guides and forums, you don't need to keep asking how/why/what on here just search for your answer."
,hitsugara,2011-11-10T19:12Z,"lol.. I'm having the time of my life since I live in India.Almost every Blank media here( Including Verbatim) is manufactured by Moser Baer.. so they also manufactur the cheapo ""Double National"" discs.. they cost like 20 cents a piece and I swear I haven't had a bad burn with XGD3 games(with LT MAX I mean)!! checked with kprobe and all.. you name it.. hehe "
