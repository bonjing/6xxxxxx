         LSU (8-0) is off to its best start since 1973 after a 45-10   
         win over Auburn, as Jarrett Lee completed 14-of-20 passes     
         for 165 yards and two touchdowns, while Alabama (8-0)         
         has been idle since defeating conference-rival Tennessee,     
          37-6, on Oct. 22.
