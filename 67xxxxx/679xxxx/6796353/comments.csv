,Leranior,2012-02-23T08:26Z,"I am able to find various faults in both your torrents.
There are books missing!
If you have the book 'Debris from the fallen races', I'd be very happy if you could upload it.
(The book is part of the esoteric wisdom-scroll, if you didn't know that)"
,nickgreyden,2012-02-24T23:33Z,Hmm It appears I did overlook that book and it is likewise not in either of my collected works. Thank you for pointing that out. Once upon a time I had that pdf but have since misplaced it. I'll be on the lookout for it so keep checking back to see if I've obtained it yet as well as newer releases.
