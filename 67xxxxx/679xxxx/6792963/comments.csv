 You gotta tell Me what I'm doing different than You because I can't get Torrentz and even Pirate Bay to list My Rips. I put This out Two Days ago in a 202MB 1080p mkv, and a 51MB xvid/mp3 version linked from KAT and most of the time, they won't show up on searches. You ripped This one from my mkv? So anyway give Your Old Mate a hand. OK...aX"
[V],.BONE.,2011-11-03T18:52Z,DTRG ripped it i just uploaded
,BAT.1,2011-11-04T01:51Z,"Yea, I'd given the link My X-Crew sent Me to an Imp, Doomer1 and He said He gave it to SAFCuck009 to Rip and Post on The Big D.Me. Since I rose from the Grave, I've just been bouncing around trying to  get My skills back. Just Ain't Working. Too Much Damn Brain Damage.! Think I'm gonna Sail back off into The Sunset.  So I'll be depending on You to Keep Them Rips a Coming. Mabuhay..aX"
