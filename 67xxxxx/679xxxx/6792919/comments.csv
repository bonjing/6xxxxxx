,TempDude29,2011-11-03T20:17Z,"This is the same crappy rip thats already been deleted from Piratebay once.
The graphics is all messed up in this version."
,Pan43bros,2011-11-03T21:28Z,"I see this repack is posted again...
I downloaded it 10 hours ago, but it was removed.
This repack works perfect, with small glitches."
,Ciahast,2011-11-03T21:45Z,"The game came out 2 days ago, so why is it taking so long to get a decent upload? "
,GaBoi234,2011-11-03T22:28Z,i cant believe no one has commented positively on this release ive been playing this all day pretty fun game graphics aren't the best but its fun and this torrent does work 
,blackrains,2011-11-03T22:36Z,"I'd like to confirm this torrent as working, in English. You just have to go into the /res/gamedata/ folder, open language.mbjr in notepad, and replace the number 8 with the number 0. I can't find any LAN support built in though."
,DarthDerp,2011-11-04T00:30Z,"""a journey that is both epic and intimate, familiar yet unexpected""

Anal sex?"
,elessarGObonzo,2011-11-04T00:34Z,"what's the ""repack""? languages removed, hi-res textures removed, video quality downgrade, using higher file compression?"
,Sivos,2011-11-04T00:48Z,"@Ciahast Because it was only released in the US, not the UK.  The best crackers (such as Skidrow) are in the UK so we're mostly getting people who bought the game uploading it to this site.  In other words, mostly noobs."
,Sivos,2011-11-04T00:50Z,"Check back tomorrow for a real SKIDROW upload.  They don't upload until they have the crack made for it, they can't crack it until it appears on Steam and it will not come up on Steam in the UK until the 4th of November."
,oscartkoyou,2011-11-04T09:13Z,"this fw version is corrupt, thats why its crashing for some people. the video partiton is corrupted, the t.p version seems to be working, i just havent found it yet?!"
,Sivos,2011-11-04T13:42Z,"Yes is works.  So far, I'm not finding any glitches, except for Aragorn in the first scene is black when you talk to him.  I've played for an hour after that and still nothing.  I do not see any graphic problems, I put everything to maximum at first then reduced it to low in game, it does get worse so there are no graphical problems (if that's what everyone meant).  And the game does lag during loading screens (like the picture is moving and it skips a bit, no big deal).  No crashes so far, for those who do have it, try running the game in Admin.  In previous games I've played, the game would crash unless I ran it in Admin.  So from now on I just do that by default.  Also, I'm not fully sure, but I think there might be some kind of virus in this torrent.  Now I know it's just a false positive when AVG says there is a virus upon running the game.  But when I got off to write this, it took about 15 minutes to open Firefox (it was soooooooooooooo slow) and now my Firefox is so fucked up, my tool bar is missing along with addons and all I see is the URL box.  Hopefully when I restart my computer it will be fixed.  It's still taking a while to go between sites, about 5 minutes.  But all in all, the torrent does work."
,GObonzo,2011-11-04T19:09Z,"everybody i talked to was black in dialog. also could change graphics settings but didnt effect game, looked like somethin from 10 years ago no matter what setting. had to use new updated crack, fixed all those issues. now looks pretty decent. was having terrible stuttering also until changed my tessellation option to Use Application Settings instead of AMD Optimized. does this even use tessellation? doesn't look like textures are all that great."
,Chit91,2011-11-04T20:03Z,"@GObonzo   
I am having the choppy gameplay issue even with a high end PC. Where do you change this tessellation setting?"
,AminAveh12345,2011-11-05T00:57Z,Seriously stop leaching and seed
,GObonzo,2011-11-05T01:15Z,"Chit91, depends on your GPU."
,usmanali.tron,2011-11-05T01:21Z,this seeeds vary high but my downloading very slow whay
,dchau00,2011-11-05T04:32Z,Having some trouble getting the game going..... anyone else having this problem i am unable to even start it up after installation
,jessebr,2011-11-06T05:19Z,"Non-newfag here; this is a virus and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

It is anti sandboxie. and tried to make use of explorer.exe when the game has NO need to.

,jessebr,2011-11-06T18:57Z,"@Abhishekp No, but look at my warning.

Also I did play the game before I found out it lags up the ass (After I renabled my av's) that the games a virus  not a fale pos a virus and a legit one. "
,usmanali.tron,2011-11-07T06:35Z,work 100 but graphics so bad
,inquisi,2011-11-08T15:31Z,"How to get it working? It always tell me in install that is decompression error -1
