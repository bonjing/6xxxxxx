About the Author

Best-selling author Dana Carpender was startled to discover that limiting her carbohydrate intake not only helped her control her weight, but produced the health and vitality a low fat diet had promised but never delivered. Fifteen years later, she laughs at people who say â€œYou canâ€™t eat that way long-term.â€ Her eight cookbooks are the result of her realization that the key to permanent dietary change is the answer to the age-old question, â€œWhatâ€™s for supper?â€ To date they have sold over a million copies worldwide. Dana blogs about low carb nutrition at www.HoldtheToast.com; her weekly blog digest goes out to over 20,000 readers. She is also Managing Editor of CarbSmart Magazine at http://www.CarbSmart.com, as well as a featured staff writer. She launches her internet radio show, Dana's Low Carb For Life, on Labor Day 2010. Dana lives in Bloomington, Indiana with her husband and a menagerie of pets, all of whom are well and healthily fed.
