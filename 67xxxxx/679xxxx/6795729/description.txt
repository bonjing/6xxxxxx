I thought Iâ€™d have a go at putting both Steven Wilsons solo releases on a DVD in surround sound .. partly because his latest release is â€˜Blue-rayâ€™ + Cd\\\'s only which I thought a bit odd?

Anyhow, there are FLAC releases in 5.1 floating around so they were my starting point (thanks to all concerned with those!)

Method â€¦
Get WAV from FLAC with dbPowerAmp converter â€¦
Convert WAV to AC3 with WAV to AC3 Encoder â€¦ from here http://code.google.com/p/wavtoac3encoder/
Build DVD with DVD-lab PRO 2 â€¦ following various guides from videohelp.com , and making it up as I go along! ..

I\\\'ve included a few screens to give you an idea of whatâ€™s going on ..
Thereâ€™s a couple of extra menus in there â€¦ to get to them push your menu button when playing a song from that particular disc (not sure why it works that way .. yet!)

Each disc plays to the end song, and then returns to the main menu.

Everything seems to work OK on my DVD player .. my cheap surround sound system tells me itâ€™s in Dolby digital 5.1, which is what we want.

This is my first attempt at this sort of thing so hopefully I havenâ€™t made any glaring audio blunders along the way!

Please let me know how it works for you , criticisms? , improvements??

And donâ€™t forget , If you enjoy Steven Wilson\\\'s music , you really should go out and buy it!!
