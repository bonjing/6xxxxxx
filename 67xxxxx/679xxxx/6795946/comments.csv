,Bolerophon,2012-02-28T23:21Z,Out of fucking sync. Why do you bother to upload this crap if you know it's not watchable?!?! FUCKING DIE.
,whitecat2010,2012-02-29T05:08Z,"Come on guys, don't be hateful! Of course, the uploader should have stated this fact, and even better, done the synchronization before uploading, but still ""die"" seems a bit too strong!
It's so easy to put the subtitles a little later or earlier. If you don't want to do it permanently, on VLC you can instruct the program to do it. Go to ""Tools"", choose ""Track synchronization"" and it has a slider where the audio can go before or after the video for a certain amount. Very easy. "
