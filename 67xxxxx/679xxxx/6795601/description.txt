 Hitler's Master of the Dark Arts: Himmler's Black Knights and the Occult Origins of the SS.




At the heart of the evil of Nazism was Hitlerâ€™s â€œwitch doctor,â€ Heinrich Himmler, and his peculiar and deadly organization with the mundane name Schutzstaffel, literally â€œprotective squadron.â€ Undoubtedly you know them better as the feared SS, the very essence of Nazism. Their threatening double lightning bolt is perhaps the most dreaded symbol of the Third Reich. 

Â  

The facts of the SSâ€™s origins are truly stranger than fiction. If you thought Raiders of the Lost Ark was an inspired Hollywood fiction, think again. Hitler's Master of the Dark Arts reveals the hidden â€œtruthsâ€ of the SS in full and morbidly fascinating detail.
