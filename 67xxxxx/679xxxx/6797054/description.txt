I KILL YOU!

Jeff Dunham is back in his much anticipated 
third live DVD, with all new material and unparalleled 
comedy that surpasses his record-breaking specials, 
Arguing with Myself, Spark of Insanity, and A Very 
Special Christmas Special. All the favorites are here 
Walter, the grumpy retiree; furry and manic Peanut; Jos 
Jalapeo, the spicy pepper from south of the border; plus 
bumbling skeletal Achmed the Dead Terrorist. Dunham is also 
joined by two never-before-seen characters certain to unleash 
their own unique havoc on stage. Dunham is an international 
phenomenon with sold-out stadium-sized concerts, half a billion 
YouTube views, and television shows that remain among the highest 
rated in Comedy Central history. 

Controlled Chaos is guaranteed to deliver an unequaled number 
of laughs-per-minute - whether you re a Dunham Maniac, or 
seeing him and his partners for the very first time
