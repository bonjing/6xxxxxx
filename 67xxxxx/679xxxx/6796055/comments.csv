Many thanks for the conference finals and finals. The current finals (1990) is when I started following the NBA so they hold a special place in my past for me. 

As for what games for you to share, I'm grateful for whatever you decide, my only preference is that it is in english. If you want a decision I would prefer the finals first (with conference finals if you have them). 

Any other games would be welcome if you think they are worth sharing, if they have notable players or just a good game.

Again I appreciate your efforts and I can only hope you keep your sharing passion alive.

Thanks for your comment and I thinked to continue with 1991's, 1992's etc. games and meanwhile insert from time to time the older games. I don't know if you all guys are agree. 
I don't know if those games worth watching or not, because I don't seen it yet, but I think that you, guys, are more entitled to decide that than me. 
From the NBA games, always try to up english version, but sometimes don't exist.
Thank you!"
,nba4me,2011-11-05T13:31Z,"I agree. If you are not to sure what the older games are like, share the finals stuff first, with the other games every now and then. I would love to have the finals for they are the true treasure of all the games. Again, many many thanks."
[V],Nepotu,2011-11-05T15:32Z,OK! I notice your vote. :)  I think that one way or another will please you and all NBA fans. Chears!
