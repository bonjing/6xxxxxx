This is all the soundtracks of Lord Of The Rings trilogy. 

The Original retail versions & The Massive "Complete Recordings" sets.

I put all of it together because often times the original retail version can be cut differently, and sometimes include a track or two not in the complete version.

320, 500x500 (which was tricky to find for "Complete" sets) fully and properly tagged. 

This torrent was a pretty good project to put together, so please seed much. I had a hard time getting "The Complete Recordings" sets.

In the "Complete" sets I included 2 album arts, 1 is the outer, or bex set cover, the 2nd which I assigned in the ID3 is the inner cd case cover.


Again Seed much, & Enjoy my fellow LOTR fans.
