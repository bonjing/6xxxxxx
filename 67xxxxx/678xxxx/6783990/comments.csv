[V],psspss,2011-10-31T02:34Z,"seems tpb is not allowing uploads for the past hour UGH !

where is admin they need ot fix it asap

anyhow

this show kinda makes one feel you have to be gay to be a artist lol

anyhow if someone wants to rip next weeks show sooner
consider grabbing it from amazon if in usa for $2
seems instead of bravo adding to their own site they sell it
to itunes and amazon first

tubedugger can rip anything streamed and convert to avi ;)

basically anything that goes to the screen of pc can be captured :)
teres other soft out there can screen capture and audio if streaming cant be done ;)"
,Fangular,2011-10-31T03:00Z,"And this really is a brilliant quality upload too - thanks again - so very, very much!!"
,Fangular,2011-10-31T03:01Z,"Oh and thanks for the tip, psspss but unfortunately, I'm not in the US - am in Australia - and you're restricted from buying episodes like that from here, unfortunately. It's so stupid - we want the shows and I'm sure they want the money from selling them.. so what's the problem!??"
[V],psspss,2011-10-31T03:23Z,"i know they stupid fockers they need to get with
what the people want and they make more money
then

its always about greed.. even $2 a episode is too much you have isp costs to dd on top remember
i guess 1 dollar in amazon pocket and 1 for media coy
another billion a yar profit lol..

but they make more if rid stupid country blocks

and spend less time fighting piracy and providing a service instead

have a read of torrentfreaks news bits (google for it).. its all about this and other antip2p stupid stuff

ps im not in usa either.. why someone there could buy it and rip for the rest of us.. :) you can use
proxies and vpns only so much

of course usa is now trying to get a new bull in
to close down or have the power to block
this site and vpns etc again  read torrentfreaks news"
,Fangular,2011-11-04T02:11Z,"That's interesting (and f*$ed up) about the US trying to block overseas people in new ways - thanks, psspss. Man, if only they used all this power and technology for good instead of greed (as if *that's* gonna happen!)

But thanks heaps for all your effort, psspss - like many others, I really appreciate it . And like you, I don't understand why someone in the US can't upload this show!

I do love this weird show, though! Do you read the recaps by one of the judges, Jerry Saltz, on NY magazine online, by the way? They're facinating (he talks a bit about some of the stiff that didn;t make the final cut, for instance- and he actually comes off as pretty cool - and very knowledgeable.

Anyway, thanks again for all your work speading this show to the unAmerican masses! Am looking forward to episode 4! :-)

Cheers,
Fangular

[V],psspss,2011-11-06T03:52Z,i still cant source Episode 4 before people comment read above im not in usa and if someone is perhaps they could source from amazon for us 
,laptopdog,2011-11-07T12:24Z,"Yeah, I totally understand psspss - and I have left requests for the others that have uploaded past episodes... you never know your luck! And thanks again for the effort you made to upload the episodes you have :-)"
