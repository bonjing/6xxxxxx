The mark of a great live album is how much it makes you feel like you were there for the show. Jorn's "Live In Black" puts you front row center and then blasts you back in your seat with a potent dose of old-school metal. If you're looking to take in a great classic metal show at home, Jorn's "Live In Black" is just what you're looking for. Let the soaring vocals, killer guitars and roar of the crowd turn your living room into an arena.
