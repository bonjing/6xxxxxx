,Bjorta31,2011-11-01T23:07Z,"Thanks can anyone try to get database for editor??

,CaptainShiznit,2011-11-01T23:18Z,is this the same Skidrow update with the staff bug?
,Avar007,2011-11-01T23:22Z,"it doesn't work, the same problem"
,nox150690,2011-11-02T03:08Z,"Guy just wanted to let you know that the crash is apparently caused by the .exe file. If you have the SKIDROW release (i assume you have) then simply take the .exe file from your DVD ISO and replace it with the .exe in the game folder.

It won't matter if you have already updated to 12.0.3 as the game will now boot with 12.0.2, allowing you to still play while waiting for the crack. Or, just don't install the update. "
,gmoujik,2011-11-02T03:34Z,"If you use steam_api.dll from SKIDROW the game won't start. If you use the original after updating to 12.0.3 on
Vista, England, Premier only, Liverpool.
The game crashes when you try to access staff profiles."
