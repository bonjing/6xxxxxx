I do hope you liked what was posted last night and are ready for more! One thing though, I have had a few e-mails and seen some reviews where people said that "they did not like all that was posted". Well this series is just like a library people. Do you like all the books that a library has to offer you? no you pick and choose the ones you like! so now let's get started....

Combonation - Combonation [1984]

Price-Sulton - Lights On [1986]

Sherry Kean - People Talk [1983]

Watermelon Men - Wildflowers [1986]


Enjoy and seed if you like these torrents!
