,atndigcrk,2012-01-02T23:24Z,"lol people screaming virus on my uploads? i must made it big, im a trusted user ur tactics wont work inthis case sorry guy

NOTE:
u can actually update it to 1.5, then shut off the net, and rip new itunes 10.5 stuff, maybe in a last resort cuz u get a warning for piracy serial lol but it still works, or u can rip with the old version but make sure when u play the vid first in itunes then right click video > set to play in its own window> then make sure it opens the window in a new window then close and then rip 
enjoy "
