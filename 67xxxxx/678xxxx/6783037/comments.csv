If you want a challenge here's one for you, I want to make a request, its an old album called ""Deep in Yoshitoshi""- Refer this page - 
http://www.last.fm/music/Various+Artists/Deep+In+Yoshitoshi 
You might be familiar with the fifth track. I really couldnt find it anywhere else, would be really happy if you could upload this. Thanks again and no hurt intended."

You think you could possibly upload another torrent with these exact songs, but the full versions?

In any case, great torrents. Keep up the great work!"
