This is my hand-converted collection of Adventure Time, current as of October 2011.
File format is H.264/MPEG4 640x360 @ 1500kbs.

All episodes originally obtained from TPB but reconverted to a standardized format and rolled into a massive torrent for distribution.  Due to naming conventions, original release crew has been omitted, but not out of malice.  I take no credit for the original releases and would like to thank the original uploaders.

Hopefully you enjoy the show as much as I have!
