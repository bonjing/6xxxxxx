,Tbone321,2011-11-02T16:44Z,My internet got shut off and I was fined $35 dollars from Showtime for downloading this.. be careful.
,lunarro,2011-11-03T04:36Z,u rule ez!!!!!
,murleyspatch,2011-11-07T14:34Z,"Tbone321....lmao....

If you were fined anything from showtime for downloading this it would be upwards of 500,000 thousand dollars, not 35.... If you were fined 35 dollars, it was probably a late charge or something from your internet provider, which would explain why your internet was cut... "
