Release Notes....: It looks like the show may have changed its name from "Gold Rush: Alaska" to just
                   "Gold Rush".  Because the website link still says "gold-rush-alaska" and for
                   continuity purposes, I decided to keep it as "Gold Rush: Alaska". Also, I was not
                   sure about the size for this runtime but 350MiB would have put the video bitrate
                   below 900kbps. This show has low compressibility so 550MiB seemed more fitting.
