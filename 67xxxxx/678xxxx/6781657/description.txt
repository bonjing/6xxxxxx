                               The Complete Series 1


The Fades is a British supernatural drama television series broadcast on BBC Three and BBC HD.

The programme centres around an English teenager named Paul who is haunted by apocalyptic dreams that nobody can explain and is able to see spirits of the dead, known as the Fades, all around him. The Fades can't be seen, smelt, heard or touched by other humans â€“ they are what is left of humans who have died but not been accepted into Heaven. As such, the Fades left on Earth have become embittered and vengeful towards the human race. We are shown in the first episode that the Fades have found a way to become partly human again and regain control of touch within the real world. However, they remain unseen in the world except to those special few like Paul â€“ 'Angelics' â€“ who have the ability to perceive the Fades. Paul finds himself pulled into a conflict between the Angelics and the Fades, trying to prevent the Fades from breaking back into the world and destroying the human race. The Fades school scenes were filmed at Queens School, Bushey.
