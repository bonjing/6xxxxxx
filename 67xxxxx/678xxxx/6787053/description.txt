Weird.Or.What.S01E16 (Host William Shatner) -][ (Mystery Explosion over island, Vanishing Boats in Fog & Weird Flashes of Light) Freaks of Natrue ][ 31-Oct-2011 ].avi

this is a webrip source

i converted to standard xvid 356mb with mp3 audio for those
who want it in this format (since I did it for myself/usage)

enjoy and help seed

ps thanks to ninjas sources. saved me having to webrip since sbs
seem to think they are clever blocking proxy and vpn ips :)

note there is some confusiom over episode naming

some say this is Season 2? S02E06 but I feel its still season 1
since the last batch of shos stopped at episode 7 (although 10 did air
in other countries)
which i feel is a mid season break rather then a full season end

nut if have too we can always rename them to match confirm naming
later

EPISODE 15 seemed to have been skipped and this one was air-ed instead
so perhaps E15 will air at a later date?

Freaks of Nature
Three mysterious freaks of nature: On the East Coast of Canada, a small community is devastated by an earth-shattering â€˜boomâ€™ that leaves scientists scratching their heads; swallowing ships and planes and terrorizing sailors and pilots, a paranormal fog haunts Lake Michigan and seems to alter the very fabric of time; and, a blinding double flash of light over the Indian Ocean sends a nation into panic and forces the US government to ask some serious questions.



this will be a slow seed! ok.. be patient and please stay connect until done
so all chunks share out faster tather then me having to give same chunks
