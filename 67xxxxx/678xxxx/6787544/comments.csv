,kampfwurst,2011-11-01T15:08Z,FAKE!!!!!!! ANONYMOUS HAS UL IT!!!
,DeFl00d,2011-11-01T16:07Z,"Anonymous isn't a person and its not fake. The guy who uploaded this has chosen to keep his identity secret, that's why it's anonymous.

This is not fake because it has been posted on rlslog with the same size. You're welcome people :)"
,Matinator10,2011-11-01T16:37Z,"Yep its not fake, this has been posted by a Trusted uploader ;)"
,TempDude29,2011-11-01T18:21Z,"I get three malware warnings from this torrent once I started installing:
One from the crack-folder file ""Skidrow.exe""
Second from c:\windows\system32\consrv.dll
Third from c:\windows\assembly\temp\U\80000032.$

I have no idea what those are but I'm waiting for another release."

,scoang6777,2011-11-02T05:01Z,Game works perfect.Thank you!
,bgabor911,2011-11-02T11:27Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS!!! IT IS FAKE!!

Not sure what the hell is this actually, but certainly not the Achtung Panzer Operation Star game."
,Raven_11,2011-11-21T04:18Z,"If this was actually a SKIDROW upload, I would expect to see a more trusted name on the uploaded by.  I will not be downloading this one.  Not to mention, if this is a SKIDROW upload, where is the original one at?"
,Commie67,2012-02-15T09:24Z,"Works just fine, no viruses, no malware.
Good game."
,tikasukaz,2012-04-16T11:52Z,"Its SKIDROW release. Game working fine.

And it has been uploaded by trusted uploader."
,iluvpie3,2012-05-22T16:02Z,"Installed it,everything seems to be fine,but where is the Serial Code for activation? didnt see anyone else with this problem,any pointers?"
