The International Standard Reference Work for Sexual Medicine

Under the auspices of the International Society for Sexual Medicine (the leading international professional society in the field), a multidisciplinary group of international contributors identify the most current standards of practice for diagnosing and treating sexual dysfunctions in both sexes. Fully reflecting recent progress in pharmacologic approaches â€“ including the highly successful drug treatments for ED â€“ the text offers comprehensive coverage, from consultation to diagnosis to treatment to reports on potential and developing treatments.

In twenty-nine chapters, the authors cover extensively the wide range of male and female sexual disorders, including ED, priapism, Peyronieâ€™s disease, ejaculatory and hormonal disorders, sexual arousal disorders, dyspareunia, hormonal therapy after menopause and more.
