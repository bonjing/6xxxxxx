Name: Android Market .apk
Developer :GOOGLE INC
Version : 3.3.11
Requires ANDROID: 2.2 and up
Category: Tools


New version Android Market, rolling out with new settings, and new icon.

Thereâ€™s a brand-new settings menu, as well as click-to-read explanations of app permissions (not developer customizable, unfortunately). Thereâ€™s also a brand-new Market icon to spruce things up.

Oh, and did we mention you can now use a custom PIN for purchases on your phone, instead of leaving your Google Checkout wide open for anyone that picks up your device? If you have kids, or your phone is stolen, this is one awesome feature to have â€“ and really, it makes a lot of sense.

You can get the new Market .apk here, root access is not required, but youâ€™ll need Unknown Sources enabled in the Settings -> Applications menu to install it.

**If you want your old Android market back just go to 

setting -> Applications -> Manage Applications -> "All" Tab 
->Search 'Market'-> UnInstall Updates

Installation Notes:

1) Go to settings - applications - enable the 'unknown sources' option.          
2) Put the .apk files somewhere on your SD card.                                 
3) Open your file manager on the device (like Astro Manager from market).

4) Select a .apk file.                                                           
5) If you get the 'complete action using' pop-up, choose 'package installer'.
