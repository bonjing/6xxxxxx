Planet Terror arrives on Blu-ray sporting a beat up, dirty and generally terrible looking 1080P transfer. Framed in its original theatrical aspect ration of 1.85:1 and encoded with AVC Mpeg-4, it's the perfect representation of how the film looked theatrically. Mr. Rodriguez, acting as both director and cinematographer, has given the film an intentional digital scrubbing to give the movie the appearance of having been badly treated over the course of many years. There's a ton of noise, loads of scratches, discolored frames, missing scenes and even burned out frames in the movie. It's all done for effect and comes across perfectly on Blu-ray. It would be pointless to dive into any real study of the quality of Planet Terror on Blu-ray as the movie looks intentionally bad. The most important aspect of this is that the film looks exactly like Mr. Rodriguez wants for it to look.

Death Proof (2007)

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1028528/

http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Death-Proof-Blu-ray/1249/

Much like the Blu-ray edition of Planet Terror, Death Proof arrives on everyone's favorite format sporting an AVC Mpeg-4 encoded 1080p transfer with all the warts intended to make the film look well aged. Although the picture isn't quite as purposely shredded as Planet Terror , Death Proof is still rife with heavy artificial grain, scratches and the general appearance that it was shot on the cheapest seventies film stock imaginable. This causes the picture to often look washed out and overexposed. Black levels can be quite deep and satisfying, but are generally washed out. The film is occasionally blurry and often overly sharp. Of course this is all intentional and there really isn't much to say about Death Proof other than that it looks precisely as it should. "

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462322/

It is 
 Planet Terror + Death Proof ( Lenght 191 min.)

In our torrent adding the times of the two movies we get 3 H 39 min
( 105 min 33 sec + 113 min 36 sec = 219 minutes, and all the clever faux trailers are in here."
,themorningstar69,2011-11-03T08:24Z,"MKV only, I don't think all the trailers and stuff are on here.  Planet Terror has the trailer for Machete, but that is the only one that I found.  Death Proof starts with ""Our Feature Presentation.""  Wonderful otherwise.  I don't know if the trailers are available separate, but I kinda wanted to see them. Thanks."
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-11-03T11:44Z,"That's right, it seems that there is a Death Proof (2007) 7 minutes longer version so I suppose that explains the missing adds from our 114 min (international version)."
,themorningstar69,2011-11-03T18:30Z,Do you have or know where to find the trailers by chance?  Thanks for the quick response!

,SilenceMurderer,2011-11-19T18:15Z,"Why does my physical memory goes 95% every time I do something with the folder of this movie (moving/changing name/copying)?

Got 4GB DDR3 and never had this before. Windows task manager (all users) shows that only 300-350K is used. After 10 min. my memory goes back to 19% (lower then normal) and windows taks manager still shows exactly the same processes with same memory use. Can't find a solution/explanation on google...

Great movie quality though."
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-11-23T09:43Z,"""..do something with the folder of this movie..""
R: C'mon, did you try other folder too? I suppese you got it on C: (where the windows is) and you have less then 10% free space on C:.
It sounds weird, as if you'd have some virus. It never happened to me to show 99% for such a simple operation. This folder is not any different then any other movie folder."
,SilenceMurderer,2011-11-24T15:02Z,"I had the movie on C, where I had over 300GB free, moved it to folder E, where i still have 200GB free.

Never had this before, so also not wither other folders.

Got now 12GB BTW, problem still occurs, but now my RAM goes from 13 to 30 or something, but my pc is still really slow when this happens for like 10 minutes.

I know, it's really weird. Can't figure it out. Let Windows 7 check for problems might help (CMD -> sfc /scannow)."
