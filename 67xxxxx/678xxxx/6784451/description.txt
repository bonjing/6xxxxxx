Marking a departure from his revered and influential musical collaborations in the past with Angelo Badalamenti (Twin Peaks), Polish pianist Marek Zebrowski (Inland Empire), and Sparklehorse and Danger Mouse (Dark Night of the Soul), David Lynch now reveals his first solo musical project, with the release of Crazy Clown Time on Sunday Best Recordings on November 7.

Recorded over several months at his own studio in Mulholland Drive with engineer Dean Hurley (who also contributes guitar and drums), \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Crazy Clown Time\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" unveils a majestic, yet powerfully idiosyncratic vision of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"modern blues\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" that could only be drawn from the mind of David Lynch. Filled with foreboding soundscapes, hypnotic rhythms and enigmatic lyrics, this is music that will resonate not only with fans of Lynch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s films, but also to listeners who appreciate daring, experimental music.
