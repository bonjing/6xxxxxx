iTunes Review:

Energetic and loose, this New England-based quintet blends various influences to create a style all their own. Led by Will Evansâ€™ rich, soulful vocals the bandâ€™s arrangements incorporate catchy hooks and dynamic tempo shifts while giving the music room to breathe. â€œRoll If You Fallâ€ and â€œThe Oceanâ€ get the crowd on its feet with infectious sing-along choruses and headlong momentum, and mid-tempo gems â€œMisledâ€ and â€œDrink to Youâ€ carry an emotional weight that adds to their impact. The band reveals its range with â€œReachâ€ and â€œChanges in the Weather,â€ a pair of moving ballads featuring swelling strings that intertwine with the melodies. Sax and trumpet add grit and texture to the piano showcase â€œHesitationâ€ and the reggae-inflected â€œEagle Front,â€ while â€œRopeâ€ is solid roots rock buoyed by Weissenborn slide and bluesy harmonica bends. The song here that perhaps best illustrates Barefoot Truthâ€™s diversity is â€œSolitude.â€ Starting with a searing guitar riff that digs in and holds on, the band lays down a bedrock of thick organ, dexterous drumming, and an agile bass line before leading to a fiery harmonica solo and some jazz-tinged keyboards.
