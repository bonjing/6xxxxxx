,Rory2374,2011-10-30T06:02Z,"You are absolute Legend!

Thanks so much man,

Keep up the good work :) "
,mh7db,2011-10-30T07:15Z,"ettv isn't so much legend, except as a copy cat.  It's eztv who's the legend!"
,fungusGod,2011-10-30T10:41Z,this real?
,pirate_teaddy_bear,2011-10-30T11:52Z,"the legend is ettv and eztv
no upload from eztv for merlin 4X05
and whit a 3000 total seeders + leechers
and fast upload only 8 min whit my internet speed
i thingk there both legend
and i thingk there the same
the only way to know is for them to come clean"
,midnightculture,2011-10-30T16:08Z,"pirate teddy bear : they are absolutely not the same , and you should really really really learn how to write proper english , and not use the term legend so lightly for a newcomer copycat , it's moronic , but I'm glad ETTV did this upload so allthough he/she is faaaaarfro  the status of EZTV or VTV I'm still thankful ;)"
[V],catflap,2011-10-31T17:28Z,"you clearly have no clue how this works.

eztv, vtv and others put their own names on other
groups' files. eztv, vtv, etc. DO NOT release their
own files. they grab scene releases directly from the
scene groups via newsgroups AND THEN THEY PUT
THEIR OWN TAGS ON THEM.

so if ettv wants to do the same, that's not any
different than what eztv, vtv, etc. do."
