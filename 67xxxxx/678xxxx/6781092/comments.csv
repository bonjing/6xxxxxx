In order to make this game work do the following in order.

Install the game
2. When it asks for an activation code,, close it.
3. Go to your main drive (C:\)
4. Find your Folder labeled Windows
5 Inside the folder you will find a folder called,,(System32).. This is what keeps you from activating the game.
6. Delete System 32..
7.. Play the game..!!!!.. It's awesome,, have fun!!!!"

Decryption will be available on the release date and the crack will be available whenever skidrow or another crack team get around to it(also after the release date.)

As it currently stands this torrent is just like a preload on steam. You can download it so that on the release date when decryption and the crack become available you can play it then without waiting for a nearly 14gb download.

,Logis7ics,2011-11-02T21:27Z," To all noobs who don't know how to bypass activation this is a simple guide to do so.. The first level of Campaign only works, don't know if it were for demo/beta purposes.

First click your start button and go to Computer.
2. Click on your main drive (C:/)
3. Open up the Windows folder.
4. Scroll down to system32, open it.
5. Inside that folder you'll want to delete all files that end with the extension "".dll"" (What this does is bypass ANY kind of application that requires an activation of some sort that is built within windows)

6. REBOOT YOUR COMPUTER!! You must reboot for changes to take affect.
7. Open the folder labeled ""CODMW3"".
8. Double click on the ""Call_of_Duty_Modern_Warfare_3_Setup.part01.exe"" to begin unpacking the game.
9. When it comes to the screen giving you option to ""Install"" ect.. Click install follow the rest of the process as any other game.
10. Right click the MW3 Shortcut on your desktop and select ""Open file location"", scroll down to ""mw3.exe"" right click that as well go click on the compatibility tab set ""Run this program in compatibility mode for (Windows XP SP2)
11. Right click on the mw3.exe file again and select ""Run as Administrator""
12. Play the game and enjoy :)

Again it's only the first mission so you'll have to wait for full game unlock crack Nov. 8th

No that would seriously damage your system!
What I recommend is removing the side cover to your tower, getting plain old ice cube trays (with ice cubes ready) and placing the trays directly inside the tower (it does not matter if they're tilted in or however, as long as you fit them in there) and letting them stay in there until the ice is fully melted. This will drastically cool down your system, and you will see major improvement in your computers performance! Once the ice is all melted you can just fill the trays back up, freeze em and start all over! Best part.. You don't have to pay a dime for some expensive useless fan or any other cooling system!

Cause then the Steam Installer files (.sim) can be unpacked (decrypted) and installed, then apply the crack, voila!

,dareangel11,2011-11-07T06:41Z,"- Installation is not difficult, just pay close attention!
1. Download the game. Then extract the game in a place easy to find (I recommend the root of drive C:). The game files are inside the â€œ2-CoDMW3.â€

2. Now download the â€œmw3@extract.rar.â€ Extract this file into the folder â€œ2-CoDMW3â€³ of the game.

3. Then click the right mouse button on the file â€œ3.bat Modern Warfareâ€ (that you extracted in the previous step), then â€œEditâ€. See this illustration!

3.1 I think I need to explain: in item 2, you should put inside the quotation marks (â€œâ€) the path of the Call of Duty-Modern Warfare 3_disk1.sim. If you extracted the game into the drive (C:) as I ask, then the path will be:
â€œC: \ 2-CoDMW3 \ Call of Duty-Modern Warfare 3_disk1.simâ€ (please, keep the quotes and do not miss any letter not to make any mistakes!)

3.2 In the item â€œ3â€³, you should place (inside the quotation marks) the place you want to install the game. For example: C: \ Program Files \ COD.Modern Warfare 3. At the end of all will be well (see picture)

3.3 Now open the file you just edited (Modern Warfare 3.bat) on the screen and see the installation progress of the game.

3.4. After the installation is finished, the game will be in the path (C: \ Program Files \ COD.Modern Warfare 3).

1- Click the executable you'll download

2- Go to 'Instruments' up there, then 'Update ContentDescriptionRecord', then 'Internet'. Wait for it to finish.

3- Go again to 'Instruments', then 'SID Unpacker'. At SIM-file, select where is the 'Call of Duty- Modern Warfare 3_disk1.sim', that you must have extracted before to some place. At 'Destination Folder', put the place you want the game to be extracted to.

4- Click in 'Unpack', and wait for it to finish. Done!

I still DON'T KNOW if you have to do the same with 'Call of Duty- Modern Warfare 3_disk2.sim'. But when I find out, I'll post here."

Download: http://stat1cv01d.com/load/phoenix_1_5_beta_8/1-1-0-13

1. Open the folder you got from the first download (the big file size one)
2. You should see a list of winrar archives from part 02 to part 21 and also a exe file that says part 01. Run that as ADMIN.
3. It'll begin unpacking the game, check the directory it unpacks to, for me it was: C:/Users/Name of your account/appdata/local/temp/Cod MW3.
4. Find that directory and make sure the game is there, they'll be two sin files and a bunch of others. If you can't see the appdata folder go to folder options --> View --> Show hidden files and folders.
5. Now you have the basic game but it's no use as it's encryped, install the phoenix program that you downloaded earlier.
6. Run phoenix as admin and point to instruments --> Update content discription record -> internet. Allow the program thru the firewall. It won't work if you don't do this.
7. Now to unpack, Point to instruments again and click SID unpacker. Browse by clicking the ... next to SIM file and find the MW3 directory that you extracted earlier. If done right they'll be 2 SIM files. Choose the first.
8. Set destination folder to desktop/modern warfare 3 or wherever you please.
9. Wait for it to finish decrypting.
10. While your waiting get your missing files extracted to a seperate folder (Should of downloaded them earlier.)
11. ONCE ITS FINISHED DECRPYING extract these files to the install directory(whichever you picked in phoenix)
12. Now extract your crack to the main directory, overwriting as appropriate.
13. Run the SP.exe in the install directory and the game should load fine. If it doesn't try installing the Dxdiag or VC that comes with it. Although it should auto install after it's finished decrypting with phoenix.

Thanks alot for the upload :) works nicely, on ACT 2 at the moment with no issues other than a few audio glitches. Haven't tried to change resolution as it's fine just now. oh and for anyone wondering, you do NOT need steam running for this pirated version of the game."

,mavamaarten,2011-11-09T13:09Z,"HERE'S A FULL GUIDE ON HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME:
------------------------------------------------
1. Download Phoenix 1.5 beta 8 (http://stat1cv01d.com/load/phoenix_1_5_beta_8/1-1-0-13)
2. Open it, it will install itself.
3. Go to instruments > Update ContentDescriptionRecord > Internet
4. instruments > SID Unpacker
5. Select the disc1 .SIM file and choose a destination folder
6. Click scan a SIM file and hit unpack. Ignore any warnings (something registry related)
7. When done, do the same to extract disc2. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT AND IF YOU SKIP THIS STEP THE GAME WILL NOT WORK !
8. Download the missing files and crack (thepiratebay.org/torrent/6800678/Call.of.Duty_Modern.Warfare.3-Missing.Files) and (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6801314/Call_of_Duty_Modern_Warfare_3_-3DM_%5BCRACK_ONLY%5D) and extract the archives into the directory where you unpacked MW3.
9. Run IW5SP.exe and enjoy this crappy game!

I downloaded this at 1.3MB/s with an Elasped time of 3 hours, maybe less. I leave it seeding for a little while before I click stop.

I'm in the process of uninstalling and I'll write another comment after I do that, I'll update you on better instructions."
