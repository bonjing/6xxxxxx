Chef Ramsay visits The Greek at the Harbor, an eatery in Ventura Harbor, California and observes poor service and variable food quality. 

This episode did not air in the U.S. on October 28, 2011 as scheduled, due to the rescheduled World Series game 7. However it aired on a Canadian channel on October 26, which was the source for this capture. While this was an analog capture from a non-HD channel, the quality is good.
