However, 0/0 (yes, ZERO) seeds currently available.  Even the poster has not uploaded the file yet.

Is there any possibility that apricot90 can actually upload the file for us???

Many thanks in advance."
,apricot90,2011-11-03T22:55Z,sincere apologies to all. I have re-uploaded the tutorial again.
,cyberkeg,2011-11-24T04:03Z,"Unfortunately this never got uploaded.  :-(

I saw 60-80 persons waiting at numerous times ....
so a huge amount of interest as this looks like a
really great resource that most of us can not afford.

If the apricot90 could possibly determine what 
happened and why it did not get uploaded, I for
one would really appreciate it, and I am sure that
MANY others would as well.

Thanks in advance for fixing this if you you
happen to read these comments."
