Living a Zombie Dream (1996) in XVID [.avi] @ 705 mbs! (Use CD Overburn)

A bitter bit of brotherly payback goes horribly awry in director Todd Reynolds' blood-soaked tale of sibling rivalry, family betrayal, and flesh eating zombies. A young man has discovered that his brother has been moving in on his girlfriend, and in order to get revenge he strands his sibling in the part of town where no sane man would venture after dark. Trouble soon arises in the form of a cannibalistic corpse, whose unexpected intrusion into the mix leads to deadly consequences for all involved.
