how to use.....


configure the usb flash drive through the xbox 360
copy over a gamesave to the flash drive example: modern warfare 2

once its finished copying over plug the usb flashdrive into ur pc

open up usbxtafgui.exe

*NOTE* if u move the usbxtafgui.exe file make sure to move the .dll file in the same place otherwise it wont work.

click file open device and it will open the usb flash drive

with files from the 360 u will see a file called content just double click on that and the next file and the next one until you see your gamesave.

right click on the gamesave and click extract this pick a place to extract it to.

*NOTE* be sure to do this twice but put the second one in a folder as backup case u corrupt the the one your going to mod.

once done minimise usbxtaf.

once opend drag the game save file into modio and it will open up a wee window 

on the bottem it will say mod file click that and apply witch ever mods you want.


once finished click save then rehash and resign

once done go back to usbxtaf right click on the save thats in ther *make sure u have backed it up i wont be held responsible if u loose your game save/progress*
delete the save allready on ur device then right click again and click inject or just drag the modded save into the box once done close usbxtaf plug it into the xbox and have fun.
