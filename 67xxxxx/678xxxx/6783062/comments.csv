            Whenever a water source is surrounded on all sides by blocks or water (not necessarily source blocks) and it has an air block or (non source) water block below, then that air/water block turns into a water source.

The behaviour seems to be carefully chosen such that it cannot automatically flood entire cav"

Thanks, maybe you will next time type my nick properly :D"
,Jayzen_Freeze,2011-10-30T15:41Z,THIS SUCKS IT HAS THE WORDS BACK ON THE SCREEN IN GAME 1.9.4 FINALLY REMOVED IT. I don't need to constantly know what version it is.
,AzDeRi,2011-10-30T16:07Z,"@Jayzen_Freeze

Shows 1.9 Pre 5 for me. Installed using my own installer."
,LiinerZz,2011-10-30T18:45Z,"Hey I cant seem to get this to work, I open the folder and click install.bat, it puts minecraft on the desktop. I click on minecraft and it brings up the custom nickname loader. When I type in a nickname and click start, it doesnt start the game, it just keeps opening the custom name loader, and it never opens the game.

Im using windows xp if that helps."
,AzDeRi,2011-10-30T23:02Z,"@LiinerZz

Try to follow these instructions:

1. Go to appdata by typing %appdata%\ into run window
2. Go inside "".minecraft"" folder
3. Delete everything exept the saves folder
4. Extract file included in this torrent
5. Run install.bat"
,McCore24,2011-10-30T23:15Z,"Quick, probably stupid, question....Do you have to already own minecraft for this to work or does this work on its own without you having minecraft installed?"
,LiinerZz,2011-10-30T23:38Z,"@AzDeRi

Thank you, everything is working great.

@McCore24

If you are wondering whether or not you need to purchase minecraft, you do not. Just follow the instructions given and everything will work fine, if you can't seem to get it to work, ask AzDeRi."
,AzDeRi,2011-10-31T19:52Z,"@McCore24

Everything is inculded to play."
,AzDeRi,2011-11-01T17:30Z,"@CrackThatGame

Thank you for the video. The installer didn't work?"
,BadassPhilip,2011-11-02T01:16Z,Dude when i play it just like lags all the time and then after some time it appears that message?Java(TM) Platformer SE stoped working...or something do you know what it is?
,AzDeRi,2011-11-02T09:48Z,"@BadassPhilip

Obviously, nothing is wrong with the torrent. Uninstall java and install correct version depending on version of windows you have (32/64 bit)."
,BadassPhilip,2011-11-02T16:35Z,yeah i have 64 but I tried to uninstall and reinstall but didn`t worked either
,BadassPhilip,2011-11-02T16:47Z,and sometimes it appears saving chunks and then say that the java is not allocated and theres not memory or something how can i allocate it better
,BadassPhilip,2011-11-02T18:01Z,Ok I tried again and now it`s working perfectly but now i have another question can i play online?if so how becuse I tried the multiplayer option but it didn` worked thx for everything anyways
,KMLKT,2011-11-02T18:11Z,"Dumb questions but: Is it only creative mode, because survival doesn't seem to be working."
,AzDeRi,2011-11-02T19:30Z,"@KMLKT

Survival works for me, just change it when creating a world.

@BadassPhilip

1. Main menu >> Multiplayer >> Direct connect
2. Enter ip address
3. Connect

Works only for cracked servers with online-mode set to ""false"". There are some built in servers for testing. ""not whitelisted"" error means you are OK, connection refused means something is wrong."
,marko95su,2011-11-03T01:26Z,"i did how instructions say,but when i start icon on desktop,error saying : "" Can't find a necessary file within the Minecraft folder.couldn't find: C:\users\administrator\application Data\.minecraft\bin\minecraft.jar  "" pops   ,any had same problem ? how can i fix it ? :)"
,AzDeRi,2011-11-03T10:41Z,"@marko95su

1. Go to application data by typing %appdata%\ in run dialog.
2. Copy .minecraft folder included with this torrent to appdata folder
3. Start game from desktop"
,PenZon,2011-11-03T14:10Z,"Has the Radeon compatibility problem been solved in this release? The ""Bad video card drivers"" issue."
,AzDeRi,2011-11-03T16:14Z,"@PenZon

You can try, it's only 43mb ;)
But I am pretty sure there has not ever been such a problem, just update drivers and it should run well."
,sooryan,2011-11-05T09:57Z,"when i try opening nickname loader
i get an error msg saying
""The application failed to intialize properly(0xc0000135). Click OK to terminate the application.""
ive been getting the same msg ever since i formated my pc(nearly 2 weeks back) and when i open the game without the nickname loader i can play offline but it crashes when i try making a new world. no error is shown but a txt file i automatically generated in the .mincraft folder it reads""#
