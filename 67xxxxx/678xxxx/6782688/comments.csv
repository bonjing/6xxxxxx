RIPPERS NOTES
We stripped out English 2.0 and DC and extras from 2 and 3 to
keep the video untouched
We know that all the movies were released previously with NORDIC subs, but
we give all of you Horror fanatics the complete boxset. With untouched video.
And for all you nukers out there, nuke if you feel like it.. We like having
series in a boxset..
ENJOY!

,trrsxxx,2011-11-14T19:36Z,Halloween 1 (1978) is non-anamorphic = black borders around the whole picture. The video quality is also quite poor (grain and dust). I do not know if the others are similar.
