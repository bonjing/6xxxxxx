Note   Including booklet with interesting liner notes !
  
  Concert:   Definitely a good choice by the people of SA ! A good show throughout with Elvis being in high spirits and great voice. We have a very appealing setlist with highlights like  Tryin' To Get To You, How Great Thou Art, Mystery Train / Tiger Man or the lovely Just Pretend ! This Vegas season belongs to the best ever, so this disc is highly recommendable ! (Ciscoking)   
        
TCB!!
