,kevinheb,2012-03-08T18:46Z,"I'm having problems installing this on my jtag xbox, getting error ""Update not found"", has anyone managed to get it installed on their hard drive?"
,wildyracing,2012-04-17T10:59Z,"I am downloading right now, but I need to know something. I have both RDR and Undead Nightmare for my XBOX360 and play them from hard disk without problems. I need to know if this GOTY edition requires more advanced version of LT+ in order to run or if it requires the same version as original RDR? Also, does this GOTY edition requires newer dashboard update than original RDR+Undead nightmare? Thank you. Else, this game is most amazing in its genre - it surpasses GTA, Mafia, LA Noire and so and so by much. If this torrent is working, I would say God bless the uploader :)"
,wildyracing,2012-04-20T17:47Z,"Everything works perfectly. 100%. I played over 20 hours - the game is latest patched, all DLC included, new unseen content, hardcore regime, even the weapon auto-holster annoying is mostly fixed. Recommended! Big thanks to the uploader!"
