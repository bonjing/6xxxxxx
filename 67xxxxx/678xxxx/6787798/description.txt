\\\"It\\\'s strange how the death of one musical group can be exactly the sort of catalyst needed to spawn another. KOAN Sound are certainly a highly gifted example of this phenomenon. It was in 2008 that KOAN Sound emerged from the ashes of several other musical endeavours, fusing passion for electronic music with sheer musical intuition. Since then KOAN Sound have continued to develop, synthesising ever more complex and inspirational patterns. And with influences such as The Prodigy, Amon Tobin and Noisia, it\\\'s not hard to see why KOAN Sound productions are synonymous with dark gripping basslines; elegantly mastered and meticulously executed.

Support is nothing but exponential for KOAN Sound. The group\\\'s creative and above all original ethos has granted them well deserved credibility from producers, DJ and Music fans alike. These include the likes of Aphex Twin, Pendulum, Zane Lowe and Rusko. Armed with a creative diversity second to none, they have set themselves apart from their peers and continue to push music not restrained by tempo or genre, all connected by their trademark \\\'KOAN\\\' sound.\\\"
