These songs are just the same as found on songs dot pk but the website name(s) in Artist & Composer tags and file names are RIPPED OFF.

I've done it so it doesn't look bad when I put'em in ma phone and also to make it easier to play. I know I have NOT done a great deal.





Its my first time here on TPB. So tell me what do I need to add to the tags and anything else commented calmly would be appreciated. :-D
