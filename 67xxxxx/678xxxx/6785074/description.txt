When the G. W. Parke Curtis, a coal barge converted to transport and tow observation balloons, appeared during the American Civil War in November 1861 with General McClellan's Army of the Potomac, no one could possibly have foreseen just how important to the nation aircraft carriers would become, not just for the protection of the United States, but for the projection of American power around the globe.
This book looks at the amazing developments that have taken place to US navy flying since the dark days of Pearl Harbour and the struggle against Japan's Imperial Navy. Illustrated throughout with colour and B&W photographs.
