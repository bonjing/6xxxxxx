,majestika,2011-11-01T18:18Z,Thank you so much Bone for a quick release. I know a few people who have done this walk and said how amazing the trip was. So hope this movie does it justice.

In May, I started walking from St. Jean Pied de Port in France. I walked 900km in 31 days...

it changed my life completely and now I have a job where I will be taking young people on the walk next year. It truly is amazing!! I recommend it to everyone. 

It's just hit me, if I was a good citizen and didn't illegally download this movie, then I would not be where I am today... Karma must have made a mistake somewhere! :P"
