This beautifully photographed nature study follows the adventures of a young meerkat from the time he first emerges from his underground nest - through to the time he becomes a young adult taking responsibility for the care and feeding of other members of his extended family. Paul Newman's narration takes the form of a dramatic storyline that lends continuity to Kolo's adventures.  

Kolo is a young meerkat with a big sense of adventure. Deep in the hostile desert of the Kalahari, he and his family have created a home, but growing up is his greatest challenge of all. With danger lurking in every corner â€“ including ravenous lions, limited food, and poisonous snakes â€“ heâ€™ll find out how to adapt to his wild environment and thrive. Narrated by Paul Newman, The Meerkats is a beautifully filmed and inspiring look at how in a land of giants, these little creatures stand tall.
