                Frank Leaves Noreen.
                Rafe Spall returns to Channel 4 for a second,
                six-part series of the hit comedy sitcom. Pete
                Griffiths is a struggling young sports journalist.
                Although well meaning, Pete lacks the emotional
                maturity to deal with grown-up relationships. He
                wishes life had clearly defined rules, like sport.
                Pete is back with his ex-girlfriend, Chloe, and is
                desperate to make a good impression. Unfortunately,
                Pete's dad, Frank, turns up on his doorstep after
                deciding that he and Pete's mum should have a break
                from each other.
