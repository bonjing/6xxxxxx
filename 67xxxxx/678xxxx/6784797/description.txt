Night of the Hurricane is a three-part crossover event in the Animation Domination block on the Fox network with all three animated television series created by Seth MacFarlane: Family Guy, American Dad! and The Cleveland Show. The event depicts a storm which hits the towns of Stoolbend, Quahog and Langley Falls. It was originally scheduled to air May 1, but a series of tornadoes killing many people in the South prompted Fox to postpone the episodes for the following season. It has since aired October 2, 2011.
