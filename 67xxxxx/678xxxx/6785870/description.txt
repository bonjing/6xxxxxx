After a decade of performing their originals and evolving their sound at all the prestigious concerts, venues and festivals throughout India, Cassiniâ€™s Division has released their debut album â€˜Ringside Viewâ€™ with 10 songs, recorded, mixed and mastered by British executive producer Simon Henderson, under the Saregama-HMV label. Henderson, who has worked with the likes of Alan Parsons Project and Depeche Mode, says the album promises a truly international sound unique to the band: â€œI am excited at the huge potential of this band. Each song tells a very unique story, yet this is not a bunch of hippies making a concept album, these are a group of well educated, very well read, cool guys,â€ says Simon on his website.
