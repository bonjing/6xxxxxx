,SharinganKira,2011-10-29T13:10Z,Region free? this is not NTSC?...
,darklordz,2011-10-29T13:23Z,"Thank you, BOOBS! You rock!"
[V],boobsman,2011-10-29T16:12Z,"@ SharinganKira, the ZRY rip has been confirmed as region free."
,SonicVsDBZ,2011-10-30T01:28Z,Boobsman what do i do with the files please help
[V],boobsman,2011-10-30T02:02Z,"@ SonicVsDBZ, you need to have a flashed or modified console to play these games, google xbox360 flashing in your area to find a shop that offers the service. Once thats done you extract the files using winrar then burn to a dual layer dvd disc using imgburn or cloneCD."
,jcg007,2011-10-30T17:07Z,"This brings up an unreadable disc error if you dont use the IHAS drive or Verbatim discs recommended by CEVA.

I have wasted 3 AONE Ricoh JPN discs on my Sammy writer finding this out. BE WARNED"
[V],boobsman,2011-10-30T17:40Z,"@ jcg007, you should always use Verbatims, other cheaper discs just fail n your better off buying good discs rather than buying cheap n having to rebuy when they don't work."
,jcg007,2011-10-30T18:51Z,"@ Boobsman. Trying to be clever, I used the JPN's on your release of Forza 4 and it was fine. Just trying to use them up as I have 100+ left to use"
,steelllynx,2011-10-30T20:52Z,"""THIS IS AN XGD3 ISO AND IS ONLY BE PLAYABLE WITH LT2.0!!!""

""This firmware is =NOT FOR USE IN A CONSOLE= and is provided 
with the intended use of being in a dedicated ""ripping"" drive.""

To me it seems these two statements are conflicting.  Hopefully I can figure this out and post my results in plain English so nobody else has to go through this confusion.

By the way, I've always used Memorex discs without problems.

this game is region free or not!?

pls help thanks

and your other all xbox 360 game torrent works fine"
[V],boobsman,2011-10-30T22:30Z,"@ steelllynx, your getting your firmware mixed up. You need to have LT+2.0 firmware in your dvd drive to be able to play the latest XGD3 games, there is also firmware available for ripping XGD3 games and is not for playing backups."
[V],boobsman,2011-10-30T22:32Z,"@ bulakli, there is revised nfo as the original was wrong, this game is region free.

[V],boobsman,2011-10-31T10:24Z,"@ asianluffy, this is 100% real!!! most xbox360 games become available 2 / 3 weeks before there released in the shops, check my releases all i do is xbox games."
,mrnexus,2011-11-01T21:54Z,"@asianluffy,that's the funniest thing ive heard in a while,look dude as boobsman said games usually get leaked 2/3 weeks before release,modern warfare 3 which does'nt get released until the 8th-nov is up here already but only on pc at the moment,use ur head m8 do u think they can protect every copy being shipped around the world and within there own compants,NO they can't."

,steelllynx,2011-11-03T00:08Z,"I flashed my iHas324-98B but get verification failure at around 49%.  ImgBurn says the media is big enough so I don't understand what the problem is.

,KingKool,2011-11-28T23:39Z,"C4E released the iXtreme LT+ v2.0 CFW for all versions of the Hitachi-LG GDR-3120L drive (â€˜PHAT Hitachiâ€™):

C4Eâ€™s iXtreme LT+ in association with Team Jungle & Team Xecuter

Official release of the iXtreme LT+ v2.0 for Hitachi drives
- Support for XGD3 ixtreme backups using LT-MAX for maximum capacity on standard DVD+R DL discs.
- Support for large capacity DVD+R DL media (no errors when burning)

About upcoming iXtreme LT+ 3.0 â€“ released after December 6th
Originals will need to be analysed by XBC to gain disc topology data. This data replaces the need for ap25/dae.bin data and enables any ap25 challenge to be answered correctly. The topology data method is very efficient using only 24k and is very accurate. Each title will need its own topology data as there are differences between titles, even xgd3 titles and backups can be detected if the same topology data is used between titles.
Backups will remain the same layout but will need the new topology data inserted by the new abgx or re-dumped with the new XBC for xgd2/ap25 or xgd3 titles.
Non ap25 titles will remain unchanged

Thanks go to Team Jungle for their hard work and efforts in the development process.
Thanks also go to Team Xecuter for their support to this project."
,spanker10,2011-12-16T17:22Z,Has anyone with a PAL console tried this? Is it actually region free or NTSC?
,spanker10,2012-01-22T09:20Z,"Just downloaded and run throught ABGX360 and it is actually region free even tho the torrent title says USA, Cheers Boobsman"
,KnugenV,2012-01-22T20:10Z,"Not working on PAL XBOX with LT3.0.  Game graphics visible in Dashboard but when loading it stops with an error ""Disk not supported"". Think its NTSC locked as written in the included NFO file. Disc Verbatim burned with Imgburn 2x, calculate optimal and truncate."
[T],razalgul1979,2012-02-09T19:42Z,"This game works  truncate with dash  14,699 and LT +3.0  I burned just to test while waiting for my burner max, however it may happen sporadic freezes or message  impossible to read the disc even burned in verbatim.
