[[[Lights - Discography (2011)]]]

--- Uploaded to The Pirate Bay by uRabbit ---


I have yet to find a discography for Lights, so I thought it'd be a good idea to put one together. I have done most everything by hand (finding best qualities, artwork, etc.). Hope you guys and gals appreciate it! 
Not all are in Lossless format, so I apologize for that. 
I have included three tracks that are not included on any Lights albums. They are found in the 'Lights - Misc' album. 

Remember to seed! And, if you like it, don't forget to support the artist!
