Arriving as it did in 1990, before nostalgia for '70s dance music turned from irony to genuine appreciation, Lisa Stansfield's Affection was ahead of its time. Featuring up-to-date clubland rhythms percolating under sweeping string arrangements a la Barry White and classic Philly soul, Stansfield's music struck the perfect balance between looking forward and looking back. "All Around the World" was justifiably the album's smash hit, but more than a few of the other tracks - "This Is the Right Time," "Live Together," and "Poison" among them - are its equal. And it's easy to get lost in Stansfield's supple, soulful voice, which leads the way in making Affection a far more memorable affair than the usual dance trifle.
