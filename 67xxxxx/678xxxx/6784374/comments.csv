Always remember to seed people! Don't be selfish!"
,sonozx,2011-10-31T04:59Z,it's legit indeed .
,aParadox,2011-10-31T05:03Z,"You're saying this when it hasn't even been up for an hour.
Okay, cool. Gonna complain about the slow speed now?

"
,dexterups,2011-10-31T05:26Z,"I've been looking for this on so many torrent sites and haven't found a legit one until now. 

Much thanks."

Seed Please!!"
,emighetto123,2011-10-31T05:36Z,I can never understand why some people are so selfish. So many finish the download and refuse to seed. Some of ya'll make me sick!
,JKincaid,2011-10-31T05:36Z,"Are you talking to me aParadox? I don't see anything wrong with what I posted and I never complained about anything. It was just a friendly reminder for everyone to seed after they were finished downloading.

Anyways, all looks well, quality is great + legit copy. Thanks uploader!"
,jaxflxeon,2011-10-31T05:42Z,"Not to sound ungrateful but... mkv? really? Sharing is caring people, dont bitch about slow speeds when you close out as soon as the download is done. "
,Jack_Pack,2011-10-31T05:45Z,"OMGSTFUBBQ!......so slow, there, I said it."

,rebdel1234,2011-10-31T06:25Z,This is broken. I keep getting skips in the video with a lot of grayed out screens. It will not play in any other media player other than VLC.

,LaVicky88,2011-10-31T07:03Z,"Been DL for over 4 hours, got to 20% done, wtf is wrong with you disgusting people that just DL and then skip out? Assholes..."
,justoned420,2011-10-31T07:56Z,No LOL or ASAP 550MB copies?  Either 200MB or 1.2GB - guess I'll get the big one.
,meuslix,2011-10-31T08:13Z,"mkv files always suck for me. and i use vlc for everything. i much prefer the 350 avis that eztv usually has early, but not this week apparently."
,logan-xart,2011-10-31T08:26Z,"...mkv is shit...good way to fuck up a decent show...

...how about a 500 mb version next time dickhead..."
,mpascoewow,2011-10-31T10:52Z,"logan-xart.

,cl81,2011-10-31T12:24Z,"What is an MKV file??
