,sell-out,2011-10-29T08:51Z,"wait for a known uploader like eztv,this slumdog just re-uploads others torrents and puts his name to them"
,cptnahab,2011-10-29T09:12Z,"I'm a bit impatient sometimes, and this downloaded pretty fast, and came up clean on the scans I ran on it."
[V],SaM,2011-10-29T15:10Z,account is real and safe.
[V],catflap,2011-10-30T02:56Z,"you and others clearly have no clue how this works.

eztv, vtv and others put their own names on other
groups' files. eztv, vtv, etc. DO NOT release their
own files. they grab scene releases directly from the
scene groups via newsgroups AND THEN THEY PUT
THEIR OWN TAGS ON THEM.

so if ettv wants to do the same, that's not any
different than what eztv, vtv, etc. do."
,cptnahab,2011-10-30T09:28Z,"ettv and scenebalance were the first to up this on here, and the lack of rar'ing is appreciated.  Ettv appears to be a new legit group, so more power to them and thanks.

I do still think the name is too similar to eztv, though, and something more unique would've been better.  There have been many that have tried to pass themselves off as eztv with virus laden shit (though they get dropped fast enough), and that understandably makes one suspicious."
