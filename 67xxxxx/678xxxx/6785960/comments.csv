This is cropped though, obscuring all of the on-screen blurb and subs.

Still well worth a watch."

,5amjr,2011-11-03T01:33Z,"Like most spy movies names, places, dates text along the bottom keeping the viewer following the story but as this is cropped i felt a bit lost as the text couldn't be read and didn't know which country past or present it was.
Very good picture though bone!"
