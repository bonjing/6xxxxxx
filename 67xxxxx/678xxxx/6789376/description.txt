Pee-Wee's Playhouse Christmas Special - Commercial Bumpers Easter Egg
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an Easter Egg on the Pee-Wee's Playhouse Christmas Special DVD.  In the original airing of the holiday special, in the middle of the commercial breaks, these are the bumpers they used.  Bumpers are the things that say "We'll be back after these message", or similar.

If you're adventurous, you might want to download my other torrent of the special, and edit them in during the "fade-to-black" transitions where a commercial used to be.  Or you just might like to have it for collective purposes.
