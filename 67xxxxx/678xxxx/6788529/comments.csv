,namco-nexgen,2011-11-02T13:14Z,"People *really* need to read. 99.99% of the time, required information is in the readme or in the description files - easy. Even easier than downloading."
,tamer008,2011-11-02T16:58Z,"Has the SP1 for NGX been cracked, if not pls put the crack on pirate bay. Ngx 600/700 will not run without sp1."

,raspia,2011-11-03T19:13Z,"Works perfectly, these are the steps ONLY FOR THOSE HAVING 800-900 ALREADY INSTALLED:

-FIRST: Install SP1 Package to update the 800-900 version

-SECOND: Install 600-700 Package

-THIRD: Apply the Patch.

Done!

So easy, tested and flying fine."
