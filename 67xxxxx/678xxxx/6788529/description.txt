The PMDG 737-600/700 NGX

The PMDG 737NGX family grows!

PMDG is proud to offer the 600 and 700 variants as an addon to our award winning PMDG 737NGX 800/900 base package.

The package includes the 600, 700 and 700WL (winglet) variants along with all the cockpit, engine, sound, flight model and performance differences they bring compared to their longer 800 and 900 siblings. The 600 and 700 are the perfect complement to the 800 and 900 for all your shorter lower-density routes.

A compliment of free liveries is available on our downloads page as always â€“ you can even fly one the famous and secretive â€œJanetâ€ 737-600 shuttles into Area 51!

Features Include

Flight Model - Engine and flight modeling that is within 5% of the actual Boeing aircraft performance charts, including single-engine operations..
3D Models - Exterior and virtual cockpit models textures created from the actual Boeing engineering diagrams and thousands of photos taken onboard the real aircraft. We have used our vast experience in FSX development to create models and textures that are extremely high quality while still maintaining good system performance.
Sounds - An uncompromisingly realistic soundset. Every aspect of the 737NGâ€™s CFM56-7B engines is represented here, exactly pitch matched to real life recordings made at every 10% over the engineâ€™s power range. Over 500 individual sounds exist in the product, all recorded with professional audio equipment in the real cockpit. Every switch and lever is unique and there is a separate â€œpassenger viewâ€ sound set that is called up in the wing views and features sounds such as the flap motors and hydraulic pumps.
User Interface - Weâ€™ve spared no effort in making the PMDG 737NGX easy to use in terms of its user interface. The aircraftâ€™s fuel, payload and more than 75 airframe and cockpit options are adjustable on the fly without ever touching the FSX menus or pausing the sim.
HUGS - The first optically collimated Head-up Guidance System (HGS) ever built in an MSFS airliner addon. You can move your head position realistically and the conformal HGS symbology maintains its orientation to the world outside, projected at infinity.
Exterior Lighting - 3D volumetric exterior lighting that lights up the FS scenery. You can even see the flash from the strobe lights when looking out the cockpit side windows.
Liveries - Free downloadable liveries for numerous world airlines, easily installable using our new PMDG Livery Manager app.
