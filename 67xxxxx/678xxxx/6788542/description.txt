It was announced just a crazy contest winner, who receives a good jackpot, or rather one hundred seventy-five and a half thousand dollars. Chris Sanders and Quincy take part in this competition, because the money is not small, and they both want to be winners, but it does not happen, there is only one winner, and this game turns into a fight and podlyanki, but at one point they all are not as they had planned ...
