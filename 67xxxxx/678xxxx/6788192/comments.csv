[T],trialNerror,2011-11-01T22:41Z,"Thank you CRiMSON for your GHL release and thank you scenebalance for making it a torrent.

Just a heads-up:  I will releasing my own 720p version of this in a few hours if anybody wants to go for that."
,d1338,2011-11-02T00:53Z,CD2 .r05  zero kb ? 
,Clockbot,2011-11-02T01:41Z,CD2 errors out... it's broken.
[V],psspss,2011-11-02T02:03Z,"to save the panic I chipped in with the missing damaged rar file.. this is why people have rars LOL

can get it here.. so keep seeding this and mine to complete the set if can.. thankyou

[V],psspss,2011-11-02T04:31Z,why did they add a stupid hissing sound when names appear at the bottom.. geeh I was wondering what the fuk was that didnt they hear it LOL
[V],psspss,2011-11-02T05:42Z,why are all the taps promos for old episodes LOL crazy
[T],trialNerror,2011-11-02T08:32Z,"Seeing how it's near the end of the season, only 4 eps left, those are recaps and not promos.

This torrent is apparently defective with a corrupt rar part in CD2.  Figures.  I hate rar downloads.

If you don't mind downloading 1.27 GB more, I released the 720p version of this GH Live event.  Single file PS3 & X360 ready MP4. Not to toot my own horn, but it looks SO much better.  Don't know about you folks but I like being able to see detail rather than fuzz."
,Heyseus2,2011-11-02T08:42Z,Thank you kindly. 
[V],psspss,2011-11-02T09:29Z,"the confirmed patch I did works though and now theres 93 seeders for the,.. so you get it heaps faster now then any new stuff though :)

only one of the taps ads feature one new episode i didnt see it as recaps.. didnt they say up and coming shows..

cant wait for destination truth.. its always a laugh
more entertaining then taps"
,Steampunk.Princess,2011-11-02T10:14Z," Shame about missing/damaged rar file on CD2, otherwise good quality etc. for CDs 1 & 3.

Have now downloaded fixed version of CD2 from 'psspss'. Thx 4 that, saved d/loading whole thing all over again from another source."
[T],trialNerror,2011-11-02T10:47Z,"One thing I've learned about torrents over the years - it could have 10,000 seeds and yet you will still only get a trickle of a download.

It's quality of connection more than quantity of connections that matters.

I'm uploading at almost 1mB/s at peak speed (avg 550-600kB/s steady) so if you are able to get a connection with me it will be pretty damn quick downloads.  And if you're able to maintain that connection you'll get a complete download from me in no time at all.

I'm gonna promote my 720p release til I'm blue in the face.  Most people have X360 or PS3 to play it on.  Most people have a newer PC to watch it on.  This is 2011, XviD's are so 1990 lol

There's plenty of peers total for that 720p now, literally hundreds, but again it all comes down to quality of connections not quantity.

C'mon folks, only 1.27 GB more to download for a very nice HQ version of this rather good GH Live Halloween Event.  

Doo eet!  lol You know you wanna.  Single file.  PS3 & X360 ready. Go x264! Go AC3! Go 720p!

Looking at the list of current peers and their d/l rates for the 720p they're all in the 100's on up to nearly 800 kB/s.  The new 720p release will NOT be slow!  Get it now people!  I'll make it easier for ya.  Here's the link for the torrent.

So how's my advertising?  Good? Ok? Sucks? lol

[V],psspss,2011-11-02T11:40Z,"geeh he is plugging it hard

i think if you want to collect only 720p shows you fill
a 2tb drive pretty quick.. i already have 22tb
and hate to think if they werent xvids how many drives one would need.. maybe when they bring out very cheap interest costs and more data and huge hard drives

plus not all of us have dual core of higher to play these large mkvs

xvids will do me just fine
when you look at download stats theres 90
percent seeding xvifs and 10 percent seeding 720p
or worse none.. they dont seed large files endlessly"
[V],psspss,2011-11-02T11:43Z,opps mean internet costs lol and xvid not xvif :)
[T],trialNerror,2011-11-02T14:28Z,"lol I'll plug it like a broken toilet if I have to!

That's what blank DVD's are for.  100 blanks for only $20!  That's about 4TB of data; $5 per TB; best way to go.

I know not everyone will have updated systems or PS3 / X360, but many do, and there are 400 people so far wanting that 720p with a couple dozen seeders to help give it to them; including myself which will continue seeding for at least another few hours.

Personally I like being able to read the fine print on a video rather than having a blurry line. For instance I bet you can't read what is beneath the Ghost Hunters logo in the top left of this XviD.  You can barely make out the Halloween Live, but below that, what does it read?  Pretty much just a fuzzy blur, huh?  With the 720p it's clearly visible.  Besides, at only 3.3GB for 04:14:44 of video, that's damn good. I was expecting it to be around 5GB or more.

Get it! Got it? Good!"
[V],psspss,2011-11-02T22:09Z,"if I had it all on dvd-r's i wouldnt be able to get in my house

cant beat hard drive for quick and easy storage
and queue any series up over lan to watch

way of the future

one day 20tb will be on a small chip
one wears on a watch and
magent drives long dead

how they die in 3 years even when
no using them.. powered off

they crap tech now days
and they arent cheap

they holding back on the new tech
to recover costs on the r&d on
old tech

but they could make 30tb drives if
the wanted too with optic magneto
using lasers and finer magnetics

and yeh I dont need to read fine print
or want to try
happy with smaller xvids
unlike rmb its a free open
source format and never die
like mp3..

all these large formats
flac and what not arent for me

keep it simple"
