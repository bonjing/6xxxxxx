Doctor Who - 9th Doctor - Christopher Eccleston (2005) - Complete

In 2005, the BBC relaunched Doctor Who after a 16-year absence from episodic television, with Russell T Davies, Julie Gardner and Mal Young as executive producers, Phil Collinson as producer, and Christopher Eccleston taking the lead role of the Ninth Doctor.

The revival adheres to the original continuity. The new series is formatted to a 16:9 widescreen display ratio, and a standard episode length of 45 minutes. For the first time since the 1965â€“66 seasons, each episode has an individual title even though some stories span more than one episode. The show also returned to its traditional Saturday evening slot.
