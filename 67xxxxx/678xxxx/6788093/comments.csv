,Zebbaluzza,2011-11-02T09:19Z,Thank you so much for making all these episodes available! I've been downloading from you & msfenmore since August :) I have a question though. Is there any way you could make all of the older episodes prior to August 5 2011 available for download again? As far back as possible if it isn't too much trouble. On the weekends or something when you're not busy uploading current episodes :)

,Zebbaluzza,2011-11-03T01:50Z,"Thank you very much :) From the earliest episode you have available would be great, but don't make it a priority. It has to be enough trouble getting all the current soap episodes up. Just whenever you have the time. Thank you"
,Zebbaluzza,2011-11-03T01:55Z,"Just the Bold and the Beautiful though, not any of the other soaps"
[V],ClaudiaZ,2011-11-03T20:09Z,"Let me see, I'll begin from May 2011 onwards next weekend, is that fine for you?"
,Zebbaluzza,2011-11-04T07:19Z,Sounds good. Thank you again for doing this!
