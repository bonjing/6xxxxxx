Every day your Windows will create a large  number
of temporary files and junk files, and leave  them
behind  on your  computer. Over  time these  files
take up more and more of your disk space and  slow
down your  PC. The  Windows built-in  disk cleanup
tool can remove some useless flotsam, but fail  to
clean  the  major  temporary  files.  WinASO  Disk
Cleaner can quickly detect  and wipe away all  the
junk files on your computer. It immediately  frees
up huge valuable disk space and boosts your system
speed  while  never  affecting  systemâ”¬Ã­s   normal
running process.
