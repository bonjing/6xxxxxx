,wintendo,2011-11-02T17:41Z,"thanks for the upload.

however the crack is not 100%
you can play the game but after a while some sort of fade protection will kick inn and make the screen blurry or completly white so it's just about imposible to play the game.

i'm sure there will be a propper crack at some point :)"
,Yourrid,2011-11-02T17:59Z,Downloading at 0.6kb.... thanks a lot seeders :(

,DeadEye74,2011-11-02T21:03Z,"ty for the up, can't recommend this game though its a mess, still using that wanker of an un-optimised piece of shit engine....i pray Bohemia won't screw up Carrier Command like this..."
,DLLimport,2011-11-02T22:01Z,"STOP WASTING YOUR TIME DOWNLOADING

The game is protected by FADE, meaning the game slowly degrades over time until it reaches a point where it is unplayable (about an hour in)

It starts off slightly blurry, then very blurry, then slight ripples in the screen, then huge ripples in the screen and you can barely make out the shape of the helicopter."
,DragonF.C.Porto,2011-11-02T23:37Z,thanks
,rra137,2011-11-02T23:55Z,"I am used to FSX, the helicopters there are not as well modelled as the planes but they are much better than Take on Helicopter.
My personal rating:
Gameplay : 3/10
sound : 4/10
video : 4/10
flight model : 3/10"
,becauseican21,2011-11-03T01:58Z,another shit game. graphics are shit even with sliders on full... thanks for the upload extremezone glad i tryed before  buying it.. won't be now...
,bobrownik,2011-11-03T06:49Z,"graphics = horrible, the cockpit feels like its a 2d game from 1995, 
performance = pretty bad considering there is almost nothing to draw
the crack works but it doesn't disable the FADE shit or whatever it is"
,tonyblackops,2011-11-03T14:06Z,"@rra137 
You're giving it too much
My rating:
Gameplay : 0/10
sound : -5/10
video : -10000/10
flight model : 0/10

I deleted the damn game after 2 minutes of installing it"
,DLLimport,2011-11-03T18:34Z,The reason the game looks bad is because it defaults to a very low 3d resolution.
,wintendo,2011-11-03T19:30Z,"seems like some people have the wrong settings setup.

This game looks a lot better then fsx. Better models on helicopters and terrain/structures.

google some images from the game or something."
,Yourrid,2011-11-03T19:55Z,"Does anyone have a crack that will get rid of this FADE crap?

I used the crack that came with it, but it still wants to go blurry on me"
,JamesChalpkin,2011-11-03T23:05Z,"I swear if this crack don't work... the shit will hit the diamond bladed fan that spins at 100,000,000RPM"
,Yourrid,2011-11-04T05:49Z,"Shit works for about an hour... then the crack goes nuts and the screen goes blurry.. thanks to FADE.

WE NEED A FULL CRACK NOT SOME BS WORK-AROUND"
,YominCarr195,2011-11-04T18:56Z,"GAME AND CRACK WORK FINE FOR ME.

However, is anyone else having trouble with their mouse cursor?"
,krazyivan,2011-11-05T01:39Z,Has there ever been a crack for any FADE-protected game?
,mb1453,2011-11-05T02:38Z,"I'm getting sonething weird and was wondering if it was copy protection:
I'm in the training mission to land a helicopter, it says to take as long as I need, but then another helicopter arrives and shoot me down.  In the flight training mission?  Anybody else run into this?"
[V],.Dude.,2011-11-05T05:47Z,"NFOfix:

  We missed a protection check in the game, which causes the game to stop
  functioning properly after playing for some time. You either need to 
  (re)install the game and use our new serial (see below), or modify the 
  windows registry as follows.

  For 64bit Windows:
  ------------------
  Modify

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Bohemia Interactive Studio\
  Take On Helicopters\KEY 

  to the following value:
  87 0C 3E 49 BF 21 06 31 8C 62 29 4A 52 90 C2

  For other Windows versions:
  ---------------------------
  Modify

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Bohemia Interactive Studio\Take On Helicopters\KEY

  to the following value:
  87 0C 3E 49 BF 21 06 31 8C 62 29 4A 52 90 C2

Installation:
  1. Install the game. 
  2. When asked for a serial use:
     ZDJW-36WG2-33333-44264-55555
  3. Play the game."
,Fipspilot,2011-11-06T10:41Z,"I have a big problem! When i fly, after few minutes it´s begin blurred! Can some one tell me, what is that?

‎1. While the flight comes the Screen with the Bohemia Interactive/Take On Helicopter-Logo (The same as when you start the game), and after that it become blurred.﻿ But the game don´t crash."
,berzerk2,2011-11-06T17:49Z,"The download is very slow, seed plz ?"
,Tiger_Zip,2011-11-08T05:21Z,Can somone explain how this can be fun to play?
,MorphzreaZ,2011-11-10T16:21Z,u u ppl call this a ''game'' ? 
,Maurox,2011-11-12T00:53Z,"That's right, people.
Someone FINALLY releases something that at least looks like an actual flight simulator (haven't played it yet), and you bring it down, kick it and then hit it with a spade, because you're not familiar with the concept of ""having fun"" while NOT blowing shit up.

Yeah, I can see a new real flightsim coming out pretty soon.
And yes, I am sour after the piece of crap called ""Jane's Advanced Strike Fighters"" that doesn't recognize a f-g joystick."
,Pirat47,2011-11-12T19:56Z,"@.Dude. Thnx! It helped! 

Game works fine after changing the key, but it has so many drawbacks that make flight no fun at all."
,falkon193,2011-11-15T19:54Z,"I installed the game and then try to fill the serial key. I now get the message ""The SERIAL was not found in the database. Most likely the SERIAL Has Been Entered incorrectly.""

I have two serial key are used.
What can I do to the game work?"
,lobo345,2011-11-20T16:13Z,FADE kicked in. Had to buy the game but it's actually worth it.
,TamagotchiKiller,2011-11-25T10:30Z,"How to burn this ISO?
I don't have space on my HDD and
this file is too big."
,bungunner,2011-11-28T02:50Z,"You know, I've been messing around with this game a little bit and at first I was thinking that this is junk.  The way it played and looked just sucked compared to FSX and some good add ons.  So then I started messing with the settings and found that I didn't have to turn everything up.  When I selected normal for everything the game feels and looks pretty good.  I'm on a hex core 3.8ghz GTX560ti 8GB ram.  Whenever I turned graphics up higher it would start to lag. but now it is pretty smooth"
,rhys2225,2011-12-13T09:11Z,it doesn't even work wtf i wasted 13.6GB

,Th3G0st,2011-12-30T17:07Z,I think the crack might not be working because in the first mission after a few minutes the helicopter just stops and i loose all control. I have tried sevral times so i know its not something i do wrong. Also it looks like a helicopter come just before that and it looks like it shoots me down.
