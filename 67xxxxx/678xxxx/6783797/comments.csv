Are the games left in a state where I can still burn the game to a disc and play it in my modded PS1 or PS2? I don't use my computers for games at all, and I think the emulators leave much to be desired. Thanks in advance : )"
[T],TaurusKJ,2011-11-03T06:55Z,"Ok, I downed one of the games and I answered my own question.  I was able to un7zip it, double clicked on the bin file, Nero opened and burnt it to disc at 4x speed, and all worked fine! Thanks for quality work, dude. Giving you a plus up! : )"
