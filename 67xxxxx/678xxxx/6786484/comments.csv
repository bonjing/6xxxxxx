Thanks for the updates.
I am installing the game right now, but I was wondering why it is so hard to find the patches? Can they be downloaded from games for windows live or something?
And what about this ""2012"" patch I keep hearing about, I can't find it anywhere."
,ReaperX24,2012-05-07T07:02Z,2012 patch is patch 1
,ReaperX24,2012-05-07T12:28Z,"Also, I just installed the updates in order and the game is working normally, without the need of a crack. This torrent is legit.

I'm using the SKIDROW release, but without the crack. "
