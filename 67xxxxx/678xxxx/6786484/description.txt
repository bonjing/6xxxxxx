Patch 1
- Support for keyboards and gaming devices that were not being recognized by the game
- Patch allowing re-mapped keys
- Changes Fixed Mode as the default graphic setting
- DRM removed for non-Steam versions of the game
- NVIDIA 3D Vision enhancements

Patch 2
- As requested by users, we\'ve added support for the following render resolutions:

   640x480
   720x480
   720x576
   1280x1024

- Support added for a wider range of arcade sticks
Many  arcade sticks that previously would not be recognized should now be  recognized (again, no guarantees your exact stick/pad is covered but  there\'s a lot more natively supported than before).

- Fixed a bug that caused just the stick inputs (left / right / up / down) to not be recognized

- Fixed a bug that could sometimes cause extra lag/slowdowns in Endless Battle mode

- Fixed a bug with the controller mappings not always saving, especially when adding / removing controllers

- Fixed a bug that would allow players to go online with incorrect benchmark scores, which could affect match making

Patch 3
We are happy to announce that we have released a small patch for Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition on the PC.
This patch fixes a bug that affects some of the various lighting effects on characters
that DarkSamus on Capcom Unity message boards discovered!
