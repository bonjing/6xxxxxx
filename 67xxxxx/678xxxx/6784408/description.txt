"Witch's Lament"

As Halloween approaches, Gaby, Bree and Lynette must 
attempt to exhume and move the body of Gaby's 
murdered stepfather after learning that Ben's real 
estate development excavation is taking place on 
that very spot. Meanwhile, Susan discovers that 
being art teacher Andre's (Miguel Ferrer) intern 
involves tending to matters that don't involve art; 
not to be outdone by Tom's new girlfriend, Lynette 
tries to construct a homemade Halloween costume for 
Penny; and Renee uses a little enticement to help 
spice up her first night of romance with Ben.
