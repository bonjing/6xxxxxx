,Dann3,2011-10-31T10:17Z,"Same here! ´Windows is not ""genuine"" anymore..."
,brodeurx,2011-11-02T00:17Z,Just wanted to confirm this worked for me. Got rid of 'This Copy of Windows is Not Genuine'. Also got rid of '18 days left to activate' and it now says 'Windows is Activated'. Now lets see if it stays that way.

This torrent is amazing. Click one button and you are done. "
,paxmees,2011-11-06T20:30Z,works but dont do the latest updates
,alon944,2011-11-13T06:00Z,"i hope you guys do know that there is a update that is specifically is for removeing activators and that it will give you the not genuine notification. the update is ........

 Update for Windows 7 (KB971033)

Download size: 1.2 MB

Update type: Important

This update to Windows Activation Technologies detects activation exploits and tampering to key Windows system files. These exploits try to bypass regular Windows activation and are sometimes included within counterfeit copies of Windows."
,alon944,2011-11-13T06:03Z,"if you wish for your activators to work then dont download that update and click hide,also for future reference read all the updates before you install them...if you didn't notice that microsoft doesn't like it that your stealing their software :P so watch out what updates you do"
,McNaughty,2011-11-19T16:27Z,"Thanks for this great solution! =D I got it to work, but the instructions was unclear. Did I even need to use the ""Activator""? It worked out when I used the ""Loader""...??"

,df01,2011-12-04T06:44Z,Works perfect. Managed to boot camp this into my Mac. now running dual-boot macbook. thanks rjaa.
,df01,2011-12-04T06:50Z,"After you install this do not install update windows update KB971033. this is a known patch for detecting pirated copies of windows (do a google search and you'll see). 

Update as per normal for the rest. 

if you have installed it follow as below:

Snowydog at 2011-11-30 09:56 CET:
1. Open Control Centre, then Action Centre, select Windows Update, then INSTALLED UPDATES.
2. Locate Windows Update KB 971033, right click, then Uninstall. Confirm as necessary.
3. Click Start, type cmdÂ in search box, right click cmd in results pane, select Run as Administrator.
4. Type the following: slmgr (now press the space bar), and then type -(dash)rearm. LEAVE A SPACE BETWEEN THE r AND THE DASH, OR IT WONÃ¢â‚¬â„¢T WORK!!
5. Wait for the Windows Script Host window to open, then select OK.
6. Reboot, then reboot again.
7. At this point you will still have a black screen, but the watermark should now be gone.
8. Select your desktop background as you would normally.
9. Open Control Centre, then System. Near the bottom of that window, it should say that Ã¢â‚¬Å“Windows is ActivatedÃ¢â‚¬Â and also have a Product ID number or OEM number.
10. Navigate to Windows Update. If the Update KB971033 is there, right click it and select HIDE. DO NOT INSTALL!!
11. In the Change Settings part of Windows Update, change the setting to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install themÃ¢â‚¬Â.
12. Update as required, but DO NOT install update KB971033 if it appears in the list."

,Batukhan,2011-12-21T14:56Z,"@kingside
200 useless points to your comment.
OBVIOUSLY we know that buying the software would help. But that's why we're all here, to NOT buy the software. And we're trying to get it work by NOT buying to software. THAT'S THE POINT."

Really, I got the freaking KB 971033 update today for my Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 and suddenly I saw the freaking â€œyou must activate todayâ€ dialogue; during the entire day I tried all the loaders I found, all the activators, and no one worked for me, this was driving me crazy, at the end I decided to back up all my personal files in case something happens, before I read your post about the KB 971033 update, I followed all the steps as you posted, and â€œFâ€ dude! My TouchSmart with W7 Ultimate shows â€œWindows is activatedâ€ and with â€œGENUINEâ€ certification; it was activated before the update but it never with the â€œGenuineâ€ thing, thatâ€™s new for me, thanks a million pal, youâ€™re the best!

,IamiMaC,2012-03-07T04:49Z,"I got the message today that says

Windows 7
Build 7600
This copy of Windows is not genuine

So I was pointed in this direction. Unfortunately I tried the activator and it gave me this message

http://i.imgur.com/I4dju.jpg

How can I get the activator to work? Or do I absolutely need to do a fresh install? If any of you know any ways that I can avoid doing a fresh install please tell me. I really don't want to do that right now. Thanks in advance."
,ShakeJunt,2012-03-16T22:54Z,"This loader isn't the safest imo. Not saying it doesn't work; but the shitty thing about it is, there's a 50/50 chance your computer will not be able to boot to your OS after installing"
,azvampyre,2012-03-17T01:48Z,"I've been using the Daz 2.04 loader for over a year on 64-bit and it still works, and anytime Windows says I need to validate for anything, it says I have genuine Windows.

Has worked with a few clicks of the mouse,I have got a HP notebook that I put a clean install thinking that I could use the same key, but found I had to purchase a new one from HP to get Win 7 activated (along with all their HOGware). 
Works great now, nice and clean!"
