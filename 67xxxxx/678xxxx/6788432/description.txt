A small and fast Linux distro which runs as well on old hardware as new hardware
Release Day!

So, itâ€™s time for us to finally unleash Simplicity Linux 11.10.  And here is a quick guide to all the various Editions we offer.
Simplicity Linux 11.10 Obsidian: (112mb)
Obsidian is a cut down to the bone edition of Simplicity Linux.  You get JWM as a window manager, Firefox and a network manager, and thatâ€™s about it.  It is designed for putting on a USB key when you just need a web browser and nothing else getting in the way and taking up processor and memory resources.
Simplicity Linux 11.10 Netbook: (124mb)
Netbook Edition does what it says on the tin.  It is designed to be used on a netbook rather than a desktop.  Most of the applications are web based rather than being locally installed.  If you use the internet more than you use local apps, this is the one for you. It is designed to be small and light for fast bootup and fast use on Netbooks which have more modest specs.  It also uses XFCE as the window manager.
Simplicity Linux 11.10 Desktop: (379mb)
Desktop Edition is almost the opposite of Netbook.  It is the Edition we personally use on our production laptop.  All the applications are preinstalled for you locally.  It is a big download but you do get the full, uncut version of LibreOffice, as well as several other large applications.  And as with the other Editions, it comes with XFCE as the default window manager.
Simplicity Linux 11.10 Media:
Media is our newest and most experimental Edition.  Here at Simplicity Linux we listen to a lot of music and watch a lot of TV and movies.  So we created Simplicity Linux Media.  If you have a VGA port enabled TV, you can hook up a modest box to a TV and create a lounge PC.  It comes with iPlayer, TVCatchup, Grooveshark, Google Books, and Blinkbox to help you out with all your media requirements.
