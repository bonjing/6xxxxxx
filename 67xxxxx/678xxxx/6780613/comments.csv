Stossel unfortunately has a couple of misconceptions about true free market capitalism of his own (possibly owing to his Friedmanite favoritism over Hayek, Mises, and Rothbard).

There are answers to the problems of externalities like pollution-control within economic theory from the Austrian school (THE singular anti-Keynesian school, as opposed to Milton Friedman's Chicago-school of theory).

The problem is, if given a real option of trying a free _and unfettered_ market, some libertarians turn out to seem fearful of giving their theories an acid-test. I'm not one of that sort, and wish John or his pro-side guests could have offered a stronger support."
