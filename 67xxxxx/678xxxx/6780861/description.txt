Michael BublÃ© has a special holiday gift for his naughty and nice fans. The multi Grammy Award winning Canadian presents Christmas. Commented BublÃ©, "Christmas has always been my favorite time of the year for me and my family so naturally it's been a dream of mine to make the "ultimate" Christmas record."

Christmas, produced by David Foster, Bob Rock and Humberto Gatica, was recorded primarily at Capitol Recording Studios in Hollywood and The Warehouse Studios in Vancouver. The album includes guest performances by Shania Twain on "White Christmas" and The Puppini Sisters on "Jingle Bells." BublÃ© also put his unique take on such classics as "Silent Night," "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas," "It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas" and "Santa Claus Is Coming To Town." In addition, a BublÃ© original "Cold December Night" will be included on Christmas.
