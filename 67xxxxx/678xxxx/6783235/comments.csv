You should only have to burn this to CD. Next, make sure your BIOS settings are set to allow booting from a CD/DVD."

Tool: Win32/Angryscan.a
Tool:Win32/Angryscan.A is a tool used to 'sniff' for or gather information sent over a network by a specific IP address range.
When installed, Tool:Win32/Angryscan.A creates the following registry keys:
HKCU\Software\Angryziber
HKCU\Software\Angryziber\ipscan

Remote Access: Win32/AmmyAdmin
RemoteAccess:Win32/AmmyyAdmin is a remote control application that allows full control of the computer in which it is installed. These types of applications are typically installed by the computer owner or administrator and should only be removed if they are not expected to be present in the computer.
The AmmyyAdmin program has built-in server and client components, thus the program can be used as a server or as a client on the computer. The person controlling the client can remotely control the computer on which the server component is executed.

The above info can be found on the Microsoft Web Site"

I hear you. But, I have found most of these to be ""false positives"" and have had no trouble."
