Christianity Today said, "even with vertical lyrics, the album could fit in easily with modern rock radio." JesusFreakHideout gave the album an overall positive review and said while the techno and industrial blends are more of an "acquired taste", the album is "right up your alley" if a person likes their worship "edgy." Cross Rhythms was very favorable of the album, giving it nine squares out of ten and stating that "apart from some slightly questionable theology in places, 'Love Riot' is an exceptional worship album."
