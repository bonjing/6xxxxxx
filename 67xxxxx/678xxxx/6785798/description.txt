Rana Mahednra Pratap Garewal (Mukesh Khanna) is a wealthy businessman along with his brother Vishwa (Dalip Tahil). They are both good friends with Brijnath (Paresh Rawal) who is not as wealthy. Rana's younger sister Madhu (Madhuri Dixit) is a good friend of Brijnath's younger brother Raja (Sanjay Kapoor). Seeing this Rana and Birju both arrange for Raja and Madhu to marry when they are older but Rana quickly backs out and insults Birju because of his social status. A accident causes Birju to become mental. Many years have passed and Raja and Madhu soon meet each other and fall in love. However Rana and Vishwa are determined to keep Madhu away from Raja. Eventually Rana gives in and accepts Raja into the family. When Raja leaves the city for a few days, Birju is invited to stay at the Garewal mansion. However, Madhu accuses Birju of rape when she is attacked by him. Rana immediately sends Birju to a mental hospital and Raja is forced to make a choice between his love and his brother. Believing in Birju innocence he breaks off his engagement with her. Madhu does not know that her own brothes had set Birju up so it looked like he had attacked her but in fact it was someone else who attacked her. Will Madhu find out what her brothers did? Will Raja be re-united with her?
