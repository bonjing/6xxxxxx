,GoatDancer,2011-10-31T23:02Z,"Doesn't work, i get an error shortly after i start the game. Any suggestions on how to fix it?"
,BaggerX,2011-10-31T23:13Z,"When you ask for help with an error, you might want to mention what error you got."
,Balguren,2011-11-01T02:02Z,Only issue I seem to be having is after I installed the DLC I am getting a error of missing bink32.dll I didnt have that before is this easly fixable?
,Kooh,2011-11-01T16:38Z,The Skidrow crack does not work for me (the game crash as soon as i click on the game icon). Only way i found to fix this is to use the steamapi.dll from the Reloaded crack.
,Angloki,2011-11-01T18:25Z,I didn't find RELOADED crack for this datadisk - I have the same problem; ie. crash after first 2 logos appear. Any directions?
,MasterFasterVDOWN,2011-11-02T16:19Z,"Tip: If the game crashes at start (and you are sure that you have installed all the needed runtimes), then change from Windows Control Panel the Regional Settings to English/United States. This will allow you to play the game. After you close the game you can change your Regional Settings back to what you had.

Note: It seems that the game also has a Region lock, thus you have to do the above trick. The crackers forgot to remove it too. "
,Angloki,2011-11-02T18:37Z,Changed both language and local setting to English/US and now it works. Thanks!
,Angloki,2011-11-02T23:50Z,"btw. the game is imho unplayable without this addon, simply because it allows to customize keys.

Whoever is responsible for the terrible default key- and mouse- bindings in original game should see a doctor. Or therapist."
,WhiteJuggernaut,2011-11-25T23:18Z,Download works perfectly. Thx
,nomoreraining,2011-12-01T13:10Z,"This DLC doesnt seem to be compatitible with the original game crack by RELOADED. Got a ""application load error 5blah3"". Any ideas?"
,danilo86,2011-12-27T12:16Z,"Works fine here ""reloaded version"".
Thanks uploader."
,DrPhysics,2012-03-03T16:58Z,"omg plz help!

and by the way i tried like some1 said here to set location to US and language to English in the control panel - it didnt make any diff :(!!"
,DrPhysics,2012-03-04T14:57Z,"how the hell u guys got it working with the DLC?? 

after i apllied this the only way i could make this working again was to use the steam file from the reloaded crack that game with the game dl, and 

renaming and dlc folder...
but then i dont have any dlc of course so this sucks and so this dl is worthless -_-"""
,TiznaraN,2012-04-15T23:38Z,"I got the bink error, dl the dll now I get ""The procedure entry point _BinkControlBackgroundIO@8 could not be located in the dynamic link library binkw32.dll

I dunno I've copied the dll to sys files and to the game dir and haven't had any luck.  Original game worked no problem and was really fun :/"

,hexjoyce,2012-05-29T03:09Z,"hey again ,i checked -double and triple checked and it's the real deal , my antivirus was only suspicious on the exe however it's clean ,and this works 100% with reloaded. Just make sure u put everything in the right folders and it will work.
Here's the proof :
