    In Dungeon Siege III: Treasures of the Sun, players will extend their
    journey and travel beyond the borders of Ehb to an all-new environment:
    the Aranoi Desert. On their search for a lost Legion hero, players will
    fight through hordes of new villains only to find a forgotten abbey
    hiding a long-lost secret: the greatest treasure of the Azunite faith.

    New abilities: Players will be able to attain mastery of the arcane
    through powerful new attack, defense and healing abilities.

    Level up to 35: Treasures of the Sun will further power up players by
    raising Dungeon Siege III's existing level cap from 30 to 35.

    More monsters and items: Players will encounter new monsters in the
    Aranoi DesertÃ¹including mummies and giant skeletonsÃ¹and will find more
    powerful items, adding to the thousands already available in Dungeon
    Siege III.

    Reallocate Talent & Proficiency Points: Players can reallocate points
    spent in Proficiencies and Talents, enabling changes to character
    customization throughout the campaign.
