DjVu (pronounced like dÃ©jÃ  vu) is a computer file format designed primarily to store scanned documents, especially those containing a combination of text, line drawings, and photographs. It uses technologies such as image layer separation of text and background/images, progressive loading, arithmetic coding, and lossy compression for bitonal (monochrome) images. This allows for high-quality, readable images to be stored in a minimum of space, so that they can be made available on the web.
DjVu has been promoted as an alternative[3] to PDF, promising smaller files than PDF for most scanned documents.[4] The DjVu developers report[5] that color magazine pages compress to 40â€“70 kB, black and white technical papers compress to 15â€“40 kB, and ancient manuscripts compress to around 100 kB; a satisfactory JPEG image typically requires 500 kB. Like PDF, DjVu can contain an OCR text layer, making it easy to perform copy and paste and text search operations.
