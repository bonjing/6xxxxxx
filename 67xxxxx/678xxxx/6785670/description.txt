Welcome Lyla Storm to Ultimate Surrender. This tall, sexy, tan rookie is as beautiful as she is tough. This is her first match, but she is ready for a war. We look for girls like Lyla, tough, energetic, and not afraid to do some hard work or feel real pain.

Ariel X has won 19 regular season matches in a row. She is a two-time Ultimate Surrender overall champion,and current reigning champion. No other wrestler in the history of the site has ever won the championship twice. This is Ariel's last match for some time as she is taking a medical leave.

Ariel X brought the pain. She put the rookie through the ringer. Brutal legs scissors, head locks, back-breakers, and multiple submission holds. Lyla took everything thrown at her and never gave in, never quit fighting. She got her ass kicked and kick good, but never once gave up. I wish I had a hundred just like her.
