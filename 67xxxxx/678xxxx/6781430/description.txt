Indian environmentalist and photographer, Sandesh Kadur, has traded a 
comfortable career in the family business to explore the natural wonders
 of the Western Ghats mountains.

Just a few hours drive from the commercial bustle of his native 
Bangalore, Sandesh could be a world away. The monsoon pours six metres 
of rainfall each year on the remote peaks and isolated valleys of the 
Ghats. Alongside familiar Indian species like elephants, tigers and 
peacocks are more mysterious creatures that are not found anyhere else -
 a purple frog with a face like a shrew and a monkey with a lion-like 
mane and tail.

Most intriguing of all, there is a chance sighting of a grey big cat, 
unlike anything scientists have seen before. To find out whether this 
enigmatic cat-in-the-ghat really is a new species, Sandesh must climb to
 the summit of these mountains. His journey is a reminder that in 
fast-track, modern India, this cloud-wrapped wilderness is more precious
 than ever.

Thanks to Sandesh for this wonderful gift. Real glory of 
Western Ghats has been filmed very well and I feel proud to live in this
 region.
