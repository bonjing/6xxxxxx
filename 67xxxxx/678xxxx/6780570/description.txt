Madden NFL 2004's soundtrack in my opinion is one of the best ever, so I compiled a list of all of the songs from the game itself.
It took me quite a while to get everything. What I did was ran my Playstation 2 Emulator with Madden 04 and I had to audio record and save all of the tracks using stereo mix. Each track is 320kbps quality.

I'm not sure if the songs are in it's exact order of the original soundtracks, but all of the songs are there.

-----------

**NOTE** All of the songs are 'clean' with the exception of 
"Gob - Give Up The Grudge")

For some reason that song wouldn't play, so I had to get that song from the internet and I only saw the explicit version.

Hope you all enjoy this memory filled soundtrack to one of the best NFL games of all time...Madden 2004.
