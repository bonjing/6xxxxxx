,Mascdante,2011-11-02T08:01Z,"Felicia, since no one has given you a decent answer a full article on SuprBay that gives the info: 
https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=106858&highlight=ettv

ettv is vouched for by TPB staff, which is good enough for me.

,brewcity77,2011-11-02T10:57Z,"Thanks, masc...perfectly viable question from Felicia. How many times have we seen virus/spam torrents that appear to be eztv rip-offs? Heaven forbid someone not want to get screwed over by another one of those."
,Bob__Dole,2011-11-03T00:37Z,^  not viable if you know what a skull means
,Online.Pirate,2011-11-16T09:13Z,"@ Bob Dole..
I have seen recently users with skulls trying to pass off dodgy files as eztv/vtv... turned out the accounts were stolen... so skull does not always mean every file listed by a username is secure.

As for ettv, thank you for the up's :)"
