The Rheostatics began their fish fetish with this album, and it's a good harbinger. After a four-year gap between albums and plenty of touring, it's not surprising that Melville is a much more accomplished affair. Although the playing is much tighter and the lyrics far more ambitious, the album still drips with Canadiana, name-dropping three provinces, one city, and two famous Canadian bands, and features a cover of another Canadian legend. There's also a song in Canada's other official language. "Horses" and "Saskatchewan" stand out, but all of the material on this album has a self-confidence that the debut lacked, making it a much better starting point.
