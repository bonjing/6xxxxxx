What is Tokens.dat?

Tokens.dat is a digitally signed file, which stores most of the windows activation files; 
All files together have a digital signature that prevents tokens.dat be replaced on other machines, in this case, if used on different machines, will ask for online activation; 
I advise making a new backup every change in hardware.

Coded with security features 
Very lightweight and fast 
Dynamic interface

How important is I have the phone activation?

You do not need to call for Microsoft, entering 25 numbers, and imput 25 characters on the microsoft activation utility ; 
You restore the activation in one click ; 
You can make changes in hardware, without losing your license [ of non-retail licenses without M$ support ] ; 
Engine 100% safe from errors and brick with activation 
Using the program:


Advanced Tokens Manager, is very simple to use, you simply have a folder with the program, run it, press Backup button, wait for the return of success


After the procedure, save the folder, and make sure that the following files
