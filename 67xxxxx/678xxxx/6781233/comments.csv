,cigaretteburns,2011-10-29T19:43Z,Does anyone know if this is either a European or American uncut / unrated version? The film has been torn to shreds by the British censors!
,hadi1989,2011-10-29T22:37Z,Can someone please confirm if this is the uncut version? Apparently the cut version is missing 2 mins.
,r512ptf,2011-10-29T23:29Z,This is the CUT version. Uncut not released yet.
,r512ptf,2011-10-29T23:30Z,Its still really good though. GROSS. lol
,SeederFTW,2011-10-30T00:00Z,This actually looks like a good movie :) Thanks for uploading bro.
,r083r73h,2011-10-30T17:49Z,Thank you. Remember the first. Sick stuff.
,Animeman1000,2012-01-01T11:31Z,"Some info. This was shot entirely in Color and then converted to Black and White. There is NO Audio except for a couple of screams, moans, and possibly laughter. Oh and Tom Six is already working on a Third one. Quote: ""The third film will make the last one look like a Disney film. We're going to shoot the third film entirely in America, and it's going to be my favourite... It's going to upset a lot of people."" So expect The Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence)."
