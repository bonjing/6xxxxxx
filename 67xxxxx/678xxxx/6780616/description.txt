WORKDONE:

Ok same as our cam video....no difference at all.But the audio this time,we've took
the line and tried to remux it,but was oos ...just like their cam audio was for our other
release.
Not saying their release is,but they used source files we don't have and something is sligthly
different  Anway went through it and made a few cuts and re synced the audio to fit 
Once done dropped it in AA as it had some noise so used a hiss removal filter and adjusted the EQ.
Enjoy folks
