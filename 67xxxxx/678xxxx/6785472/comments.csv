,killua-uchiha,2011-11-01T11:11Z,Can the subtitles get activated and desactivated (like turn them off) ?? Please respond
,kid999,2011-11-01T13:43Z,its a wonderful movie not
,StayWay,2011-11-01T15:19Z,"@killua-uchiha
I'm afraid not. Hard-coded subs are a part of the video therefore they cannot be removed.

Also, everyone else bitching perhaps it would be better to wait for others releases."
,Peacky,2011-11-01T15:19Z,"Quality is good !! Everything looks good. Just don't mind that hard-sub. 
thx!!Hero_No_1"
,soot9978,2011-11-01T15:55Z,"I really wish you people lived in Korea where half the time, if a movie has any foreign language, it's translated directly to Korean.  The other half of the time, there is and over under english/korean deal going on.  Korean subs are a way of life here and NOTHING to complain about when you're getting a movie for free.  Shit, I PAY to go see a movie, knowing full well, that there will be hard coded Korean Subs... that movie is also in 4-D with moving seats and spritzes in the face.  XD"
,FrUsTrIc,2011-11-02T14:05Z,"Thanks for the upload hero!

I do however have a suggestion:
Separate the subs from the movie as in putting the subs in a separate file so you can turn them on as an option instead of having them forced down our throats :)

In any case, A:10 V:10 excellent upload!"
,Ivarxxx,2011-11-02T19:10Z,Good Qualty 8 of 10
,cloudsora,2011-11-07T14:18Z,Man if the subs weren't such a bitch I would have seeded to 2.5 I only seeded 1.5
,quickie58,2011-11-08T02:20Z,"((((How To get rid of hardcoded subtitles.)))

Step 1. Get a Program called ""MOVAVI VIDEO CONVERTER 11""
In PRESET chose ""MKV for DVD quality video (*.mkv)"" 
(MKV are also known as ""Matroska Video File"")
(This will rid the file of Hardcoded subs)

Step 2. Use ""AVS VIDEO CONVERTER"" to convert the ""MKV File"" back to an ""AVI File"".

If A MKV File is subcoded use ""VSO.Convert.X.to.DVD.3""(Or a Current Version)
click on Setting, chose subtitles then click on ""Text subtitles rendering settings""
in the :Colors - Contrast: set all 4 to 0 ""use the mouse set them to 0"" then click on ""OK""
this will convert the File to VOB's (DVD FILES)
To convert the VOB back to an AVI File use ""AVS VIDEO CONVERTER"" 
""Only chose one VOB File to convert"" that VOB should be called ""VTS_01_0"""

A little annoying at the beginning with korean subs but then not noticeable. Good movie, pretty enjoyable

@Hero_no_1 - Thanks

Seeding as much as I can!"
,superus3r,2011-12-20T08:00Z,"Besides the movie being complete crap:

A: 6/10

What a waste of my HDD space."

Indeed the subs were little annoying (especially for us foreigners, who had to watch other subs on top), but overall an excellent download. Many thanx."
,frostbite91,2011-12-30T04:52Z,if you dont want subs just dl vlc video player...it can  sniff out subs in any video file
,mosi2012,2012-02-10T20:45Z,still waiting for download!!1
