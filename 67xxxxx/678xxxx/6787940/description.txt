Damon Albarn\\\'s back with an anti-mainstream monkey musical! 
It\\\'s a stage adaption of an old chinese novel from the 16th century, and luckily, there\\\'s a soundtrack to it. 
And a good one, indeed. Well, it\\\'s not very normal and you can clearly hear the Chinese inspirations on this one. 
Of course, Gorillaz have also set their marks on the monkey-tastic musical, as well has The Good The Bad And The Queen. 
If you were looking for ethnic monkey music, you\\\'ve come to the right place.
(btw, am I the only one that thinks the cover is kinda friggin scary?)
