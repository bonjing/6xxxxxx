                               ===========================




Bushcraft expert Ray Mears (Extreme Survival) adds man-against-the- elements adventure to the stunning wildlife photography for which Survival is world-renowned.


1)Wolves: The magnificent Sawtooth mountain region of Central Idaho is prime wolf habitat. Ray tracks a large pack of these highly secretive predators but he has only ten days before wolves are taken off Idahoâ€™s endangered species list and could be hunted.


2)Bears: The pristine wilderness of British Columbiaâ€™s Pacific Coast is the only place in the world where white spirit bears can be found. There are only about 400 of these bears alive today and to find one will be a personal fi rst for Ray. Unfortunately, they live in the same territory as groups of potentially dangerous Grizzly and Black bears which makes tracking them a particularly hazardous challenge.


3)Leopards: The ferociously hot terrain of Namibiaâ€™s Central Highland Plain is home to some of the most dangerous of all predators and one of its most revered is the leopard. Ray joins a pioneering leopard research project, and uses his unique skills on a quest to find a notoriously huge dominant male leopard.
