Modified inf file if you are having problems installing your F710 in XInput Mode.

ONLY TESTED ON WINDOWS XP 32-BIT.  SHOULD WORK ON ALL 32-BIT VERSIONS AS THE XBOX CONTROLLER SOFTWARE IS FOR ALL 32-BIT VERSIONS


Install Xox360_32Eng.exe

In installation directory of the above, swap the inf file (Xusb21.inf) with the one in the archive

Update driver of device (when set to XInput mode) from device manager, point to the new inf.

Select the right controller.

Done.

The problems seemed to be caused by the controller having a different Hardware ID than a real xbox controller, and hence not being recognised.
