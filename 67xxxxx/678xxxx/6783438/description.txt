Here is a good mix of great House tunes i got from beatport just had to share the quality the files are in .AIFF which is a new format beatport is using it's just like .wav just contains album art and metadata. Works with itunes. if you're using mediamonkey you have to Download a .aiff plugin sounds amazing enjoy the tunes
