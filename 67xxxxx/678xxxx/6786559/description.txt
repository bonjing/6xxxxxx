RipZip v3.00 takes multi-volume Rar\\\\\\\'s or Ace\\\\\\\'s, with File_id.diz and NFO\\\\\\\'s and automatically Zip\\\\\\\'s them all up.  

It features NFO\\\\\\\'s in first Zip only and auto-numbering File_id.diz\\\\\\\'s option\\\\\\\'s.  

It\\\\\\\'s easy and fast, takes only a few seconds to pack in Zip\\\\\\\'s with a 20 Rar fileset with Diz and NFO\\\\\\\'s. 

To auto-number File_id.diz\\\\\\\'s just put xx/xx in the Diz and RipZip will subsitute the number to that of Zip#/Total.  Couldn\\\\\\\'t be easier to set up and run. 

If you pack files for the scene, RipZip is the way to go, try it and you\\\\\\\'ll see.
