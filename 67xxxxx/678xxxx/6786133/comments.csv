,joo-loved-it,2011-11-02T01:20Z,"ok first off @602Bandit I don't know about utorrent but with bittorrent you need to go to the settings, then go to bandwidth and change your maximum number of global connections to peers and seeds. the amount you choose will vary. just make it roughly around between 200 and 500 global connections(depending on the torrent), just make sure you don't set the number to more than the actual torrent has.
Secondly @e0r I watch jason statham movies for his acting(which there is nothing wrong with).
He may not be the best at pulling faces and crying on cue but the last time i checked action was a movie genre and stuntmen are considered actors too.
Jason Statham is a great actor and I enjoy watching him act."

,camo12345,2011-11-02T07:05Z,"Jason Statham is a great actor, all of his films are jam packed with action, which is what I love most about them... and whoever said this film doesn't have enough action in it needs to get their eyes tested, it had action in it all the way through! 

As for the quality, video and audio is perfect, but as it says in the title, it has been cropped, I think the reason is because it has Korean subtitles at the bottom and they've cropped them out... but by cropping the Korean subs out they also cropped out the information that the film already had, such as times and places.

I was downloading at an average 1.2 mb/ps (1200kb), which is incredibly fast... so I don't wanna hear anyone complaining about download speeds!!"

,DJ_eight,2011-11-03T05:10Z,"extremezone ,,, best !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,masonfree,2011-11-03T06:02Z,"For those wanting to know about the actual quality, like the file heading says, it's been cropped. Unfortunately it seems a bad aspect ratio has resulted from the cropping process; the video frame is elongated, meaning the picture has been stretched vertically. Minor adjustments can be made in VLC to reduce the effect but you can not achieve a 'true' image (to the best of my attempts), therefore subjects and objects will always be stretched vertically to some degree. Many people seem to not be bothered by incorrect ratios, such as when a 4:3 ratio TV show or movie is stretched horizontally to a 16:9 ratio to fit modern TVs. I personally can not tolerate it as I'm aware I'm not looking at a 'true' image. While the picture quality of this torrent is fine, it's essentially ruined from the vertical stretching, so I will wait for a proper version. A8/V1. Thx all the same to extremezone."
,DrMD,2011-11-03T09:25Z,"Well if you've seen the original then this is something completely different.A/V=8/8 M=5. Subs would have been nice to get through those goddamn British accents but with this being cropped you wouldn't see them or the name of the locations which actually is cut off.Movie seems seriously disjointed, badly edited, and you'll wonder whether the actors are in the same movie."
,tigersquall,2011-11-03T09:58Z,@masonfree what are you on about? the aspect ratio looks fine
