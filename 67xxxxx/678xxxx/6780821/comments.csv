we all wanted to see whats at the bottom of hole
been a long wait

man they really got screwed.again (I want say ho you ahve to watch). that old man might find himself
drowned accidentally one day

this program if any thing again shows the rich are just greedy uncaring sh1theads

whats does a old man need more money and gold for when they have more to loose like family health and houses and everything"
,coyotedogg,2011-10-30T01:17Z,"@ psspss

If your trying not to make a spoiler....
Don't comment on episode!!!
Why comment that they screwed again?
Let us watch it...please.
You gave lots away by NOT spoiling it...
By saying you wanted to see what was at the bottom of the glory hole loet's me know more than I want to already."
[V],psspss,2011-10-30T11:54Z,"sorry.. but then the beginning lead in says not much more to hat I said that there was a twist or surpise coming.. and E00 also hinted at it

i have to say the ending of this got my blood to boil but no doubt we get to see what more is pulled out of the hole im sure discovery will keep following it up

how come no ones rated the quality

i see others released there xvid versions after I spent hours on my slow pc converting and missing this version but then i say it has a higher bitrate
then others out there"
,Fangular,2011-10-30T13:03Z,"Hi psspss! And I apologise if this is the wrong spot to make a request, but I was desperately hoping that you would continue to upload Work of Art.. do you think you'd be able to do that? It would be so magnificantly, wonderfully brilliant of you if you did! (Nobody else on the entire internet seems to be doing it, so I wouldn't be the only grateful person if you were to upload it..)

Regardless, thank you very, very much for uploading the last episode (ep 2) - it was greatly appreciated.

Cheers,
Fangular"
,coyotedogg,2011-10-30T16:29Z,"No prob. psspss....I know what you mean, what an episode. Thanks for the upload...the quality was great."
[V],psspss,2011-10-30T23:54Z,"i only upload shows I watch and source missing episodes so I upload what i have and depending on ISP and data caps! also im not in usa :) 

but if requesting please stick to my torrents for the same show at least.. work of art is now up.. I found a source and spent 2 hours making a xvid for it if I had a quad or i7 things would e a bit daster

so how come no one has tick video quality still? lol

anyhow perhaps admin will upgrade me to trusted uploader soon so can upload faster here and avoid that catchcha random word business.. its so annoying"
,Fangular,2011-10-31T01:58Z,"Thank you so, so much, psspss - I will rate the Work of Art episode - and stick to commenting on those shows I watch - my apologies for getting it wrong this time."
,fuckincrazyness,2011-11-01T23:41Z,lol i cant believe these dumbasses are at it again.   season one was a failure.  i geuss the discovery channel gave them some money
[V],psspss,2011-11-02T10:27Z,"they maybe more newbites rather then dumbasses
but they are entertaining though :)

shame the leader is clueless and taken advantage of by these rich mean men though"
,frost1090,2011-11-04T05:15Z,wow that sucks i was literally getting stressed watching it.  That is such bs how they got taken advantage of buy that asshole old man.  Right when the gold gets good they are kicked out.  These guys are more levelhead than i would have been!!!  This is how they make a living and not they are pretty much back a square one...  They should have let the hothead do his worst dickhead fred.

Will you be uploading S02E02? , would be much appriciated, won't air in Canada for a couple weeks... much thanks!!"
[V],psspss,2011-11-06T03:49Z,"read above.. if someone is in usa they could source from amazon for us

i like to see it also but cant find a source any where"
,livens01,2011-11-06T18:20Z,"Thanks for up'ing. All of us with no paid tv service appreciate!

And those hating the old man for ""doing them wrong""... well its just business. Its his claim and he has no reason to be 'nice' to them. Dumbass shouldve paid his lease on time, how the F could you forget that?"
,Dizzious,2011-11-07T04:23Z,Anybody have any clue when Episode 2 of this season is going to air? 
[V],psspss,2011-11-07T10:35Z,"e02 is now up

however its not just business... more dirty business

i see it as plain greedy just hope they kept the gold
they got before he showed i suspect they paid thelease maybe a day late which means they
should get it back or keep the gold since the lease would be per season no doubt and they never got to mine it for paying"
