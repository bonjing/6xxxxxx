House of Exorcism (1973) in XVID [.avi] @ 705 mbs! (Use CD Overburn)

House of Exorcism was released in the United States in 1975, where it was a critical and commercial flop. Leone's plan to try and exploit the popularity of The Exorcist backfired, as many critics and viewers denounced the film as a blatant rip-off of The Exorcist.
 
Ironically though, the re-editing of Lisa and the Devil as House of the Exorcism would cause the film to gain cult status amongst horror fans as far as being a "lost classic". As Lisa and the Devil was commercially unavailable (and for a time, thought to be truly lost forever until an intact print of the film resurfaced in the late 1990s), the film's reputation grew amongst fans and critics as one of Mario Bava's best films
