For many years the focus of fear and disgust, the anus is actually one of the human body's most wondrous creations-elegant, efficient, and richly supplied with pleasure nerves. However, stress and ignorance can turn the anus and its functions from a source of delight into a painful disability. What's needed is an owner's manual-and here it is! Join therapist and sexologist Jack Morin, Ph.D., on this tour of the anus, complete with information and exercises to open the door to new sources of comfort and gratification. You'll unlearn habits that can cause everything from hemorrhoids to chronic pelvic pain- and, if you choose, learn new ways of achieving solo and partnered pleasures through this humblest of portals.
