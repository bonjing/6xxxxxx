Release Notes
You didn't think SiC forgot about Human Centipede II did you? This was captured from a standard definition VOD stream. It turned out pretty good for what it is. Currently this is the first and only source of this film available, so take it or leave it. Yes, the entire film is in black and white. Also, the version of the film that IFC released to VOD and theaters is cut by nearly 2 and a half minutes. Unfortunately, this will be the only cut of the film we'll be able to see until they release the unrated director's cut on DVD, which I'm guessing will happen December/January. Until then, this should do. Perfect for Halloween weekend. Get the family together and dig on this wholesome goodness.
