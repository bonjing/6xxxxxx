There are more effective ways to improve your reading speed, I recommend using software, like AceReader pro (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3273611/AceReader.Pro.Deluxe.Network.Edition.v3.4C-ER8)

I tried it myself, and it definitely improved my reading speed by atleast 100 words per minute...

anyways, here is a link that explains why speed reading software is better, read it : http://www.readingsoft.com/

and there is a speed test there as well.

Oh, and that acereader Pro torrent seems to be dead...you might want to get it reseeded, I highly reccommend it ! "

When I read a book I am looking for meaning and not speed... I think that a book can be read hundreds of times, reading this quickly is just doing a check mark to the thing you read and demolishing the quality of the reading."
