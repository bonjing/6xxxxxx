,KingPumpkinX,2011-11-01T06:27Z,"Game doesn't seem to work right under Neogamma R9 beta 50...when you select an episode you get the dreaded #002 error. I don't know why It's doing this, all of my other Wii back ups work fine...anyone else having this problem?"
[V],HobbitGamez,2011-11-01T23:34Z,"@KingPumpkinX

Have you tried 002 error fix?"
,KingPumpkinX,2011-11-02T05:37Z,"@HobbitGamez

Still no luck. Like I said, the game boots up just fine, but when you're at the main title screen and select a chapter I get the blue 002 error fix. All of my other Wii back ups work perfectly except this game."
,mysteryman64030,2011-11-02T11:20Z,Works great with USB Loader GX running CIOS D2X without any custom settings

,KingPumpkinX,2011-11-03T18:16Z,"The game WILL work with Neogamma. Go into the options and make sure the ""Block reload"" options is set to ""No""."

,mudoken2000,2011-11-03T23:48Z,"I'm using usbloadergx and d2x.  When I select a chapter, it resets the wii."

Follow the guide to install d2x cIOS. Then set the game to Block ISO Reload. 

Worked for me when I had the exact same problem. "

,Sejjtan,2012-02-12T16:42Z,@ Keithuk : Exactly how did you get it to work ?
,hught78,2012-04-25T06:24Z,"I was having the same problem using Configurable USB Loader, tried everything here and nothing worked. Finally I came across this thread and it solved the problem. You need to install d2x cIOS. Instructions are clear. www.wiihacks.com/other-faq-guides-tutorials/88654-d2x-cios-installation-guide.html"
,Keithuk,2012-06-02T02:52Z,"@ Keithuk : Exactly how did you get it to work ? 

Nothing special just dowloaded it extracted the iso and added it to the drive with WBFS Manager and it worked straight off."
,Keithuk,2012-06-02T02:55Z,"You guys really need to use USB Loader GX there are more cracks and fixes for games with this USB Loader.
