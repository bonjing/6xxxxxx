,touchwoodblues,2011-10-30T07:43Z,"dubya89 ~ Never had any trub with Sir Paul's d/l's, and Y wait for your suggestion, Sir Paul is far from CRAP ... :)"

,fancyfatty,2011-10-30T08:19Z,"Legit, thanks man"
,miasma6,2011-10-30T08:56Z,"A/V anyone?? hope its not blurry like some of sir paul's releases, no disrespect.."
,moffy123,2011-10-30T09:08Z,lets get that d.l speed up guys
,Nimh,2011-10-30T09:34Z,"The reason we say SIR PAULS realses are no good is becasue of the wrong encoding. 

1) Audio glitch!!!
2) Dont work with PS3

People here say ""fuck that then wanker use VLC"" or go ""fuck yourself with you console."" 
I dont have a PS3, i've been using Media Player Classic for years, trouble free. What about all the people with home theatre PC's using it too? 

You're getting angry because we are saying he does his encoding wrong??

The proper releases (NOT SIR PAUL's) play on everything without issue.  "
,Nimh,2011-10-30T09:37Z,"I actually have VLC player installed, it just that i much prefer MPC.  

If you are going to make a release, make it compatible with the most common players.  "
,banodrum,2011-10-30T09:43Z,does this include the prelim fights as well??
,Cumnplay,2011-10-30T09:53Z,"Great, over 700 seeders yet only 6 online. Looks like the new generation of downloaders are all for themselves. If you're clever enough to take, be clever enough to know that without seeders there is no download.

Selfish Pricks"
,Cumnplay,2011-10-30T09:56Z,"BTW thanks for the dl. and yes there seems to be an audio glitch on most of the sir paul dl's. Bottom line, if u dont like it then go pay $44.95 to watch the event OR dl another torrent.

Thanks again for the prompt upload"
,lif3isfr33,2011-10-30T10:49Z,"I'm only getting 10 kb/s :'(

seed please"
,billylopez,2011-10-30T11:06Z,"C'mon you guys!!! 

SEED!!!!!!!!! PLS!!

I've noticed people who complain about seeding are the ones who are not seeding...
Glad to say I'm not a leech but if I keep getting downloads with no one seeding, then I may as-well stop seeding.. 
Why be nice if they not nice back?????"
,billylopez,2011-10-30T11:26Z,"GAVE UP WITH THIS TORRENT.......

DOWNLOADING SAFCukO09 TORRENT INSTEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

thepiratebay.org/torrent/6782367/UFC.137.Penn.vs.Diaz.DSR.XviD-XWT"
,SH-LFC,2011-10-30T11:51Z,Cheers Sir Paul.
,Cumnplay,2011-10-30T11:57Z,@ Billy Lopez...Thats the attitude that F*#@ks everyone. If the original peer to peer generation of downloaders took that attitude there would be no downloading torrents. Bottom line. Yes seeding chews my dl limit but every seed makes a difference.
,Vedz,2011-10-30T12:25Z,is there a glitch on some parts or is the sound off with the video??? and ffs seed you greedy maggots ;)
,mbonaci,2011-10-30T13:18Z,"When I try to play part1 with VLC i get:
This AVI file is broken. Seeking will not work correctly. Do you want to try to fix it?

No matter what I choose video lasts 1 second.

Part2 cannot be opened at all."
,sktotal2,2011-10-30T14:00Z,"Cumnplay is quite right, Billylopez comment is scoundrel and dishonest because this release from Sir. Paul is truly genuine. It actually is the UFC 137 29/10/11 event fights with 2h51m and excelent audio/video quality.

I've just complete my download after 42minutes at 630kbps while going up by 190kbps.

Site crew perheaps should think about renew use rules to make this kind of comment gives ban to idiot writer as well kick out the release that offered ""instead"". 

One of the reasons that I like this great PTB is exactly how easy is to read all coments very quickly soon at the first page of each release. Comment are the most powerfull way to ensure if a release infos are saying true.

If idiots start to post a lot of craps like this above may cause serious harms to trust of all comments posted by other users because people may have doubts about which post is saying the truth (esp new users or with dificulties to read in english) so I hope that whom can do something in order to prevent this sort of disgrace take cares about it. "
,fasteddie_felson,2011-10-30T14:56Z,"didn't read other comments. Good upload video 9
audio 10
thank-you!"
,mbonaci,2011-10-30T14:56Z,"Disregard my last comment.
Sorry, my bad, I was trying to open unfinished download.
It was an honest mistake, I'm not the part of any plot to make anyone look bad.

This is great, genuine, high quality upload."

,cob420,2011-10-30T17:15Z,hey can someone tell me why every fucking time there is a UFC and I download it takes fucking 30 + hours to download.  Am I doing something wrong? I get full speed downloads whenever I DL anything else.  But this shit never Downloads fast. WHAT THE FUCK?  IT DRIVES ME NUTS!!!! I have my upload turned up real high but it doesnt even get used.  
,banh_cam,2011-10-30T17:23Z,A YO FAGGOT ASS CUNT COB420 your COMP fuckin SUCK that's the reason why your download is hella slow so take my advise why dont u throw your shitty ass COMP away and get yourself a much faster COMP u fuckin CUNT it only take me almost 7 HOURS to download this shit......

,dwatson,2011-10-30T17:58Z,^what a wanker^
,BOONEDOGSAINT,2011-10-30T18:41Z,"Can one of you assholes turn up the bandwidth? Every fucking time I try to get one of these fights it takes 3 days for someone to share properly. Don't hit it and quit it, remember to share with everyone else!"
,P.O.S,2011-10-30T19:04Z,If you dont want to wait buy the fucking thing how is anyone going to bitch about not paying $45 greedy bitches thank you to the uploader your work is very much appreciated!
,CoreStrn,2011-10-30T19:43Z,"Thanks for this. Hope everything plays smoothly. 

Just a quick note to everyone getting slow a slow download speed. It's not because you have a slow computer like banh_cam said don't listen to that wanker, it's because so many people are just downloading this fight and not uploading it. In other words they are being greedy and selfish.

Don't complain about getting something for free, when you pay for it then you can complain."
,cob420,2011-10-30T20:13Z,Am I the only one who thinks banh_cam is an asshole? 
,Labwrath,2011-10-30T22:21Z,I always need to pass the file through mkvmerge to get rid of the audio glitches. Takes about 30 seconds and I'm done. No problem.
,insdel2006,2011-10-30T23:32Z,The Matt Mitrone vs. Cheick Kongo fight is all messed up on this video copy.  FYI
,SteadyBrand,2011-10-30T23:46Z,"Thnx for the up 'scene'. 

Banh you sound like a little Cunt! Feel me.."
,spelonkar,2011-10-31T01:07Z,"Few spots where the video/audio glitched out for a second or so, nothing major, especially for a free ppv. Also my download speed was fine and i got it about an hour after it came up, configure your shit properly "
,Lustrum0005,2011-10-31T04:59Z,"@sktotal2  ... I agree too, I wish comments could be deleted by the user and also be flag for inappropriate content and or spamming. 

There's this other torrent website I like using and will not mention here, that at least lets you vote up or down in each comment. Readers can vote once, up or down on each comment, then bad comments after a certain amount of negative votes are hidden, unless you wish to view them. "
,cychka,2011-10-31T16:38Z,Good shit Respect bro
,sumyoungbum,2011-11-01T19:19Z,"Pretty bad video, but it's free so I'm not complaining.

V: 4/10
A: 6/10"
,rafsaluno,2011-11-01T23:11Z,"banh_cam must be banned/ very nice uploading, good quality video and sound.
Thx Sir Paul.

banh_cam its a mental delayed, incult and ignorant."
,c3bhm,2011-11-02T21:59Z,"***********
GOOD LORD: Get the x264/RUDOS version.  The encoding has a frame-rate that is butter-smooth, somehow.  Incredible effect and perfect for this kind of fight-action where you want to be able to see every tiny little movement.  Amazing.  Big Ups to RUDOS.  Seriously impressed.  It's kind of like going from 60hz to 120hz on an LCD-HDTV."
,Zipetta,2011-11-03T00:50Z,Just a heads up to other like minded people - this doesn't work on Xbox (I assume also PS3) Was a quick download though :)
,bodierock,2011-11-03T12:11Z,"this shit makes me sick . i thought id give it a watch
this is why america needs its apocolypse"
,bodierock,2011-11-03T12:15Z,shit ..wrong torrent comment .sorry
,awesomewelles,2011-11-06T12:44Z,all you saying this is good quality are trippin. It looks like a stuttering fucking computer game. Seriously bad and almost unwatchable. What are you dudes smoking?
,torrntzmakemepurr,2011-11-21T08:12Z,can you guys kindly post UFC 139 (shogun x Hendo)??  would greatly appreciate it  :)
