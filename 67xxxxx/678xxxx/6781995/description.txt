Age of Conquest Africa:


for iPad, iPhone and iPod

Age of Conquest AFRICA is a medieval risk-like turn-based strategy game where you take the reins of a budding empire and struggle against fellow empires for control of the African continent. In one game, up to 15+ players vie for supremacy, but only one can be victorious. Every game you win pushes up your score, until you don't just dominate the world, but also your fellow players. Then all will be in your shadow and not just peasants, but even kings will worship you! All this can be yours, but only if you triumph.
