how come"
,Chuckfist,2011-11-02T16:01Z,"@afreet5 - hey n00b, let me explain on how you can tell if it is hardcoded without bitching about it, saying they should left a note.
1) Torrent file is named KORSUB - as in Korean subs - (one hint that it has subs)
2) See screencap (it shows korean language - another hint)
3) it is an avi. Only subs ever in AVI is hardcoded. Subs that can be turned off are in MKV and possibly MP4
4) If you look at the files and see no .SRT, .SUB files, it means there is no separate subtitle file thus being hardcoded in the AVI.

Suggest you should learn more about different file formats first and read the title of the torrent ""killer elite 2011 KORSUB hdrip XVID"" - KORSUB, XVID..."
