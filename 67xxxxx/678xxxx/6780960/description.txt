Storyine: Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman star in the outrageous comedy from the director of Wedding Crashers and the writers of The Hangover. One drunken night, two friends admit that they wish they had the others life. Mitch (Reynolds) thinks Dave has it all: a beautiful, loving family and a high-paying job at a prestigious law firm. But Dave (Bateman) thinks Mitchs stress-free life without obligation or consequence is the real dream come true. The next morning they wake up, hungover, in each others bodies, and proceed to freak out! With time not on their side, Mitch and Dave comically struggle to avoid completely destroying each others lives before they can find a way to get their old ones back.
