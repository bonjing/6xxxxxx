Bitter much?

As for your comment about feeding SI workers families, every retail copy sold SI make 15 pound on, every download via STEAM and they make 17...

I think SEGA posted over 200 million pound profit as well just out of this genre of their gaming alone, sport, so please don't come here and tell us that we are the skint ones.

Also re your Youtube/Twitter compatible comment - Talking out of your backside. Same system they ran on FM11, you seem to think that we need to be internet silent when playing...We don't.

Just uploaded youtube videos myself, works perfectly fine - as it did with 11 - now please, leave us alone and let us play our free game.

Work out who the mug is, the guy who spends Â£0 to play a simulation football manager game or the guy who spends Â£27 buying a simulation football manager game..."

,Rikiel502,2011-11-01T09:15Z,"found this solution on another site and it worked for me
for those who cannot use the EDITOR:

go to editor filepath, for example:
C:\Program Files (x86)\SEGA\Football Manager 2012\Editor
You will find a file called special folders.xml (donâ€™t open it)
Open your usual text editor (NOTEPAD) as AN ADMINISTRATOR
then, go to FILE > OPEN and select special folders.xml
Click OPEN

then you should replace all â€œ../football manager 2012/[ANYTHING] â€ with your actual filepath
For example, if you have installed your game under c:\program files\SEGA (default), this is what your sile should look like:

Instead of ../football manager 2012/data/sigfx (For example);
Put:
C:/Program Files (x86)/SEGA/football manager 2012/data/sigfx

Do the same for the other lines.

Then save your file, and open the editor."

,marco699,2011-11-02T02:05Z,"@ FM-Man
And where did you put the berkelium.dll ?

Open the zip-file you downloaded from DLL-files.com.

Extract berkelium.dll to a location on your computer. We recommend you to unzip it to the directory of the program that is requesting berkelium.dll.

If that doesn't work, you will have to extract berkelium.dll to your system directory. By default, this is:

C:\Windows\System (Windows 95/98/Me)
C:\WINNT\System32 (Windows NT/2000)
C:\Windows\System32 (Windows XP, Vista, 7)
If you use a 64-bit version of Windows, you should also place berkelium.dll in C:\Windows\SysWOW64\

Make sure overwrite any existing files (but make a backup copy of the original file).

Reboot your computer.

If the problem still occurs, try the following:

1.Open Windows Start menu and select ""Run..."".
2.Type CMD and press Enter (or if you use Windows ME, type COMMAND)).
3.Type regsvr32 berkelium.dll and press Enter.

Failing that im sory I cant help you."
