Big thank you uploading this fantastic series in HIGH quality.

Its really generous of you.

I would like to ask you something.

I do a lot of encoding and have found that when I use x264/aac for compression in an mp4 container I am able to reduce the size of a regular avi file to 1/3rd the size with 'negligible' (literally) loss of quality.

So for this torrent, I believe that the size can be reduced to almost 12GB! And it will be so much more easier to seed a 12GB torrent than a 36GB one.

So my question was, would you be able to do this? This would be such a BIG help to the entire 'Alias' community/fans.

If you are new to encoding please have a look here for some excellent free software that you can use:

cheers!!

THANK YOU :-)................"

Like 30 mins would be around 500MB and an hour show would be like 1.09 GB.  Now it seems to be about double the size.  It seems like we are going backwards.

Can anyone explain why they are doing this?  Can't be quality because I don't see any difference.


Maybe....it takes less time to compress and/or encode so they can upload sooner?  That's the only thing I can think of.


They aren't doing this on movies, just tv shows."
