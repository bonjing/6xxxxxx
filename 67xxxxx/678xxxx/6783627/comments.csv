@RMJ13
update notes always tell you what's in the update for people who bought the game. Some things, such as multiplayer options, may not apply to people who torrent it since those features might have been removed."
,RMJ13,2011-10-30T22:30Z,"I understand this , I was just commenting . no need to update this crap game then"

,sun83kim,2011-12-03T22:57Z,"Works perfectly.

In the note Skidrow mentions they dont know what has changed in the update1; but the update 1 changes the difficulty of the game. 

Alot of people were complaining the game was just too hard even on the easy level so thats what the update 1 fixed.

This update patch worked perfectly with skidrow release of the game which is here
