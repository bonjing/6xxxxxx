The X-Men anime is written by famed English comic book writer/creator Warren Ellis, and borrows story elements from famed Scottish comic book writer Grant Morrisonâ€™s early 2000s story arch for New X-Men, as well as Joss Whedonâ€™s mid-2000s run on Astonishing X-Men.

"U-Men - MyÅ«tanto Gari" (U-Men - ãƒŸãƒ¥ãƒ¼ã‚¿ãƒ³ãƒˆæŽ¢ã‚Š)  April 8, 2011

The X-Men arrive in TÅhoku and talk with Hisako's parents concerning her disappearance, learning that several other mutants have gone missing over the past few years. As the X-Men suspect this to be the work of the U-Men, a group of humans that harvest mutant organs in order to produce counter measures against mutants, they soon learn yet another mutant boy has gone missing. As they split up to investigate, Beast realises the call was bait to lure them into a trap, and they are soon attacked by the U-Men's robots. After defeating the robots, the X-Men regroup and head to an abandoned hospital which is hought to be the U-Men's base. There, they find the missing boy being pumped with chemicals and transform into a huge monster. Despite learning his body is beyond biological repair, Cyclops is reluctant to fight against him, but is eventually forced to kill him in order to save his allies. Before passing away, the boy asks the X-Men to save the others. As they move on, they discover a laboratory where Hisako is being kept, along with Emma Frost who Cyclops remembers being the woman he saw behind Jean during his battle with Phoenix.
