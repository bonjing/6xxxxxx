Barnaby and Jones enter the cloistered and old-fashioned world of Midsomer Priory after a nun is found strangled. Jones visits the local pub, where he learns that a woman was seen acting strangely on the day of the murder, and that teenagers in the area sneak into the priory grounds for romantic liaisons.
Later, the nuns discover that a valuable silver altar set has vanished, then the chaplain is found murdered. Can Barnaby and Jones work out the connection between the holy orders, the missing silver and some African art and uncover the killer?
