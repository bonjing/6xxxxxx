China's Mega Dam

2006 NR 100 minutes

This awe-inspiring documentary from the Discovery Channel lets viewers stand on the sidelines of the largest public works project in human history: the Three Gorges Dam on China's Yangtze River. But aside from concerns about the effects the massive structure will have on the surrounding landscape and the people who live in its shadow, one important question remains: Will the "dam thing" actually work?
