After releasing a number of records in the 1980s the band toured extensivley and built a large fanbase without any significant rotation on either radio or television. During the years touring and recording have decreased but The Nomads still play a number of shows every year in the Scandinavian region. In 2001 the band celebrated their 20th anniversary with a gig in Stockholm that included appearances by members from Bob Hund, Sator, The Flaming Sideburns, Robert Johnson and Punchdrunks as well as members of the original line-up. At their gig at the Hultsfred festival the band once again took the opportunity to celebrate with guest appearances from Nick Royale, Chips Kiesbye Handsome Dick Manitoba, Ross The Boss, Jello Biafra, Chris Bailey, Odd Ahlgren och Wayne Kramer. 20 Years Too Soon - A Tribute To The Nomads was released in 2003 with bands like The Hellacopters, The Dictators, The Robots, Bob Hund and Nitwitz contributing with their own version of their favorite Nomads songs. In 2008 The Nomads shared the stage with rock legend Roky Erikson at the Peace and Love festival in Sweden. (wikipedia)
