It\\\'s the year 3030...And here at The Corporate Institutional Bank of Time, we 
find ourselves reflecting...Finding out, that In fact, we came back...We were 
always coming back....

And thus begins the intergalactic journey of Deltron Zero (Del the funky 
homosapien), The Cantankerous Captain Aptos (Dan The Automator) and 
Skiznod the Boy Wonder (Kid Koala) on their journey to reclaim Earth\\\'s Music.

Spanning 21 tracks, 9 of which are quick interludes to help push the story 
along, and just over 60 minutes worth of music, the trio must be commended 
for maintaining such a consistent vibe and structure throughout this musical 
piece. The album is extensively produced, not only in the sense of beat-
composition in which Automator has done a splendid job with, but in which 
everything is presented; the story wrapped and maintained, the mixing of 
sounds so preciously placed. The album evokes a sense of awe; a truly 
believable tale, undoubtedly meant to be played from beginning to end. It\\\'s 
wondrously layered with topics such as virus\\\', turbulence and apocalyptic 
visions of the world, right on down to mass confusion from which of course 
leads to madness. One can not help but be taken aback by this finely crafted 
and conceived visual tale.
