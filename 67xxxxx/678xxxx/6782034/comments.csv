So I would just say upload it that way and don't convert it into 320kbps
btw, this applies most of your uploads.
(not trolling, neither bitching)
Have a nice day and thanks for uploading."

You're complaining something in which you get for free. If you don't like, then don't download. Just buy the album when it comes out.
