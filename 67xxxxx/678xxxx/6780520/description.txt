Hi all,
First of all, this isnÂ´t my job, just downnloaded from FMSCOUT (http://www.fmscout.com/i-1026-Cut-Out-Faces-Megapack-for-FM-2011.html), so the credits must go to "Sortitoutsi" guys, who made these pack and all updates.

in files you will found instalation instructions, or in site previous mencioned.

Note:
They say that winrar do the job, but it didnÂ´t work for me, so I used 7-zip and works perfectly.

This torrent was intended to save time to the people, who needed to download one-by-one with all restrictions that we known.

Hope that help.

Tested and worked with FM 2012..

Cumps,
