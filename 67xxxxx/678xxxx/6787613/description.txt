Elmore James Slip Sliding Away
Released: 1999
Label: Dressed to Kill
Format:Flac

You can't go wrong with any James package and this budget set features 14 of his recordings for Bobby Robinson's brace of labels. With tortuous slow blues like "The Sky Is Crying," "Something Inside of Me," "Held My Baby Last Night," and "Anna Lee" and rockers like "Bobby's Rock," "Rollin' and Tumblin'," "Look on Yonders Wall," and the inevitable re-cut of "Dust My Broom," this isn't the definitive James package, but it's a darn good one.
