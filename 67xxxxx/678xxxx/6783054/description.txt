Additional Details:

There are other torrents on The Pirate Bay of the Fallout: New Vegas soundtrack but I found none to be in full and correctly tagged. So here, every track tagged by hand with the artists included. All files came directly from the game folder so feel free to just copy and paste from there but you will just have 48 unlabeled tracks.

Enjoy,
