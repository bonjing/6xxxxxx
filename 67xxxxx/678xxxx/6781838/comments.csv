,BinkyDeath,2012-01-15T19:33Z,"I seem to have trouble with most of sceneline's torrents and I've not downloaded this one - but wanted to say to the downloaders above... if it's not playing, then try updating your copy of VLC Media Player as this has always fixed any problems I've had with playing files in the past. I haven't noticed sceneline uploading fake torrents, but I don't like downloading films that have dozens of zipped folders which is why I don't usually bother with sceneline's torrents. Nevertheless, if you're happy with this torrent then try the fix I suggested. Bear in mind that this is labelled as a TeleSync (TS) though and there are Rips available now instead of TS's. ;)"
