  Joining Jools in the studio are our very own global rock superstars   
  Coldplay, returning to perform live on the show with songs from       
  their fifth album Mylo Xyloto after debuting tracks from it at        
  2011's headlining show at Glastonbury.                                
                                                                        
  Stephen Paul Manderson aka Professor Green, the Hackney-born rapper,  
  makes his debut on the show with songs from his second album At Your  
  Inconvenience, including hit single Read All About It featuring       
  Emeli Sande.                                                          
                                                                        
  Plus, The Waterboys, formed by Mike Scott in 1983, perform tracks     
  from their new album An Appointment With Mr Yeats, which features     
  the works of the Irish poet set to music.                             
                                                                        
  Also performing are The Phoenix Foundation from Wellington, New       
  Zealand. The band have been together for over a decade and enjoyed    
  success and acclaim in their homeland with their dreamy, synth-heavy  
  spin on Byrds/Beach Boys-style pop. Now they bring it to the UK       
  courtesy of the independent label Memphis Industries.
