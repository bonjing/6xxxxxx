,BelgTelg,2011-10-30T20:47Z,If I remember correctly this uploader caused a lot of anger because his files are labeled wrong (have a look in the DVDR top 100 ... ). Not sure it's the case here but be careful! 
,fuisp,2011-10-31T05:22Z,WITH the popping sound! Why upload this garbage you fucking cunt
,ninline,2011-11-02T00:43Z,I often wonder if the uploaders even watch the movies they upload.
