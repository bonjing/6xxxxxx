,Mathlol,2011-11-01T18:50Z,"Thanks for your time and work. 
As a long time video editor I must object to this release.  Reworking the picture color to personal tastes detracts from the original work. This is much different from trying to preserve picture definition at low files sizes
Please release an intact copy next time, thank you."

[T],honchorella31,2011-11-04T18:11Z,maybe i did go over the top but people need 2 understand taking sumthing that is 30gig + and getting it down 2 8gig drains color a little so u hav 2 add a little back. if u look at the screenshot comparison av not changed it that much just removed a little grain and added a touch of color. i like it think they look great on the ps3 and on my wdtv live. if people dont like it then fine but i hate been told 2 change wot i do.
,helgi71,2011-11-28T10:51Z,"Greetings, this looks great."
,vivatpb5776,2011-12-25T13:51Z,"Okay, now that tempers have calmed down, let me give a very objective review...

First, to the ""video editor,"" you are taking your role way too seriously. In my opinion, as someone who has seen upwards of 1500 HD quality movies, the color quality is comparable for the size of the file. Granted, it is not perfect nor would I consider the color comparable to a true BluRay release but, again, based on the size, it is good enough.

The screen resolution for all three movies is 1920*1038. This is slightly less than ideal as true 1080p is 1920*1080. This leaves small black boxes at the top and bottom of the viewing area. I test all movies on a 47"" LED HDTV. That all being said, the slightly less than perfect screen resolution does not take away from the overall quality of the movie.

Finally, we all have to realize that we are getting this stuff for free (not factoring in our monthly charge from our ISP). Don't knock someone for providing a .torrent that is less than what you may perceive as perfect. If you are not happy with what you see, download something else. If you do not have the bandwidth or hard drive space to do this, don't blame the uploader...buy a larger hard drive or get a better plan from your ISP.

Honchorella - I have downloaded several of your releases. Thank you for taking the time to provide this release to the masses."
