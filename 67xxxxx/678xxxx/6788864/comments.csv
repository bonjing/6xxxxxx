Where did you get it from?"
,Dragosbirsan,2011-11-02T05:57Z,Wow !!! awesome torrent thanks... love the soundtrack
,Reigefyre,2011-11-02T08:34Z,"Thanks for the upload. Please note, this is genuine, however the audio quality is around a 5 or 6 out of 10. Do not expect studio quality with this. I would HIGHLY recommend waiting on a release with higher fidelity if you are an audiophile."
,xaxax,2011-11-02T17:15Z,"The audio quality is perfect, better than 99% of the music out there crushed by bad recording/mastering/loudness war.

However : it's clearly lossy/mp3 sourced, whoever converted this to flac is an idiot and should be banned."
,elmfuzzy,2011-11-02T21:03Z,"@Reigefyre @xaxax

I totally agree. I would give you the link to the source but I can't find it :/"
,LiquidQC,2011-11-03T05:44Z,"Don't listen to Reigefyre, these are the files ripped straight from the game itself, its the best quality you can possibly get and there all about 320kbps.

Great torrent."
,andy1055,2011-11-03T09:55Z,"Thanks so much, great torrent, however the sound quality is more like 128kbs mp3, listening with audio technica AD900 headphones, there's no way this is 320kbs mp3 or flac. Oblivion or morrowind in game soundtrack has much better audio."
,xaxax,2011-11-03T14:48Z,"I think it was lower than 128k, myself."
,luceferian666,2011-11-03T20:20Z,"Bitrate is around 80-90 kbps (( 
Check it, every line is 1 Khz

,Reigefyre,2011-11-06T20:57Z,"@LiquidQC Yes, don't listen to the guy with top-tier Sennheiser headphones, I have no idea what I'm talking about. /sarcasm

I've been listening to orchestral and choral scores for decades, and there is NO WAY these are lossless unless the source files (perhaps from 360) are garbage, or the rip was poorly done.

There is clipping and distortion throughout. That's why I stated the quality is 5-6 out of 10. There are even some Beth videos on youtube that have much higher audio quality."
,latooots,2011-11-11T16:44Z,"Haven't downloaded this yet, but if this is the one from the game, then the source is not in high-quality. The files in-game are lossless but are of low quality recordings in the first place. For example, mus_maintheme is 3:55 long but is only 1.77 MB in the encrypted file. Uncompressed, it becomes 43.1 MB, but then since it is originally of low quality anyway then.. you get my point."
,PeterSteele,2011-11-13T13:21Z,Thank you sir.
,lksm,2011-11-21T01:05Z,"@Reigefyre You're right. And you don't even need to have a super awesome HD650 to notice it. My lowly ADDIEMs are brutally revealing of its nature.

I'll keep this around until a truly HQ one comes out."
,Zeratuhl,2011-11-29T23:12Z,"This was probably originally taken from the files used in-game, so although it may have been converted TO flac the original source is xwm, which is basically a bastardized version of wma and the files were never in a particularly amazing bitrate. So until an official soundtrack comes out this is the best we'll get."
,Zeratuhl,2011-11-29T23:14Z,"Duh... Just looked at the contents of the rar, and yeah it's taken from the game's original xwm files. Any quality issues can be blamed on Bethesda for not using a higher quality bitrate or format for the game's music. Though I can kinda see why they did it, since it avoids the need to use a second dvd for retail versions of the game."
