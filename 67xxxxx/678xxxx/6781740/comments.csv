,hedwerk,2011-11-03T12:09Z,"I too am getting a virus warning on SETUP.EXE. take a look here for the scan result:

whilst i can appreciate that a CRACK may give a false positive - a setup.exe file giving these results is very suspicious to me, especially as I have NEVER had this kind of warning with ANY other reloaded or other scene release. Im not knocking the uploader b4 anyone flames!! Just checking first...

Any thoughts anyone?"

To people who are getting virus positives on ""setup.exe"" - I got bad news for you: YOUR system is already infected and it has nothing to do with THIS torrent."
