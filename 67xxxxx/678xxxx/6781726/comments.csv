,MC26,2011-11-10T05:13Z,"Amazing all the haters out there.  No its not DVD quality but hey, its in the theaters still and you are getting it for free.  If it doesn't work, its probably on your end.  Try using VLC media player, its like your golden ticket to downloaded movies.

Thanks to the uploader, I really appreciate you posting this."

V:4.5

Audio is pretty good, but the video can be incredibly fuzzy at times. Played with no problems using VLC."
,elc2k,2012-01-17T21:39Z,"the darkness is fine. it's the 5-20 seconds scenes of blurriness that become unbearable, especially at the san ricardo bank scene. i will wait til a real rip comes out before i ruin the experience with this watery eyed wishy washy waste of time. MANUAL FOCUS!!"
