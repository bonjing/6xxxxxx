Imagine with me what life would be like if the Arab/Muslim world united their resources and armies and defeated our armies in Iraq and Afghanistan.  In the negotiations for 
peace, our nation was required to pay a fine of $4 trillion dollars that devastated our economy. Our once powerful country is defeated by its enemies and humiliated by the Peace Treaty. Hunger and poverty surround you. What little money your family has is worth less every day. Inflation is out of control.  Some of your friends live in the street because they canâ€™t afford to pay the rent, and you wonder if your family will be next. Things continue to get worse and the government seems unable to stop the downward spiral.  The government leaders are inept, and demoralizing.  A once proud nation has been brought very low.  But then, something happens.  It seems almost messianic but suddenly, a man enters the political arena and promises to change everything. And while you are skeptical at first, you soon change your mind because you see that poverty and hunger begin to ease as more food and jobs are available.  Once again Americans can hold their heads high and be proud of their country and their heritage. Patriotism runs high and Americans can once again unite for a common goal--the good of their country.  Who is this man? What I am describing is not something that simply could happen, it is something that has already happened.  The country is not America, the country is Germany and the man, is Adolph Hitler.  However, Hitler's brand of prosperity comes at the cost of persecution and eventual death to those who oppose or disagree with him.

Why do I bring this up?  April 9, 2011 was the 66th anniversary of the 
execution of Dietrich Bonhoeffer by the Nazis. He died at 39, but left a legacy in his writings that now, 60 years later, still provide valuable insight for Christians seeking to live faithfully to the Gospel in a culture dominated by hostile ideologies.
