Second, maybe a dumb question, but does anyone know what happened to episode 5 of this series? The only avail download is 1.38 gigs, and that's from a guy with no skull? Did I miss something?

Thanks!"

AlexSupertrampOriginal: I got S03E05 from The Torrent Zone (torrent zone.net) rather than the 1.38gb file here. Currently accepting new members..."
