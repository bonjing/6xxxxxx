,vinniep,2011-10-31T13:59Z,from my experience eztv = legit torrents with high quality
,Zoowee,2011-10-31T14:40Z,It's the real deal. Video quality is ok. Not as good as previous releases of the series. Watchable though.
,7-Phoenix,2011-10-31T15:02Z,You guys should know that the video quality isn't good.........it's EZTV... awesome :D
,Cheyenne-tgy,2011-10-31T15:16Z,thanks mate.
,x0fx3,2011-10-31T15:20Z,Anyone else having a problem with this torrent? I never had a problem like this before. Once it got to 100% I opened up the folder and the file was marked as .!ut at the end. Normally utorrent removes that after it's done. So I thought that's odd so I forced a recheck and it came back 100% so I removed the .!ut and tried to play it but nothing played.  I dl'd another show and it plays fine. Strange...
,TerFar,2011-10-31T15:21Z,"Yet again, the sound track is absolute crap. Will you please stop using auto sound levelling on the sound track. The background sounds simply get pumped up to intrusive high levels in quiet passages. 

Very disappointing again."
,Candlegoat,2011-10-31T16:01Z,Sound leveling is indeed the same as last week; extremely annoying. 
,x0fx3,2011-10-31T16:08Z,I redownloaded it and it works this time.
,indiyet,2011-10-31T16:13Z,tanks man!!!

fake torrent 

there is someway to report this fucking liar? do not talk shit about people doing her best and giving free high quality to us, so give some respect fucking asshole.."
,DjBeau,2011-10-31T17:34Z,"Terfar: Yes, the sound is incredibly bad! I've been wanting to contact the uploader / ripper but I don't know how. 

Does anyone know who to contact and how?"
,Mayals,2011-10-31T18:33Z,the best torrents n will always be the best :D
,PauloFran,2011-10-31T18:59Z,"Low video quality for 720p.
The episode itself was good."
,SantiagoCCC,2011-10-31T19:25Z,"I appreciate all the effort, but like the previous episodes the quality is just bad. Video quality is not 720p and sound is just horrible."
,somedayyy,2011-10-31T21:53Z,"TO ALL WITH SOUND PROBLEMS:
with VLC, right click on screen when you have the movie loaded

>audio device
>set it to stereo

Rot in hell

eztv is the best"

Thanks for the heads-up; this is my single biggest pet peeve with movies and TV shows.  Thought last week might just be an anomaly, but now I'm getting my copy elsewhere.  Shame, since eztv usually has such excellent quality..."
,lazuri,2011-11-01T06:47Z,"Thanks for the Upload.  
A9
V5 for HD. 

For 913MB 720p the Video Quality is Poor, very grainy. you can even see the video encoding slowly becoming more grainy then it suddenly resets to a clear image and slowly becomes grainy again, This happens through the full episode in a 15 second loop.   "
,lazuri,2011-11-01T06:52Z,"The Audio is Fine. 
No delay and no problem with background noise. 

Tested with Media Player Classic Home theater and VLC. "
,lazuri,2011-11-01T06:57Z,"Perfect for Watching,
 just not a keeper for 720p   

Thanks Again for the Upload"
,Painweaver,2011-11-01T07:14Z,At first I thought these Hi Res TV cut of TWD were just as good as the 350mb versions.  This isn't true.  People thinking this isn't good quality may not realize that AMC has added a grain to the video to add the classic 70's horror feel to it.  I think it's a dumb idea but it's there's at the start and ours now.  Don't like the quality make it better it's available.  EZTV u rock.  I still wish these were MP$ format though.

,BARRDOGG,2011-11-01T22:38Z,am not getting a picture bro :S any advice ?
,artvandelay2007,2011-11-01T23:43Z,"I have the 1.6GB Web-DL version which is much much better.
I won't put it on here though. Too many people bitch at my connection speed."
,TerFar,2011-11-02T10:08Z,"I agree with el_muerte17. The sound is CRAP again.  The (quiet) background sounds get pumped up to a disturbingly high level during passages when no one is talking.

I'll test with the 'stereo' setting using VLC to see if it helps as suggested by somedayyy"
,TerFar,2011-11-03T16:54Z,"The sound track workaround (setting to the Stereo tracks) doesn't work. I feed the audio to the Media Centre over S/P-dif, so I cannot use any other setting than A52 over S/P-dif.

I do appreciate that someone is making the effort to record, convert and upload this for other users, but all they need to do is to set the audio to a fixed level."
,tofushoyu,2011-11-03T20:13Z,"Thanks again, EZTV!"
,DismantleRepair,2011-11-04T08:41Z,"The people whining about the audio are correct; there is dynamic range compression being applied to the source material, which absolutely ruins quiet scenes.

With regards to the video, it is important to note that it was a conscious decision to shoot the series using 8mm film cameras, which have a significant amount of grain. Under high compression such as these 1GB episode releases, the subtle flickering grain effect is compressed into a a distracting pool of artifacts. The only way to solve this is to lower the compression, which is why I'm going to wait until someone can do a responsible Blu-ray rip at a much higher quality level to display the grain as it was intended to be viewed by the cinematographers."
,MagicalHerpies,2011-11-07T09:10Z,"@DismantleRepair
Just download and watch it you picky fuck. 
""it's got graaaiin"" 
You're a faggot."
,mohiergauth,2011-11-07T12:04Z,"Tired of whiny noobs. Tired of crap ups, that's why I only DL eztv ups! Never had any issues withem. Then again I have VLC, FF, and WMPC. And am also not a noob who gets ass hurt when something doesn't work right away.
"
,AndroidLove,2011-11-10T06:36Z,@ eztv: Would you be uploading the S02E04? There's an upload from 'eTtv' which seems to be missing the ending and there doesn't seem to be any alternative to it. Was wondering if you would be uploading your version as you have in the past?
,Dylan7291,2011-11-16T11:36Z,Why isn't there an upload for s02e04 or s02e05 from eztv so far....? =[ Have they decided to stop that series or something?
,anal_fissure,2011-11-20T16:01Z,"Why is the background noise so horribly loud, and why is this the only show with this problem?"
,lemn8,2011-11-29T11:28Z,"For me Audio is more important then video quality. If there is a 5.1 channel dolby digital stream why would you downgrade it to stereo? As long eztv doesn't listen to the complains the score remains:  V: 7
A: 2"
,craddle,2011-12-21T14:31Z,"All of you idiots kept complaining and complaining and see what happen? eztv stopped uploading The Walking Dead. Stupid ungrateful bastards.

Oh well, I guess I'll download the rest from another source."
