,bumba2,2011-11-27T07:54Z,"it is working perfect,no prob at all.on win 7 32 bit.thanks once again-blackbox.

@daucuskarota-i dont know what ur talking abt.guys there is no such thing like babylon or something like that i found.its just clean install as other blackbox releases."
,daucuskarota,2011-11-27T12:05Z,"@bumba2
I'm not lying, just asking for some confirmation. Indeed I didn't give a -1 for this torrent.

After mounting the iso, a pop-up for setup comes up and some Babylon 9 toolbar installation stuff appears. If you decline it the whole process ends. This also occurred when you run the setup.exe not just only by the autorun
If you succeed installing the game just tell me how you do it, please "

,sanu911,2012-05-06T03:43Z,"This game is just off the rack............Amazing game ....... I completed the game ........The game is very much fun 2 play for hours ..........Download it ,, & Not 2 worry this game has no BUGS Or glitches ............."
,tweaker61,2012-05-25T19:15Z,"Ok so @ bumba2 Yes there is a babylon, its part of the installer for some weird reason, along with some other program, and apparently, The game. Which im starting to doubt, its a rather odd installer, first i made sure to click off the babylon stuff so it wont install, clicked next, it said it was gonna install some weird program that i could uninstall later, clicked next and nothing. Went back did it again this time clicked no on soem stuff, tried installing babylon, clicked next, and instead this time it just closed, so...yea, theres something wrong with your torrent. 

Either these people who are commenting saying it works, are lying or something. Because 1, there is a babylon toolbar trying to install from the installer, and 2 its not installing anything because it keeps closing. So

Whats up?"
,tweaker61,2012-05-25T19:22Z,"Ok got it to work. Mount it and move the contents of the iso on to your desktop and click the setup.exe and another setup.exe should appear called setupb.exe just run that

Was that so hard ppl? you couldnt have just told us how to do it? 

Well anyone who was having problems, there you go"
