,bucknastee,2011-11-01T20:07Z,"This is episode 5. Episode 6 isn't until November 7th. Either way thanks for the upload eztv, they are always good."
,ArkAngel666,2011-11-01T21:27Z,"@bucknastee You're both wrong and right actually...

Technically this is episode six, as the premiere consisted of episodes one and two.

But in numerical order of how many have been aired on TV, then this would, in fact, be number five."
