Blackwater is an intense, cinematic shooter experience unlike anything
you've ever played before. Lead a team of Blackwater Operators protecting a
fictional North African town, battling dangerous warlords and fighting back
two opposing militia forces. Using the motion-sensing Kinect controller
players can do everything from moving their character to aiming and firing
a weapon as you work your way through pressure-filled missions. The game is
also playable with a standard controller.

Blackwater Real Combat Tactics: Employ Blackwater military tactics as
you learn to handle potentially lethal scenarios like entering hostile
facilities, avoiding enemy ambushes or protecting friendly convoys.
Kinect or Traditional Controllers: Be the first to take on the next
generation of third-person shooters, as you use your entire body to fully
immerse yourself in the action - or use traditional controls for a more
conventional gaming experience.
More than 25 different Kinect moves: From shooting to ducking, throwing
grenades or protecting VIPs, use the full range of body moves and expertise
vital to be a professional operator.

Mossberg, Spetnaz and Blaser provide an arsenal of firearms.
Choose Multiple Mission Paths: Pick the mission-path that best suits
your individual and team members skills, and enjoy enhanced replayability.
