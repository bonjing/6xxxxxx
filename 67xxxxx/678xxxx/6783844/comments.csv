[T],Jon.Pson,2011-10-30T22:26Z,I'm working on a transcript of this movie. It will be found at http://subscene.com/members/JnPson/default.aspx in a few days. This is because I haven't been able to find any good translation for it.

,jazon333,2012-02-07T15:36Z,I guess you gave up on the transcript. I still can't find any good english transcript. Every damn one I find is based on a crappy translation ;(
