This album's concept is "If Takumi and Peter make the song for a quiet midnight".
With naive voice and quiet melody, Takumi & Peter delicately presents
the calm mid-night,and then "Quiet night" would surrounds and lull the audience.

Takumi Uesaka
He made the midnight like a planetarium.Sentimental and glimmer sound.
Peter Broderick says"Takumi's songs . . . like a dream . . .

"Peter Broderick
In this "glimmer", all his pieces are recorded at Grunewald church in
Berlin(Recorded by Nils Frahm).
Adding the peculiar atmosphere to church and reverberation to his
pieces,his pieces ever more simple and deeply resounding.
The pieces in this album are truely for the "night".
You will find yourself laid back and eyes shut,and deeply absorbed into his world.
