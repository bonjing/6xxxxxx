You Sound Like You Got Bi-polar."
,SoxPatsFanInKC,2011-11-12T23:05Z,What I was talking about is that when you put this file in Itunes it reads the album artist as www.djleak.com. This is not the first torrent of yours like this. My question is why you insist on putting your name in the album info like you're involved in the creation of the music.
