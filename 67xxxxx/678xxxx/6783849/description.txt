Restore the memory of a magical kingdom in this exciting twist on solitaire from the creators of Magic Inlay. Armed with only a deck of cards, it's up to you to bring this fantasy land back to life. Place classic playing cards on the board following one simple rule: place cards next to another one with a value of one less or one greater, regardless of the suit! It's easy to learn and play, but saving the day is another matter altogether.
