,redactedwv,2011-11-02T21:17Z,"Irony is truly dead.

All you Randian haters of ""parasites"", ""moochers"", and ""looters"" might want to google 'Ann O'Connor Rand Medicare' if you're at all interested in the glaring hypocrisy of Ayn Rand. It illustrates rather perfectly the intellectual bankruptcy of her philosophies, and the logical chasms that their adherents are required to ignore.

Hope no one is confused as to what Rand's (public) opinion of The Pirate Bay would be. You're all guilty of STEALING her intellectual PROPERTY, and the labor/investment capital of everyone involved with the making of the movie. 

Tsk tsk tk. Isn't it inconvenient to practice what this witch preached in her clunky, awkward, heavy-handed books.

But do keep on sharing this anti-sharing shite on a collectivist site, y'myopic asshats. "
,scflats,2011-11-03T16:10Z,redactedwv - your whining and liberal tears sustain me.  Thanks.
,redactedwv,2011-11-03T19:19Z,"Left, not Liberal. There's a difference, wingnut.

Regardless...lol....that's it? Called out for blatant hypocrisy and that's what you've got? A lazy, weak dodge if ever i've read one.

[Not that it would be easy to defend either yourself (the ""conservative"" thieving/sharing intellectual ""property""), or The Medicare Bandit - 'Ann O'Connor' - on the merits, i grant you.]"
,the_sha,2011-11-03T20:57Z,"redactedwv you are a fucking moron Ayn Rand was entitled to take back from the state what the state already took from her by force.

Your position is as absurd as a man feeling guilty of taking back his property from a thief.

Ann Connor was Ayn Rand's married name you complete buffon, I bet you thought she was ""hidding her identity"".

Ayn Rand would support the Pirate Bay, you know why? because its a voluntary network of people freely sharing backups of what they already owned, if someone uses it to ""steal"" property its not the site's fault. 

Furthermore if people want to share their property with others it is their right to do so, specially when they make available a movie with limited distribution, I can understand an idiot like you would be afraid of Rand's message spreading too far.

""Left, not Liberal. There's a difference""

True but I know you dont know it.

""the conservative thieving/sharing intellectual property""

Libertarian not conservative, there is a difference you know."
,FluffyBunyAlpha,2011-11-05T05:41Z,"@redactedwv  You come to a pirate website just to rant about how what we are doing is wrong. You must be a complete retard if you think that spamming junk like you did would change any of our minds. besides, I'll start feeling bad about pirating when the government starts felling bad about homeless people.

How many times have you seen an actor come on TV begging people to send money to haiti, those bastards have more money then they know what to do with and they are asking middle and low class to give up what little they have just so they can keep their pockets full?

it goes the same with the people that made this movie, they didn't even come up with the story but they are making money on an un-origanal movie. If we really think about it (by your logic) every time someone steals an idea they are ""asshats"" so to speak.

Look at it like this, our troops are making less then entertainers. Entertainment is the number one ""cash crop"" in the United States"" and the people that get the money didn't really do anything except make another reason for people to sit on their lazy asses and do nothing. I can guarantee that most of the people that actually do accomplish something that is consider progression towards our future (for example: loaders of big rigs (with out truckers we would not have food in cities) probably get paid 8 bucks an hour) get paid way less then actors that only play pretend and do drugs. 

that is why you are an idiot, and that is why I do not feel bad about pirating movies."
,PGHammer21B,2011-11-08T04:08Z,"If you read Rand's book, she *properly* equates unions and corporations (Big Business and Big Labor) as two sides of the same coin - the difference between ""Atlas Shrugged"" and other anti-establishment books of her lifetime is that it was the idea men (the Carnegies and Edisons) that went on strike.  If you read the Wikipedia entry on Rand, you'll find that, despite her leftist leanings, she was no socialist or communist - in fact, she despised both equally; John Stossel (currently of Fox News Channel and Fox Business, and formerly of ABC News) is the closest thing to a modern Randian today. (His own special on Rand is also posted on TPB.)"
,Z@RDOZ,2011-11-11T13:15Z,@redactedwv...u sound like some sort of american inbreed...i guess the wv after redacted stands for west virginia...the state where inbreeding is the norm....
,miss_understood666,2011-11-12T12:08Z,Finally! Thank you!

Alternatively, he has better things to do than argue with morons on torrent sites. Slink back to your troll cave.

Thanks for the up."
,Bonesman1990,2011-11-18T00:34Z,"This ""Atlas"" is proud to say he ""shrugged"" years ago, right after Papa Bush ranted in '91 about the New World Order.

Collectivism is weakness en masse, while voluntarism is strength in numbers. BIG difference.

The USSR only fell to the even more corrupt USSA and, as a libertarian and constitutional purist (abolish EVERYTHING after the tenth amendment), I am ready to RECLAIM & RESTORE our lost republic the way we did it in 1776.

A weak sozi coward's ""terrorist"" is a brave man's ""patriot.""
"
,Bonesman1990,2011-11-18T00:40Z,"Oh yeah!


Thank you, Hero_No_1, for this highly anticipated offering!

You do the world beneficial service (that even 'Howard Roarke' would approve of) when you encourage individuals to BE individuals by sharing the gospels of individualism.

Let freedom ring!"
,READmyCOMMENTbich,2011-11-20T07:24Z,"redactedwv People are flawed. Actually hold up, people are fucking retarded, the left the right, they both suck each other's cocks and fuck each other up the ass at will, they are nothing more than bloods and crips.
Long Story Short: the IDEA that this movie portraits is fantastic. People are flawed, but every once in a while one of them has a really good idea."
,Pharos01,2011-11-22T18:42Z,Nice to know what that bullsh#t is. Really is this where they get their ideas from. Poor Rand Paul. What a name to heritage!
,spankdaddy,2011-12-08T03:49Z,jesus ... stop the total bs about the movie critics and just fucken rate the audio and video... holy hell.

As expected from the Blu-ray rip, Video and Audio are flawless. The film is not bad, certainly not as terrible as the critics would have you believe but it would be best if you've read the book already, regardless of whether or not you agree with Randian philosophy. Interesting, enjoyable, and relevant. Hope you like the film!"
,kartowkxyt,2012-01-06T07:11Z,"Crazy movie (as crazy as that Rand woman) but fun to watch. It gives a boner to yuppies who think they are the salt of the earth and without them all would collapse. I can already see the second part. The John Galt Atlantis geniuses finally succeed and dictate conditions to the oppressing federal government when the whole economy collapses and create a golden era of unbridled capitalism where anybody can make as much money as they want and to hell the rest of the population. As if it wasnt that way now and in the last two centuries, but hell, they feel threatened by government limitations. Rand=greed without restrictions, that just wont work, the whole idea is ridiculous but lets have fun watching those yuppies wet dreams."
,Stakrina,2012-01-14T07:06Z,Thanks Hero#1!
,elitecrusher,2012-02-12T23:35Z,"Yeah i agree with spank, stop the rubbish abnd rate the movie.. Dumb asses love to talk shit.."

As much as the message is extremely off balance, I liked the book, and I like this film almost as much. It is after all, a work of FICTION. And for everyones edification, Morgan, and his ilk, never had one original idea on how to do things. 

SO hilarious to see ""men"" who probably don't even know what a planer is to argue about who gets things done in this world. Learn how to build a cabinet from rough milled wood before you start talking about getting things done.

And how quickly you turn on each other over outdated and useless philosophies. When the lights DO go out, it might be helpful to know how to make things with muscle power. And knowing how to brew your own beer will be something worth more than gold when the lights go out."
,xMajesticMeteorx,2012-03-16T21:35Z,"I am willing to eat the pussy and suck the tittie and fuck all female relatives of Ann Rand, for free.
That is my only obligation for downloading this piece of Jewish produced CRAP!"
