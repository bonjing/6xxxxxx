Mirror Mirror is a pretty cool comic that I recently stumbled upon.

"The Magic Mirror from the Snow White fairy tale was shattered and its pieces hidden across the globe, to be protected by a secret society known as the Huntsmen. Owen Bullfinch, racing against a secret society, searches for the pieces before the mirror can be rebuilt and used for evil."
Enjoy and seed
