The government recently mailed a copy of this to the school where I teach, and so I have just copied the content of the disk into a standard file folder and presented it as a torrent. The information is freely and simply available from the government website, but it is presented a little more cleanly in this format.

The Statistical Abstract of the United States is a publication of the United States Census Bureau, an agency of the United States Department of Commerce. Published annually since 1878, the statistics describe social and economic conditions in the United States.

In 1975 a two volume Historical Statistics of the United States, Colonial Times to 1970 Bicentennial Edition was published.

The 2010 (129th Edition) Statistical Abstract of the United States contains 30 sections, 926 pages and over 1300 individual tables covering over 200 topics including income and wealth, imports-exports, agriculture, energy production and consumption, natural resources and some international comparisons. All information is downloadable in PDF and Excel spreadsheet formats. The statistical abstract is the standard summary of statistics on the social, political, and economic organization of the United States. It is also designed to serve as a guide to other statistical publications and sources.
