Misfits returns for the third series, and new kid on the block Rudy gets a rude awakening in his first few days of community service, learning that with the keys to the infamous locker room comes a great deal of running, screaming and, in some instances, killing. But that really is the least of his worries. More pressing is just how to keep his secret superpower, well, secret. And is it super? As in, is it from the A-List? The rest of the gang are also back with all-new powers. So, just how did that trade-off with Seth the superpower dealer go down? You'd hope that at least one of them has a power approaching something halfway useful. Is Simon any closer to fulfilling his destiny as Superhoodie? And just where does he learn to do all that nifty parkour? With Seth still trading powers, zombies on the loose, havoc being wreaked with events from the past and present, things haven't got any quieter for the gang.
