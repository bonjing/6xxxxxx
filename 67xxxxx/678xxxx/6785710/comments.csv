Application has stopped unexpectedly. Please try again."
,a-spot,2011-11-02T22:38Z,"Cant working, too small (size) program.
Working one Navigon V3.6.0 with european maps needs about 2.7GB....
Perhaps some copy errors has occured during cracking?"

,re1850,2011-11-03T23:24Z,"Is it possible to just install this APK,and the already installed maps from v3.6will be working..or is there a completly new download of all maps needed? My v3.6 stopped working after upgrade to Gingerbread on LG Optimus 2x (P990)"
,JackieDan,2011-11-04T11:42Z,"Works great on Galaxy S2.
Here's how you do it,

First make sure you have Navigon 3.6 installed. I had the version: Navigon.MobileNavigator.Europe BY JOE.v.3.6.0.apk. After you downloaded all the maps (v3.6), you're good to install the new version which is Navigon 4.0.

Download this one, install the program (it will ask if you want to substitute the old - click yes). 

Done!"
,nissenhj,2011-11-04T21:09Z,It doesn't work if you don't have data enabled and you can not disable all the permissions asosiated with internet(wifi or gprs) with permissions denied that you can do with navigon 3.6.0
,chrisgall,2011-12-15T22:56Z,Can anyone upload the 4.0.1 version please???
,Iztok67,2011-12-28T16:31Z,"4.0.1 works WITHOUT need for data connection. You can download it from ""Blackdroid.net"" in ""Apps"" section"
