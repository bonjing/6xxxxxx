This is the first fully illustrated book about U-boats to combine first-class commissioned photographs and artwork with narrative eyewitness accounts by crewman so enabling the reader to acquire as accurate and redolent a picture of life in the U-boat arm as is possible within the covers of a book. The author, a well-known U-boat historian, has pieced together the technical details of the roles of individual crew members with extensive first-hand reports, many drawn from previously unpublished oral histories.
