History Documentary hosted by Ian Wright, published by Travel Channel broadcasted as part of TC Short History of The World series in 1998 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

The first fleet of ships carrying 700 convicts left England in 1787 on a 15,000mile voyage from Portsmouth Harbour via Rio de Janeiro and Cape Town to Botany Bay in Australia. Ian Wright sails in the wake of these reluctant global explorers to discover exactly what their voyage was like. He learns the tactics of the pressgangs - spiking rum with opium to ensnare their victims being a particular favourite. Ian also visits Port Arthur in Tasmania where he hears about experimental punishments designed to 'break the convict spirit' and turn the men into model citizens. He also heads for Norfolk Island off the coast of New South Wales where the prison was reportedly so brutal that convicts would rather commit mass suicide than be imprisoned there.
