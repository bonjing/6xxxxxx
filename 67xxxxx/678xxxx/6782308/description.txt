Michael Jackson - Thriller (converted from FLAC) 320k + bonus track

We compared a number of different versions of this album out
there - even flac from DTS, related wav files, remastered mp3s, regular
flacs, mp3s etc and found distortion all too often at high levels in the
samples we found.

Finally we came across great sounding flac iles which were huge and bulky
and had too much other material in the folder - so here we are with just
as great a sound quality in my own view with this experience too, with
this set of mp3s instead. With what you save on bandwidth using these mp3s
rather than bulky flacs, we managed a great bonus track of a beautiful song.

Thriller was one of the best albums of its time and belongs with the stuff
of disco as part of the same overall memory for those of that period of
growing up - or having fun!
