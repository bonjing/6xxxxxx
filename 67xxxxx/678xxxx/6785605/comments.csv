,AARRGG,2011-11-02T05:45Z,"when will recorders learn not to have their auto focus set to on when recording these telesynks?? it makes it go out and back into focus all throughout the movie. sound is good even for this format.  that is why i am giving the video a 4 rating and the sound a 9.  
.bone , thanks for the vid, nice work as usual but please have a word to your sources about this issue because it seems to happen alot and not just from your stuff. "

,kelv1969,2011-11-03T12:40Z,I agree about camera operators expecting the auto functions on their camera to be the best setting. Much better to use manual focus and then when the screen goes dark or light the camera wont try to change focus and ruin the result. I would have thought it was blooming obvious! Gadget freaks who don't actually know how best to use their equipment. lol
