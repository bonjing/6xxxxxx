,Lustrum0005,2011-10-31T19:11Z,"The Video is amazing in this up load, but the audio is recorded a little on the quiet side. Either way, this is still a very good up load, you can hear everything, and the image is so crisp.. Thanks up loader. "
,BadBreaker,2011-11-01T02:15Z,Thanks for seeding on this one guys. Keep it up. Will seed as long as possible so everyone can enjoy this.
,c3bhm,2011-11-02T22:02Z,"GOOD LORD: The encoding has a frame-rate that is butter-smooth, somehow. Incredible effect and perfect for this kind of fight-action where you want to be able to see every tiny little movement. Amazing. Big Ups to RUDOS. Seriously impressed. Itâs kind of like going from 60hz to 120hz on an LCD-HDTV."
