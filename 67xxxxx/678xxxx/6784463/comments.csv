Double checked & does it every time so pretty sure it's not my comp....Just wanted to let you know. But thanks for the up, still appreciated :)"

There is a repeat of the episode in a few days in the early evening on Showcase. If you know anyone in 2HD remind them this episode needs to be RERiP'd."
,dumbasstheives,2011-10-31T08:44Z,"Yeah it aired like that it seems. Showcase are a bunch of fuckups who can't play back a tape to save their ass.

Last week they played the wrong tape and this week, their tape was glitched. What are they using 1980s VHS. 

I'm sure 2HD will hear about this. They seem pretty responsible and usually address any mistakes.

The producers addressed last week's issue on their twitter feed. I hope they will this time too."
,canefanus,2011-10-31T09:14Z,I can live with the glitches.  I really like this show.  Thanks a million to the uploader.
,aiigghht,2011-10-31T09:46Z,"thanks tvteam, this is downloading very slowly though. "
,Evilution,2011-10-31T16:29Z,"good to know the glitch is from the source, since same glitch was in the 720p release."
