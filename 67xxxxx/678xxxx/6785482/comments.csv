,grenole,2011-10-31T17:12Z,"ettv? That's a little low the way you're blatantly trying to mislead people into thinking you're EZTV... Anyway, as for this upload, it's garbage. ASAP released the actual SD XViD version about 5 hours ago... And if DiViSiON is even a real group then this release would be nuked due to the audio problems and it being undersized for episode length (should be 550mb)."
,Deepkamal,2011-10-31T17:35Z,"c'mmon, without download how can u question the upload? and for your kind information size of file doesnt not only depend upon episode length, there are things in this world called codec and compression,, look it up"
,grenole,2011-10-31T18:17Z,"There is also something called Scene Standards, that all real scene groups have to adhere to. Look it up. This doesn't follow scene standards ergo is not scene and should not be labeled as such."
