Step 1. Get a Program called ""MOVAVI VIDEO CONVERTER 11""
In PRESET chose ""MKV for DVD quality video (*.mkv)"" 
(MKV are also known as ""Matroska Video File"")
(This will rid the file of Hardcoded subs)

Step 2. Use ""AVS VIDEO CONVERTER"" to convert the ""MKV File"" back to an ""AVI File"".

If A MKV File is subcoded use ""VSO.Convert.X.to.DVD.3""(Or a Current Version)
click on Setting, chose subtitles then click on ""Text subtitles rendering settings""
in the :Colors - Contrast: set all 4 to 0 ""use the mouse set them to 0"" then click on ""OK""
this will convert the File to VOB's (DVD FILES)
To convert the VOB back to an AVI File use ""AVS VIDEO CONVERTER"" 
""Only chose one VOB File to convert"" that VOB should be called ""VTS_01_0"""
