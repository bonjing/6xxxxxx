 Album Info..: 
 
 Conceivably, the two aspirations could have been divided between the two records, but instead they are just thrown into the blender -- it's just a coincidence that I is a harder-rocking record than II. Stradlin has a stronger presence on I, contributing three of the best songs -- "Dust n' Bones," "You Ain't the First," and "Double Talkin' Jive" -- which help keep the album in Stonesy Aerosmith territory. On the whole, the album is stronger than II, even though there's a fair amount of filler, including a song that takes its title from the Osmonds' biggest hit, and a dippy psychedelic collaboration with Alice Cooper. But it also has two ambitious set pieces, "Novermber Rain" and "Coma," which find Rose fulfilling his ambitions, as well as the ferocious, metallic "Perfect Crime," and the original version of the power ballad "Don't Cry."
