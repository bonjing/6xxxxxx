Storyline:


Legendary filmmakers Steven Speilberg and JJ Abrams join forces in this extraordinary tale of friendship, mystery, and adventure. Super 8 tells the story of six friends who accidentally film a train wreck only to discover that something unimaginable escaped during the crash. Now, the only thing more mysterious than what it is - is what it wants. Experience the film that critics rave is, "filled with unstoppable imagination and visual effects to spare. It will put a spell on you." - Peter Travers, Rolling Stone
