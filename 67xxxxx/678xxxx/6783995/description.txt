This was converted to FLAC level 8 in Sony Vegas Pro 11. That was then converted to Apple Lossless using dbPoweramp. The audio is broken up by song, and all necessary ID3 tags are already created. I also created a custom album cover, which is already on the files, but is included if you want it for your collection.

The two versions are in seperate folders inside one folder, so you don't have to download both if you don't want to. But no matter what you download, please remember as much as you can. Thanks!!!
