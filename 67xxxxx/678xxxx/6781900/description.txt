**SPECIAL NOTE** For all my followers of my torrents, I have had many requests
asking if its still possible to continue providing these torrent for 2012 when 
the F1 coverage moves to SKY SPORTS. 

I am pleased to announce that i WILL NOW be continuing to upload the 
Formula 1 for 2012 as I have invested in new Satellite Equipment & Motorised Dish
which will enable me to provide the 12 Races the BBC has agreed in its contract 
to cover for 2012, in Full HD.

For the remaining Races, I will be uploading SKY SPORTS coverage of every
Practice Sessions, Qualifying & Race also in Full HD.. (Im just hoping SKY
keep to their promise and keep the commercials out of their coverage!)

Looking Forward To 2012! 

Enjoy, TheBlackKnight
