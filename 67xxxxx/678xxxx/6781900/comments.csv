,plumber576,2011-10-30T20:48Z,is this JUST qualifying? Or is this the race?
,Quattrox,2011-10-30T20:51Z,Thank you. Waiting for the race ;)
,ytrewq4321,2011-10-30T21:50Z,2012 is going to be a good year! Many thanks!!
,digimike50,2011-10-31T09:22Z,"Hey, BlackKnight: I want to thank you for not only the quality but for your consistency - those of us who are away from the UK need that (which you provide). Now you have made a big investment to provide for us next year ... MANY thank you's - truly! I thought that next year might well be a problem - but not now, thanks to you. Could I ask you to consider a second level of service, for those who have inferior internet structures in the country where they live? I downloaded your (excellent) Quali - but it took 2 days. Now, with ONLY 7 (but 1312 leechers!!!) seeds, your race coverage will take OVER a week! Could you also provide a normal resolution for those of us I have described? A cheek to ask, I know - but you would sweep the market. I have checked for months, now and the normal res stuff is heavily used, when available. Thanks again, for your great service and dedication - you are set to become a legend in Torrent Up-loaders! Thanks - DigiMike"
