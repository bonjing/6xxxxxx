Storyline:
Two young women arrive at a curious penthouse apartment, led by one's crush on her tutor. However, her love interest doesn't live alone.
He's part of a trio of computer hackers about to embark on the ultimate job on the world's most mysterious mainframe.
Whilst doing so, they unlock more than they bargain for with supernatural and ultimately fatal results.
Can this seemingly insignificant chain of events, which have thrown this group together, be construed as fate? Can the beacon provide
a signal of hope or is it a web of manipulation, paranoia and ultimately... murder?
