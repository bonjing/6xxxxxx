[T],zeromancer,2012-01-24T19:44Z,you should lay off the weed.
,nosing_glass,2012-02-17T23:58Z,"your attitude towards several top uploaders (yifi, anoxmous, icbane, greatmagican, just to name some) has proven apart from a lack of manners that you have no idea what you are talking about (technical understanding of definitions, possibilities regarding the right codecs, the reasons for a balance of quality and size) but i doubt you actually downloaded some of the stuff you're trying to degrade.

[T],zeromancer,2012-02-20T16:56Z,"I have actually downloaded the suff. If you believe me or not, I couldnt care less.

It's quite annoying that tpb has fallen so much conserning quality. 
I just point out the obvious.

If you believe that 800kbps is good HD quality, you are sorely mistaken. Its crap.

If you dont like it, it's not really my problem. It's freedom of speech.

Just deal with it."
,Twilight909,2012-02-24T01:23Z,Thanks for the videos. I appreciate it.
,nosing_glass,2012-03-03T21:39Z,"knock knock. just some time to kill so here we go:

since u're denying it (your REM upload, remember?): 720p is a HDTV format. just try wikipedia and u'll see for yourself.

i've never said anything about bitrates. that always depends on several things but most of the new rips have rather good quality imho and regarding the votes.

and if u know (according to your own point of view) the movie's bitrate is too low, why still bother downloading the damn file? just to complain afterwards?
it's like hating vegetables but eating them anyway just to let the world know that u can't stand them. 

btw, the standards have fallen? i disagree: once the standard was xvid/700mb for a movie. are u really trying to tell the 720p x264/700mb version is of inferiour quality? really?

sure it's freedom of speech but facts are facts and logic is logic so why keep saying white is black, mate? though i've the feeling this discussion might be futile ;)

enough time has been killed, my job is done, cheers!"
[T],zeromancer,2012-03-05T00:47Z,"O well, I dont have a clue, have I? :)


""At least I dont provide low quality 720p rips and call it HD :)""

HD stands for high definition(sound and picture) and is synonymous with High Resolution FYI. When u choose to rip to a low quality(NOT high resolution) 720p and call it HD, it's hilarious. You have turned the source into just that, LOW QUALITY. Thats my point. Hope you see that, but I doubt it :)


""i've never said anything about bitrates. that always depends on several things but most of the new rips have rather good quality imho and regarding the votes.""

Its ALL about bitrate, baby. Just to clearify why 700 MB isnt enough. Take the AC3 soundtrack. A 2 hour movie with about 384kbps AC3 sound takes up about 3-400MB, so whats left is a mere 300Mb for picture quality. And that my friend is waaaaay too little. You may say 'oh but 700Mb rips look good'. Viewing them on a 1080p television I asure you its not. You obviosly havent seen a blu ray movie. But thats a given :)


""and if u know (according to your own point of view) the movie's bitrate is too low, why still bother downloading the damn file? just to complain afterwards? it's like hating vegetables but eating them anyway just to let the world know that u can't stand them.""

I laughed at this one. Ofc I should download them. Why shouldnt I? Its like you accuse me of not downloading them, so when I do, thats wrong too. Lol? O well, one cant win against you, can one? :)


""btw, the standards have fallen? i disagree: once the standard was xvid/700mb for a movie. are u really trying to tell the 720p x264/700mb version is of inferiour quality? really?""

It's bad quality, yes. Take a look at a decent 720p rip of 6-7Gig and you so see the difference. Or maybe you're still in denial about that?


""sure it's freedom of speech but facts are facts and logic is logic so why keep saying white is black, mate? though i've the feeling this discussion might be futile ;)""
If you want facts, try and google some info about AVC codecs, and why blu rays have such high bit rates(15-20ish MBps). Thats right, THAT high. And you try to convince me 800kbps x264 rips is close to this. Lol, get outta here. Whos saying white is black here?

Sorry pal, but you have some reading to do. Just fire up google.com and you might learn something. Or maybe you just dont want to ;-)"
,nosing_glass,2012-03-06T19:25Z,"oh my goodness.

an advice for u:

if u want to have a battle of wits u better arm yourself first.

seems u really don't have a clue, especially when it comes down to reading and understanding some simple sentences. that's the basis if u want to participate in a discussion and cite passages.

hd has it's definition and 720p is part of it. hard to check, eh?
anyway, comparing a rip with a blueray? how lame. 

a 700 mb rip with 384 kbps ac3 sound? a ridiculous example. 
btw, u should talk about aac which is used when it comes to your ""low quality"" rips. it has a better compression rate and doesn't need so much bitrate to sound decent.

it was a guess and not an accusation that u didn't download what u were bitching about.
and it didn't matter.
but what did matter is indeed that u apparently downloaded those files just to behave like a crybaby afterwards.
so my allegory was and still is matching perfectly. 
rather sad intead of funny u didn't get it.

again u didn't understand what i said: 
i was talking about standards which have increased. 
when have the majority of rips ever been better than today, hmm?
and your answer had nothing to do with my question, just with your own opinion of hd.

i've never compared a 800 kbps rip (btw, that's even for a 700 mb xvid not enough) with a blueray... who would do such a pathetic thing, except u of course?
neither this comparison nor suggesting people said something they didn't can be called smart.

do some reading is your advice... oh what ironie! that coming from a guy who has completely failed to get a grasp of every sentence, every line! pretty embarrassing, isn't it? "
,nosing_glass,2012-03-06T19:50Z,"oh, i almost forget (don't worry, it'll be my last visit on your account).
since u care more about ""winning and losing"" than about facts and more important, about common sense, one more thing:
as u've disqualified yourself, u've automatically lost ;)
cheerio "

lol, and what should we compare it with? A dvdrip of 700MB? Well, compare it with a random 5-6GB version and you'll see the difference. But you obviously havent, as you say time and time again that 700 is decent and good enough. Haha :) Nothing to do with bitrate? ofc not :)


Troll somewhere else please."
