             FLAiR is a severely retarded group of friends            
          with a taste for analog video and forgotten films.            
           Whereas most groups stick with DVD sources we still            
         enjoy spinning 12" optical discs and rewinding our           
            VHS's like its in 1985. We're here to fill in the               
            gaps and give every "film" no matter how bad, its               
             chance at an audience (or at least a good chuckle.)              
                While our greatest love resides with 80's b-movies            
          and childhood classics, we enjoy all movies and will          
          rip any abandoned film regardless of production year.
