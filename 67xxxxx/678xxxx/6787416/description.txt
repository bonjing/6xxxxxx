God Is Alone (2004) in XVID [.avi] @ 705 mbs! (Use CD Overburn)

This entire film really revolves around the sullen William (played by J R.A. Schaefer) who must deal with his abusive father and deaf sister in the wake of the recent loss of their mother and little brother. The story is told in ever-revolving layers as the day William loses his job he bumps into the exquisite Amy (Monique Farrar) who is crouching in a dumpster with her newborn child. Through a strange turn of events, William accidentally murders the infant, wraps it in a swaddling grocery bag and promptly takes the corpse to his house to store in the deep freezer. It's here where the viewer is introduced to William's heartrending sister Marge (Sherri Sewell) who is also battling her own demons in the form of their sadistic father Walter. Through the detached hazy sequences we discover that Walter not only murdered their mother Lilith (Rose Thomas) and brother in a fit of rage but that he's barking mad. This guy needs to be taken out, trust us!
