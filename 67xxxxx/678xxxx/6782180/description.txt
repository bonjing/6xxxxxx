The blockbuster games come thick and fast in the npower Championship. 
On the south coast, two of the league's in-form teams, Southampton and Middlesbrough, 
go head to head. Saints have a wonderful record at St Mary's but Boro's away form has 
underpinned their impressive start to the season so it'll be intriguing to see which team 
comes out on top. Meanwhile, Birmingham City face Brighton at St. Andrew's. 
Chris Hughton's side has been involved in Europa League action for the first part of the 
season so a Saturday outing is a rarity for the Blues; and they'll have their work cut out 
against Gus Poyet's Brighton, who have started the season strongly. Elsewhere, 
Burnley and Blackpool meet in a Lancashire derby; the last time they met, in the 
Championship three seasons ago, Burnley did the double over the Tangerines. 
Manish Bhasin presents.
