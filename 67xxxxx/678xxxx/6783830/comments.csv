,S_A_U_S,2011-10-30T22:37Z,Thanks for the 2012 coverage update.
,djohnsen11,2011-10-30T22:46Z,thanks. but seed jorell0733 - and others!!
,Grondil,2011-10-30T22:46Z,Thank you :)
,fr33ky,2011-10-30T23:18Z,What does everyone have against small file sizes lately? How about a 720p or even 480p version for those that don't have 100Mbps and 1TB per month allowance?
,EdoSensei,2011-10-31T01:12Z,"jorrell0733 always does the HD version. Look below for an SD version. No space between Formula and 1 so you don't find it when searching Formula 1.

,fr33ky,2011-10-31T02:48Z,Thx EdoSensei! I definitely did not come across that. Though for this being twice the dimensions and  barely twice the filesize... jorrell musta done a good encode to his credit.
,josephblowf1,2011-10-31T05:42Z,"EdoSensei

thank you thank you thank you.

I never have anything bad to say about someone who takes their time to provide us with something free! But jorrellos files are so huge and forever to download.
I was checking Pirate bay since 8am pacific standard time in usa for someone, anyone to upload! Jorello's wasn't up till 2pm I think, by 5pm I had a whole 1percent downloaded! lol.

We are all thankful for EVERYONE who uploads no matter the size no matter the time it takes trust me, YOU ALL are doing so many of us around the world an invaluable service!

Jorrello thanks for the Forum upload def got that.

,gogopobric,2011-10-31T06:16Z,Thank you! Awesome to hear about next year!
,Loxxster,2011-10-31T06:55Z,"Damn, I wish there was a smaller file. My tv is only 720 and this taking forever...lol.

Thanks for the up though! :)"
,Loxxster,2011-10-31T06:59Z,"SWEET!!! Thanks EdoSensei...I really appreciate this upload, but it's too big and slow to get soon enough after the race. Plus I'm not concerned with having it in HD. 

Cheers all! :D"
,Rasmazal,2011-10-31T10:49Z,"The BBC coverage is awesome!! Don't compromise on the quality for the sake of a smaller file :)
Thanks again mate!! "
,EdoSensei,2011-10-31T12:25Z,"Rasmazal, obviously if you have a huge TV then it might be worth the wait, but the longer one waits, the more likely you are to stumble across the result before it's finished downloading. Either way, I'm DLing both HD and SD files. Whichever finishes 1st wins! The SD torrent isn't being particularly fast this week, probably due to people not finding it coz of the file name, and therefore over 1300 are now leeching this HD torrent."
,pauap,2011-10-31T20:18Z,"Many thanks jorrell. Noticed something, and was wondering, am I the only to get a linear image? I don't really know how to describe it, vertical lines appear to form and out of sync with one another. I've noticed it on other of your torrents, not all."
,Mesohappy,2011-11-01T04:51Z,"Great thx. But the recording was out of sync video. Not the sound but the video. I turned on Deinterlace
and tried different types and that improved the picture. jorrell or anyone. In Europe yo guys love racing as much as some ohter sports you have that I`ll never understand but I love racing. Does anyone have other say German or LeMones series races? "
,pauap,2011-11-01T13:45Z,"Yup, turning Deinterlace ON helps. Thanks for that. ;)"
,cdphreaker,2011-11-01T22:30Z,"I'll be downloading this one. First time downloading a F1 torrent. I was a part of the Fire & Rescue marshalls team. So, couldn't watch it from any other angle except my post. Thanks a ton for the upload. This is special for me :-) and all the Indian marshalls who were part of it."
,oldcrank,2011-11-02T17:02Z,I just wanted to thank TheBlackNight and all of the other people who are sharing.
,gloteron,2011-11-03T16:46Z,Thank you so much!!!
