I will seed all night. Hopefully this will indeed be better than the first two, I feel the style has changed a lot, they might be going too fast with the carl thing."

[T],artpepper,2011-10-31T04:10Z,"The first 2 episodes were excellent. 

For teenage knuckleheads who just want endless zombie action with lots of gore, this series is probably a bit too sophisticated, what with having a complex narrative and minimal gunfire and all. 

For the rest of us, who outgrew cartoonish zombie flicks around the time we lost our virginity, this is a terrific series.

Thanks @TvTeam."

No, the first two episodes of Season 2 were weaker than the previous season's episodes. They were very drawn out, which is because the episode budget for this season is significantly smaller than it was in the previous season. As a result, they need to water down what they accomplish, and it showed. Limited locations, story progression, effects, etc...

Maybe later episodes will be improved, as they might be under-achieving with certain episodes in order to store up a bigger budget for other episodes. I haven't watched tonight's episode yet."

,lulapop_,2011-11-01T04:51Z,"The social commentary in the last two episodes has been so uncalled for and it seems like they're trying too hard. It looks unreal. ""Do you think there is a god?"" and ""He was talking about the deer!!! He wants to live!!!!"" come to mind.

Something just feels wrong, I'm not really a good critic so I can't pinpoint what it is but the first few episodes of the first season were way better than the first 3 of the second season."
