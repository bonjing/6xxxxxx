The Scotsman ****
"..songs of great heart, delivered with authority and instrumental panache.."

The Guardian ****
"Steve Tilston writes thoughtful, highly personal songs and is one of the finest instrumentalists on the folk scene, with a style that echoes the elaborate, rhythmic "folk baroque" guitar work of Bert Jansch and Davy Graham."
