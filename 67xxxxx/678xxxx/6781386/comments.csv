,CatherineYen,2011-11-05T14:43Z,"i've finished downloading it but everytime i press on the game, a box pops out saying :

 'failed to find any DirectX9.0c compatible graphics adapters in this system! Please make sure you have a DirectX9.0c compatible graphics adapter and have installed the latest drivers provided by the manufacturer. The application will now terminate.""

why is this? and please tell me how to fix this problem. "

I guess your computer does not have a required video card. Your computer might simply be too old. 
You can try installing new graphics drivers. How old is your computer and what kind of video card does it have? "

,emcrew56,2011-11-10T03:23Z,"Seems to work fine (WXP 32 w/SP3) except for one small peculiarity..

When I created a new neighborhood (Belladona Cove) and started a game almost all of the houses have various items (trash cans, dumpsters, crates, pylons & planters.. and what looked like a phone booth) setting out in the street in front of them!

I tried the next neighborhood and it seemed fine, but those are the only two I tried so far. I get trash cans (since they would be collected) but ALL of those items.. at the start of a game.. doesn't make any sense. Belladona being the main default neighborhood (and what looks like to be the largest) it's kind of not ""proper"" for the game.

Any idea what would cause this?

Thanks a million for the upload BTW. I was going to delete all my ISOs (about 14gigs) and archive this install, but I'll try them first and see if I get the same behavior."

,Kaowaii,2011-11-22T10:36Z,"Thank you so much! I've had so many problems with Sims 2 on my computer - If I installed Open For Business it wouldn't accept the pack as installed, as the loading screen would say Nightlife and the game would crash after finishing the loading.
I really hope this works, if it does, it's seriously the best torrent I've ever seen - It makes half a day of installing much easier! Thank you a million times."

,Ruiz13M,2011-11-28T22:10Z,"I need help. It downloaded perfectly and everything is peachy right up until I click on a family. Then it loads for a while and crashes. I've done multiple compatibility checks (Windows Vista, XP, ect) but none seem to work. Could I have done something wrong?"
,Talkthattalk,2011-12-03T12:09Z,"I got it installed, but at the end Avira found a virus which it turns out it was a Trojan.

The virus was actually the file the shortcut goes to once it's installed, i.e the icon you click when you want to launch the game. So, if you don't remove the ""virus"", you can launch the game and your antivirus will keep beeping and it'll give you a message that ""Garden/Mansion Stuff"" wasn't correctly installed or something.

However, if you remove the virus, you can't launch the game because it says that the file needed to launch it (A file in Garden/Mansion) cannot be found.

Is there a way I can fix this? Or is there an issue with the torrent?"

I do have a question tho. I used SimPE to make the blur go away on my sims (it makes my eyes water when they shower or potty and I'm zoomed in a lot) before. But I don't know if it would make your edited version not work anymore if I used it. So my question is this:

With your [brilliant] installation of The Sims 2, am I able to use SimPE to remove the censored blur from my sims, or is there another way?

Thanks again!"

,[Kymm],2012-02-05T13:54Z,"Thanks a lot for this torrent, I really felt like playing The Sims 2 again but I did not want to stare at my screen for hours waiting for every EP to install in the right order. This made it fast and easy.
Works perfectly for me (WinXP SP3)

@cdubjess:
As far as I am aware The Sims (1, 2 & 3) never had a story mode. There is a series of other games called The Sims Stories which was optimised for laptops that do have a story mode. There are 3 ""The Sims Stories"" games and they are standalone games, they do NOT support the expansion and stuff packs from The Sims 2.

@sf1234
custom content has to be enabled ingame, this can be done in the game options.
You have to place your custom content in the downloads folder located here:
For XP
C:\Documents and Settings\Your Username\My Documents\EA Games\The Sims 2\Downloads 
For Vista
C:\Users\Your Username\Documents\EA Games\The Sims 2\Downloads
I do not know for Win7 as I use XP myself for The Sims 1/2.

@llama_sammich & xd111 & neppejami:
Did you use the installer to just install the entire game? it should have placed an icon on your desktop to start with. The Sims games always start their game with the .exe of the LAST installed EP/Stuff pack in this case that is Mansion & Garden stuff. Try to start up the game with the Sims2EP9 file located in 
on win XP:
""C:\Program Files\EA GAMES\The Sims 2 Mansion and Garden Stuff\TSBin\Sims2EP9.
The content of all the other EPs should just be there when the game starts.
As for the place CD error I have no idea for me it just worked after using the installer.

@TitWilliams
On XP:
C:\Program Files\EA GAMES\The Sims 2 Mansion and Garden Stuff\CSBin
(the CSBins of the other games should contain this too)
You should find a PackageInstaller file and a TS2BodyShop file. If you just open the TS2BodyShop file the body shop should open. (works for me anyway.)"
,neppejami,2012-02-10T11:54Z,"@Kymm: I did install the game using the installer, but when i run it with Sims2EP9 it still just runs Mansion and Garden... I think iÂ´ll try to reinstall it and see if that works. But thanks anyway!"
