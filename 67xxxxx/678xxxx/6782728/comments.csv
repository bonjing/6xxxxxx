Additionally, imagine someone posting this same torrent in a week. Most new leechers will flock to it, making this one far less likely to endure (go ahead, click on my name, I have some oldish torrents, it's kind of cool).
 It is always prudent - and respectful - to search before uploading. You can easily see what I mean by clicking on almost any one of your meta tags - you'll see all the seeders that came before.

Finally, here's the interesting part. This is the ""light"" version, it has no FMC. For that you need the Super 80 Professional for that and it is about another hundred megabytes. I have found one seeder currently, albaniansniper, here is his torrent:

,saintamadas,2011-10-31T13:36Z,"Some of these comments are just uncalled for.
""There's no honor amongst thieves."" So I don't expect many of the people downloading and sharing to be on the highest level of civility. But some discussions and comments on this site have gone the way of pure madness.
It's like a pirate ship where all the pirates are fighting amongst themselves the ship becomes coral bound.
The comment section of TPB is really a place to be, if it wasn't so pathetic. 
Bottomline, if the item you want falls below your expectation(s), keep moving as you don't have to make ill-remarks. Anyway, they can keep talking and hopefully they will say sometime intelligent... Thanks for the upload as time and effort is appreciated!"
,saintamadas,2011-10-31T13:48Z,"The proverb that says, ""a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"". Did aarque confirm if the link that he alleges to contain the best still active? If yes, why ""404 NOT FOUND"". Hence the saying, you cannot blame the baker(Anonymous) if the butcher(aarque&the late osama_bin_laden) bakes the bread cos they are both not in their right frame of mind."
,aarque,2011-11-01T04:07Z,"saintamadas, all you have to do is actually use common sense, you don't have to listen. You can't find albaniansniper's torrent, did you say? Wow, did you try searching yourself? How about ""www.http://thepiratebay.org/user/albaniansniper/"", did you try that? Didn't think so. Comments aren't only for praising stupidity, as you appear to advocate, they are also for warning other members of the community about sub standard torrents."
