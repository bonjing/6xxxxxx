- PSP ISO Compressor

 Utility: For those who canÂ´t (or simply wonÂ´t) buy a bigger memory stick and want to carry the largest amount of games as possible at a time. Most of my games (I like simple ones, mini games, nothing extremely fancy), when compressed to CSO, are reduced to less than 50% of the ISO file size. Since I never had any problems running CSO on any Custom Firmware, definetely worth the use! (Leaving some space on the stick for music and videos can never hurt anyone, especially those who travel for long periods, like me!)



For instructions on how to use those tools to patch or manipulate the games, look up for the thousands PSP forums on the web! TheyÂ´re surely easy to find.


Enjoy and good gaming!
