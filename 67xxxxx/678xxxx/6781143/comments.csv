Thanks!!!  "
,nickgreyden,2012-01-11T14:47Z,"I've now watched every episode provided by this torrent. All are excellent quality audio and sound except for the following which have a horrible choppy sound and desync'd audio/video and makes the whole episodes unwatchable.
4x06 - The Bus
4x09 - Quo Vadis, Captain Chandler
4x24 - The Interview
The last one is mentioned in the torrent info, but I found these other 2 as well."

,zoffix,2012-02-05T15:22Z,"You can selectively download the 4x06, 4x09, and 4x24 (that others mentioned are broken) from this torrent: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3255429/MASH_Season_4_-_Complete"
,ShockDiamond,2012-04-29T14:25Z,Thanks for the upload.  I have had good quality dvdrips for years but the original uploader or their source messed up S02E24 and S04E21 - They were just duplicates of other episodes.  I really hope your source is your own and those episodes are correct!
