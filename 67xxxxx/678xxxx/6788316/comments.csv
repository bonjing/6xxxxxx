,Chomie,2011-11-03T19:42Z,"horizon91, try changing your bitrate some may argue against me because it produces a larger file size but hard drives are cheap and I care more about quality I use:

generic.avi.xvid.audiocopy 
then click edit and change bitrate to 4400kbs 

This might be high but it seems to work for me I get around a 2gig file size. Thats the only option I touch. 

Cheers."

,dlxmax,2011-11-14T02:43Z,"The crack doesn't work for me on Win7 64-bit. I uninstalled the previous version, manually deleted all references to ""DVDFAB"" from the registry, ran CCleaner, and deleted files DVDFab files from C:\users\...\AppDate\Roaming\TEMP. I then rebooted, installed, ran the crack, disconnected internet, and started the program. The splash screen showed that ""DVD Copy"" was enabled (""Yes""), but when I clicked ""ok"", the dialog box for reading the disc only briefly blipped across the screen. Going back to the ""about"" box for the program then showed that ""DVD Copy"" was no longer enabled (""No""), and it was also impossible to select my DVD as a source. I've been having the problem for the past few versions, I think there is something hidden somewhere on my computer that DVD Fab looks for when it's first run that tells it that I'm a nasty pirate, so it then disables its functionality. This needs a new crack, I hope someone can get on it soon. Thanks."

,Bruza005,2011-11-21T12:08Z,"The patch does not work on Win 7. The disc only barely scans and then skips over decryptin the process etc. I uninstalled, deleted form registry went and re-installed making sure not to be connected and unchecked automatically check for updates and use on-line database just in case they are tracking ip address. So not sure whats going there?? They must be getting smarter "
,BlAdEAnGeL,2011-12-10T21:41Z,"Thanks in advance, I have not tried this version yet but all previous version have been top notch. Thank you. :)"
