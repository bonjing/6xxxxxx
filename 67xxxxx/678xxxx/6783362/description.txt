Everything Changes is the sixth studio album by English singer-songwriter Julian Lennon. It is released on 11 October 2011. The album is his first since 1998's Photograph Smile. The first single from the album is "Lookin' 4 Luv".
Lennon has described the material as "a bit more free-flowing than [his] previous work", calling it his "favourite album so far". Revealing how Everything Changes came about, Lennon explained: "Obviously, if you sit down and play around for a bit, youâ€™re going to come up with ideas. One thing led to another and pretty soon I had about 30 ideas, so I invited some friends to come over and flesh them out into songs".
