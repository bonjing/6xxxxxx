**********************************************************************************
following the events of the Brightest Day, 13 people have been resurrected by the mysterious white entity. 
One among them, Maxwell Lord, is the one of the most dangerous foes ever faced by the Justice League. Now he has vanished from the world, and only four heroes seem to have any idea that he ever existed at all.
These four must fight against all odds, and the suspicions of those they once trusted with the world to stop his plans from coming to fruition.

Booster Gold has always been one of my favourite characters, glad to see a series where he really comes into his own.
Enjoy, and and don't forget to seed!
