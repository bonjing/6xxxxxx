,B.Genaaid,2011-11-01T20:20Z,"I guess the people that scream fake can be considered copyright trolls hehe. Since downloading is legal where I live and my upload is only protocol (100%) and therefore no copyright violation hehe... I can say without any problems... nice to watch on a glass tube widescreen TV, sometimes out of focus but he... I saw on IMDB that they are showing this movie not earlier than 5 february in sweden, end january in finland 7 december in holland and 27 oktober in russia 28 oktober in USA... this is asking for downloading... and so I did.... by the way nice movie, I will for sure buy the DVD for the kids dubbed in our own language .... :) eventhough I prefer antonio banderas his voice for the PUSS hehe. have fun with this one if you cant wait for it to show in your country (3 months difference... who's stupid idea was that????)"
