Please would you consider doing the conversion from 1440*1080 to 1280*720 MKV with header compression turned off, or removing it using MKVtoolnix 5.0.1 from www.videohelp.com/tools/MKVtoolnix. In File/Options/mmg, tick the box for ""Disable header removal compression"", then OK. Drag the QI MKV file into the top window, set the output file name, then click ""Start muxing"". Muxing takes only 20-30 seconds on my computer. Thanks again for your wonderful QI-XL uploads!"
