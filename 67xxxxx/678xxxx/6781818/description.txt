Storyline: As Lord Voldemort retrieves the Elder Wand from Albus Dumbledore's tomb, Severus Snape has become Hogwarts' headmaster. Meanwhile, after burying Dobby, Harry Potter speaks with the goblin Griphook about breaking into Bellatrix Lestrange's vault at Gringotts bank, suspecting that a Horcrux may be hidden there. Griphook agrees to take Harry, Ron, and Hermione to the vault in exchange for the Sword of Gryffindor. Harry asks Ollivander, the wandmaker, to identify two wands they took from Malfoy Manor. Ollivander says they belonged to Bellatrix and Draco Malfoy, but Malfoy's wand has changed its allegiance to Harry.
