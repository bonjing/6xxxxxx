re-upload of http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6779897/Supernatural_S07E06_HDTV_XviD-ASAP_[eztv]"
[H],HeroMaster,2011-10-29T13:01Z,"@Sell-out it is not a dupe, see the torrent files and then comment, this time warning for you like you did it in rest of his torrents."
,ust2,2011-10-29T14:50Z," eTtv eh?

 Sorry but copying a VIP uploader's name for hits is just dirty and makes you seem rather untrustworthy.."
[V],catflap,2011-10-30T02:52Z,"you and others clearly have no clue how this works.

eztv, vtv and others put their own names on other
groups' files. eztv, vtv, etc. DO NOT release their
own files. they grab scene releases directly from the
scene groups via newsgroups AND THEN THEY PUT
THEIR OWN TAGS ON THEM.

so if ettv wants to do the same, that's not any
different than what eztv, vtv, etc. do."
