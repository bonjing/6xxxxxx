,Jack0ff,2011-11-01T03:19Z,this show should be called terra ble
,punk333,2011-11-01T04:26Z,"@jack0ff - its not that bad, I agree they need to spend a little more money on the animation - but i think the actors are doing a fairly well job"
,Boston3417,2011-11-01T04:35Z,"@JackOff, if its so ""terra ble"" as you so cleverly came up with why are you looking for the show on here? And if you looked it up to comment that it was ""terra ble"" you could've at least came up with something better and more original than that. Or are you just that simple minded and have no life?"

Anyone would think that you personally created the show given how people feel the need to comment negatively on the show itself. 

If people in the comments don't like the show, why are you upto episode 6 lol"
,Orphu,2011-11-01T17:14Z,"@JackOff.... yeah I agree, terra ble.  First episode was decent but it is going downhill, on a steep incline.  Will still give it a few more chances cuz there is sooo very little TV worth watching."
,swen4os,2011-11-01T21:54Z,"@Orphu I totally agree on this :)

@Tendo_pain We're giving the show a chance"
