[T],trialNerror,2011-11-03T14:54Z,"You're quite welcome.

Know what's funny, tho? 

People on SyFy's site, facebook, twitter, blogs, wherever, all complained about too many commercials.  Yet there were the same amount of commercials packed in there as if it were 6 different 1 hour long episodes being watched.

On average a show cuts to commercial every 6 to 10 minutes and lasts about 3.5 minutes; that's how it was for the Live event.  It only seemed like there were more cuz it's not often we sit our asses down to watch a 6 hour long episode.

But yes, it is a bit nicer not having any Dodge, Syfy, toilet paper, and those ""help I've fallen and can't get up"" emergency necklace ads over and over.  "
,Zomniac,2011-11-06T07:58Z,"I've tried everything to get the audio to work.  Ran it through GSpot to find out what type, if any, the audio was and it gave me a best guess of AC3, though it was returning an invalid header error.
Tried viewing in DivX player and VLC... no go.  Refreshed my AC3 installation to the latest version, still nothing.
The video quality on this is FREAKING amazing.  My problem is with the audio.  Any suggestions?"
[T],trialNerror,2011-11-06T08:26Z,"Check for VLC updates.

Play it on a PS3 or X360.

If you have the K-Lite codec bundle with Media Player Classic go to Start Menu > All Programs > K-Lite > Codec Tweak Tool > Manage preferred DirectShow source filters.  In the configuration window that opens set the .MP4 to use the LAV splitter.

Plays perfectly fine with audio in Media Player Classic, VLC, Windows Media Player and on the PS3 for me!

I wouldn't have released it if there were no audio.

Last resort would be to try and mux it together with MKVmerge.  That shouldn't be required, tho, cuz like I said - plays perfectly in every player I have on the computer and on the PS3."
,Zomniac,2011-11-06T09:24Z,Thank you so much.  I had forgotten about that codec pack.  Installing it did the trick!
