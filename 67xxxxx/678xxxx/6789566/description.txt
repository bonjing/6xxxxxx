A special Halloween Live event from the Pennhurst State School and Hospital in Pennsylvania. According to the owner of the property reports of paranormal activity have increased since Jason and Grant's last visit to the institution for the mentally and physically disabled earlier this year. TAPS returns to investigate the abandoned buildings and underground tunnels LIVE in hopes of helping the owner with answers as to what's going on so workers won't frequently run from the place scared.
 
PS3 & X360 Ready.
 
 
Release notes:
 
This was a LIVE feed. There will be some video glitches and areas of no audio. This is how it was streamed over the network; nothing I could do about it. There will be some areas where the sync seems to be off, but that again is due to the LIVE feed broadcast from SyFy.
