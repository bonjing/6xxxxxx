Good/Bad, am I missing anything?"
,ElSteve0,2011-11-14T02:58Z,Whats the quality on this? I got another discography with only a couple botched songs but the quality is otherwise amazing so I need to know if this one is worth upgrading to
,Techwiz101,2011-11-14T12:16Z,Well I put this together myself and I listen to them daily. The quality in these songs is really good.
