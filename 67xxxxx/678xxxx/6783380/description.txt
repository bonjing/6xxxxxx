Award-winning series following the stories of the world's greatest archaeological adventurers. This mini-series profiles the perils, struggles and triumphs of four of history's treasure seekers. In glass cases and dusty corners of great international museums of North America and Europe, thousands of their priceless relics & treasures are displayed. All are fascinating in their own right for what they tell us of lost tribes, lost cultures, even lost civilizations. But the real stories are rarely told--the blood-stirring adventures of the travelers who braved swamp fever, cannibals, sandstorms & other perils to capture the treasures. Michael Rockefeller; Lord Elgin; Giovanni Belzoni; and Edward Thompson were all men of guile & daring in the tradition of Indiana Jones. They travelled to the ends of the Earth in search of archeological riches of ancient and exotic cultures.

Episode 2 : Thompson and the Well of Sacrifice

In 1909, wearing an unwieldy diving suit with two assistants hand-pumping his air supply, Edward Thompson lowered himself into a 60-foot deep Mayan well in search of a legend. What he discovered, deep in the jungles of Mexico, was an extraordinary collection of human bones, wool, pottery, jade and gold: precious artifacts of an ancient sacrificial site.
