,jaidi,2011-10-31T07:09Z,"To those of you who do not know; EEWalford has been uploading Eastenders omnibus for years for no other reason than he is a very kind and generous person. Despite the loss of Mininova and various other problems over the years EEW has always worked hard to make sure that we all get our latest episode. He is based in Belgium and sadly the authorities in that country have now blocked TPB from operating there. EEW has enlisted the help of tri895 and so the omnibus will still be available on TPB thanks to their efforts on our behalf. Although I mostly use Demonoid, I am grateful to know that there is another source for this download and any of you who appreciate the work of these guys should be sure to leave a message of thanks. Long live EEW, tri895, Demonoid and The Pirate Bay!"
