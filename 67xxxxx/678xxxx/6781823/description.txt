Episode 1 : The Michael Rockefeller Story

In 1961, newspaper headlines across America were dominated by the story of the mysterious disappearance of Michael Rockefeller, the youngest son of Nelson Rockefeller, off the coast of New Guinea. Enthralled by the war-like Stone Age tribes living there, Michael had journeyed into the country's formidable interior to document their disappearing way of life and to assemble a museum collection of their extraordinary artifacts. He never returned -- drowned after capsizing in a canoe or, perhaps, killed by local tribesmen. His death remains a mystery to this day.
