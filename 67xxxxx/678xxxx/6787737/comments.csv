,megastar7,2011-11-02T02:20Z,"Thanks for uploading man! People were tripping out about the graphics, but it's obviously a low-res capture. Looks stretched too. 
Can't wait for 11.11.11."
,AlwaysLearningTech,2011-11-02T14:07Z,"It's nearly here! I hope it gets uploaded the second it comes out! I'll leave my computer on all night if I have to. If the game is good and plays on my PC, however. I will buy it."
,Landplacker,2011-11-02T21:24Z,"Wow, these videos prove how shitty Skyrim is in fact. No wonder pulls the videos off, because no one will buy it once they have seen this. It will be same for pc, the typical console inventory menu alone is despicable."
,Cohuge,2011-11-02T21:45Z,"@Landplacker I hope you are kidding. This seems awesome, including the graphiics. 
@all Real gamers don't give a shit about good graphics."
,plicked,2011-11-02T23:12Z,"@Cohuge
..I just sincerely hope Skyrim hasn't been dumbed down to much.  That'll crush my faith in two companies this year.  Bioware with DA2, and now Bethesda with simplefest Skyrim."
,Landplacker,2011-11-03T01:30Z,"Sorry, but I didn't talk about the graphics, but the gameplay. It is dumbed down even compared to alreday dumbed down and consolized Oblivion. "
,Darkoil,2011-11-03T19:13Z,"The graphics are pathetic. This is what you get on xbox 360, eye sore at 720p. Definatly going to have to get it for pc."
,Trucifenix,2011-11-03T20:42Z,"I don't think the voice acting is all that bad, I've seen worse. I've already got a legit copy preordered from Newegg, but I'm eagerly awaiting a leaked PC copy since I won't get mine until the 14th-15th"
,crispyman01,2011-11-04T06:40Z,"Legit torrent, THANK YOU!!!"
,Leignheart,2011-11-04T08:18Z,"im freaking excited, got myself an i7 960 4 way classified, couple of gtx 590s and 30 inch 2560x1600 monitor just for this game. when it releases and i own it, i will already be in heaven. LORD DONT TAKE ME NOW!!!!!!!!!"
,cloudsora,2011-11-04T11:49Z,They're pulling them because the Pirated version is a little bit crappier and its the xbox version.
,Afroman305,2011-11-04T12:20Z,please upload more! maybe an hours gameplay if possible
,Gmoon777,2011-11-05T21:07Z,"check out more leaked footage here!!
