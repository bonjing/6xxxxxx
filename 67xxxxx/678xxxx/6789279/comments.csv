How to use the keygen?
""User code 1"" and ""User code 2"" are asked. What are they?"
,MisterZap007,2012-03-25T17:38Z,"Hi again,

When I try to activate UEStudio (with no Internet connection and firewall blocking UE), I still get the message:
Error Number: 8
Error Description: INVALID SERVER RESPONSE

I never get the ""Offline activation button"".

How tot do?

Thanks..."
