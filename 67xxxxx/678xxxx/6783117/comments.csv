,croca,2011-10-30T16:44Z,why is it so big when in the app store it doesnt pass 300 Mb?
[T],nobody2007,2011-10-30T18:35Z,"Yeah, you're right. The app store says 253MB.
Maybe this torrent comes with tons of advertising?
Let us know, whats the differences between this one and apple's peace of software from their site?"
,c31m,2011-10-30T23:31Z,"checked, looks fine, no ads and other crap.(just many framefork- files,makes it big) 
btw in demonoid i have found same size that 'compressor4.0.1' so dont worry, 
only thing was when you open dmg shows error with image, but app works okay."

I'll test it on my mac now.

Question: How does an app from apple comes with ""advertising""?

Thanks!"

All well"
,c31m,2011-10-31T03:49Z,"Answer: if you put in your ""App"" folder what you UL also pics of your naked mum and so on, then that is advertising.. 
but this doesnt mean that we don't like your mum"
