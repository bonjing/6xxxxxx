,xPEEDLESx,2011-12-04T19:07Z,"i am having the same problem once i move on to another level it freezes while loading that level, it just gets stuck looping the same sound over and over again. ive tried updating my cIOS like shirepirate suggested, and ive tried updating my wiiflow to the latest version but none of that is working. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what i can do to fix the problem? IM DYING TO PLAY THIS GAME FULLY!"
