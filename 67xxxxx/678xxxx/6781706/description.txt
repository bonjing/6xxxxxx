D. Gold reveals the inner world of marijuanna and hashish in Cannabis Alchemy, Accompany the alchemist as he uncovers the secrets of anhancing potency in this informative text.  Finally, this hard-to-obtain cult classic is once again available. Revised and updated.


This printing is from 1993,  the book itself heralds back even farther to 1973. So some of the data and information is dated, but its a good read and a must have for anyone who likes homemade hash or oil.
