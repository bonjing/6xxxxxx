This is an album of songs he recorded while he was attending Oberlin college in Ohio. These songs are pure gold and vintage Josh Ritter. If you've loved any of his albums so far, then don't hesitate to pick this one up, you won't be disappointed. 
The greatness of his music seems almost effortless. The songs are so easy to listen to that I keep wondering if I've heard them before. These are classic songs, among the best of his catalog. A definite must for any Ritter fan or for any fan of music.
