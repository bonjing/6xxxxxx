Like always, thanks to ExtremeZone for putting it up. and Thanks to the Ripper"
,mind_over_matter,2011-11-02T00:50Z,"@ donkruiskade ~  seeding is done automatically in utorrent, all you need to do when your file is completed download is leave the utorrent application open (and of course the pc power on)
until you feel you have shared a sufficient amount :D

If you need help with Fifa id be help to try... cant answer the divx 2 (I dont know)

If you are a troll lol I will find you and burn you at the stake :P

@ jesusjuice ~ you are the real dork here, I suppose you was born knowing every aspect of life ? no so instead of having your snide remark try educate another, there are no stupid questions but as you displayed there is always someone with a stupid answer !!

will rate A/V when d/load complete as always thanks X-zone u da man "

,STGstylah,2011-11-03T02:02Z,"Excellent quality A/V.

Movie itself was pretty great as well. A highly original twist to a pretty worn-out concept. Well done!"

,born2b,2011-11-04T00:23Z,Thanks!
,madFact,2011-11-04T02:02Z,Not sure if I want to download this.....Why in the fuck would you choose the worst/grainy footage in the film as your sample?? Makes me think the rest of the file is piss poor quality if that is the sample you chose!! WTF?
,madFact,2011-11-04T02:58Z,"My bad, this is how the whole movie looks and its...... UNWATCHABLE!!!!! Fucking Sad!!!!! Absolute piece of shit! I wouldnt watch this if it was the year was 1970! What a headache!!!"
,SerSpec-V,2011-11-04T03:14Z,"A/V is a 9, the movie is a 3. Pure low budget crap, don't waste your time."
,canuks,2011-11-05T21:33Z,"I had to chug half a bottle of fish oil to stop the brain damage occuring after watching this pile of shit movie. Someone should tell the director that there is no gravity on the moon! Utter rubbish and very unbelievable movie throughout. If you choose to watch this flic, you will regret it till the day you die...be warned!
You will always be the king extremezone (you didn't write the script). keep them coming :)"
,Euphorics,2011-11-08T02:39Z,"@canuks

awww how cute we have a resident physicist here :)

Ok I'll keep this nice and short for you. The moon has mass. Less mass then the earth.

(This much I know you're following, but heres where i'll probably lose you)

Mass in space generates the force of gravity. Therefore the moon generates gravity. 

(relative to it's size)

(Which equates to approximately) Less gravity then the earth does. "

I don't remember exact figures but I belive it is close to 33% strength of the earths gravitational field. (1/3)"
,Euphorics,2011-11-08T02:51Z,Sorry exact figures of the moons gravity relative to earths is 16.7%. Roughly 1/6.
,Euphorics,2011-11-08T06:16Z,"seriously shit movie though. I only managed 30 minutes. atleast they got the gravity on the moon part right.
