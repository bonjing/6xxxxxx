,DARKnight02.14,2011-12-25T16:34Z,"For those prople who installed crack and patch and replaced PARAM.SFO but still getting the 'Update to 3.60' error, this is how you fix it.

>open file manager and multiman and go to hdd0/game and delete BLUS30762
>exit multiman.. reinstall PATCH then crack (it is important to install PATCH first)
> then install CRACK
>(if you havent change the PARAM.SFO, do it now or you can let multiman change it for you but i recommend manual replacement)
> launch the game using multiman and kill people :D
