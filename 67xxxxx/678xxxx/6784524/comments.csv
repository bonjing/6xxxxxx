Watching on my big screen now. juts as good if not better than the 550mb AVI's we've been downloading.  Well Done ettv!  "

Great value for the size"
,spelonkar,2011-10-31T13:45Z,"This is last weeks episode in a smaller size, not scamming the one coming out tomorrow, derp"
,fukov,2011-10-31T14:00Z,Load of fucking bollocks... Video is perfection BUT there is NO sound....Waste of space douchebags. Fuck off ETTV!!
,arukarudo,2011-10-31T15:26Z,"i Thought it were a fake as well, but i tried it as I can't download the 720p on my stupid slow connection and it ended up being a legit S06E05 episode. The 720p subtitle fits it perfectly as well. And it does have sound, maybe you're lacking some codec, im using ""The Kmplayer"" to watch it..."
,wiezimag,2011-10-31T15:37Z,"It's REAL, 
both video and sound are good (so just download some codecs, moron), good quality, 
stop rating it down."
,horrendousmaximus,2011-10-31T16:04Z,"Thanks ETTV, file plays and sounds great."
,Lowlskichi,2011-10-31T16:54Z,"It doesn't say ""eztv"" you friggen' idiots. So stop bitching about this being a fake."
,sarafova,2011-10-31T17:10Z,"thank you :))
I like these 480p.mkv very much.
good luck!"
,junkevil,2011-10-31T19:47Z,"this isn't a fake and there is nothing wrong with it despite prior complaints. the video is also in better quality than some of the previous rips i've gotten for episodes of dexter this season that were much larger than 216mb. so, kudos to ettv. played on vlc with no issues whatsoever. "
,niks856,2011-10-31T20:35Z,"dont understand how some fools are commenting this is fake, last weeks episode, etc... seriously???

A=10
v=10

,angel-k,2011-11-01T07:51Z,PErfect
,GungaDan,2011-11-01T09:07Z,I hate these MKV files!  :(
,piratiinho,2011-11-01T09:51Z,"Great torrent and video. 
It works with VLC and you can always convert it.

Those who rated this torrent as fake or bad are simply stupid.

Thanks uploader!"
,sapper71,2011-11-01T21:06Z,Thanks excellent quality and fast download.
,xdamiancx,2011-12-13T06:54Z,doesn't work right on ps3 media server.. damn mkv files
