In order to play ShadowGun, you need to turn on â€˜Reduce texture qualityâ€™ and â€˜Reduce texture sizeâ€™ in Chainfire3D. This will help to reduce memory usage and improve performance on older Android phone. Guess what? These help to fix force close issue on Samsung Galaxy S2 when trying to loading another level after finished level 1. But the graphics quality will be reduced, right? No worry, just turn off those after you manage to go pass the loading."
