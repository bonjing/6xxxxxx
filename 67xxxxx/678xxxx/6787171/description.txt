Storyline: Growing up together, Mitch Planko and Dave Lockwood (Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman) were two inseparable best friends, but as the years have passed, they have slowly drifted apart. Dave is an overworked lawyer, husband and father of three children and Mitch is a single, quasi-employed man-child who has never met a responsibility he liked. To Mitch, Dave has it all: his beautiful wife Jamie (Leslie Mann), three children who adore him and a high-paying job at a prestigious law firm. To Dave, living Mitch's stress-free life without obligation or consequence would be a dream come true.
