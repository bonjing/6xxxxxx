So this saved me the trouble of downloading the theme from youtube or such and convert it to mp3

Aaand ofcrouse I wanna grab this too.
So greatly appreciated."
,Sarkasmi,2011-11-04T02:01Z,"Oh and it really is good quality :) 

Just listened to the main theme on my high quality headphones and had ridiculous amounts of chills down my spine. 

DAMN it's epic. "
,kolokythis,2011-11-08T12:54Z,"Thank you for uploading this, but must be noted that the quality is mediocre. Those who demanding high fidelity better wait for another release."

,Dreadhawk123177,2011-11-14T01:12Z,"Modest quality. Still, thx for the torrent. By the way, laga234, plz give the CORRECT lyric translations:

Dragonborn, Dragonborn, by his honor is sworn,
keeping evil forever at bay, and the fiercest foes rout, when they hear triumphs shout, dragonborn, for your blessings we pray."
,revrai,2011-11-22T14:25Z,"Thank you LiquidQC for the Skyrim soundtracks, i love everything about Skyrim.. ALL of it!"
,dickdick22,2011-11-23T16:33Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD

This is a TERRIBLE transcode - NOT 320KBPS. Tracks shelf at ~10khz, AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL quality.

THE ONLY LEGIT INSTANCE OF SKYRIM OST CURRENTLY IS THE 5-TRACK SAMPLER CD.
"
,dickdick22,2011-11-23T16:35Z,"WARNING

ALL TRACKS SHELF AT ~10KHZ

NOT 320KBPS, TERRIBLE TRANSCODE"
,GeekyGamer01,2011-11-23T17:16Z,"Nice Name ""dickdick"".

Ignore him, hes a douche bag.

This is LEGIT Thx"
,titegtnodI,2011-11-26T20:24Z,"This looks awesome. If you ever feel like making a second soundtrack with epic tracks that may be considered ""spoliers"" I think that would be another great addition to people's collections.

Also if you could do the next one in a very high VBR that'd be great as they're already lossy to begin with so it would just save some space. (Mind you I'm a bit racist against CBR)"
,darelp,2011-12-07T14:35Z,i used to listen to these terrible rips.. but then i took an arrow to the knee
,RHMTG,2011-12-17T12:10Z,"Don't listen to haters, this is good quality!"
,mozman1991,2011-12-20T03:48Z,"Nice! Quality is brilliant, gonna set the main theme as the ringtone for my Blackberry :) Now everyone shall know that i am Dragonborn xD

This game is AWESOOOOOMMMEEEE :)))"
,vidiation,2011-12-22T15:55Z,"All good quality. G-spot reports all at 320kbps, most at 44.1kHz.  Thanks for the effort!"
