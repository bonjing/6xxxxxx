Skyrim Unofficial Soundtrack

This is the Unofficial Soundtrack to the game Elder Scrolls Skyrim. All MP3's are high quality rips directly from the game. The reason this is an "unofficial" soundtrack is because it has not been released nor does it have any relation with the official OST, these where hand picked from over 200 tracks to give you a taste of the games music, only 18 tracks are in this collection and most of them are from gameplay that was shown prior to release so it is not to spoil too much of the game.

Original credit goes to Bethesda and their composer Jeremy Soule.
