Critical Thinking: A Concise Guide is a much-needed guide to argument analysis and a clear introduction to thinking clearly and rationally for oneself. Through precise and accessible discussion this book equips students with the essential skills required to tell a good argument from a bad one.

Key features of the book are:

â€¢ Clear, jargon-free discussion of key concepts in argumentation
â€¢ How to avoid common confusions surrounding words such as â€˜truthâ€™, â€˜knowledgeâ€™ and â€˜opinionâ€™
â€¢ How to identify and evaluate the most common types of argument
â€¢ How to spot fallacies in arguments and tell good reasoning from bad
â€¢ Chapter summaries, glossaries and useful exercises

This third edition has been revised and updated throughout, with new exercises, and up-to-date topical examples, including: â€˜real-worldâ€™ arguments; practical reasoning; understanding quantitative data, statistics, and the rhetoric used about them; scientific reasoning; and expanded discussion of conditionals, ambiguity, vagueness, slippery slope arguments, and arguments by analogy.
