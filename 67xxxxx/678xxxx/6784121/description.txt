Colin Murray introduces highlights and reaction from Premier League games - 
including the London derby between Tottenham and QPR. Spurs and QPR renew 
their rivalry after a 16-year gap - and if you check the history books, you will see 
the two clubs have three wins apiece from their previous Premier League meetings. 
However, this fixture is best known for the 1982 FA Cup final, when Spurs needed a 
replay to overcome their then lower division opponents. Expert opinion and analysis comes 
from Lee Dixon and Mark Lawrenson - and there is also a comprehensive review of Saturday's eight games.
