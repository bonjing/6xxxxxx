,wadaya87,2011-11-06T15:58Z,"""The Church"", being humans who are under illusion that they are divinely correct in their assumptions, banned these writings from the Bible. Who can say what is to be part of or not part of the Bible? Who can determine what is written by God and men?"
,ThePoisonedYouth,2011-12-12T10:35Z,"@joshua13 the catholic church did actually ban all heretical books during the middle ages, in fact, they even banned the bible itself from public possession, only the priests and authorities were allowed to own any part of the bible. they claim the intent was to stop it from being corrupted, but the truth is they just didn't want anyone to know what it says. they were capable of lying about anything if they chose to. they believe that the ""ends justify the means""."
