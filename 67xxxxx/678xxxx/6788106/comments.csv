,rodzandz,2011-11-02T08:14Z,"The game works fine people. I burnt it with ImgBurn following the standard instructions for XGD3 ISOS..
But I'm really sad to say that Graphic-wise, this is a BIG disappointment..! (at least this xbox version). It's a step back from Oblivion. The character's faces are grainy, dark and ugly with almost no expressions and stiff animations. The overall world textures look blurry and low-res. The animations of character movements look stiff. The Physx engine seems cut down (there is no more rag-doll effect on dead characters). You cant pick up and move objects and dead bodies in realtime like in Oblivion (although you can examine objects in the inventory). Overall it's a huge disappointment for me. A game released 5+ years ago looks better then this..
What the hell is going on? Lately there seems to be a tendency of new games looking worse than their older counterparts! (Rage, Crysis 2 anyone?) I really really hope the PC version fares better."
,azureray,2011-11-02T09:21Z,"Well, I'll confirm, the PC torrent is fake. Installation eventually asks for your phone number for a service run by ZipRo.ru. The installer (not even titled setup.exe, does not contain any sort of Bethesda launcher, is 3GB, and yet there's still 3 bin data files. 
Also, the crack won't even start up on a 64-bit system which I doubt razor would have done. Oh well :/"
,Mr.TroIIz,2011-11-02T09:30Z,"@ rodzandz

''You cant pick up objects and dead bodies in realtime like in Oblivion''

Stop lying you son of a bitch. I've seen trailers where the player picks up books and other objects in real time and moves them around. It was even confirmed by Todd Howard.

Of course the Xbox will have garbage graphics. What do you expect from 6 year old hardware.
That's why REAL GAMERS use a PC.

''Lately there seems to be a tendency of new games looking worse than their older counterparts! (Rage, Crysis 2 anyone?)''

Crysis 2 was the best looking game in the world until Battlefield 3 came out. Crysis without mods does not have better graphics than Crysis 2. If you add mods, even then it's hard to tell which one is better looking. Rage is completely different story. It was a shitty console port with bad driver support.

And btw, Skyrim will look much better on PC even without mods. Console gamers are stuck with the vanilla graphics forever. We, PC gamers, can enjoy thousands of mods while you will be stuck with low res textures, screen tearing and whatnot.

Enjoy your Shitbox."

Is the PC torrent confirmed?  The size looks about right for a rip, and about 70 people seeding it, which IMO weighs in the favor of it possibly being legit.  Would that many people seed a BS torrent?  

Can anyone confirm or deny the PC version Liquid_Flux posted?  Or are 60+ seeders just all trolling? "
,SBSAlbertini,2011-11-02T17:11Z,@accrow01 Yer the PC torrent is fake I can confirm this too. It asks for your mobile number to activate and the entire contents of the iso look very weird. The way the EULA is placed in with the install contents is quite a funny attempt to look legit. I was thinking it had a chance of being real too.
,Liquid_Flux,2011-11-02T17:13Z,"@accrow01

,rodzandz,2011-11-02T22:02Z,"@Mr.TroIIz

I tend to agree with you, you son of a bitch!
I AM a hardcore PC gamer too, but eventually enjoy my Xbox too. I downloaded this game, cause my curiosity got the best of me and I couldn't wait for the PC release. It DOES have pretty bad graphics, which worries me. Why? Because just like Rage, it indicates that that this might also turn out as a shitty port for the PC with consoles being the primary target market. Oblivion was the other way around. It was made with the PC market in mind, and eventually got a console port. Just consider the following:

Morrowind (PC) was released in 2002 and Oblivion in 2006. The improvement in graphics and physx achieved in those 4 years was Outstanding! Everything looked better! Now it's been almost 6 years since Oblivion was released, and looking at Skyrim I definitely do NOT see the level of improvement I should see. I KNOW the PC version will look a bit better (probably better hi-res textures) but still if the Xbox version is any indication, this game hasn't improved much (graphics wise) in the past 6 years... which boggles my mind.  I tend to believe that developers are holding us PC gamers back due to old console hardware.. and for this game it is a damn..damn shame!

BTW, unless I haven't figured it out yet, you cannot move and manipulate bodies and objects in real time like in oblivion. You can pick stuff up and look at it in the inventory, but that's pretty much it. And, THERE IS NO ragdoll physx on dead bodies. Least not for this Xbox version.  The drop stiff as a board."
,Mr.TroIIz,2011-11-02T22:32Z,"@ rodzandz

Listen, you son of a cow.  :P

Yeah, you're probably right, they could've done a better job with the animations. They had more than enough time.

The consoles are holding us back. They're like a neverending disease. And that's why I hate them so much.

''you cannot move and manipulate bodies and objects in real time like in oblivion''

I guess we'll see when the PC version comes out. I hope you're not right about this.
"
,shen123,2011-11-02T23:00Z,"??? why should the graphics be better than oblivion, they still have the same console to work with, they can only push it so far. morrowind was on the original xbox so of course they could achieve better graphics on xbox 360. Your gonna have to wait for next gen consoles before you see any better unless your a pc gamer where the graphics cards are constantly updated and improved.

Xbox 360 is starting to get old now you know."

,rodzandz,2011-11-03T01:18Z,"@shen123

That's exactly my point. Consoles are holding back all the advancements in graphics technology dammit!! Why should Skyrim look better then Oblivion?? Because they had 6 fucking years to make it!! 6 Years in which PC graphic cards and CPU have made HUGE leaps and are capable of processing photorealistic 3D graphics in real time gambplay! 

But Nooooo! All the fucking developers are developing with consoles in mind now.. So we're still seeing new games coming out with outdated 6 year old graphics. It's a damn shame that Skyrim fell in this death trap... and you're probably right.. Not until the launch of the ""Next Gen"" consoles are us PC gamers going to start seeing a real improvement in graphics (since nobody seems to develop exclusively for PC's anymore). 

Can't blame 'em though.. Money talks and bullshit walks."
,rodzandz,2011-11-03T01:31Z,"Dude, Learn to Fucking read!! THIS ISO WORKS FINE!!!!  Alright????!!!

You burn it just like any other XGD3 Game.

I used the latest ImgBurn and selected the ""Burn until the end of the disc"" option.

Check that the layerbreak option is in ""Calculate Optimum"" and the actual layerbreak reads: 2,133,520.

There are like a million tutorials for this on youtube and google... It's easy as shit! 

You don't need any special DVD burners or software, no special disc. Just your normal DL disc. I've been using TDK and they have always worked.

Oh, and for the retards out there: FLASH YOUR DAMN CONSOLE to LT 2.0! That's why you're only seeing a ""Play Game"" message with no image and then you get the unreadable error."
,remedy2,2011-11-03T01:40Z,"The graphics are sufficient, not great but thats never been Bethesda's thing IMO.  They do make great rpgs for the most part and the stories side quests take plenty of time to make.  I think they concentrate more on that then the graphics."

,squat251,2011-11-07T19:08Z,"not only does this work. but everyone having an issue, please read on. 

(if you still play on live): * WARNING use a non live account to play* you need to burn this to verbatim media with an ihas 124 variant writer that has been flashed to the ixtreme software. (tools are availible here, but you NEED that burner (there are 6 different ones) otherwise you may be banned.)

(if you do not play on live): you may truncate the disk (just means over burn) when you start to burn this (with newest imgburn) an error will pop up saying that the disk is too small/file too big. click ok and burn it. this should play ok, however you may have errors and you should not try to connect to live as you could very possibly be banned. i hope this helps a little."

Thanks again for a quality release!!! Dl'ed this and your Dark Souls upload, both are perfect!

@BoozeBeard

First of all, use good quality DVDs. I know this might sound silly, but I learnt that lesson the hard way. Wasted a lot of DVDs burning with crappy media. 

Second, is your ImgBurn version 2.5.6.0 (currently the latest)? If it is, then you should choose the truncate option NOT the overburn option. Make sure that the layer break in the .dvd file is 2133520. 

Furthermore, you should burn at a maximum of x4 (I usually burn at x2.4). I've never heard of anyone burning X360 games at x8 or above.

These are the steps I took to burn the game and it works perfectly for me :)"
,Pavlelink,2011-11-12T08:57Z,"now that the game is out, is it safe to play on a live account?"
,beadle_jay123,2011-11-12T12:50Z,"Hey guys, I burned the game but it says when i put the DVD in the xbox ""Wrong region code""..what gives?? I thought it was region free? Can someone please help?"

Thanks"
,BloodxShotxx,2011-11-29T00:33Z,to burn this game on Imgburn you must continue even though it says the disc doesnt have the disc. pick the Truncate option before burning(a message should be shown). This worked for me on saints row and halo anniversary and modern warfare 3. also is this a good quality game? ive read comments on the btjunkie torrent saying the graphics were bad because it was a pre realease
