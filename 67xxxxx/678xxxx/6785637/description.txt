We're sorry this is late but we've been experiencing some issues with
our Cartoon Network feed these past couple of days. There might be some
minor glitches on this release. We asked FQM and they didn't have the
episode recorded. Our apologies but there's no other rerun scheduled
so we thought it would be better to have the episode out there then not
at all
