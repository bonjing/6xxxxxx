,hawkinau,2011-11-03T09:32Z,"how can it be the old movie when Harry.Potter.And.The.Deathly.Hollows.Part.2 is in fact out as a DVD Rip and has been for a couple of weeks, the info above says it is the final chapter, the encode date is Oct 2011 and uploaded 3 days ago, wouldn't it be smarter to D/L the file first and then make a comment???"

,Crash613,2011-11-03T17:10Z,"against my better judgement i am downloading it.  I usually do not download rar files.  almost always bad news.  
fuck you very much for using that virus infected format.
i will comment on the real quality once it is done... .... assuming it is not a virus"
,Crash613,2011-11-03T17:32Z,"Does appear to be real.  Skipped thru and quality is DVD.  nice.

Still stand by my previous comment....... ditch the RAR!"
