[T],SqrtNegOne,2011-11-04T03:32Z,"Walang anuman. :) Thanks for the heads up re: copy protection, btw. I've deleted almost all of my DVD9s, which is why they disappeared, and am properly re-imaging & re-uploading them."
[T],SqrtNegOne,2011-11-04T03:36Z,PS - I'm also on KAT. ;)
,Synthesist,2011-12-25T10:31Z,Anyone have trouble burning this; even using DVD Shrink seems to run afoul....
[T],SqrtNegOne,2012-01-08T02:52Z,"You're not alone, but I haven't tried a burn. The source program might help. When actively re-filtered by DVDFab Passkey, with PathPlayer enabled, DvdReMake errors at least go away. However, such is not the case with AnyDVD. Otherwise, I don't remove anything but copy protection & region restrictions in order to boost compatibility."
,homericICON,2012-02-09T20:37Z,"Please don't drop me! I just started this torrent. As to burning this onto a DVD5, use Virtual CloneDrive or something similar and mount the disc image, then use DVD Fab on that as if it were a disc and create a second DVD9 iso. This new ISO will go through DVD Shrink now slicker than shit. I promise."
