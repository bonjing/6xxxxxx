For all the rare 80's posts. The RIAA complains about pirating, but if the industry won't promote quality music like your torrents, then we have to rely on word of mouth.

I think that I now have all of your torrents, and I have them on my MP3 player over the radio at work. Vastly superior to the crud that is on the local radio stations out here.

cheers for the time and effort you put into this collection."
,fanciz,2011-10-29T10:29Z,"Thanx for the upload. I love Valley of Evergreen. I was fortunate enough after a hard fought battle on ebay to get their CD Retrospect. I have also the extended version which is even better than the album version. Thanx also for The Major Thinkers. I think it was one of my request long time ago. They have very good songs.
 I think, it was yesterday that I was listening to some Les Enfants tracks coz I'm in the process of checking your compilations against what is available on Amazon. I already found and ordered Chalk Circle and Blue Peter hahaha My next order includes White Door, That Petrol Emotion, Kane Gang, The Bongos etc
I'm not so familiar with Skank, I'm goin to give them a listen.
BTW Check out the new boxset of FLL. I already got one that includes their 4 albums and I have ordered a second copy as spare hahaha "

[V],80zforever,2011-10-30T07:43Z,"wetWeasel, you were bang on with your comments about the music industry. A bunch of whinners stuck in the 70s business models. By the way I am so glad you are liking these torrents.

Fanciz you might like to konw that I was also a bidder on Alternative Radio CD but it just got too pricy. Now I would not mind if you upolad and email it to me lol

gb-record, i just have two songs from them, Poetry In Motion and Dancing Into Danger. I am not aware if they had a full record?

tkm0718, welcome man!"
