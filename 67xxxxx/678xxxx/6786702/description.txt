| Plot summary |
----------------
In this adaption of Robert Heinlein\'s novel, 
we follow the adventures of a squad of troops as they fight in a war of survival against merciless alien invaders. 
Facing constant danger, they are the ones who have to do the thankless task of facing the enemy head on, 
and for the sake of humanity, they must prevail. 

NOTE: The series was supposed to be 44 episodes, but was brought to an end a little too early and only 36
episodes was really completed. That is why Trackers contains mostly of recycled clips of earlier episodes,
and the last 4 episodes was never completed.
