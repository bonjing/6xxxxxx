The Imperials did a lot more than what I out up here, but these 4 cannot become forgotten.

Sail On

Bread On The Water

One More Song For You (super moving)

Oh Buddha

These 4 tunes I'll never tire of listening to, with One More Song For You so powerfully moving you'll feel it right from the start.

All 4 of these songs, you will never forget even if you only listen once.


Enjoy, find more of there stuff and put it up please. I'm looking for more myself.
