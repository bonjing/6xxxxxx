Wild Britain Series 1: with Ray Mears 
In this series, television's original survivalist, Ray Mears, takes us on an incredible journey, travelling the length and breadth of Great Britain. Each episode is themed around a different habitat to discover some of the varied landscapes and fascinating wildlife that these islands have to offer. From the dramatic heather moorlands of the Peak District, to the beautiful North Norfolk shingle shore and the quintessentially British hay meadow, Ray reveals the hidden world that lives just beyond our doorstep. Sharing his knowledge of field and craft and his passion for British wildlife, Ray shows us how to decode the landscape.
