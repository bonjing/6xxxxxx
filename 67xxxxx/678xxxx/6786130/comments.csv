,Raccoonnookkeeper,2011-11-06T07:12Z,"The reviewer on IMDB said of Katia Winter, ""..., and I predict we'll be seeing a lot more of her in the future."" Having just stated that she appears in the buff, I wonder whether the reviewer used this turn of phrase un-conscious of the inherent pun. Going by the review, there may not be 'a lot more of Katia' left to be seen!"
