@MusicProAppz

I have been trying to access this ""Paid Software"" link [from Hiren's Email].

But, I keep getting this error message: ""The file you are trying to access is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later.""

How did you get this?"
,darkmanmd,2011-11-01T00:59Z,"Hi MPApps,
Yep, you must have  been camping in Hiren's  kitchen. Been waiting for this for a month of Sundays. Thanks for your diligence and hooking me up. Nice work dude. We appreciate it. ) Peace out. dm"

Clean version of the uharc file is in this torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6805709/Hiren_Boot_CD_15"
,Superposition,2012-01-06T16:03Z,"Unfortunately, this file(s) has a trojan as verified by Kaspersy's virus removal tool. I am currently D/L Hiren's 15.1 and 15.1 Reloaded from another torrent site. As soon as I can verify it is clean, I will create a torrent on TPB and seed both individually."
