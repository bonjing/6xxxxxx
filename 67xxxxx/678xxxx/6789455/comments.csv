hmm.. I'd downloaded a Motorhead show in which there's a bunch of video_ts files, and I read on the internet that it is possible to merge these video_ts files using a software. So I had downloaded this software called TSSplitter (that can either divide or merge video_ts files) and I've managed to merge all of the video_ts files into one video file. However, when I play the concert, the video consistently gets stuck for like Ten seconds or so and then plays for another Ten seconds and then it all happens again. 

Do I need to upgrade my Codecs? If I do, then can anyone direct me to the specific Codec/s that I might need? Or perhaps should I use another software when merging video_ts files? Could anybody please recommend me a good software? Or perhaps there's another problem? Please help me. 

Thanks."

,ArrMetal,2011-11-07T18:14Z,"The thing is that I'm pleased with my desktop monitor, so I prefer watching concerts on my PC and not burning the concert onto dvd- meaning that each time a part of the show ends, I need to navigate among like 20 divided parts of the concert in order to open the follow up video- which is why I want to merge all of the video_ts files into one file. Does it make sense to you? "
