Product Description: This title helps you to be an eyewitness to the life of a knight. Did you know caltrops - nasty spiked objects - were scattered over the ground before battle to injure animals or men who trod on them? Take a look at a knight's life, from young squires learning the trade to weaponry, armour and battle. You can get the picture using the clip-art CD with over 100 amazing images to download. Then use the giant pull-out wallchart to decorate your room. Great for projects or just for fun, this fact-packed guide and CD shows and tells you everything you need to know about knights. "I am a big fan of these...They are brilliantly visual". "There isn't a child that would be able to resist picking that up" - "Reader Reviews".
