,Holding_it_Steady,2011-11-02T12:55Z,Thanks!
,VaLkYRiE2,2011-11-04T05:53Z,I created an account just to say that this is NOT 320kbps. It is VBR. 
,grenole,2011-11-07T17:39Z,"Yup it's VBR, and high quality VBR, therefore sounds as good as 320 without wasting space. 320 is also sketchy since you can reencode to it and nobody can tell. So VBR is preferrable.

Lame 3.97 VBR
Avg. bitrate ~246kbps JS, 44khz

Looks like an excellent rip! thank you!"
,Int3rpol,2011-11-08T20:00Z,You're welcome!!! And sorry for the mistake about the bitrate...
