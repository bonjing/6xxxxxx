Just be sure to copy all 4 files in the SKidrow folder and you should be fine. "
,Gizmo3739,2011-11-01T14:06Z,Does this one have the real names?? They said that only the all black and Aussie teams have the real names...
,robbo1987,2011-11-01T14:32Z,It doesn't have the licenses for all the names on a lot of the international teams. As the official RWC game has those... but they have the licenses to the european and super 14 etc teams.
