,The Hawk,2012-01-25T05:34Z,"Google has installed a setting into the Android operating system to prevent you from installing software that has not been approve by them.

To get around this annoyance, click on SETTINGS, choose Applications, and check the box:  ""Unknown sources""

Next, save the .APK file to your SDCard.  Use the file explorer to find it, click on it and it will install normally.

Thank you for not being another sheep lead to the Google market slaughter!"
