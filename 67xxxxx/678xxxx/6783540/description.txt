Believe it or not, even with hundreds of new features or replaced features, the ISO image of Preview 5 is in fact lighter than the ISO image of Preview 4!
This is the second last preview leading up to illume OS 1.0! Youâ€™re welcome to send some feedback to my email address specially made for this project - csiew.illume@gmail.com. Iâ€™ve already set to work on the next preview release, and itâ€™s pretty stunningâ€¦
You can download the ISO image from here.

P.S. - When booting up, youâ€™ll see a few things thatâ€™ll look like errors, but theyâ€™re really just showing up because some of the drivers bundled with the ISO are not for your hardware, so you wonâ€™t have to worry about it.

So, you must be pretty adventurous to come over to this page, eh? Well this is like a Chemistry lab, where the wrong mixtures could result to an undesired reaction. I do have to warn you, these ISO images are not for the faint-of-heart. If you screw your hard disk up... well that's 'death' by misadventure.
To login to illume OS, the user account name is 'root' while the password is 'pineapple'. If you've installed illume OS to a hard disk, you have the choice of making your own user account under your name and your own password via the Terminal using the command 'adduser'... or to go to the Package Manager and remove a package called 'xdm'.
