,aaron4corona,2011-11-01T18:38Z,Hi... I just wanted to tell you thank you for your hard work! I just read your comment and it didn't click until I did! I have been downloading these now for over a month and there is so much music here for me to listen to and it has been a great blessing to know that you have been working so much to put it up here. I have never commented on a torrent before but this one is different. It is so big and so useful that I have to let you know that you are doing a great job!!!

As a believer, it is easy to satisfy our desire for good music with what the world throws at us, but havin a better and spirit filled alternative cannot be overemphasized. Thankx for micah stampley, he was a guest minister in my church recently where he blessed us with his annointed, spirit filled worship: 'Heaven On Earth"" was a smash hit with the congregation.  Looking forward to Dwayne tryumf and other holy hip hop artist.
Thankx again......you are blessed!"
