      Kevin Johnson is an Australian singer-songwriter, most active in the 1970s, and is best known for his 1973 song "Rock and Roll I Gave You the Best Years of My Life".which peaked at #4 on the Australian singles charts. 
      According to rock music historian, Ian McFarlane, it is one of the most covered songs written by an Australian with 27 different artists recording it in 1975 alone. Covers include fellow Australians Col Joye and Digby Richards and international artists such as Mac Davis, Terry Jacks, Gary Glitter and Tom Jones. Some cover artists, including Mac Davis, leave out the lyric "... I'd never be a star" for a happier ending. Others, like Gary Glitter, leave out the upbeat ending in the Johnson version for a more somber ending. In the U.S., Johnson's single went to #73 on the Billboard singles chart in 1973, Jacks's went to #97 in 1974 and Davis's became the biggest hit, reaching #15 in 1975.
