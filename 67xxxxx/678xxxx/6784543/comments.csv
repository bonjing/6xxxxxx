,justoned420,2011-10-31T06:44Z,better late than never

,nobrainer666,2011-10-31T07:10Z,AVI PLEASE!!!!!
,logan-xart,2011-10-31T08:26Z,...mkv is shit...
,outpatient730,2011-10-31T08:40Z,"why are you having problems uploading a avi eztv, honestly what are you doing here?"
,mikeyb79,2011-10-31T09:03Z,"What's wrong with MKV, it's open source and a lot easier to actually encode HD on as the files are smaller and better quality. Just get VLC or a cheap WD Live player for your t.v. or don't get the HD versions."
,potah,2011-10-31T09:08Z,"What´s up with the nagging about .avi? There is nothing wrong with a .mkv
Get another player or get out.

Even the ""free"" stuff isn´t good enough for some. Ungrateful people, that´s the spirit these days.
Have a nice day now!"
,festisio,2011-10-31T09:19Z,The fucking retards who demand .avi probably use windows media player - just fuck off you cunts.
,outpatient730,2011-10-31T09:34Z,mkv doesn't convert on a vast amount of programs avi converts on all. it's not that difficult to figure that out. get a clue.
,n3xu7,2011-10-31T10:09Z,"You're getting something for free dumbasses, quit bitching.  Learn how to recode if you really want your shitty xvid."
,maxpower100,2011-10-31T10:10Z,"I need to use subtitles. To use subtitles with mkv, first I have to convert the mkv to avi, then I have to convert it again with virtuadub to sync up with the subtitles. It doesn't always work. Avi would be alot easier, and it works for virtually everyone. I really doubt that a 1.22 gb mkv file is any better than a 1.22 gb avi file. Why not just use avi?"
,baconguy,2011-10-31T10:16Z,I would be surprised if people asking for the .avi simply want the smaller file size since .mkv's are over twice as large
,maxpower100,2011-10-31T10:21Z,"Anyway, thanks for uploading this."
,N00bee,2011-10-31T10:27Z,"@eztv
Thanks!

@nero420187
One would think one whining comment is enough...

@logan-xart
Then just don't download.

@outpatient730
eztv provides un-rar releases. What do you do here? Then get a program that coverts mkv."
,s3177430,2011-10-31T10:41Z,I don't mind watching mkv.. the quality is better..  but the reason i download avi's is cause my xbox doesnt read mkv... so I can't stream it to my tv =(
,s3177430,2011-10-31T10:41Z,oh and as usual thanks eztv keep up the great work
,hemantkumar,2011-10-31T10:47Z,"First of all thanks to eztv..... good work as always.&
 second......Hey guys quit asking for avi files, mkv files are much better in terms of quality.avi files also get damaged during
1. an attack by malicious trojans or worms
2. after installing a new window or formatting.
only fault with mkv is that you do not find subtitles easily, for that try using bs player pro available on piratebay by chatchitto,it finds subtitles for any video online."
,cwedo,2011-10-31T10:53Z,".mkv will eventually take over from avi's, anyone who actually knows what thier talking about will agree.

I for one still download avi's i prefer them purely for thier file size and versitility across my home network and a few old pc's that cant handle 720p very well.

one day i will have to make the switch to .mkv's.. but for now.. where the hell is my avi dexter! :)"
,Asif_Freak,2011-10-31T11:14Z,"@outpatient730
Search for ""handbrake"" on www.google.com and use it to easily re-encode mkv into whatever you want."
,nambr9,2011-10-31T11:18Z,"i have problems streaming mkv via wireless, so im waiting for avi."
,ferdie82x,2011-10-31T11:40Z,"why you want a SD .avi file of this
avi look like shit, a HD .mkv is beter to watch.

can you not play no mkv files try it whit
VLC PLAYER this player can play all you media files.
or buy a beter pc or media player

@maxpower100

I do not know if there are already sub, s in your language
sub, s are made â€‹â€‹by people themselves
If you have a sub for a video and you want under your video
Download subtitle you unpack it and stop it. srt file in the folder where your video is make sure the name of the sub, s is equal to your video otherwise the subtitle is not"
,barrist,2011-10-31T11:43Z,@maxpower: learn English. 
,Buelligan826,2011-10-31T11:59Z,Some of us like AVI because it is more versatile.  I can't play an MKV through my PS3.
,PrincePwn,2011-10-31T12:10Z,They probably just want avi because an mkv breaks consistency with their folder structure OR their device doesn't support mkv by default.
,rocco_sifredi,2011-10-31T12:41Z,thx man
,rustyrambo,2011-10-31T13:12Z,Why the abnormally large file? usually an episode of dexter uses about 550MB.
,zork219,2011-10-31T13:16Z,Thanks for upload and especially for MKV! I love it ;)
,ericripper,2011-10-31T13:20Z,"BUELLIGAN:

You can watch MKV on PS3.  Download a free program TSMuxer. In that program, choose the .MKV video file you download, and select the output file as .M2TS. You can stream it to PS3, or copy it to a USB flash drive and plug it right in your PS3. Works great, looks great. The conversion time from MKV to M2TS is just a couple of minutes."
,WJKelso,2011-10-31T13:26Z,"Whats with the large size of file?

I personally love the MKV quality however my tv plays avi files when I simply copy them on a disc without having to spend hours changing the format.  I can get a full season on a dvd usually.  From that angle an AVI option would be welcome :)"
,Shrimp67,2011-10-31T13:47Z,"I'll tell you why I prefer SD:
It's smaller size, and decent quality.
I don't need to see every mole and wrinkle on the actors face to enjoy this brilliant series, and some people pay a lot for their bandwidth and data.
Also, many times I put series on my phone and watch it on the train and I want to be able to more than 10 episodes on my 16gb phone.

EZTV please continue to release SD as well!"
,badeye,2011-10-31T14:10Z,@Buelligan826: you can use ps3 media server to stream mkv files to your ps3 
,zork219,2011-10-31T14:12Z,"""without having to spend hours changing the format"".
Demuxing of MKV takes about 1 min of time, and to mux files to AVI one more minute. I personally 
use MKVextract + Avi demux. It's very easy."
,rustyrambo,2011-10-31T14:26Z,"ERICRIPPER:

Thanx for the info on tsMuxer. I converted 3 seasons of The Wire using iSkysoft and it took over 3 days. tsMuxer did a 2 hour movie in 1 min 37 sec. The problem is, when played on my Ps3, there is no Audio :'(  Any suggestions?"
,MacThizzle,2011-10-31T14:56Z,"For one, why is the file twice the size than other dexter episodes, series special or something (extended show)??? Then to all those people whining about mkv container files.... GET OUT OF THE BAY!!!!  Obviously being in the bay you outta know how to survive, take steps to live (play, rip, copy, burn) with what you have!!! Not being a crybaby because you cant immediatley download and do what it is you want to do!!!  Try learning some things, conversion is simple if your not an mkv fan!!!! And if thats too much time for you to convert something you paid nothing for why dont you try copying the shows, reformatting them, then uploading them for all your other lame ass avi fans!!!!"
,Sicy,2011-10-31T16:17Z,This is taking forever :(
,TheTwinTowers,2011-10-31T17:45Z,No AVI? Lame.

,redfire111,2011-10-31T18:30Z,BULLSHIT! Crappy file is all broken and won't play on VLC. I waited all night for this shitty file. Fuck that.
,AliZaybar,2011-10-31T19:22Z,"Yes, I could certainly convert, mux, and mutilate every file I download so that its compatible with the device I want to use. And I could make a shirt out of a garbage bag and go to the dance. 

People who don't want to use .mkv files have every right to ask for an .avi alternative since an .avi version was not released for this show until after the .mkv (an unusual circumstance for eztv releases). I personally don't want to have to mess with files I download in order to watch them on my device of choice, even if 'it only takes a minute.' 

But if .mkv works for your purposes, congratulations on having found a file format that meets your needs. And thank you ptl_base for pointing me to an .avi version which is what I came here looking for.

The people who get all worked up over this are like those guys who hang around video game stores waiting to tell you how much you suck for having an XBOX or PS3 because the other is so much better."
,awdrkjb,2011-10-31T20:25Z,The file is broken. Won't play in VLC
,lazopper,2011-10-31T21:05Z,"Alright. First of all, keep all of your stupid debates about which format  is the best to yourselves. No one cares about that,seriously.

avi file or mkv file. small file size or large file size You get that for free here! Be grateful for that and keep your comments to the quality of the torrent."
,TAM70,2011-10-31T21:17Z,"Thanks eztv, been downloading from you for some years and you always deliver good stuff ^_^ Greetings from Norway"
,facebreak,2011-10-31T21:37Z,"Fuck all you unappreciative little twats that have the nerve to complain about a torrent such as this. I'd like to wring your fucking necks. If you don't like the format, fuck off and go elsewhere. eztv works hard to provide this shit for free, so instead of complaining and demanding other formats, how about you thank him. Thanks eztv!"
,bart1989,2011-10-31T22:35Z,"This torrent does not work on VLC media player, despite people saying that .mkv will still work on it. Sound was broken up and video was skipping a good 3 seconds in between frames. So to all of you bitching about people bitching that this is not a .avi, get your heads out of your asses because we have a valid reason to complain. There has been a .avi file every week until this one, so really, what is up with that?"
,bart1989,2011-10-31T22:37Z,"Not to mention the fact that it took 5+ hours to download, when I usually have it downloaded in about 20 minutes.

Oh, and A = 1, V = 0."
,BrianG76,2011-11-01T00:42Z,Thanks eztv. We can always count on you for the best stuff..
,Persekarva,2011-11-01T04:05Z,"Thanks! Great as always!

Don't pay attention to bart1989 he is just a retard with a crappy computer. Of course .mkv files work perfectly fine with VLC. I know because i just watched this and the quality was perfect, both video and audio."

you are a cunt.  your computer is too slow to play this file.  please eat shit.  "

Thanks again for another great up .ez"
,potah,2011-11-01T09:12Z,"I know this is not the right place for this, but i seriously wonder how some people think and act in life. It canÂ´t be just a age thing, there are people older than 20 that can be just like that as well.

Ask yourself what you really get out of a comment in the range of this one: ""F00k you retarded asswipe, your mother sux cock""

For real? Go on like that in life and you will just end like a bitter old man, or boy, frustrated over things that you do NOT need to pay attention to. Focus on more important things in life, life is what you make of it.

ItÂ´s fascinating, the kind of comments people just spew out over everything from this to facebook, youtube and whatever.
Later in life you will find out that people often times appreciate when someone can express themselves both verbally and the written word.

Make something of yourself instead of talking down others, thatÂ´s just a negative circle that you will continue to follow forever."
,madmosche,2011-11-01T13:57Z,"Thank you so much!! eztv, you are awesome!!"
,ThatWisconsinDude,2011-11-02T02:02Z,"Potah... 

Really? You have to go on the internet to judge people? 

The reason people flame on the internet is so they don't have to read pussy shit coming from pussy faggots like you. Its dumb. 

And btw there is a difference between being a random comment on a website, then actually talking shit with your voice. If you or anyone else can't realize that then GTFO!! Pussy."
,guy_wild,2011-11-02T06:42Z,"Guys.

[T],thetorrentlord,2011-11-02T20:22Z,"First of all MKV is a container to hold multiple chapters and subtitles and a video file. It can be used for 720p or smaller depending on the encoders preferences. Second, for all the complainers looking for an avi it should be in this classification (http://thepiratebay.org/browse/205), if you are complaining here this is for 720p which is almost always mkv now because the compression is much better with x264 than xvid. Third, if you wanted an inferior quality file why did you download an mkv and then complain about how large the file size was? IMHO if you are watching on an up to date TV then you would only watch avi files if you had no other choice because of the noticeable difference in quality."
,PA_Team,2011-11-03T00:57Z,"V/10
A/10 .. as usual. 

why post? eztv always has perfect quality torrents. 
Also i highly recommend using Vuze. You can download torrents with it and also stream the torrents to your xbox/ps3 regardless of the type of video file. It is the sweetest program ive ever downloaded. try it out and see for yourself"
