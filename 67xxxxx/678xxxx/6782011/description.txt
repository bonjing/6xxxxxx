- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

  A hard-touring Ohio band with a debut record that didn't reach the Billboard
  charts until a full seven months after its initial 2004 release,
  Hawthorne Heights plays a bracing brand of emo rock. The group combines the
  punky tunefulness and speedy rhythms of the Descendents with a heavy,
  prog-influenced sound that owes more to the "math rock" and "screamo" scenes.
  "Silver Bullet" begins with complex Rush-like start-stop unison fills, before
  giving way to an ultra-catchy chorus that would make fellow Midwesterners
  Cheap Trick smile, while "Ohio Is for Lovers" adds a healthy dose of guttural
  throat-shredding over lyrics that examine love and death. "Niki FM" uses
  metallic riffing and careening lead guitars to evoke a seemingly obsessive
  relationship. Equal parts raging post-hardcore and gentle melodicism,
  The Silence in Black and White is a dynamic, appealing emo album.
  
- Uploader Notes ------------------------------------------------------------ -
	
  Dear Hawthorne Heights fans,
  this is my own rip from original CD, extracted and remastered in my studio
  because it's the golden album of Hawthorne Heights. The original recording
  quality is not good and I decided to remaster the CD and upload exclusively
  for you. You can now enjoy the best quality on the internet supplied by me.
  I used the new LAME MP3 Encoder 3.99 and the best high quality settings for
  MP3. All the tags are filled with information about the album. Please seed
  as long as you can. I'm able to upload FLAC version too for the lovers.
  Any feedback and comments are more than welcome! Thanks.
