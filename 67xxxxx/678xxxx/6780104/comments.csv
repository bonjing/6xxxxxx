[V],catflap,2011-10-30T02:52Z,"you and others clearly have no clue how this works.

eztv, vtv and others put their own names on other
groups' files. eztv, vtv, etc. DO NOT release their
own files. they grab scene releases directly from the
scene groups via newsgroups AND THEN THEY PUT
THEIR OWN TAGS ON THEM.

so if ettv wants to do the same, that's not any
different than what eztv, vtv, etc. do."
