You may notice sound quality degradation (besides it being not good in the first place) during songs 9 and 10 (plus there's a short pause between them). Memory card in the audio recorder failed, so I had to use sound recorded by the camera for the missing part of audio recording. 

Bonus: 
Iris performing "It Generates" during previous Synthember Wave Festival on 2010-09-11 at Tochka club, Moscow, Russia (running time 2m 50s). 

Due to the limitations of camera, picture turns black for around a second between songs. 

This recording is also available on YouTube - just look for my channel, I have the same username there (parafinSpobs).
