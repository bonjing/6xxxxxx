The Physx engine seems toned down (there is no more rag-doll effect on dead characters). You cant pick up objects and dead bodies in realtime like in Oblivion (although you can examine objects in the inventory). Overall it's a huge disappointment for me.

,azureray,2011-11-02T09:20Z,"Well, I'll confirm, the PC torrent is fake. Installation eventually asks for your phone number for a service run by ZipRo.ru. The installer (not even titled setup.exe, does not contain any sort of Bethesda launcher, is 3GB, and yet there's still 3 bin data files. 
Also, the crack won't even start up on a 64-bit system which I doubt razor would have done. Oh well :/"
,Mr.TroIIz,2011-11-02T09:26Z,"@ rodzandz

''You cant pick up objects and dead bodies in realtime like in Oblivion''

Stop lying you son of a bitch. I've seen trailers where the player picks up books and other objects in real time and moves them around. It was even confirmed by Todd Howard.

Of course the Xbox will have garbage graphics. What do you expect from 6 year old hardware.
That's why REAL GAMERS use a PC. 

''Lately there seems to be a tendency of new games looking worse than their older counterparts! (Rage, Crysis 2 anyone?)''

Crysis 2 was the best looking game in the world until Battlefield 3 came out. Crysis without mods does not have better graphics than Crysis 2. If you add mods, even then it's hard to tell which one is better looking. Rage is completely different story. It was a shitty console port with bad driver support.

And btw, Skyrim will look much better on PC even without mods. Console gamers are stuck with the vanilla graphics forever. We, PC gamers, can enjoy thousands of mods while you will be stuck with low res textures, screen tearing and whatnot.

Enjoy your Shitbox.

Ah, another troll, or a simple close minded fanboy. Let me enlighten you.

Crapbox graphics will be below the bare minimum graphics on the PC.
That 7+ year old hardware can only do so much; if anything.

1080p? There are no games on Crapbox that can be played in 1080p.
All you poor dirty console gaming peasants are getting is 480p upscaled to 720p, barely so.

Have fun playing it with your crappy graphics while I blast it on my 23"" monitor in full 1920x1200 1080p resolution, with a 7.1 surround system.

I rest my case."
,sile2005,2011-11-03T17:20Z,"@wimwinkle I don't know dude,I've compared it to the E3 demo that's right here on the pirate bay witch is 720p,the textures look bad in comparison to the demo dude."
,sile2005,2011-11-03T17:28Z,"@Arbiter89 I know what you are talking about,I had to make a choice betwen a new graphic card or something else so I sold my PS3 and my old flat screen TV and went for a BIG WIDE ASS full HD 1080p TV and a surround system + a 2 gig of ram upgrade on my PC,so I have a quad core,4 gigs of ram and a 9800GTX and I'm happy about my money investment."
,8bitbubsy,2011-11-03T17:30Z,"@Arbiter89
Your naive ""wise man"" way of putting your sentences doesn't make you any smarter.
Not to mention that a lot of the 360 games are true 720p, maybe you should check this out before ""stating fact like a wise wizard""?
It's not all about graphics either, mr. Arbiter."
,wimwinkle,2011-11-03T17:40Z,"@Arbiter89 the only people Trolling here are the PC/ps3 gammers who can't play it yet. And ""Have fun playing it with your crappy graphics while I blast it on my 23"" monitor in full 1920x1200 1080p resolution, with a 7.1 surround system.""you obviously can't read as I clearly stated I was getting the game for the PC.

@sile2005 Sure the graphics don't blow you away and I never said they did. but it's far better than oblivion and much better than what people are claiming it to be."
,sile2005,2011-11-03T18:02Z,"@wimwinkle at the very start of the demo when Todd talks about that plant there ""this plant here"",in the demo the textures look waaaaay better then that same location on this xbox version,I was blow away When I fist say the demo and I was like..""this is on xbox??!?!get the fuck out of here"" ,the graphics don't match dude  "
,DanielRibeiroMarinho,2011-11-03T18:20Z,"@sile2005 that happen with battlefield 3 too, when i saw the gameplay trailer, i was like omfg ! now i bought the game and don't even looks like that gameplay on xbox 360 ! same on PS3. I don't understand .."
,CommonFacade,2011-11-03T18:37Z,what i think is that they probaly just used the hd modifications and hd screen to make it look best as possible but it is on the xbox just with alot of HD modifications and @ arbiter bro you talking about fanboys it seems your a pc fanboy who believes pc is better than everything i have pc ps3 and xbox and i like all of them i dont care about a game looking better on the pc i like to have a controller in my hand instead of keyboard and mouse and usually play games on the pc with a xbox 360 contoller so yeah where are you getting at -__-
,fanfasnight,2011-11-03T20:12Z,"Yes the game is great, the more you play the better it gets. The graphics are not amazing but they are quite good. I have pc and xbox but i will just play the xbox verson of the game. Later"
,J0hnQQ,2011-11-03T20:26Z,"ALL Battlefield 3-footage have been from the PC-version, unless stated otherwise. Wouldn't surprise me if Skyrim did this too. But the latter I'm unsure of.

Not long until 11.11.11 anyway :)"

,babbleM,2011-11-03T23:08Z,"question for anyone who can answer it, most of the new xfd3 releases like, Skyrim, Cod MW3, Batman arkham city, Battlefield & Rage say ""to play this game u need to install a system update, if u do not install this update u can not play the game"" - my question is, will installing this update flash my 360 to stock?

p.s. I have read that it is harmless but I want to be double sure to avoid the hassle of reflashing thanks"

Thanks to the developer for uploading !

This torrent seems to work great until I start it up :s

Am I the only one experiencing this problem and how can I fix it if you know it ;-)?

Kind regards

,Snaxxet,2011-11-10T00:07Z,"Game works fine! at level 5 now. But wondering if this is a final release cuz there seems to be a lot of graphic bugs in this game. Like its a BETA or something. They cant have released the game unfinished like this can they? Running in water 4 example, the water is hardly effected, getting hit by a Giant, you sometimes fly like 100m up in the air . Animals keep getting stuck and the A.I is weird, some enemies run at you then run away and then run at you again and when you almost killed it, it SUDDENLY disappears in to thin air in open field.
 Graphics compared to other games these days could have been alot better and maybe on 2 discs instead. Although  all this negative about it....the game experience is at max!! with the AWSOME freeness and GREAT music! I will keep playing but ...bummed out by some small things I thought they would fix from OBLIVIAN.??Anyone know anyting about this??"
,Skyywolf3,2011-11-10T00:15Z,"So, I'm confused. If this is an 8.1gb file, how do I burn it to a DVD with a max capacity of 4.7gb? Do I HAVE to use a ""flasher"" such as Jungle Flasher? Are there other requirements? I've done a lot of research and couldn't find much helpful information."
,Enjoyhax,2011-11-10T09:12Z,"Thanks a lot mate!

I can confirm it works, burned with my laptop with integrated burning drive, without an Ihas drive nor any custom firmware.

Burned with ImgBurn 2.5.6.0 using the truncate method, on a Verbatim MK003, at 3x speed.

Have been playing it for about 8 hours now, without a single crash, or any problems, have not tried installing it yet.

Tested it on a Xbox 360 PHAT, LiteOn DG-16D5S,
Ixtreme LT+ 2.0.

I do recommend buying a LiteOn Ihas drive though, aproximately one tenth of the XGD3 games will not run using the truncate method, but in time, every XGD3 game will be unplayable.

Despite a lot of people complaining about the graphics, I'm surprised at the level of detail, I did not expect this, especially considering I'm using a old television with 4:3 resolution.

Thanks a lot again! Will seed until next month!"
,voolandis,2011-11-10T13:52Z,"To all the PC gamers, that think they are ""greater"" than us - console owners; let me get this straight:
-You are ""real gamers"", and we are ""the casual ones""?
Well, that is SO true! You see, we bought our systems to have fun from time to time, and we didn't need any money for upgrades for over 6 bloody years!
We are casual gamers, because we spend most of our life outside, hanging with real friends (the ones made of flesh and bones, you following?) and spending our money on shots, beer and chicks, not on some stupid component upgrades.
We have social life, and wadda you have? Dark room and a groupie that answers to ""mom"".
Get a life, dudes. I mean it.

Official release of the iXtreme LT+ v2.0 for Hitachi drives
- Support for XGD3 ixtreme backups using LT-MAX for maximum capacity on standard DVD+R DL discs.
- Support for large capacity DVD+R DL media (no errors when burning)

About upcoming iXtreme LT+ 3.0 â€“ released after December 6th
Originals will need to be analysed by XBC to gain disc topology data. This data replaces the need for ap25/dae.bin data and enables any ap25 challenge to be answered correctly. The topology data method is very efficient using only 24k and is very accurate. Each title will need its own topology data as there are differences between titles, even xgd3 titles and backups can be detected if the same topology data is used between titles.
Backups will remain the same layout but will need the new topology data inserted by the new abgx or re-dumped with the new XBC for xgd2/ap25 or xgd3 titles.
Non ap25 titles will remain unchanged

Thanks go to Team Jungle for their hard work and efforts in the development process.
Thanks also go to Team Xecuter for their support to this project."

I installed it, truncated at 97% but the Xbox sees it OK.
The thing is that when I start it, I get a message:
This game requires an update, but an update could not be found""... I'm quite the noob with this but couldn't find any info about this anywhere. Help someone?"

"
,10vazza10,2011-12-31T14:29Z,"@yanipan :

Hope you flashed your Xbox !

yes it will pop-up for a update . what you have to do is ..
remove ur memory card or HDD or USB flash drive off from the xbox then switch on the Xbox .. ""now the game works""
then Insert the Memory unit."

,user1212,2012-02-05T21:14Z,"I'm unable to set the layer break to the one specified in the dvd file.

ImgBurn gives an error:
W 15:09:32 User specified layer break position exceeds L0 capacity.
W 15:09:32 User Specified L0 Sectors: 2,133,520
W 15:09:32 Maximum L0 Sectors: 2,086,912
W 15:09:32 Set L0 Data Zone Capacity Failed! - Reason: Invalid Field in Parameter List

Game then doesn't play (using ixtreme 3.0 so should be fine).

How did people manage to use the given layer break number?"
