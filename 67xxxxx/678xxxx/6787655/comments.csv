,8Corei7,2011-11-01T15:17Z,BOTS u said ?!?
,priex10,2011-11-01T15:32Z,Its working on pirated copy too. Thank you ErikZown
,godofwrath08,2011-11-01T16:17Z,guyz all i get is battlelog aswell any ways round this ?
,RKO1989,2011-11-01T16:54Z,Is dis a multiplayer crack..i mean can it be used with the pirated version or u need to own d game??
,Snoopzeh,2011-11-01T17:00Z,@priex10 How u made it work?
,payam1,2011-11-01T17:08Z,Guys...does this mean that we only need to pay $9.99 in order to play online?? Hell just pirate the game then and pay the 10 bucks. Battlefield 3 was solely designed for multiplayer fun anyways. If there are any mess ups in my logic here please correct me but it just seems like all we need to do is bypass battlelog -- and that's just $10. Totally worth it.

,superbigel,2011-11-01T17:55Z,What about MD5 sum check by PB? will PB ban you if it finds exe mistmatch?
,demo990,2011-11-01T18:00Z,"@payam1
how did you calculate those 10$? I don't follow..."
,Alnuks,2011-11-01T18:42Z,"try to understand what u read :/ This is for people who bought the game and don't want to start the game with ""origin"", u still need a legal account to log in the ""battlelog"""
,BlackMoth,2011-11-01T19:05Z,Idiots this is only if you bought the game
,virvelvinden85,2011-11-01T19:11Z,"I can't unpack the file, what program do i need for that?"
,chihaiacosmin,2011-11-01T19:47Z,...open with... winrar
,payam1,2011-11-01T20:13Z,My mistake.. I thought you could purchase an online code for $9.99 and the rest would be handled through battlelog. I had a brief moment of hope ='(
,BileesD,2011-11-01T20:26Z,hope they can do something about the pirate version too
,xcloudx,2011-11-01T20:33Z,"Thanks, but is it possible you can make it get around battlelog too? Its even worse than origin. ""easiest way to join your friends"" my ass, more like most difficult and buggy as hell."

,LCFer,2011-11-02T01:22Z,now im buying the game! =)
,johnniebrasco,2011-11-02T06:53Z,"I own the game, and the thing that bugs me is that when you start the game you are starting about six-seven processes compared to the usual one, or two if you use programs like steam. thats origin, firefox, two plugin-containers, battlesonar (or something), and the game itself. Why not do like steam and put all these in one?? I am considering this hack but i am wondering if I will get trouble withthe game afterwards when the updates start coming?"
,Fibrasek,2011-11-02T13:39Z,only works in the original game. pirate can not play online
,DevlinXIII,2011-11-03T04:07Z,"@3 (DjDede) what do u mean by this ""Works only for these, who bought the game, but bot for pirats"" ??
BF3 cracked gets bots for MP instead ?? cuz if that's true, it's still very damn good."
,woqesud,2011-11-03T11:31Z,"Okay, so what am I doing wrong???
It opens Battlelog in firefox, and when I try to join a server the page tells me to install Origin....
Do I need to have Origin installed?"
,RockPaperShotgunz,2011-11-03T11:42Z,"@DEVLINXII, OPEN YOUR EYES, THIS IS FOR LEGIT OWNERS OF BF3, NOT PIRATES! BUY THE GAME, IF YOU CANT, GET A JOB!"
,DevlinXIII,2011-11-03T16:43Z,"@RockPaperShotgunz lol I never hoped that it would be a proper MP crack to play online, I only asked if this allowed for bots on a cracked game.
And don't be so full of yourself becuz u bought the game, I got no interest in buying it."
,IsoSucks,2011-11-04T00:51Z,"@woqesud
yes you need to have it installed or other wise you can not get the patches for the game.

But what i want to know is if you are a pre loader will this work and not get you banned 

@DevlinXIII In ENGLISH = if you are not one of the people who own the game out right ( full stop you must own the game out right to play multi player )
or in simple terms 
BUY THE GAME.
Even if you are wanting to test it, buy the game support pc gaming , by buying pc games you are supporting a dieing community, its people who down load torrent games that are supporting console gaming, or is every one just a little shit who would rather see no games on pc ?   "
,Sivos,2011-11-04T09:10Z,"@xpmule  Eh, they're just one of those people who think they are important because they bought it; where the fact of the matter they actually think THAT makes them important is sad.  Not inventing an item that changed the world nor discovering a cure for something to save lives, they bought a $60 game and thus think they are gods.  Which chances are they actually didn't buy the game (I mean, they are on this site after all, most people who never pirate games have never even heard of this site.  Even those who have the money to waste still buy games and have never been on this site, or own a console and is a member of Gamefly.  Raises questions).  So pretty much all you are seeing are people who wish to bitch and whine about............I don't know, something.......instead of just being adult about it and moving on.  If someone asks a stupid question, who cares?  Not really like you would see them ever again; you could make them feel bad for maybe a day or so, but it will end there.  It's really sad they act that way."
,Wildsider,2011-11-05T12:29Z,"I'd support PC gaming A LOT more if they get rid of all the DRMs and shit. I actually bought lots of games in the past, all in retail. But ever since Steam was introduced, along with the shitty DRM bundles implemented by game developers, I supported them a lot less. I would only buy the game if I ""really"" liked it, providing that the game has high replay value too.

Personally, I despise Steam. The moment you activate the game on your account, the ownership is no longer yours. You can't revoke or deactivate the game (just in case you wanna give it away) and the shit just ask for your internet connection all the damn time. Offline Mode is limp dick if you ask me."

Will crackers be able to get the pirated version to play online by any means? EA seems too strict with their new method, it looks impossible.....so DID THEY WIN THIS TIME?!?!?!"

,tops.c,2011-11-09T18:40Z,"Ok 2 bf3.exe ' in 1 directory, all this oes it launch Battlelog and when you join a server the ""game manager"" has to install Origin, good try."
,LordQuack,2011-11-10T17:18Z,"For all those spamming ""to play online, buy the game"" comments, many of them should know that people sometimes would like to try the game before they actually give away their money for it.

In other times it was kind of ok to take the risk but nowadays so many companies have the bad habit of turning their biggest titles into shallow mass-money-making productions that most of the times, the ""buy first, test later"" strategy will often end up in being ripped off.

In my case, I was deeply disappointed with the singleplayer in BF3! It was incredibly short, boring (it's more about following certain instructions step by step than actual war) and even bugged, and came out as a deep disappointment! I haven't played a BF game since 1942 (Bad Company 2 doesn't really count as I was so disappointed with it that it almost didn't last in my computer at all) and before I give away 50â‚¬ for it, I'd like to know if the multiplayer is just as good as addicting as BF1942 (one of my all-time favourite shooters) was, and is worth buying it, or if it's just as crappy, flawed and uninteresting as the singleplayer is.

And the thing is that (shame on you EA) I haven't found a single multiplayer demo on the internet!!! So honestly, how do you expect me to test the multiplayer before concluding if the game is just entirely crap or the multiplayer still honours good old 1942 without asking for some ""multiplayer crack""?

I will definitely not give away my money first and then see if it was worth it or not, only to maybe find some huge disappointment as BF3 singleplayer or Bad Company 2! I supported games like Civilization or even GTA IV after testing them and seeing they were worth it, but I will not support with my money the loop of half-assed work most companies have nowadays, as could be seen in Bad Company 2! Now I try first, buy later... that way I know for sure I won't be giving my money to the wrong people!"

FYI, Multiplayer Beta was opened last September 25 to Oct. 10 I think. Probably you didn't got the chance to play it. It was made Open for the players may send the bugs they can see ingame to EA or DICE so that they could fix those bugs. I own the Limited Edition btw, Singleplayer is a bit bad, yes ofc bcs of it's length and not interesting story. But trust me dude, Multiplayer is very very GREAT!!!

,Wildsider,2011-11-18T09:46Z,"Just got a retail copy of Battlefield 3, here's the digs.

- The game essentially FORCE you to install Origin before installing the game itself.

- Once the game is installed, you can use this crack to run the game without having to run Origin. You MUST to install Battlelog plugins and PunkBuster in order to play online.

- The game will function as long as Origin is installed. You don't have to run Origin while playing. However, if you ever REMOVE Origin, you will NOT be able to play multiplayer. (Due to Battlelog Game Manager enforcement.)

""Playing with friends has never been this easy."" My ass. Not only that I have to install this crappy bloatware, including other shit like PunkBuster  and hidden installation of ESN Sonar. I also have to run a friggin' web browser everytime I play the game."

Doesnt work anymore with the new update... Hope they are going to ""crack"" this new onwe too!"

,Sadhudeva,2011-11-24T19:14Z,"@herob4u  

stop talking shit, they not trying to let you play online without buying the game. This whole thing is over origin spying on ""paying customers""  
Its ment to help people who actually bought it but want to protect their privacy "
,JaxSparow,2011-11-27T02:18Z,"I have a legit cd key but no game, would this crack work?"
,LordSte,2011-11-28T07:52Z,"@JaxSparow

A legit CD key means that you own the game.  All you have to do is activate the key on Origin, and you can download and play the game without a crack.

In regard to playing without Origin, this ""fix"" stopped working when they released the newest patch on November 22nd."

Thats what i did, i wanted to see if MW3 would be tight so i torrented it, played it, liked it, deleted off comp, and bought the game at walmart. So shut the fuck up haters"
