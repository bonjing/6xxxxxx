â€¢ Speed graph
Displays a graph chart covering the last several minutes.
â€¢ Speed warning
You can set speed limits for three different types of roads, so when you go over a visual alert or sound will notify you.
â€¢ Display units
Supports units such as miles, kilometers and nautical miles.
* GPX track export
Enables you to save your current track to SD card or email it to someone. GPX format is supported by many applications.
â€¢ Background mode
You can minimize the program and keep it running in background. It will work as usual and even notify you when you exceed the speed limit!
Please note that the accuracy of speed readings depends on your GPS reception quality, which can be affected by a multitude of error-introducing factors.
Also, please bear in mind that this app is not optimized to run on 7-inch tablets or devices with uncommon screen resolutions. You will be able to use it, but it may not display properly.
