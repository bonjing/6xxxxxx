The way the game is to control a knight with a sword, and destroy the enemy, to escape authorities, continue to climb to the top of the castle Ferris, rescued the imprisoned princess. Jump to avoid the elements of the game a lot, very interesting, the difficulty is not small.Paper painted quite seductive painting style.

A kidnapped princess, a brave knight and a tower... very, very, very high. Those are the main ingredients of this action/platform game, created by the indie group Two Bros Games, all that presented with a very remarkable graphic section.
