Hi,

Dutch Sweet is simply a collection of tracks that made a long time personal impression while making Dutch Treat (taste we might share). The playlist tells a musically journey through a variety of less well known songs and sounds. Songs and sounds that survived the might of exclusion and in which sharing is enjoying (for me). A Bit of Fuel for the soul. 

I think this is a reasonable attempt in reaching out to a lot of people, who like to listen to real, honest music as well (and which is suitable for the late hours too :)).
