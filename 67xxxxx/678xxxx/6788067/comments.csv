you wouldnt believe it mate,
but ive had it popped open in restorator and at the same time was hooked up to google translate, i know the odd word in spanish or french , but all is excellent with it ive changed all the language to english and even did the same for the string table,
so all in all, definatly what i was looking for and top respect to you mate for listening out to us and sorting it so quick,
if youd like the translated files its the most i could do seeming you and hacker2009i got it sorted so quick, genuine buzzin i am, also love the pic lakgeaaca looks a bit well alot like chronic dont ya's think,
tops
keep the peace and respect mate
condem78, 
ah nearly forgot to say that ill have a look at the start orb changer, although i have got loads of them from various sites and downloads @ deviant art, i like to go in commando style and head straight for the explorer.exe and open it in rez hakker or restorator,
thanks anyways and will be keeping an eye out for future releases, also let you know when i have done my first theme,
