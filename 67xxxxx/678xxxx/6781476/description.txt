"We're really happy to finally tell you all a number of things we've been working on over as long as the last 6 months. As you may or may not have known we have been working on (and finished) our debut album. We started last September at Rockfield and Moles Studios recording with producer Dan Austin (Doves, Cherry Ghost). After the release of the Algebra EP we felt that we needed an album to fully represent us as a band and we took the time to make sure we did it right. We're really proud of what we have achieved and feel we've finally got to the point where we're entirely happy with all the songs and the recordings and ready to let the world hear it."
