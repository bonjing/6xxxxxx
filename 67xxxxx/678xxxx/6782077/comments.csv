It was once known as VAG-COM.It is primarily used for diagnostics and adjustments of Volkswagen Group motor vehicles, including Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Audi, SEAT, and ĂÂ koda automobiles, along with Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles. The name ""VAG-COM"" derives from the acronym VAG, the name by which the Volkswagen Group was formerly known."

Can anyone tell me what Im doing wrong? 
I have followed the instructions all the way down to using the vidpidfix.exe, but when entering that program, it requires a serial number or description?

Also, my cable shows up as a usb cable in the hardware list and is installed as soon as i plug it in. In other words, its not showing up under ""other units"".

Further I cant find the second driver Im supposed to point the cable towards? Not in this package?

Could really use your help here guys. Have any of you got this version to work?"
