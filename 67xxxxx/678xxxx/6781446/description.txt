Nikita is upset when Birkoff tells her that information in the black box indicates a man named Ramon, who she captured years earlier and turned over to Percy, is now working for Division as an assassin. Amanda convinces Alex to kill Anton Kochenko, a man who once worked for her father, and sets up Ramon so that he will be charged with the murder. However, when Nikita interferes with Amanda's plan, Amanda retaliates by taking what Nikita values most.
