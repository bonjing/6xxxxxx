                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Religion has become big business in Nigeria, with preachers performing exorcisms and
 miracle cures while their congregations pay handsomely for the experience. Reporter
 Seyi Rhodes sees a pastor at work at a church in Lagos, speaks to worshippers who
 believe good fortune will be bestowed upon them for their financial contributions,
 and hears a troubling account of the new churches from a local journalist who has
 been following them for five years.
                          
                                 Enjoy!
