Description:
Martin is a mentally disturbed loner who lives with his mother in a bleak housing project. He works the night shift as a security guard in an equally grim and foreboding underground parking complex. To escape his dreary existence, Martin loses himself in the fantasy world of the cult horror film The Human Centipede (First Sequence), fetishizing the meticulous surgical skills of the gifted Dr. Heiter, whose knowledge of the human gastrointestinal system inspires Martin to attempt the unthinkable.

Note : You didn't think SiC forgot about Human Centipede II did you? This was captured from a standard definition VOD stream. It turned out pretty good for what it is. Currently this is the first and only source of this film available, so take it or leave it. Yes, the entire film is in black and white. Also, the version of the film that IFC released to VOD and theaters is cut by nearly 2 and a half minutes. Unfortunately, this will be the only cut of the film we'll be able to see until they release the unrated director's cut on DVD, which I'm guessing will happen December/January. Until then, this should do. Perfect for Halloween weekend. Get the family together and dig on this wholesome goodness.

Enjoy!
