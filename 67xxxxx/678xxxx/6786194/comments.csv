I've not got the hang of messaging one another and was looking for tip on how to convert some of the files into CBR.

Also I had mentioned even with my McAfee I lost two laptops to trojans from here. Not you I'm sure but any advice how to avoid that besides only downloading with skulls like yourself?

Any help much loved.

Cheers!"

As for help with the virus control I'm not sure I can help you.Used Mcafee also for a while but now I'm using Avast and ZoneAlarm.My advice is for you to also download CCleaner.All of these programs can be downloaded free..."
