From the highly sexed editors of the irreverent Instinct Magazine comes a painstakingly thorough and hysterically illuminating guidebook to perfecting the oft misunderstood art of a good blowjob. Whether you are a straight woman or a gay man, chances are you have either done it or been asked to do it. The question is, did you suck? Well, class is in session as hundreds of surveys conducted with givers and receivers of both sexes, lead to interviews with subjects on how to go from knob slob to blow job champ. 15 chapters and 20 black and white illustrations cover every inch of this topic, while color commentary , and hints and tips from sexologists, porn-stars and sex-workers round out what could be the greatest gift to happy relationships ever published.
