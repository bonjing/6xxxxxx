Inca Mummies Secrets of a Lost World
Discover startling new revelations about this extraordinary civilization. Inca Mummies: Secrets of a Lost World transports you to remote Peruvian mountaintops with archaeologists as they explore a vast and previously unknown citadel. Thousands of Inca mummie many with hair, skin, and eyes intact have been rescued from beneath the streets of a sprawling settlement on the outskirts of Lima,Peru.
The 500-year-old bodies of more than two thousand men, women, and children were excavated from a large Inca graveyard that may contain as many as 10,000 dead. Above the ground, a few feet over the mummies, thousands of their descendants were going about their daily lives. Archaeologists recovering the bodies found many of them in mummy bundles, large cocoons that held up to seven individuals and weighed as much as 400 pounds (180 kilograms). Some of the bundles bound adults and children perhaps entire families together, wrapped in layers of raw cotton and exquisite textiles.
