From the makers of FINAL FANTASY and FINAL FANTASY II comes a brand new RPG masterpiece for the iPhone and iPod touch!! CHAOS RINGS takes full advantage of the iPhone and iPod touchâ€™s capabilities. Using a classic game system that any RPG fan will enjoy, it presents an epic tale consisting of four different scenarios, all brought to you with gorgeous sound and unbelievably smooth 3D graphics.

The story revolves around a tournament where combatants fight for their lives: the Ark Arena. Upon choosing a pair of characters, one male and one female, you will then have to fight against the other pairs. Each pair has their own story, and the truth behind the Ark Arena will not be revealed until each story is completed.

Best looking game I have seen on Ipad /Iphone. If you loved final fantsy games on PSX or PS2 then you owe it to yourself to take a look at this.


Trailer: see for yourself.
