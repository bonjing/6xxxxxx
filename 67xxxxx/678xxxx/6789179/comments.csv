,NewWorldOrphan9,2012-04-27T07:59Z,"@ narutozk & @ pafuller98,

Dependra is talking about after they've installed the MaddenNFL12v102.apk file onto their SGSII, and when it is ran after that it still needs to connect to the EA servers and download the rest of the game, THAT is where they're getting stuck with""nan 0/0...."" The game is NOT downloading the 300+mb from the EA servers.... I have the same problem on my SGSII so I know what they're talking about... So Dependra is not the idiot in this situation...."
