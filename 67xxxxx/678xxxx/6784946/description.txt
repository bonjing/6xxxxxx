Dr. Frosta (Ramiro Oliveros) has been conducting illegal and immoral experiments on the recently deceased in an effort to conquer death and perfect the mental control of his subjects. All that Simone (Marcia Bichette), his estranged girlfriend knows is that the doctor works too hard and doesn t give her enough attention. The police inspector (Fernando Sancho) assigned to the case is getting closer and closer to catching and stopping the doctor.

Unfortunately, the dead are now undead, and the swamp water is infested with living corpses bent on a showdown with the mad doctor!
