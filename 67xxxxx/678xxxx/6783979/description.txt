Laughter is meant to inspire and heal, not belittle and harm. This new collection provides abundant "good clean fun," whenever you need inspirational slices of life, bracing quips, quotable wisdom, or a refreshing dose of nonsense. Church quirks, or corporate perks? From family life to the afterlife, Lowell has it covered.

Best of all, to find the pertinent anecdote, you don't have to read the whole book (though you'll want to). Each of these jokes is categorized and indexed so you can find it on demand. Perhaps you're a public speaker who wants plenty of sparkling witticisms to hone your point. Or maybe you (and your family) simply want to enjoy thousands of fresh jokes. Either way, let An Encyclopedia of Humor help you find the "good" in "good hearty laugh!"
