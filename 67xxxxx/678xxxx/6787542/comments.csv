Perfect as Slickinator accustomed to from you, with all modules"
,Torent.Spy,2011-11-01T14:30Z,thank you very much
,dcheng45,2011-11-02T04:23Z,"for some reason this version isn't working for me. when i load a disc, the scanning bar appears and shows DVDFAB scanning and opening the disc. with this version the scanning bar window flashes real quickly and disappears. I reinstalled an older version and that one worked fine. I have no idea why it is not working. i've tried using the other dvdfab torrents of the same version and still the same problem. any suggestions?"
,isuru003,2011-11-02T06:07Z,"Work 100% thanks,
But I didn't used the patch."
[V],Slickinator,2011-11-02T08:02Z,not sure about that i tested it out on my windows xp and it worked ok
,jersson,2011-11-02T15:44Z,"Yeah I have the same problem dchange45.
The same happened with the 1click dvd copy pro. It said I had a lot of bad factors so I installed an earlier vers and it works like a clock.. I have also gone back to DVDFab 8.1.2.6 and it works as well.
They must have added some new stuff on the 8.1.3.2 vers that gives errors. I have W/7 64B"
,dcheng45,2011-11-02T17:47Z,"I'm running Win7/64-bit too.

One thing I noticed is that on the Start Page when I open DVDFab and after installing the crack, it says that the licensed user is ""Trial User"". Could that be a problem and mean that the crack isn't working? It also says that Update Expire Time is ""Never Been Used"" when it usually says ""Never Expire"". Maybe the problem is that its on Win7 or because its 64-bit. Good to hear that I'm not the only person with this problem though."
,jersson,2011-11-02T19:55Z,"What do ya think about this slickinator ?
Could it be an error of new stuff added to DVDFab ?"
[V],Slickinator,2011-11-03T08:21Z,"well i know dvdfab added some new protection in the dvdfab program but i would say reinstall new one and right click on the patch and run as admin and try patching the dll file and test it again ,may not like my prepatched crack as it was patched on windows xp"
,dcheng45,2011-11-03T16:53Z,"I uninstalled and cleared my registry of any dvdfab stuff. I disconnected my internet (just in case) and reinstalled the program and ran the patch as administrator. I am still getting same results at the Start Page of Trial User and the program doesn't really scan the disk. it just appears for a split second and disappears.

Are any of the people who are successfully using this version running it on Win7 or are the people running XP the only ones who are having success with this?"
[V],Slickinator,2011-11-03T22:33Z,well hmmm other people i know who has dvdfab on windows 7 are working fine i even tested it on my laptop to make sure and all is well .... maybe try copying over the crack dll file or patching in Safe mode just start computer and right away start tapping F8 and go to only Safe mode not safe mode with networking and go in and patch or crack it ... only thing i can think of sorry ... make sure you install dvdfab first 
,dlxmax,2011-11-03T23:43Z,"It did work on my Win7/x64, but now I'm having the same problems too. I have reinstalled twice, no fix."
,dcheng45,2011-11-04T02:21Z,I think it is a problem with a 64-bit Windows. I installed x86 version of win7 and it worked fine on my laptop. maybe it has something to do with the filepath since on 64bit the program is not in the normal Program Files folder but in the (x86) Program Files or whatever folder
[V],Slickinator,2011-11-05T22:06Z,this is a AIO you double click the exe file and use the clickable buttons for everything AIO= all in one file
