Great quality as always

Never had a problem putting them into my iTunes. 
Only problem I've had with HR's Downloads is not having enough space for them all. Time for another 2TB."

,felli_fel,2011-11-08T03:01Z,ummm question non of your movies can be burned onto dvd?
,orkin117,2011-12-08T04:35Z,"I just wanted to thank you for your movies and explain why they're the best so everyone can follow your example

1) .mp4 or m4v files so they're playable anywhere (.mkv? really?)
2) Low file size HD movies.  Seriously ~3-4gb looks good enough.  I don't need movies taking up 10gb each, that's crazy
3) Dual audio
4) I haven't seen any of your movies that have non-english parts, but hard coded non-english subs are a must
5) Slightly higher quality/resolution for high-action movies (not sure if you actually do this one, though)"
