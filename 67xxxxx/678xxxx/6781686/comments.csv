,RevelentDark,2011-10-30T01:28Z,Can anyone get the DLC to work?
,klord2010,2011-10-30T02:52Z,game is unfinished massive let down so either give it a few weeks or forget it.
,elturbo9077,2011-10-30T02:56Z,why the fuck is the update bigger than the game it self 
,NanoEntity,2011-10-30T03:15Z,"so many bugs, and im confused in the game, so many damn menus I don't know how to play this.

They made this game too complicated, i expected homeworld or sins of solar empire style game, but no its turn based, and I just dont know wtf am i doing."
,elturbo9077,2011-10-30T03:23Z,nevermind 
[T],alexisthebest,2011-10-30T03:33Z,"Yea, i've been hearing alot that the game is...bad lol

@elturbo9077

it's an update + a DLC
but yea, the file size is huge"
,Necroclysm,2011-10-30T04:23Z,"It is bigger than ""the original game"" because it really is not an update.
They released an incorrect version to Steam for distribution and when they fixed it, it basically patched instead of forcing people to redownload assets.

Thus they made this release the same way instead of repackaging everything(which may not even work correctly).

Just download the original(get the one by Murlok on TPB) and then both of the uploads Alex put up(which are linked in the comments on Murlok's upload)."
,Culnarion,2011-10-30T10:53Z,"It wasn't released in beta mode, thats just a rumor. The devs, Kerebos Studious, have been in financial difficulty. They've been releasing staff all year. Now its down to a bunch of people with no life slaving in the office while they try to keep the company afloat. Please try the game, then buy it!"
,klord2010,2011-10-30T12:07Z,"it WAS beta. while you are busy spreading false info, dev and publisher already admitted it and apologized it.

i heard being ignorant and retard is good for your own health. keep it up."
,saginatio,2011-10-30T13:31Z,"@alex, @murloc: Thanks for uploading!

Still I have serious problem with this release:( Game crashes at the end of first turn, at saving a ship design and couple of more crucial points. Here is the crash log:

,tantraic,2011-10-30T21:46Z,Hi Alex and thanks for the upload.  I get an error whenever I try to build modules on my civilian trade hub.  It says that the script contains no matching element or something to that effect and then crashes.  I also have the no options problem and the audio cuts out.  If anyone figures out these problems please post solutions here.
,sbseed,2011-10-31T16:16Z,"errors every time i try to update the game... anyone else running into the replacement errors?

i would suggest making a repack of the entire game including all the updates etc. to hopefully avoid these kinds of issues."
,FalconGrey,2011-10-31T22:50Z,"A third update is out as of 3:30EST. It fixes more of the addressed issues and crashes and adds more content and tool tips.

Plays better with it and Paradox/Kerberos will always work hard to make things right.

Remember, if you like this game to buy it. The Kerberos team (Roughly 5 people with the vacancies) is well worth it and will add more things (many free) and support the game for years to come."
,bigmega1uk,2011-11-02T18:18Z,"work around for unpack errors that worked for me

use winrar/7zip 
create folder for unpack (mine was s.o.t.s.2 unpack update 1)
unpack file 1-40 only into created folder
then unpack sotsu1 into same folder
install file

hope this helps"
,Wislas69,2011-12-11T22:46Z,"i installed the game on windows 7 x64 and i am getting this error at the log file...i am thinking its got to do something with the steam update...anyway i can fix this?
