1.update directx
2.update netframe.
3.right click FM.exe -> Compatibility Mode -> tick Run this program in Win XP mode
4. right click FM.exe -> tick Run this program as administrator

Nothing worked. Also saw someone say to make an FM.exe shortcut and then right click the shortcut on desktop and set the window mode to maximize.

Fucking Vista. 

IF someone gets a fix please let me know. Cheers"

1. Delete file named ''special folders.xml'' from the editor folder, and voila, it works!

Yes, it has the editor, but you have to apply the quickfix as instructed above.

@Costas

Which OS are you running? I don't know how to help you, but here's the steps again in a little more detail:

1) Mount the image
2) Install to your preferred directory
3) Locate SKIDROW folder from the disc -> open the folder -> ctr+a to select all -> copy
4) Locate your FM2012 install directory -> paste and REPLACE
5) Do not start from desktop shortcut (unless you've made one from the crack/modified .exe file), but from the gamefolder.

- Exe file should be 74,3 Mt in size now"

2. Unistall Football Manager 2012 Demo if you have it again you don't need it and may be the cause of some of the issues?

3. Delete anything off your HD relating to 1 or 2 you won't need any of it unless you use Steam for anything else. Now install FM 2012 via Daemon tools or similar.

4. Copy the FM.exe from the skidrow folder and paste it into the SEGA>Football Manager 2012 folder.

Should work now did for me I've had the game on holiday mode to check if it crashes or not and passed the first few months fine.

For the editor deleting the .xml file and then loading the database (which I think some are forgetting to do) seemed to work for me the first time but then I started getting font errors and had to delete the cache which I learned to do here:

1) sasnet stop spamming the pages with your shite site. We've already got enough verified cracks here on TPB

2) There is no point in playing the game until a crack for 12.0.3 comes out. There is a goalkeeping bug which doesn't allow you or AI's to train the keepers positioning stat and your goalies end up being shite in a season with no way to fix it.

,tmooney2005,2011-11-01T19:53Z,"Step 1

go to editor filepath, for example:
C:\Program Files (x86)\SEGA\Football Manager 2012\Editor
You will find a file called special folders.xml (donâ€™t open it)
Open your usual text editor (NOTEPAD) as AN ADMINISTRATOR
then, go to FILE > OPEN and select special folders.xml
Click OPEN

then you should replace all â€œ../football manager 2012  with your actual filepath
For example, if you have installed your game under C:\Program Files (x86)\SEGA\Football Manager 2012, this is what your sile should look like:

Then save your file, 

Step 2


Delete your cache and reload the editor.

How do I delete my Cache files?

First of all you need to turn on hidden files and folders.

Windows XP:
My Computer
â€˜Toolsâ€™
â€˜Folder Optionsâ€™.
The go to the â€˜Viewâ€™ tab and select â€˜Show hidden files and foldersâ€™

Windows Vista and Windows 7:
My Computer
â€˜Organizeâ€™
â€˜Folder and Search Optionsâ€™.
The go to the â€˜Viewâ€™ tab and select â€˜Show hidden files and foldersâ€™

Once this is done, follow the instructions below:

Windows XP:
1. Open â€œMy Computerâ€
2. Navigate to : â€œDocuments and Settings\\Application Data\
3. Go into the â€œSports Interactiveâ€ Folder.
4. Go to the â€œEditor 2012â€ Folder.
5. Delete the â€˜cacheâ€™ Folder found inside here.

Windows Vista and Windows 7:
1. Click â€œStartâ€
2. Click your username on the start Menu
3. Click on â€œAppDataâ€ and then â€œRoamingâ€
4. Go into the â€œSports Interactiveâ€ Folder
5. Go to the â€œEditor 2012â€ Folder.
6. Go to cache Folder.
7. Go to english folder and delete fm2012.skc

now when you run editor it should work just fine but you will need to delete this file everytime you start the editor."

1. Mount .iso and install
2. copy ONLY fm.exe from skidrow folder
3. then i downloaded the 12.0.3 version also from skidrow (about 68 Mb) and unpacked it
4. then just copy that patch crack (68 Mb file not 73)
5. Run the game

It worked for me, and i DON'T have Steam, and I just installed directX, and Framework I couldn't install 'cause I have different version etc...

,TOMSK65,2011-11-03T12:44Z,"Just in case any of you guy's missed it this is how I got the program to work without no hassle.

1. Mount img onto a virtual drive using UltraISO or deamon tools etc...

2. Install game and Direct X, NET Framework if needed from the img file.

2. Install 12.0.3 update

3. Now just replace the game fm.exe file with the crack from the SKIDROW folder on the img file and nothing else. Don't overwrite the steam_api.dll or the Steamclient.dll

Important
***Do not use the fm.exe supplied by the update***

***When replacing the fm.exe make sure to get rid of the original file don't keep both.***

The game runs with no bugs or dump reps, didn't have to worry about Steam, been playing now for hours, not running it in administration mode, don't even have to mount the img file to a virtual drive to play.

I followed your instructions but still no joy.

Im running Vista and I cant get FM to work, it could be cause I still have Steam installed, however I would like to keep it.

If anyone has a solution to the FM - Vista problem It would be much appreciated,

,kavel,2011-11-04T16:48Z,"Hi guys,

I've got some problems running the game :(

I've been doing exactly as requested, here is what I've done so far :

1. Installed the game with Daemon Tool (no problem for that)
2. Copied ONLY the fm.exe which was in the SKIDROW file

When I then start the game, Steam is loging in, and the official FM2012 page appears, telling me to buy the game.


I don't know why it happens, as I've followed each and every step...

So then I tried to install the 12.03 update (I used the method described by TOMSK65 in page 14 of the comments here) : 

1. Installed game and Direct X
2. Installed 12.0.3 update
3. Replaced the game fm.exe file with the crack from the SKIDROW folder on the img file and nothing else. Don't overwrite the steam_api.dll

Again, I successfully completed every step, but again STEAM is oppening when I try to run the game...

Could someone help me to solve this by explaining all the steps to avoid it ?

Thanks all,"

MOUNT .ISO (Daemon/PowerISO..etc)
INSTALL
COPY FM.exe FROM THE ""SKIDROW"" FILE
PASTE&REPLACE THAT INTO C:/programfiles/sega/fm12 or whatever your destination file was.
OPEN the game from the destination file or create a shortcut to the .exe in the destination file.

I use VISTA on Acer PC.

1. Relax, it will work :)
2. ERASE every presence of previous Football Manager, Sega or Steam. Uninstall Steam. Delete Sports Interactive folder in your Documents. Delete Sega and Sports Interactive folders in ''Program Files''. Once you're TOTALLY free of these, step 3.
3. Mount the ISO image of FM 2012 and INSTALL the game.
4. Once the installation is done, COPY ONLY THE FILE ''fm.exe'' from SKIDROW folder. Don't take the other files. Juste ''fm.exe''.
5. PASTE this file in the ''C://Computer/Porgram files/Sega/Football Manager 2012.
6. Choose to REPLACE the file ''fm.exe''.
7. Launch the game by clicking the new ''fm.exe'' icon, and it HAS WORKED FOR ME !

Enjoy :D"

Please try steps below to fix your issue:

Step 1

Delete your cache and reload the editor.

How do I delete my Cache files?

First of all you need to turn on hidden files and folders.

Windows XP:
My Computer
â€˜Toolsâ€™
â€˜Folder Optionsâ€™.
The go to the â€˜Viewâ€™ tab and select â€˜Show hidden files and foldersâ€™

Windows Vista and Windows 7:
My Computer
â€˜Organizeâ€™
â€˜Folder and Search Optionsâ€™.
The go to the â€˜Viewâ€™ tab and select â€˜Show hidden files and foldersâ€™

Once this is done, follow the instructions below:

Windows XP:
1. Open â€œMy Computerâ€
2. Navigate to : â€œDocuments and Settings\\Application Data\
3. Go into the â€œSports Interactiveâ€ Folder.
4. Go to the â€œEditor 2012â€ Folder.
5. Delete the â€˜cacheâ€™ Folder found inside here.

Windows Vista and Windows 7:
1. Click â€œStartâ€
2. Click your username on the start Menu
3. Click on â€œAppDataâ€ and then â€œRoamingâ€
4. Go into the â€œSports Interactiveâ€ Folder
5. Go to the â€œEditor 2012â€ Folder.
6. Delete the â€˜cacheâ€™ Folder found inside here."

""Error: Unable to find some essential data. Please ensure that the game is installed correctly. If the problem persists, please contact technical support.""

ps. Game works perfect


Try this!

Replace the Editor/special folder.xml with this one: 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------









































----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


then you need to delete the cache.

here's the trick:

1. First, you need to unhide all hidden folders and files.
2. Then go to start -> your user name
3. there's a hidden folder call ""AppData""
4. Click it -> Roaming -> Sports Interactive ->Editor 2012 ->DELETE the Cache folder
5. Launch Editor again, and it works!

IF, same problem occurs after you shut down your PC, repeat the same steps, and you can edit data anytime you want.

Now for the people who cant start the editor. (idk why, some people have commented how to do it but i am going try my best)

Delete your cache file of the editor. To find the file:  
1. Click â€œStartâ€
2. Click your username on the start Menu
3. Click on â€œAppDataâ€ and then â€œRoamingâ€
4. Go into the â€œSports Interactiveâ€ Folder
5. Go to the â€œEditor 2012â€ Folder.
6. Delete the 'cache' Folder found inside here

Or, Copy â€œspecial folders.xmlâ€ to the location where you installed the game on your hard drive. For example, for me it was  C:/Program Files/SEGA/Football Manager 2012.

Or, Restart and Repeat any of the these steps.

Hope it Helps :)"

extract the files using winrar or zip7,both can be downloaded for free,extract them to desktop,once extracted you'll find the iso image,mount this using magicdisk or other software,easily found online! when mounted install,after installation open fm 2012 Crack(you need this) copy & paste the fm.exe. from the Crack into computer/local disk C /programs/SEGA/football manager 2012/

you dont need the other files in the crack,JUST THE EXE. FILE!!

*******   DLL ERROR SOLVED HERE   *******


Hello Guys

This torrent is working great but it took me arround 2 hours to fix it to make it work,
so here it is I hop it will save you time:

1. First the game is missing 3 dll so download them here:
d3dx9_41.dll -> http://www.opendll.com/index.php?file-download=d3dx9_41.dll&arch=32Bit&version=9.26.952.2844&dsc=Direct3D-9-Extensions
berkelium.dll -> http://www.opendll.com/index.php?file-download=berkelium.dll&arch=32Bit&version=&dsc=

2. Once you download them extract them in your c:windowssystem32 folder

3. Start the game.

After all that it should work fine."

1. I uninstalled the game completely and then reinstalled

2. I then ONLY copied the ""skidrow fm.exe file"" to the installed directory

C:Program FilesSEGAFootball Manager 2012


3. In the installed directory right click on fm.exe file and create a shortcut on your desktop

4. Load the game from the new shortcut (delete the original shortcut from the installation)


Hope this helps

,vitor210,2012-04-29T13:43Z,"for everyone having trouble with running this game, you have to install the 2 programes that appear at the end of the installion (.Net framework and DirectX, i guess)even if you already have it installed on your computer, and only copy the Fm.exe on the Skidrow folder on the disc, not the steam_api.dll and Steamclient.dll"
,eltejon,2012-04-29T18:59Z,"can't believe it, just been to a friend's who dont know a thing about games and all, downloaded the torrent, installed the game, copied crack from skidrow (the f****** way i do home) and it just worked perfect. I'm sure I'm missing something stupid because i keep getting the stupid serious error crash dump shit."
,sami96,2012-05-03T19:19Z,"Okay, ive found a problem in tis game, and its quite a weird one. The monthly awards like Manager of the Month, Player of the Month, Goal etc dont work. Im playing in the Premier League and doesnt work for that or the lower English divisions.
