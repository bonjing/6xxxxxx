,stonedjedi,2011-10-29T23:19Z,@MODERNdayHIPPIE what's the difference between an ITunes Edition & an ITunes Rip Discography just wondering??
,stonedjedi,2011-10-29T23:32Z,"Thanks alot for the discography, Amazing work ;)
Just wondering what new discographies your compiling at the moment. I always look forward to your discographies. Any word on an Ice Cube one?"
,Rio_almusbahi,2011-10-30T00:22Z,"@stonedjedi 

itunes edition is M4a format and iTunes rip is mp3 format ... but with m4a theres explicit and clean tags on iTunes ... iTunes rip just the information is totally right with no tags "

The Beatles (iTunes Rip)
Pink Floyd (iTunes Rip)

^^both remastered


90% finished compiling Snoop Dogg

About for Ice Cube discography, still checking in iTunes.
Might put it one massive collection along with former N.W.A artist such as Dr. Dre and Eazy-E - iTunes Rip"
,stonedjedi,2011-10-30T01:25Z,"@Rio_almusbahi Thanks for clearing that up dude

@theLEAK Sounds great! cant wait you my friend are amazing. As for the Ice Cube discography that would be fantastic if you made a massive collection like that. ;)
