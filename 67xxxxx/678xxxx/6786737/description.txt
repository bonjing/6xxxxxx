A classic anime based on \"The Hakkenden\" and set in the future.  I was introduced to this Anime on an Australian TV channel called AXN. It is my absolute favorite anime, and I was saddened to learn that it is almost unheard of in the U.S.  Upon urging from friends curious about it, I created this torrent for more people to know about it.

So here it goes.  This is in Japanese with English subtitles, it is actually a direct rip from TV, so it is not a fansub.
