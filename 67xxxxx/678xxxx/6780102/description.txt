From the director of 'School Of Rock' and 'Dazed and Confused' comes this summerâ€™s smash comedy hit.Classic Rock meets the new school. Beloved tunes from Alice Cooper and Ted Nugent sit alongside new tracks from Senses Fail and Phantom Planet.Baseball has rules. Meet the exceptions. Grizzled former professional baseball player Morris Buttermaker (Billy Bob Thornton) is recruited by a strait-laced lawyer (Marcia Gay Harden) to coach the Bears, a woefully inept Little League team. He's got to find a way to drive this gang of 12 misfits to a championship against their hated rivals: the Yankees and their overbearing coach (Greg Kinnear). From the director that brought you 'School of Rock' comes a hilarious 2005 homage to an irreverent 1976 comedy: 'Bad News Bears.'Soundtrack Album Producers: Richard Linklater and Randall Poster Executive Album Producer: Ralph Sall for Bulletproof Recording Company.
