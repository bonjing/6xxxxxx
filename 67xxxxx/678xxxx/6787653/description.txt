  That Girl in Yellow Boots is a thriller      
  tracing Ruth's (Kalki Koechlin) search for   
  her father - a man she hardly knew but       
  cannot forget. Desperation drives her to     
  work without a permit, at a massage parlour. 
  Torn between several schisms, Mumbai becomes 
  the alien but yet strangely familiar         
  backdrop for Ruth's quest. She struggles to  
  find her independence and space even as she  
  is sucked deeper into the labyrinthine       
  politics of the city's underbelly. A city    
  that feeds on her misery, a love that eludes 
  her and above all, a devastating truth that  
  she must encounter. And everyone wants a     
  piece of her.
