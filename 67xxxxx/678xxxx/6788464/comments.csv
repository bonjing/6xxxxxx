Soldiers are the decisive edge. We provide them with leading-edge technologies and advanced capabilities to dominate in our current operations across the battlespace while simultaneously preparing to respond decisively to future threats.
This annual publication describes how we are accomplishing our mission and highlights our major acquisition programs. You will learn what each program is designed to achieve for our Soldiers and the programâ€™s status. Furthermore, you will learn about the contractors involved, teaming arrangements, and critical interdependencies with other programs and fielded systems. In addition, this handbook augments several key publications that characterize the strategic context for our work, including the 2010 Army Posture Statement, the 2010 Army Modernization Strategy, and our Science and Technology Master Plan.
Our comprehensive modernization program reflects an overarching vision to meet the equipping demands of our Soldiers by developing and fielding an affordable and interoperable mix of the best equipment available for success in both todayâ€™s and tomorrowâ€™s full spectrum military operations. It encompasses strategic relevance, complexity, innovation, and interconnectedness of the products and systems that we are delivering to our men and women in uniform. We are also working to institutionalize wartime innovations to better enable success in todayâ€™s wars while ensuring that our forces are prepared for a complex future.
Americaâ€™s Soldiers are our most precious resource. They are at the center of all that we accomplish and the focus of all our plans. We are dedicated to meeting their needs around the clock and around the world. As you reference this publication and learn more about the Acquisition, Logistics and Technology community and our major acquisition programs, you will understand that our top priority is to ensure Americaâ€™s Soldiers are the decisive edge. We will never let them down.
Malcolm R. Oâ€™Neill, Assistant Secretary of the Army."
