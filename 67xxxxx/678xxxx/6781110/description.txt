    The Universe provides succour to everyone  
    born under its nourishing space. An        
    apparently less privileged person will     
    still find room to adjust his needs        
    according to available resources. At the   
    same time, the Universe responds to the    
    needs of the individual if only he/she     
    can show a genuine expression of his/her   
    needs and works towards making it a        
    reality. Whether she understood this law   
    of the Universe or not, little Tanya       
    brought up in the secure and contented     
    environment of a loving family decides     
    to chart an unpredictable course all       
    with the intention of location her         
    biological parents.
