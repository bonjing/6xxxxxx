,doglogny,2012-03-22T19:46Z,Patch worked great!!...The only thing is...theres no update. Is there anyway of being able to update the software after the patch was installed?
,Doc_Wilson,2012-03-23T20:57Z,"This Activator hasn't worked for me yet. When applied as instructed (even using nxs5aj method) this activator only puts the 12553 days of activation into my bitdefender software with a different serial number. The activator does create an account with bitdefender but with the original S/N that nxs5aj gave and shows only 30 days of activation and No ability to update virus descriptions with your program. 
I will try the different address that elenabaju gave and report back."
,doglogny,2012-03-27T04:34Z,"Thanks for the other option for updating, but my computer crashes everytime I restart bitdefender as it asks. I'm not sure if anyone else has run into these probs. I don't think I'm doing anything wrong. I change the update location to the other loction. Then when its done I change it back to the default. Let me know if theres anything else that I should be doing"
,pimpdaddykain,2012-04-07T15:54Z,for me doesn't work. After i select the language a white window shows up and nothing happens. help me please
