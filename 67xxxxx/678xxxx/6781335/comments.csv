,Chiitah,2011-11-05T20:14Z,"It wouldn't be that bad if it wasn't for the fact that the person recording left the camera on auto-focus so every time the lighting changes on screen the camera gets all confused and tries to focus again repeatedly.  The sad thing is that happens constantly all the time with cams but it's especially bad for this movie.  There are so many little things that are really funny, gags and such that are super short in this movie and you miss them in this version because it's out of focus so often.  It's not worth watching this version unless you absolutely can't wait.  You get the general gist of the movie but miss tons of the humor.  I appreciate that it exists but the video is about 3 with the sound being pretty high quality at around 8."
