,GurraGrahn,2011-11-01T10:32Z,"Hey! Im getting this when I try to start the game: d3dx9_41.dll could not be found

What is this and what can I do?"
,poi2311,2011-11-01T11:07Z,GurraGrahn install directx
,poi2311,2011-11-01T11:08Z,GurraGrahn download directx
,GurraGrahn,2011-11-01T11:16Z,"poi2311/

Ok, I'll try that. I just reinstalled my computer, maybe thats why directx i lost :)

Btw, I extracted the d3dx9_41.dll file from the directx folder into the game installation folder. Is that the right way, or should I just download directx and extract and replace every file in the directx folder?"
,przelot,2011-11-01T11:17Z,In SKIDROW we trust.
,GurraGrahn,2011-11-01T13:00Z,"Ok, downloaded and installed directx, then i reinstalled the game. when i launched it everything went fine until i got to the frontscreen in the game. Thats where it crashed. When I copyed the files in the skidrow folderand put it in the game installation folder i replaced the old files. Now I cant even open the game. It says: Football Manager 2012 has stopped working.

What can I do?"
