,pompeypaul35,2011-10-30T02:02Z,"Hi this is the real deal. Video and Audio 9 or 10 /10 and it is complete with no glitches?
Thanks to the uploader.
As for the movie? Google reviews or judge for yourself. "
,Candyman_1,2011-10-30T14:57Z,v9 a9 good job subha
,yoma819,2011-10-30T16:02Z,Anyone know where to get the uncensored version?
,invioletlight,2011-10-30T17:17Z,"Although a small part of me wants to see this, I will resist downloading it. I've heard about some of the scenes in this movie.....I watched the first one but I don't think I can manage this one."
,i_steal_media_hohoho,2011-10-30T20:22Z,"OH YES!!!!!!! BEEN WAITING FOREVER FOR THIS. SO GRATEFUL, THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!"
,nlpaju10611,2011-10-30T21:20Z,ive seen the uncut verison of this movie in theaters in my state and this one is no difffernet. i didnt notice any changes made and everything that was said to be cut out of the UK verison is in this one.
,i_steal_media_hohoho,2011-10-30T23:46Z,From what I can see so far: A10 V10. 
,i_steal_media_hohoho,2011-10-31T02:30Z,Very over rated. It's actually laughable how over rated. Total anti climax. 
,datwerd,2011-10-31T04:15Z,"is it supposed to be in black and white?
to be honest im glad it came out in black and white on vlc for me as it was the most disturbing thing ive ever seen"
,Ssschhhh,2011-10-31T07:34Z,"nlpaju10611: Then you saw the censored version, because this is missing several things such as the barbwire rape and the face cutting, and more."
,Frankie76xxx,2011-10-31T14:46Z,Ive seen the uncut The.Human.Centipede.II.Full.Sequence and this is the cut version but its still watchable
,pawkah,2011-10-31T18:58Z,wohoo thanks been waiting for this!   
,SeederFTW,2011-10-31T20:50Z,Works fine for me. Great upload. Thanks 
,ashen77,2011-11-01T12:48Z,"Cant really understand why they'd censor it. its only a fucking movie. Any one whos gonna be ""disturbed"" by watching a fiction is a complete wimp and shouldnt be watching horrors. Grrr, fucking conservative pussies ruin every thing."
,razornguido,2011-11-01T16:41Z,"Good quality film top job

shame its so fucking sick! i think this is one not to watch with the gf lol"
,coyotedogg,2011-11-01T17:16Z,"@ i_steal_media_hohoho

You are totally wrong and full of shit.
This movie is exactly what it is suppose to be. Watch it with a group of people and it is sick, demented, and even funny at times...i think i_steal_media thought this was oscar material, sorry to be a spoiler, but it is not.
From what I have seen from all of your posts on this movie, it could never reach your expectations...like another post said about you...you need to calm the fuck down mate...Your obsession with this movie let's me know that there is someone even more obsessed and screwed up with this movie than Martin is in part 2...you should start working on part 3 ASAP...Martin has nothing on you!"
,coyotedogg,2011-11-01T17:26Z,"@ i_steal_media_hohoho again...

you say it is actually laughable how over rated this movie is?

Where were you expecting it to go to after the first movie?

It is amazing they were able to pull a part two out of this concept, but they did it as well as they could in my opinion.

I thought the first movie was laughable throughout...after all they are sewing asses to mouths. What other directions could they have gone for part 2?"
,ashen77,2011-11-01T19:53Z,^^ some ones not been taking his meds again!
,theboomdaddy,2011-11-01T21:44Z,"No one else experience no audio, aside from minor bursts of sound that fade out...."
,GreeceSux,2011-11-01T22:34Z,"THIS IS THE CUT VERSION!!!

Thanks for this upload, but it's not the REAL movie: the most horrific scenes have been removed. You should have labelled it properly and put CUT VERSION in the title or something. Now everybody who watches this will think they have seen the real movie while they haven't.

I recommend waiting for the REAL version guys!"
,coyotedogg,2011-11-02T16:08Z,"@ theboomdaddy

I had issues with audio using BS Player for some reason...i had audio, but it seemed like it was fast and missing words, out odf sync...worked fine with VLC though."
,so0os,2011-11-02T18:32Z,"It's like 2 and a half munte was cut, no?"
,Pdid,2011-11-03T08:11Z,I think it is supposed to end up as a trilogy...
,brash1,2011-11-04T00:45Z,"This is not the fully cut UK version, but it isn't the fully uncut version either. 

Missing are the 'in colour' final scene, the 'barb wire rape' scene and the choking on vomit/shit death' scene. "
,tvwatcher7698,2011-11-04T05:22Z,omg i love u i have waited for this forever!!! Im so gratefull haha might sound messed up but i wanna see this cuz i heard sick nasty things about it
,XaltedSmoke,2011-11-14T03:54Z,"Cut or not this movie is a pile of shit.
If you enjoyed the first movie, this one is a far cry from it.
Shame..."
,Vorzakone,2011-11-21T20:46Z,"Sound does not work? I'm using VLC.
other than that vid quality is a 10"
,rach1234567,2011-11-24T23:56Z,anyone know where i can get the uncut version? ive searched everywhere :(?
,DU33ED75,2011-12-18T15:06Z,"Bountyfilms.com
only place i can see the uncut version ..fek buying it tho  lol"
,Animeman1000,2012-01-01T11:25Z,"Some info. This was shot entirely in Color and then converted to Black and White. There is NO Audio except for a couple of screams, moans, and possibly laughter. Oh and Tom Six is already working on a Third one. Quote: ""The third film will make the last one look like a Disney film. We're going to shoot the third film entirely in America, and it's going to be my favourite... It's going to upset a lot of people."" So expect The Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence)."
,sarapnina,2012-01-16T02:53Z,Here is the uncut version: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6920037/The_Human_Centipede_II_(Full_Sequence)_2011_[UNCUT_VERSION]_720p
