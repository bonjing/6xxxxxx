[V],globeplus,2011-10-30T20:15Z,"To noalcoholjuzsoda : i think it will be probably the first time that you download one of my RMVB files and i can tell you they means lot of work , getting the movie , making  necessary conversions and finally preparing the picture removing black borders in full screen and improving colours but you know what ? it is worthy all the work because i get the conscience that the best work possible to do with the present cam file was done and that it is great , it is like you get the most quality that the original cam can give under the circunstances and you are making the best possible use of him , simply wonderfull ... and the RMVB video is probably the best video type for lower bitrate video because can keep great definition of the screen for this kind of bitrate , others nice video types like flv have a tendence to pixelization at full screen and the avis or mp4 get a little unfocus way on the picture in full screen leaving many times particles on the picture background and that it is a little borring to the viewer , this RMVB files are really great work for wherever you look and i have many years uploading files and my only way presenting files is to make the best possible with great work and my intention is to keep like that when it is possible , if you liked the shrek movies you simply canÂ´t miss this one ... and of course beware of this cat because he is great with his sword but i am shore that you already know that ... well see you and all of you and please download more RMVB from me because i am choosing the best new nice movies to do all the work and upload ... cheers ."

,ohrightpl8s,2011-10-31T07:46Z,Why bother uploading when the quality is this bad. I don't see how people can watch a movie is this format =P

[V],globeplus,2011-10-31T09:46Z,"This is at the description of this file and i already upload many RMVB files and finally this video type have many files to download around the net for new nice movies :

* RECOMMENDED PLAYERS :

- RMVB PLAYER or - MEDIACOPE 

or convert to your prefered video type for any other player

NOTES :

- the suggested players runs perfectly this type of video with a bug that i liked to see removed saying ""problem playing the file"" at the start of the video but beside that the video runs fine no doubt , for this type of video other more common plaers can get a lag between the audio and the picture like vlc or no audio with picture ok like mpc and so on , so beside the little annoying bug the refered players are ok and are a few very nice converters that make perfect conversions to avi or mp4 or wherever easily with the presented video file , it is just a matter to grab video converters on piratebay and wait some time for the necessary conversion but no big deal then any player will play the video and it was only the file size to download what it is positive wherever you look on the downloader perspective because this tpe of video keeps great definition of the picture for lower bitrate and this particular aspect can be improved with a normal nice converter with a conversion for any other more usual video type like i said before , so this file is ok with many options to the user ...

To saequa253 : i think you are viciated in downloading lot of crap video files for new nice movies in the torrents with bullshit codecs and things like that and please donÂ´t come again at my comments talking like that because in all this uploading years i keeped a correct respect for the uploaded files giving my best at the necessary work before the upload and never cross my mind for a single time upload bullshit codecs files to put the possible users paying in not too trustfull movies services , it is completly against my principles , when i make a download of wherever i like to feel the best possible correct work from the uploader sharing with nice spirit the presented file and it is this nice sharing spirit that makes the torrent sites better or not , without beeing a critic or beeing a kiss ass if the users permit the expression , piratebay after knowing the files are fake they are removed immediatly with possible banned consequences many times to the uploaders of that type of files , unfornatly in many other torrent files that donÂ´t happen and too many bullshit files are mixed with the good ones , i can comment excusing me for not making any particular reference to the name of the site , that are nice torrent sites with 50 or more fake movie files for new nice movies and if a politic of banning the infractors was applied probably this statistic get a normal tendence to reduce but each site have is own way to work and what it is really important is the file saring spirit but some guys abuse from a total freedom sharing spirit putting available constantly crap files to foul the possible users and that it is what more negative the users can find on the torrent sites ... i repeat never talk like that again in one of my files specially because it is a real lie saying that it is rar files and any user can click at the files and see that beside a ico and a jpg poster of the movie only the RMVB file is in there , so you are not saying the truth clearly and that it is not a recommendable spirit to use at the comments of any respectfull file , NEVER repeat that again at my files or next time my attitude it will be worst and you have to respect nice sharing work for your profit inclusive too , if you donÂ´t respect nice files what you can respect i ask ?!!! 

Ok , see all of you and this is a new nice animation movie with the best work possible under the circunstances that was possible to do with the original downloaded cam and i respect the users and my work and my intention is to keep like that ,,, thank you and happy movie to all of you .
