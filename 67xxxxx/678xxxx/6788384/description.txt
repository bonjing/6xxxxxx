  Description

Plot: When the commander of a B-17 Flying Fortress bomber is killed in action, his replacement, a young, naive pilot struggles to be accepted by the planeâ€™s already tight-knit crew. Ordered into a suicide mission, their only chance for survival is to band together as brothers in battle. With unparalleled aerial action, Fortress pays homage to the sacrifices of an entire generation during the most important war in history.
