,CainRiZZo,2011-10-30T19:17Z,"No new Haley yet,but I'm looking into some other good stuff to post."

,Vexion,2011-11-04T04:42Z,"I'm also waiting for the new Haley-update from you Master CainRiZZo ;) She's my all time fave! But in the meantime, thanks for everything else :D"
,mick_leeds2003,2012-01-08T16:30Z,"Thanks CainRiZZo, but could I ask that you split the pictures into one file, and the video into another?

I like the pics, but not the videos, and splitting them into two files would allow those of us who only want the pics (or the video) to just download those.  Thanks."
,kaizoku2,2012-01-30T05:09Z,"Yeah, I also like pictures too. It would be grat if you put separate files for each. Thanks for uploading"
