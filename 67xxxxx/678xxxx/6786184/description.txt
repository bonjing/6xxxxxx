                      The Complete Season 2 of Strike Back


Strike Back: Project Dawn, as it is known in the United Kingdom (or just Strike Back in the United States) is a ten-part British-American action serial television series, and is the second series of Strike Back.

The series follows Section 20, a secret branch of the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), which is trying to stop Latif, a Pakistani terrorist, who is plotting "Project Dawn". John Porter (Richard Armitage), the main character of the first series, is captured by Latif's men while trying to figure out Latif's plan. Section 20 sends Michael Stonebridge (Philip Winchester) and Damian Scott (Sullivan Stapleton) to find and rescue Porter and uncover Latif's plans. Their first lead sends the team to a hotel in India, which is later seized by terrorists. Winchester added "[Section 20] are trying to figure out whether or not he has his hands on WMDs or he knows where they are or whether it is a ploy to try and distract everyone from something else he is doing." The search for Latif also leads Section 20 to other worldwide locations, including Cape Town, Sudan, Kosovo and Vienna.
