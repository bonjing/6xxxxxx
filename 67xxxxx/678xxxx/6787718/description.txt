[b]# Integrated Tweaks:[/b]

[b]* Disable CEIP (Customer Experience Improvement Program):[/b]

[i]The Windows Customer Experience Improvement Program in Windows 7 is a completely voluntary program designed to help Microsoft improve its operating systems over time. This program collects information about computer hardware and how people use Windows 7.[/i]

[b]* Speed up Windows Thumb Time-Delay:[/b]

[i]Windows 7 has provided a cool feature with ability to preview taskbar thumbnails whenever the mouse is hovered on the program icon. However, you may notice that it does have some latency to display the preview after mouse over the icon, Thumb Time-Delay has been improved to avoid this problem.[/i]

[b]* NTFS; Disable 8.3 Names and Last Access:[/b]

[i]NTFS Files systems create file names in 8.3 format. Disabling this option reduces the overhead during the creation of new files or directories.[/i]

[b]* Improve DNS Caching:[/b]

[i]By default Windows also caches erroneous data and this can take space of valid cache items and thus slow down your Internet access. This will tell windows not to cache erroneous DNS data at all.[/i]

[b]* SpeedUp Access to AVI Files:[/b]

[i]Speeds up the access of AVI folders as well as makes the renaming and deletion of AVIs easier.[/i]

[b]* Enable Boot Optimization:[/b]

[i]The Boot Optimization function will automatically defragment boot files and rearrange them so that all boot files are in close proximity to one another.[/i]

[b]* Allocate more Critical Threads to Increase Performance:[/b]

[i]This Option lets Windows create more critical threads for when your system load is high in order to improve your systems performance.[/i]

[b]* Unload DLLS from Memory after Use:[/b]

[i]Remove DLLs from memory after use to free up more resources.[/i]

[b]* Disable Network Redirector File Caching for Workstation Service:[/b]

[i]On network computers, when data is written to a file, it is written to the cache and not immediately flushed to the redirector.[/i]

[b]* Improve Core System Performance:[/b]

[i]This option lets drivers and system code move to disk whenever required as sometimes more physical RAM is requiered to run an application[/i]

[b]* Increase NTFS Performance:[/b]

[i]The time stamp for the last accessed files and folders are updated by Windows and this update may take time.[/i]

[b]* Enable Self-Healing Capability of NTFS File System:[/b]

[i]In earlier version of Windows, NTFS marks the volume "dirty" upon detecting file-system corruption and CHKDSK is required to be run by taking the volume "offline".

With self-healing NTFS is the new feature of Windows Vista and Windows 7, in which an NTFS worker thread is spawned in the background which performs a localized fix-up of damaged data structures, with only the corrupted files/folders remaining unavailable without locking out the entire volume. [/i]

[b]* Stop Automatic Rebooting of your System after Windows Update:[/b]

[i]Stops automatic rebooting of the system after automatic udpates.[/i]

[b]* Disable User Tracking:[/b]

[i]Prevents the system from tracking the programs users run, the paths they navigate, and the documents they open. Although somewhat helpful, this tracking is a pontetial privacy threat.[/i]

[b]* Show Extensions for Known File Types:[/b]

[i]Enable to display file extensions (e.g. DOC, XLS, EXE) as part of file names. This can help you tell disguised malicious software from normal files. It also increases the performance of Vista folders.[/i]

[b]* Show Hidden Files and Folders:[/B]

[i]This is rarely required for novice users, but is very useful for experienced users as it gives them better control over their computer.[/i]

[b]* Always Show Menus:[/b]

[i]By default Windows Explorer does not display the menu bar.[/i]

[b]* Use Checkboxes to Select Items:[/b]

[I]Adds Checkboxes to file views to make it easier to select several files at once, wich can be useful if it is difficult for you to hold the CTRL key while clicking to select multiple files.[/I]

[b]* UAC disabled... make things work correctly with UAC off...[/b]

[i]User Access Control (UAC) can be a very annoying feature. Allow operations without administrator consent (similar to Windows XP).[/i]
