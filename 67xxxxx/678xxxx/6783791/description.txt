Now in its second edition, this popular beginners course has been completely rewritten to make learning Japanese as easy as possible. Lively dialogues cover business situations as well as social and everyday language and the text includes helpful cultural notes.
Japanese script (kanji, katakana and hiragana) is gradually introduced, with romanization throughout for those wishing to concentrate on the spoken language. Other features include:

    * exercises with answer key
    * extensive vocabulary lists in Japanese script and romanization
    * index of kanji (with on and kun readings).
