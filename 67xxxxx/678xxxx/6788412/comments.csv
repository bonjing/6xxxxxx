Utter rubbish.

As for the SKIDROW will fix this, what?

They don't fix things, SI do.

The update is fine. The update+crack is fine.

Works fine for me.

Thanks again.

SI fan boys - *ss off.

Staff screen doesn't freeze at all (Double checks)....No crash or freeze."
,ba4336,2011-11-02T00:24Z,"@dib why are you such an ungrateful tool, if you don't like what people give up their free time to create do it your self you tard"
,meeyou,2011-11-02T00:31Z,it does crash everytime u want to view staff profile
,a1098,2011-11-02T00:54Z,"Constant_Ramble, don't know how you got it to work, but it doesnt work for anybody else. 

For those of you who haven't realized the problem yet, install this update, run the game, and go to the staff screen and click on a staff member. 

The game freezes and automatically turns off."
,DraganLG,2011-11-02T00:59Z,I got the crash when click on coach or scout to.But better this then nothing.Good work SKIDROW
,tmooney2005,2011-11-02T01:25Z,"Step 1

go to editor filepath, for example:
C:\Program Files (x86)\SEGA\Football Manager 2012\Editor
You will find a file called special folders.xml (donâ€™t open it)
Open your usual text editor (NOTEPAD) as AN ADMINISTRATOR
then, go to FILE > OPEN and select special folders.xml
Click OPEN

then you should replace all â€œ../football manager 2012  with your actual filepath
For example, if you have installed your game under C:\Program Files (x86)\SEGA\Football Manager 2012, this is what your sile should look like:

Then save your file, 

Step 2


Delete your cache and reload the editor.

How do I delete my Cache files?

First of all you need to turn on hidden files and folders.

Windows XP:
My Computer
â€˜Toolsâ€™
â€˜Folder Optionsâ€™.
The go to the â€˜Viewâ€™ tab and select â€˜Show hidden files and foldersâ€™

Windows Vista and Windows 7:
My Computer
â€˜Organizeâ€™
â€˜Folder and Search Optionsâ€™.
The go to the â€˜Viewâ€™ tab and select â€˜Show hidden files and foldersâ€™

Once this is done, follow the instructions below:

Windows XP:
1. Open â€œMy Computerâ€
2. Navigate to : â€œDocuments and Settings\\Application Data\
3. Go into the â€œSports Interactiveâ€ Folder.
4. Go to the â€œEditor 2012â€ Folder.
5. Delete the â€˜cacheâ€™ Folder found inside here.

Windows Vista and Windows 7:
1. Click â€œStartâ€
2. Click your username on the start Menu
3. Click on â€œAppDataâ€ and then â€œRoamingâ€
4. Go into the â€œSports Interactiveâ€ Folder
5. Go to the â€œEditor 2012â€ Folder.
6. Go to cache Folder.
7. Go to english folder and delete fm2012.skc

now when you run editor it should work just fine but you will need to delete this file everytime you start the editor."
,Marragun,2011-11-02T01:44Z,Does anyone know how to deal with these crash dumps connected with the staff? I hope that someone know how to solve the problem...
,zeliscar,2011-11-02T01:52Z,dont worry people this will be fixed soon..expect a fix tomorrow
,morgoth_69,2011-11-02T02:01Z,"Constant_Ramble

Go fuck your dog.........."
,DraganLG,2011-11-02T02:02Z,SKIDROW team said that they are aware about bug and they will try to fix it as soon as they can
,Constant_Ramble,2011-11-02T02:05Z,"I did just get a crash dump offering contracts to staff via the transfer centre?

Not sure if it's related, I had used FMRTE.

Not 100% what caused it but after offering 15 contracts I got to 16 and it crash dumped me, deleting settings/cache now hopefully it will be fine when I reload."
,jediknight2k1,2011-11-02T02:40Z,"Actually it does crash on Staff screen but only when you click on a staff members name.

So some nub cakes are wrong."
,nox150690,2011-11-02T03:07Z,"Guy just wanted to let you know that the crash is apparently caused by the .exe file. If you have the SKIDROW release (i assume you have) then simply take the .exe file from your DVD ISO and replace it with the .exe in the game folder.

It won't matter if you have already updated to 12.0.3 as the game will now boot with 12.0.2, allowing you to still play while waiting for the crack. Or, just don't install the update. "
,Krugasuarez,2011-11-02T03:29Z,"OK PROBLEM WHEN I DOUBLE CLICK ON THE GAME IT LOADS UP BUT WHEN IT GOES THROUGH THE WAR CHILD, LOGO AND THE ADVERT ABOUT THE AC MILAN STUFF IT JUST DISSAPEARS ANYONE KNOW WHAT IVE DONE WRONG ?? "

,gmoujik,2011-11-02T04:52Z,"@Krugasuarez, Did you replace fm.exe with the one in SKIDROW folder?"
,Krugasuarez,2011-11-02T04:55Z,"LOADING SCREEN DISSAPEAR FIX !!

Ok i was getting the loading screen dissapearing trick happening to me all the time so i unistalled then reinstalled everything so all of m stuff was saved in the (COMPUTER / ACER / PROGRAM FILES / SEGA / FOOTBALL MANAGER 2012)

THEN.....

I downloaded this crack ( http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6786217/Football_Manager_2012_Crack_only_SKIDROW_ )

I then ONLY Copied the (fm) file that was inside the crack only folder i copied it to my ( COMPUTER / ACER / PROGRAM FILES / SEGA / FOOTBALL MANAGER 2012 )... 

And a screen popped up saying there is already a file called "" FM "" do you want to delete or add both, I added both but the one i got from the crack folder was renamed "" FM (2) "" .. i then deleted the original fm.exe and the game now works  :D


HOPE THIS HELPS PEOPLE WITH THE DISSAPEARING SCREEN PROBLEM "
