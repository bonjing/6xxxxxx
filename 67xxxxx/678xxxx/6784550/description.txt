Originally titled "The Squatchiest Place on Earth" this special episode of Finding Bigfoot follows the B.F.R.O. team to Northern California where the infamous Patterson-Gimlin film was captured which really started the American Bigfoot buzz. Fans of this show will really enjoy this episode because 1) they're using trap cameras! 2) Ranae makes her very first a 'Squatch call! 3) Bobo continues his comedic remedies, and 4) their last night of investigation turns the very skeptical Ranae into a bit more of a believer.
