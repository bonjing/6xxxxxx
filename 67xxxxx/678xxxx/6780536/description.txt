[/b][/color] Pete Griffith is basically an average guy.
Apart from the lying, selfishness and being a bit of an arse.
He's slightly more than average in these departments... But what sets Pete apart is that every move he makes is subject to constant observation, analysis and comment by two TV sport pundits.
And they aren't slow to point out the errors of his ways...
