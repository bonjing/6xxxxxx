,quose,2011-11-01T10:30Z,"A: 5. Not awful, a little tinny; moments of noise washing over dialog (between 2-10 seconds long) occur ~10 times, but not plot-critical.

V: 5. Well-aligned, generally consistent; overcontrasted and blurry, typical of cams; colour reasonably accurate.

One scene (audio and video) skips, for (guess) 3-5 seconds. Seeded @ ~600kbps, YMMV.

Cheers."
