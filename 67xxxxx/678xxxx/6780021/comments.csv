,iceman053,2011-10-29T13:03Z,I am a novice when it comes to rar files. Do i need to unzip each file or just one? Thanks for any info you can give me!
,petjax,2011-10-29T13:24Z,"iceman just extract 1 file.

and great this show is back i love these{a little simple,but brave} roughnecks"
[V],psspss,2011-10-29T15:16Z,"the easiest way to
extract the video file
is use right click on any of
the rar files.. but generally
do the first one which is called .rar
others will be called .r00 to .r99 or
000 to 099

in the pop out find extract here
in context menu of right click
and its done wait for the uncompressor
to finish

i set the setting to dont delete partial files
handy if want to check
the first few rars or watch
the avi so far.. by default
if not got all rar files it deletes
the unzipped file done so far

if not installed winrar 3.8 or higher
you can google filehippo winrar

and it be the first download link
in the results"

,gimperman,2011-10-29T21:15Z,I find the free '7-Zip' does a great job of extracting any file format. Just sayin'...good luck!
