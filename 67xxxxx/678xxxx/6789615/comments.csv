,jmsloop,2011-11-03T12:46Z,Can someone tell me how to play these files. They come through as .rar files and all separate.  1st time this has happened in the year I have been using this site. 
,MrPuggy33,2011-11-04T01:12Z,The sample only played for me. I have never had a problem before either. I am not sure whether to download it and try it again or what.
,defiance_sg,2011-11-04T04:49Z,"I also would be very interested if someone could provide an explanation of why this episode has to be multiple .rar files instead of one .avi file. Call me crazy, but isn't one .avi easier to download and watch? Why make us jump through hoops? So we have to now download some program to combine these files before we can watch the episode? Ridiculous bullshit, seriously. I honestly would like to hear one good reason why this episode has to be split into 40-some pieces. Please."
,jmsloop,2011-11-04T11:56Z,"Maybe if we all give a negative rating he will decide to answer.  Not trying to be a bitch, just want to watch my favorite show and I live in Taiwan. So anyway I bought it on iTunes. Maybe next week."
,lepaysan,2011-11-08T02:33Z,"Guys download winrar or any other program that can unrar files. Once you do, open the first file and extract it. All  files will be extracted together into one .avi file which is 700 MB.

Great torrent scenebalance, thanks!"
