[V],neil1966hardy,2011-10-30T10:36Z,"720p resolution

Never say never again was never part of the James bond franchise nor was the david niven  spoof before any muppet complains that is missing."
,luis17se,2011-10-30T20:35Z,"The name of the torrent is misleading since it is the width that has 720p. The convention is to quote the height, which in this case is 512 (not considered HD). Thanks anyway :-)"

,jawick9,2012-05-20T05:02Z,"Not only in ""Never Say Never"" missing, so is the original ""Casino Royale.""  

This is far from being the complete collector's edition."
,woneo,2012-05-25T01:23Z,"As neil1966hardy said...

Never Say Never Again + Casino Royale (Original) are NOT official Bond movies... they were made by a different company and are not classed as ""real"" Bond movies.

Thats why you dont see them in box sets or torrents unless specifically mentioned... so this IS the COMPLETE set."
