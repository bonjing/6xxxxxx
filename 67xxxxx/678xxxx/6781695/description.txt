enhanced visual quality, a grand sense of scale, massive destruction,

dynamic audio and incredibly lifelike character animations. As bullets whiz

by, walls crumble, and explosions throw you to the ground, the battlefield

feels more alive and interactive than ever before. In Battlefield 3,

players step into the role of the elite U.S. Marines where they will

experience heart-pounding missions across diverse locations including Paris,

Tehran and New York.

before.

the terrain. Battlefield 3's cutting edge animation, spectacular visuals

and real as hell battle gameplay attack your senses and make you feel the

visceral warrior's experience like no other FPS.
