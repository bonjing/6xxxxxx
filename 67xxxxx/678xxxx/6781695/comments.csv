If you have an Nvidia graphic card try updating to 285.38 beta drivers, it worked for me..."
,bballov3r,2011-10-31T10:47Z,"For those who have the problem: ""Battlefield has stopped working just delete te 'TM' symbol."
,dumas1000,2011-11-01T03:03Z,"""Battlefield 3 has stopping working,"" is an error that results from not updating the drivers for what is almost assuredly a ATI Radeon graphics card. You need to download and install the Catalyst 11.10 preview 3 driver. Google it. It's not hard to track down. I had to get a tech specialist to install that driver on my computer though because I own a laptop, and those drivers can be a little iffy to install probably on mobility cards. But if you own a desktop PC, it shouldn't be too difficult."

Only one method working 100% (till now) for Battlefield 3 Double Sound Echo Fix

Worked for many 100% on (win 7 32bit , nvidia 9500 GT 1 Giga , 2 Giga RAM and CPU 3 GH Dual Core )


Battlefield 3 Double Sound Echo Fix By Dr Ali Aliraqi


Before you begin and load your mission (on Game Menu)

Press Alt + Tab then Task Manager then rigth click on BF3.exe then Set Affinity

after that unselect CPU 1 ( Select only CPU 0 )

you will notice that double sound or sound echo disapear ...

But you will notice also that game will become slower (because only one CPU of dual core CPU worked) so you needed to reduce resolution ...


Note :Few Seconds after loading and beginning your mission you can reselect CPU 1 with CPU 0 and game will become faster ...

But But But double sound or echo reapear when new loading regain (loading regain when you kill or begin next mission etc ... ) ...


So Conclusion : Dual Core CPU is main cause of double sound or echo ...


So we are waiting computer supporter that make patch or installer or anything for : ( battlefield 3 begin with single core CPU and converted to dual core 
CPU automatically few seconds after loading complete and when new loading reapear it converted to single core CPU automatically and it converted to dual core
CPU automatically few seconds after loading complete ) 

It is so difficult but we are needing that..............
