                           DESCRiPTiON 

 A team of professional con artists travel the country to catch out            
 unsuspecting members of the public with their fraudulent tricks in order to   
 teach them how to become more vigilant.                                       
                                                                               
                                                                               
 TV and radio presenter Colin Murray goes undercover as a magazine journalist 
 and cons a card player by persuading him to cheat in a private poker game.
 Meanwhile, Jess Clement offers a homeowner the chance to try out the latest TV
 technology for free, but the deal has a catch.
                                    
                                 Enjoy!
