Thank you so much !! "
,Monser1,2011-10-30T17:27Z,Is it RAR?
,szilard1987,2011-10-30T17:46Z,does it have pre and post race show?
,mikrovision,2011-10-30T20:33Z,Hmm...More info on this would be helpful.
,EdoSensei,2011-10-31T01:06Z,"I expect this is the FULL BBC1 show coverage inc. build up and after, but not the Forum. Have DLed SAFCukO09's torrents before and they have always been so."
,EdoSensei,2011-10-31T01:15Z,"To the SAFCuk009: Thanks for this SD sized file, but I think the file name will have limited the number of people finding it. I typed in ""Formula 1"", then ""F1"" then ""India"" and this torrent still didn't appear. The only file visible was the big HD one that Jorrel uploads. So, thanks for your efforts, but if you amend the torrent name, more people will find it and appreciate it. "
,digimike50,2011-10-31T05:13Z,Very many thanks!
,josephblowf1,2011-10-31T05:48Z,"EdoSensei thank you so much for providing the link to SAFCuk09 upload via Jorello's.

SAFCuk09 I strongly agree with EdoSensei, I never ever thought to search for Formula1 all together like that.  I don't think you did this in the past?  

SAFCuk09 your upload is of fantastic quality and I have no problems at all playing on my crappy netbook using vlc player.

Thank you for taking your time to provide us with this.  I cannot enjoy the fabulous BBC coverage here in the USA and refuse to watch via our ridiculous Speedtv (david hobbs is great, but there is no comparison with the beeb. none.  Scared about sky next year though!)

,josephblowf1,2011-10-31T05:50Z,three and a half hours in all. pre and post race.  look for the forum as well here on piratebay for all you f1 fanatics.  
,EdoSensei,2011-10-31T06:50Z,"Glad to be of service, although being as I live in Japan I have no good to TV to upload myself, even if I did know how to do it!

Thanks to all who use their own time for the benefit of others. It seems a shame that they go to the effort and then people can't find it because a simple naming issue. Indian instead of India as another example. "
,EdoSensei,2011-10-31T06:53Z,"And another thing, obviously it's a file size issue, but the forum always downloads way before the race has finished. Most frustrating!!! lol"
,silvah-,2011-10-31T08:57Z,"Ahhhh damn! I was waiting and waiting..I was literally checking every hour, and now I see it's already been uploaded 12 hours ago.. :("
,chandrus1983,2011-11-01T05:39Z,"i completed download after waiting 13hour 46 min.....but its okay....no 1 is seeding, jus they downlaod n delete the torrent.....plsss seed....i'm seeding it !!!
