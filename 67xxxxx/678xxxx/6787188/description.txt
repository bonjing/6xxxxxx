1. Introduction
======================
Voyage Linux is Debian derived distribution that is best run on a x86 embedded 
platforms such as PC Engines ALIX/WRAP, Soekris 45xx/48xx and Atom-based boards.

It can also run on low-end x86 PC platforms. Typical installation requires 
128MB disk space, although larger storage allows more packages to be installed.
Voyage Linux is so small that it is best suitable for running a full-feature 
firewall, wireless access point, Asterisk/VoIP gateway, music player or network 
storage device. 

Currently, Voyage Linux has the following editions:

    * Voyage Linux - the basic version
    * Voyage MPD - Music Player Daemon
    * Voyage ONE - VoIP software - Asterisk, dahdi etc

All editions are delivered as distribution tarball and Live CD in i386 
architecture. AMD64 architecture is available for Voyage Linux only. We also 
offer SDK to ease customizing Voyage Linux.
