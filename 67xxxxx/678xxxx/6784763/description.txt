Jeepers Creepers 1 and 2
It Waits

Partial scenes

Dead And Breakfast
Hell house

Been a while since i did a edit and since Halloween is around the corner thought why not getting rusty here.If you have ever seen any of my prior edits i do
way to much work to list everything,but here are some basics the intro,every transition between each movie ending and the next starting is custom made image per
image.I took a few scenes out of it waits that clashed with the edit and added a few custom scenes of the creature from jeepers creepers throughout,the ending is custom made
as is majority of the music you hear throughout the whole edit.

Jeepers creepers 1 was pretty much untouched except for 2 scenes were removed some vocals switched around and efcourse the ending transition was altered.Jeepers Creepers 2
i took all the deleted scenes and muxed em back to my encode,took out some original scenes left some intact,edited music and some vocals,If you have seen these movies numerous times
very easy to spot the edits if you haven't this one should be enjoyable.The flow is very smooth i tried to match everything up from dates to times so it doesn't look like i just joined
the 3 together,anyway you be the judge enjoy and HAPPY HALLOWEEN FROM LKRG.
