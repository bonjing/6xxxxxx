The More than Complete DC-Now More Completerer!

This forty-fifth alphabetical installment is: Superman!

What's This?
     It's a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.
       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those "Pre-DC" comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some "Post DC" comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c.875-885gb in total. It will take as long as it takes. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.

=================================

I know this is really big. It still seemed better than splitting all the titles starting with "Superman". Remember there are lot of Superman Stories that do not begin with "Superman". For examples "Adventures of Superman", "Action", "World's Finest", and  "Man of Steel". So this is a long way from a complete Superman comic torrent. The rest are o will be in their proper torrent by name.

I will wait longer than usual before the next part (46) as I know many of you will need extra time to download this.

I put some extra effort into this one. I have far too many scans that are too small, most dating back to a few years back when drive space was more scarce. I haven't had time to hunt for newer scans for all those in past torrents but really put some effort into it this time since so many Superman scans were small, as small as 2mb for a 36p comic.  Around 15% of the comics in this torrent were replaced with bigger scans in the last week. There are still some very small ones though. Even some of my replacements are smaller than I'd like.

Bigger is not always better, but there is such a thing as too small.(ask her) I like to see 12-18mb for a 36p comic. Obviously there's a lot more to an edited scan than just image size, but other things being relatively equal, you do need more space for a higher quality image. I think more than half a meg per page may be excessive simply because drive space still matters and frankly I read on a laptop (hopefully soon an iPad) so a giant image is not much use to me. I just have to shrink to fit anyway. Many people do prefer scans in the 25-30mb range. They have a point and if you don't try to collect every comic, drive space is less of an issue than it is for me. I've seen a number of scans with 2-3mbs per page and that's way too much, I think.

=================================

Some changes have been made to the previously announced makeup the rest of the torrents - small changes are still possible. I plan on 10 more.  Approximate sizes listed based on what I have now. I still have duplicates and replacement scans to weed out and additions are possible.  

The fill torrents continue to grow, as they will. It's looking likely that there will be three. On the other hand there's a lot in there that may or may not be better scans than what I already shared. So there will be last minute shrinkage.

Sizes given are the current size for the folder. Things will change.
