,Warbest,2011-10-31T17:55Z,Thanks VTV a tad late though...
,grenole,2011-10-31T18:14Z,That's not VTV's fault. They are a distributor only. The release got pre'd only an hour ago so this release was only 30min after pre. Pretty damn good job guys. Keep up the great work!
,ptl_base,2011-10-31T18:17Z,"Thanks for putting this up in standard def in an AVI format, i like to stream to my PS3 and Xbox to watch on my TV and they do not support the High Def MKV files."
,robbinsdl,2011-10-31T18:21Z,maybe late but its the first avi out thanks vtv

,dhlee34,2011-10-31T19:57Z,"I agree with ptl_base. Need the .avi file for streaming to the 360. Wish the MKV file was supported by Xbox though, it would be nice to have. Thanks for posting the .AVI
Thanks."
