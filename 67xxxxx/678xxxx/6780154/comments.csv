,nyder,2011-10-29T09:31Z,"Pretty sure you going to find this is an old episode.

All the ones from like rslog are the episode where Cass has the souls in him and gets rid of them.

,elusivejim1,2011-10-29T13:15Z,"Thanks EZTV great quality, @nyder I think you might be getting confused by the fact supernatural has previous episode recaps at the beginning. lol dumbass"

,Tutu81,2011-10-29T17:13Z,Woohoo thanks again od work!!!! XX
,nyder,2011-10-30T04:11Z,"No, i'm not confused.

rlslog gets the stuff first, i downloaded 2 different ones that were upped, they both were the episode with cass having the souls then getting rid of them.  How do i know that?  because i played thru it and checked.

fortunetly, eztv had the correct release."
,nyder,2011-10-30T04:12Z,"Which i might point out, wasn't in the recap of this episode, dumbass.

The recap in this episode is about the leviatians and the hospital and stuff.  No cass in it, bitch.
