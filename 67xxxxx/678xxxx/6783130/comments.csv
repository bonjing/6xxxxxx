,Chris561,2011-11-27T22:47Z,Picture quality sucks like off the street bootlegs. Sound is in good condition. Torrent is all right for those who really want to see the movie.
,imahaxyoo,2011-11-30T20:08Z,"OK now, I'm one of those viewers who REALLY dislikes bad quality movies but I have to admit that this movie is 100% worth it. Time as currency? Probably one of the most unique ideas of all the movies I have seen in my time - but onto the quality.

Remember, its not a DVD Rip, don't expect anything solid. If I was to rate this on a scale of 10, 1 being Minecraft and 10 being DVD Rip, it would place somewhere around 6.

If you are on the other hand, used to cams, this is a 8-9/10.

Overall I would give it an average rating of:
V: 7
A: 8 (Some static at certain points but otherwise very good)
M: A must watch, but if you're patient enough to wait for a rip, definitely do that."
