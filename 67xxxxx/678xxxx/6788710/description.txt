MiniWeapons of Mass Destruction is a humorous, MacGyver-'msplred tactical guide that illustrates the full potential of everyday items to be transformed into a menacing miniarsenal. This bible of forbidden knowledge will prepare you for a zombie uprising or the inevitable alien invasion. To prevent mass hysteria, proper training is essential. Each weapon is cataloged with an easy-to-read bill of materials, step-by-step instructions, and alternate construction methods. And in the final chapter you'll find a small library of simple targets you can use to master your MiniWeapon shooting skills.
