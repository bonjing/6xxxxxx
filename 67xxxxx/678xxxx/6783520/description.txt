Mega Breakdown: Cargo Truck
The Volvo FH12 Globetrotter: After over a hundred thousand miles of hauling cargo, this Euro truck is headed for a breakdown. But in Sweden, a country known for it's "green" initiatives, Volvo's goal is for 90% percent of the truck to be reused, or recycled. Piece-by-piece, a team of experts must remove everything from the 350 horsepower engine, to the 8-foot tall cab, so it can be recycled, and reborn, even bigger.
