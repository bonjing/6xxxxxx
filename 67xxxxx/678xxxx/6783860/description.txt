Saol John Riley, directed by Galway man Kieran Concannon, follows Kerry singer songwriter Charlie O'Brien as he revisits the sites associated with Riley and tries to discover more about the revolutionary heroâ€™s fate.

 Charlie is one of several songwriters, both here and in America, who have been inspired by the deeds of John Riley. 
 The song Pa Los De San Patricios commemorates the brigade, and was included on Charlieâ€™s first CD, Songs from an Outpost in 2007. He had read about the story in a book called The Irish Soldiers of Mexico by American historian, Mexican resident and authority on the San Patricios, Michael Hogan.

 Other singers who documented events in Rileyâ€™s life include Nashville bluegrass star, Tim O'Brien who co-wrote the song John Riley with the legendary Guy Clark. New York Irish rockers, Black 47 penned a song called San Patricio as did folk singer Thom Moore, while Ron Kavana wrote The Men That God Made Mad about Riley and his men. That was recorded by Niamh Parsons and others. In addition, the Chieftains and Ry Cooder did a whole album last year around the San Patricios.
