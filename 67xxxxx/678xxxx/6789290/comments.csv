However, a more universal image format (ISO) would have been nice. Not everyone uses Nero."

,Bonesman1990,2012-01-07T23:38Z,"This is just version 22 in drag.

If you want to participate in file sharing, douche bag, BUY THE DAMNED SOFTWARE and SHARE IT! Don't repackage someone else's outdated upload with a lie.

I hope your mother's womb falls out onto the ground and you are forced to pick it up and hand it to her, scumbag."
,mizhop,2012-01-22T13:51Z,"Thank you to the uploader and seeders for a quick DL!  This program is exactly what it says it is, and works great.

Yes, the image is a "".nrg"" file, but it mounts and opens just fine with Daemon Tools Lite.  Copy the files to your desktop, unmount ""image.nrg"" and mount the ISO from the first DVD file, and you're on your way.

Piece of cake!  Props to BLACKTROY"
