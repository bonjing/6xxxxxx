,frzfoxy,2011-10-29T07:26Z,Is this the broken beta version or the real steam release?
,Rhine86,2011-10-29T07:41Z,"@frzfoxy I think it might be, its roughly the same size as the other fake ones, Ive been reading around that the full final should be around 5gbs, Im going to have a go any way"
,lolm8lolm8,2011-10-29T07:53Z,I'm almost certain it's the leaked beta version.
,Necroclysm,2011-10-29T08:15Z,"Just don't even bother downloading to test one of these unless you see something stating it is the correct non-beta version, or something similar.

Someone already uploaded the SKIDROW release and now we are going to get a flood of people reuploading the same torrent for no reason as usual(other than to usually stick a tracker in that is private)."
,StefanGavrila,2011-10-29T09:48Z,"@Rhine86 5 GB seems a lot for a space game, Sins of a Solar Empire is about 1.2 GB even after 3 expansions, so this size is about right.
Anyway I've just finished downloading it and will post result here in a few minutes."
,Elegos_Akla,2011-10-29T10:07Z,"It appears to be same bugged beta. 
No full-screen mode (at least working one). 
Main menu often appers without letters, Options menu cannot be exited correctly, nd LAGS, LAGS, LAGS..."
,StefanGavrila,2011-10-29T10:19Z,"OK, this is definitely a beta version. It's buggy as hell and looks unfinished. The version number on the start up screen also indicates it's a beta.
"
,Niarro,2011-10-29T14:32Z,"Don't bother with this download, it's the beta version. Any sots 2 torrent 1.63 gigs in size is the beta. (I've heard that the release version is about 2 gigs)"
,StefanGavrila,2011-10-29T15:49Z,The first update for the game has been released earlier today. I fixes a lot of bugs and is much more stable but the tooltips for most if not all the items in the game are still missing so you will have a really hard time figuring out what everything is supposed to do.
,StefanGavrila,2011-10-29T15:51Z,"PS: You can find it at ""rlslog net"" in the PC games list. make sure it says ""update 1"" in the title."
[V],Murlok,2011-10-29T15:52Z,"that was kind of new spelling.
Can you translate that to murlokian :D"
