Gary Lineker is joined by Alan Hansen and Alan Shearer for highlights of the day's eight Premier League matches. 
The standout fixtures are the London derby between Chelsea and Arsenal, and Everton's home game with champions 
Manchester United. Arsenal ended a five-match losing streak against Chelsea with a 3-1 home victory when the sides 
last met, in December. However, the Gunners have made their worst start to a season in more than half a century, 
while Chelsea have made a smooth transition under new manager Andre Villas Boas. The key man in this fixture 
could be Didier Drogba, who has scored 13 goals in his last 12 appearances against Arsenal. Another forward, 
Wayne Rooney of Manchester United, is likely to be the focus of attention on his return to previous club Everton. 
The day's other fixtures include Manchester City v Wolves, West Brom v Liverpool and Sunderland v Aston Villa.
