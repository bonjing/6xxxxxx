 BLAH, this so isn't our night. Uploaded the wrong audio. This still
 has the other blip but atleast now you can watch with the audio.

 As for Lost Girl, we'll address that in the morning. However all 
 signs point to it being in the original broadcast. So really you/we
 have two choices. One we wait for a rerun in 4 days and not pre and people
 go nuts over where is it or, we pre and you can watch it for the most part 
 and it's not perfect. That and who said the reair would be fine. In the past
 Showcase hasn't fixed these issues for the reair. We know we've waited. LOSE
 LOSE for us and you.

 Previously on 2HD going crazy..

 
 We're sorry this is late but we've been experiencing some issues with 
 our Cartoon Network feed these past couple of days. There might be some 
 minor glitches on this release. We asked FQM and they didn't have the 
 episode recorded. Our apologies but there's no other rerun scheduled
 so we thought it would be better to have the episode out there then not
 at all.
