Album: Demonns of Gymnastics
Artist: Yacht Club DJs
Released: 2010

"Demons of Gymnastics" is the second release from Yacht Club DJs. Sampling pretty much everything from 80s rock to hip hop, from Elton John to heavy metal, from top 40 to classical... and it works so well. If you get the chance, check these guys out live. They're amazing at working a crowd and gettin the party rockin.
