,ImSoJaded,2011-11-01T10:47Z,Why upload anything if you don't seed it?
,sv504,2011-11-01T13:54Z,"I agree with ImSoJaded: seed at least 10:1. If you can't do that, then stop uploading and wasting our time. (The 10:1 ratio is needed because there are always hit-and-run users who don't bother to keep seeding after their download has finished. Seeding at least 10:1 gives you a good chance that the upload stays alive)"
