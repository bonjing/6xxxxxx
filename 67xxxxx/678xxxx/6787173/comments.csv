,Chirpe,2011-11-17T13:13Z,Downloads won't connect. (Stuck at 0 connections no matter the file or download service.)
,collinmck,2011-11-24T16:54Z,"I am having some trouble with the crack on my home computer. I tried it on another machine and it worked just fine, but as soon as I apply the crack on this one, it won't complete any downloads.
 I've tried everything I can think of to get it work (AV, firewall, uninstall/re-install, etc.). I made a copy of the original .exe file and replaced the cracked one with it, and it works again (just not Premium activated). I've tried several different cracks and patches, all with the same result. Can anyone help me?"
