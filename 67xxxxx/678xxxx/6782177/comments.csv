,RailGamer,2011-10-30T18:12Z,Your all welcome! @shamus178 i am trying to stick it all into an installer the full size is 37.2gb TPB will not let me upload that size of a file for some mad reason but i don't know any programs that will make these very large folders into an executable or an MSI package so it reduces it to a 12gb file then you can install it to the TS2012 Directory. Any suggestions will be appreciated.
