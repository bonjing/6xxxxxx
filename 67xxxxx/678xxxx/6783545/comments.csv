As they are not standard themes, one really needs the documentation in avoid to avoid countless hours trying to figure out why certain things aren't working. Documentation is available on the templatic website, but you have to be a paying member to access it. If you can get the documentation this torrent would be great, without it, many themes are not usable."
,dom9360,2012-04-03T01:54Z,I've got all of the instructions. Anyone still want them?

,dlhire,2012-04-03T16:33Z,"Hi @dom9360 

Would you be kind to send us the instructions? Thanks"
,dlhire,2012-04-03T16:45Z,Any chance for some manual guide for the templatic themes?
,FAGGOTS3,2012-04-25T22:08Z,@dom9360.. Could you please upload the documentation? This torrent is next to worthless without it >:(
,ecpanik,2012-04-26T03:14Z,did anyone ever get the documents???

Thanks for sharing, and sharing the security warning :)"
