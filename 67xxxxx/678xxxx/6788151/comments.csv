,Eagle63,2012-02-10T16:03Z,"Hi Bit-Step! 
Thanks a lot for all the time you have used to upload all these awesome Dubstep torrents!!! :D 

However, I have 2 important questions: 
Can you upload the (about) 2 hour mix in this torrent in Stereo? (yes.. it`s mono!). And, can you please fix the ID3-tags before you upload your torrents? 

May I also mention for anyone else who read this post: Whith the speed most people have today, upload 320kps in stereo! ( not joint stereo )

Cheers from Eagleizer! :D"
