Good torrent! Great quality. Please also include the bitrate though mate. It's important for those who watch from their USB stick and stuff. I might have the worlds fastest USB 2.0 stick (Patriot Xporter 16GB) but it can only handle so much...

So please include the bitrate in the description.

So far characters are yeah really clichĂÂŠ it's very much a 'family' show intended for kids as well. Though namely a few scenes would scare the shit out of children.

Also finding it really predictable but it's not completely cringe worthy. I'm waiting for a bit more action and some maturity from the cast of actors. If it gets worse than this however I'll stop watching it and move on to something else.

Torrent has no subs. You can get them online though. I personally don't think you need subs to watch this. Watched the first 5 episodes without subs no problem at all. Only wish they would hurry up and air the series faster."

That's why sometimes the description is needed... despite some ""spoilers""..."
