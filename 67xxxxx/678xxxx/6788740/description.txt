NOTA: This PDF file and the one described in torrent  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6485849/ are identical but named and saved differently, making the two torrents distinct (much like identical twins don't have identical DNA due to distinct mutations). This file is retorrented for technical reasons. The previous .torrent file will soon be removed from the TPB index.
