Kingâ€™s Canyon is the sophmore album from the Sydney band, following on from Hunting released late last year. They have recently played with the likes of Florence and the Machine and Jamie T, as well as selling out their own nationwide tour. Originally commencing as a solo project, they were still known as (just) Ernest Ellis until recently when they decided to add to their moniker, once and for all declaring themselves as a collective.

Clearly a reflective bunch, Kingâ€™s Canyon is a beautifully poignant album, a result of their everyday emotion and passion. The lyrics and overall scope of many of the songs can be quite heartrending, but in a way where you can still see a way out. Itâ€™s honest. 

The albumâ€™s first single â€œGreat Skyâ€ gives that exact impression, a big infinite space. Recorded with high levels of reverb and echoed backing vocals, they cleverly give what is in actuality a very large track a withdrawn feel. â€œSave Meâ€ is one of the more upbeat songs, tempo wise at least. Itâ€™s definitely a toe-tapper, and reminds of a time when Kings of Leon werenâ€™t shit. Ellis, who has been quoted as feeling unconfident in his voice, does himself proud with his wailing vocals soaring throughout. The opening track â€œSons and Daughtersâ€ may be my favourite, a track which delves into deep melancholy before finishing on a powerful and victorious spike.

I read an interview about the recording process, how they wanted to create a rounded album, not a couple of good singles surrounded by filler. This is exactly what they have accomplished.
