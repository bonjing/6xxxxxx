,Sjoppiej,2012-01-31T19:26Z,"For the language problem, this works: download the Fifa manager 12 Demo from Gamershell (or other trustworthy Webpage) and install on your PC. Then when demo is installed there will be  Eng,fre,ger Packs in the 'fmdata' folder of the manager demo. Now delete the current 'eng' folder from the full fifa manager 12, and Copy andï»¿ Paste the 'eng' folder from the demo in the 'fmdata' folder of the full game. Now it should work fine . Russian language is gone and game is in English :)

(i know it's quite some work, but it will work!)"

,clauskg,2012-03-01T14:44Z,Not working in Windows 7 64 bits version. The computer is freezing in a black screen at launch.
,mybboard,2012-03-16T18:54Z,"This torrent really works. THANK YOU !

For english language:

1. Download the [url=http://www.fileplanet.com/222898/220000/fileinfo/FIFA-Manager-12-Demo-]Fifa Manager 12 Demo Version[/url]
2. Install Fifa Manager 12 Demo Version
3. Download this torrent, mount the image (it's ISO) and install Fifa Manager 12 in other folder (Program FilesFifa manager 12) - FULL VERSION.
4. Delete the current 'eng' folder from the FULL VERSION (Program FilesFifa manager 12fmdata).
5. Copy from DEMO VERSION the same folder 'eng' (Program FilesFifa manager 12 demofmdata) to FULL VERSION (Program FilesFifa manager 12fmdata).
6. Now your game will be in english.

----
To change language also in DATABASE EDITOR, you need to replace next 2 files from (DEMO VERSION) ""FIFA MANAGER 12 Demofmdata"" to (FULL VERSION) ""Fifa manager 12fmdata"":
1. DatabaseEditor.txt
2. DatabaseEditor.de.txt

Now also DATABASE EDITOR will be in english.

Very good torrent.
Work's fine on Windoows 7 with only 1 GB RAM. 
But maybe you have more :)"

,Enkydoo,2012-04-05T12:16Z,"Don't do the stupid shit about downloading the demo first , why to spent 2 Gb just for one simle folder. Just do what I said in the previous comment.
also if u want to see how to do it certainly I've put a video on youtube:
http://www.
youtube.
com/watch

(I've separated the link in several parts because ThePirateBay doesn't allow to put links of youtube.. in the comments, just write the parts together,one after one in youtube search box, so u can watch the video.)"
,banjisa,2012-04-20T16:57Z,will someone please seed the eng pack that Enkydoo had posted. please. thank u
