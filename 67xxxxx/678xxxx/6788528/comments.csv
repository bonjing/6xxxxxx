[V],Murlok,2011-11-02T09:34Z,Thx :)
,FalconGrey,2011-11-03T13:00Z,"@Rhine86
The game works good, but has lots of issues still without the 4th patch. (One advantage of purchase, support and easy access to patches)

A few things to check if you're not able to even start. Make sure you have installed the DirectX, VB, and C++ installations that came with the game (located in the installation directory). The game will error out or crash or not even start if any one of those is missing."

,Wintermist,2011-11-04T01:08Z,If you like this genre you should really support it by buying the game. There aren't that many developers willing to go into this genre at all. Or maybe it's just me growing old...
,FalconGrey,2011-11-04T02:10Z,"No Wintermist, you're not getting old. :)  I also agree. If you like this game, you should buy this game.  If you don't like Steam. You should buy this game directly from the Kerberos website (so they get most of the money) and then download the patches here, of if impatient, goto steam for them directly."
,Rhine86,2011-11-04T04:09Z,"@FalconGrey Cheers, I can run the game, its just that I cant stand to play a game in windowed mode or with half the features missing, Im a perfectionist"
,XForsakenX,2011-11-04T04:45Z,"Once the game is really playable I will buy it, but this game is a good example of why i never buy brand new games or pre order anything till i try it first."
,Wintermist,2011-11-04T07:45Z,If you buy it before the end of the month you will FOR FREE get 3 of the Immersion pack DLC's. Worth considering.
,Urlos,2011-11-06T11:22Z,is there Update 4to6 thats actually working?
,thebeav111,2011-11-06T14:31Z,"wait how do I get 3 DLCs?  I bought it lol, played the first one for years and never payed for it, figured I owed em."
,Falkur,2011-11-06T18:36Z,Any chance of uploading the next patches?
,whiteorc,2011-11-07T17:43Z,"the updates 4-5-6 are available on rlslog if i'm not mistaken, courtesy of skidrow of course"
,whiteorc,2011-11-07T17:58Z,"never mind, it seems the patch is broken"
,solitaire,2011-11-08T04:51Z,"Tried updates 4 to  6 from skidrow and it's broken...

wait for the next one..."
,Lomarg,2011-11-08T09:20Z,"Yup, Skidrow update 4-6 is currently broken. It downloads and installs fine, but it always insta-crashes on startup (you get to the second intro video, then a critical error pops up)."
,whiteorc,2011-11-08T12:17Z,"Someone from the skidrow update 4-6 forum found a workaround. He backed up the following: sots2_managed.dll and mars exe from the bin dir(x64) and the Mis_Missile.weapon from the assets/base/weapons.(those are after update 3)
Then installed update 4-6 and overwrited those files. In my case the game starts and i didn't have any crashes so far (played only 50-60 turns). The stupid AI combat turn remains despite the fact they said it's fixed, but i noticed some changes in starbase module interface. I guess some of the changes are made, but i didn't have the opportunity to test if combat is fixed(alot of bugs there to fix)"
,Lomarg,2011-11-09T10:14Z,"Well, the ""workaround"" is basically to remove several of the things the patch is supposed to fix, as you just overwrite ""fixed"" data with the old broken one. That's why for example the AI turns are still crappy that way. SotS2 will need a lot of patches before I'll play it seriously, I'll just stick with SotS Prime ACM for now."
