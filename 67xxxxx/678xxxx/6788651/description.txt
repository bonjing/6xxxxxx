Horace Andy has one of the most distinctive voices in reggae music, and here on these early seventies tracks, Coxsone got the best from him. Contains his big Jamaican hit Skylarking of course, alongside such classics as Just Say Who, Love Of A Woman, Every Tongue Shall Tell, Something On My Mind, See A Mans Face and Got To Be Sure, his adaptation of Cat Stevens Where Do The Children Play and the killer Ill Be Gone. Pure quality.
