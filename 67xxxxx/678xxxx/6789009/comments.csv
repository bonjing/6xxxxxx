[T],trialNerror,2011-11-02T08:45Z,"I still say just go for the 3.3 GB single file MP4 720p version.  
Plays directly on a PS3 & X360.  Can't go wrong. (~;

:thumbsup:"
[V],psspss,2011-11-02T09:26Z,"nah a 3.3 wouldnt play on my laptop.. any mkv or mp4 over 1gb looses sound sync

cant beat plain old xvid with 1200 or higher bitrate :)"
,Steampunk.Princess,2011-11-02T10:07Z,"Thx 4 this. Now I can watch the whole thing (with CDs 1 & 3),  without having to download the whole thing all over again from somewhere else. x :)"
[T],trialNerror,2011-11-02T11:28Z,"Of course you can beat plain old (keywords being plain and old) XviD, it's called x264!  

And if you can't play any MP4 or MKV over 1GB on your laptop without going out of sync, makes me wonder what kind of audio splitter, sound drivers, video card, etc you have going on.  That shouldn't happen for any reason unless your lappy-top is 10 years old with 512MB or less of RAM and only 64MB for the video card. That would not be a laptop by today's standards.  That's just a portable word processor.  However, I can understand that scenario as I have a 10 year old Gateway with those exact specs.  It barfs at the attempt of playing a 720p video."
[T],trialNerror,2011-11-02T11:30Z,I should probably note that I do have a new desktop with much better specs that can play 1080p vids no problemo.  That old Gateway is pretty much just a music and DVD player in my bedroom now.
,Netbunny,2011-11-02T23:27Z, Thank you for this great upload you get a +1 from me. :)
[V],psspss,2011-11-03T00:07Z,"thanks

i have a celeron m 1.6ghz 2gb its slower then my p4 with hyperthreading (I had... earthquake it died so unable to replace as no money) and geforce card though
this has a crap intel video chip

it takes most of the cpu to play abasic 500-700mb mkv and if using VLC and scroll the audio vanishes
for minutes before reappearing yet on a dual core
with same setup its instant so
the compression takes a toll of resources

where xvids just keep working even 3gb ones

and xvid quality depends largely on width x height
pixels used and bitrate it can be sharp as mp4.mkv
if you want it to be but will take more drive space
so we go for a trade off size verse acceptableness quality"
