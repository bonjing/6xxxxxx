,nmodi9,2011-12-13T00:15Z,should there already be a Shared Plugins folder when we install? I can't find that folder in the directory in Program Files in a 64 bit installation on Windows 7. Is that folder in the x86 directory instead?

,Exodus666,2011-12-15T13:23Z,"Downloaded and installed, Everything works fine.

To the ppl who cant do it, u need to remember 3 things:

1. Always start the keygen as a admin.
2. the plug ins folder is in the x32 section (programfilesx86) because most plug ins are 32 bit.
3. In the keygen u need to select Sony Vegas 11 or you will get the wrong key.

,darkbyke,2011-12-16T04:32Z,"1. Install Vegas
2. Run keygen as admin.

6. Install directory is C:/Program Files and your Plugins folder is C:/Program Files(x86)  VERY DIFFERENT FOLDERS!!

,LostReaction,2012-01-28T23:25Z,"Works Flawlessly. Also remember to ALWAYS run the keygen as administrator when patching. Also, for those who say the Activation code at the end doesn't work, you must have not patched it. Close the keygen and reopen it with administrative privileges. Then Patch at again. Your ""plugins"" folder will always be in program files (x86) no matter what version of windows you are running."

in the step where you actually run the keygen and they say as adminstrator, what some of us may not know is

- you have to right click on the keygen and scroll to the not (open) but (run as adminstrator).

the keygen should come up after. when you follow the steps edjpsu.. you shouldnt have any problems"
,install99,2012-02-07T17:04Z,"Installed to
Windows 7 x64 Ult (non-SP1)

Offered update during installation which I declined.
Software ran as normal using keygen tools.
Sadly my gtx260 is NOT supported for GPU acceleration. Vegas 11 pro runs OK, but seems to be slower in performance than Vegas 10 pro, in particular the preview window is awfully slow.

With nothing to lose I tried to update using the sony website download file:
vegaspro11.0.521_64bit.exe
Build 521

Update was successful.
Starting up Vegas 11 build 521 prompted the registration window familiar with the install of Vegas 11 build 371.
This time though the keygen tools DO NOT WORK and so the software cannot be used.

Require new keygen information.
Or no-reg crack.


In other words, don't bother to update builds, it wont work."

,jswalski,2012-03-19T08:49Z,I had no trouble installing but I cannot preview any video and if i render the video its just a blank green video with audio.
,jswalski,2012-03-19T09:12Z,"Something is wrong with this torrent, you cannot render videos all you get is black screen. Same with video preview. I used the same settings with a vegas 9 install for a while, this is bogus."
,kystarr,2012-04-09T02:21Z,"Got it running in one try, here's what I did. Who knows, it might work for you too.

1. Install Sony Vegas Pro 11 (but don't run it yet after installation)
2. Run the keygen as Admin
3. Select Vegas Pro 11 from the dropdown. 
4. Click on patch. I selected this folder C:Program FilesSonyVegas Pro 11.0x86
5. After patching, Run Vegas Pro 11
6. Paste the Serial Number from the keygen (the one starting with 1T4)
7. Click on next, then register from another computer.
8. Paste the authentication code from the keygen.
9. Go ahead and make awesome videos!"
,kystarr,2012-04-09T02:24Z,C:Program Files -> Sony -> Vegas Pro 11.0 -> x86
,GoblynQueen,2012-04-19T04:04Z,"Okay i figured out what the problem was and it worked perfectly. :)

Here's what i did:


1. Run Setup x32 or x64, depending on your OS.

2. When finished before you open Keygen (RIGHT CLICK KEYGEN AND CHOOSE 'RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR) 

3.Choose Vegas Pro 11 from the drop down menu, select ""patch"" and point it to your installation directory. (C:Program Files/Sony/Vegas Pro 11.0)

4. When asked for the second time, point it to-> C:Program Files (x86)/Sony/Shared Plug-Ins)

5. Start Vegas Pro and give in the serial from the keygen.

6. Give in any name and email, accept terms and conditions, click next.

7. Select: ACTIVATE FROM ANOTHER COMPUTER

8. Save the file you get anywhere.

9. Give in the authentication code and you're good to go.


So basically follow the instructions but don't forget when you get to the keygen part, right click it and run keygen as administrator. And once you choose Sony Vegas Pro 11 from the drop down menu patch it to: C:Program Files/Sony/Vegas Pro 11.0 the first time.
And then the second time patch it to: C:Program Files (x86)/Sony/Shared Plug-Ins

After that it should work. :) Hope this helps anyway that's been having problems with it.

Btw if you're getting an error message when you try to patch, try uninstalling and re-installing the program again and then follow the steps exactly as i posted."
,SoldZomby,2012-05-06T09:12Z,"The torrent works great! Thank you so much! I've been using this for my videos for a few months, and have had no problems regarding the torrent aspect of things. 

Question though. Is it safe to update our version from this point on, or will it somehow conflict with the keygen?"
,roller_reaction,2012-05-19T03:46Z,"Didn't work for me, though I suspect that it failed to patch because I already had Sony Bloggie software installed on my PC and apparently already had a newer version of the Shared Plugins folder.  I'll try again later."
