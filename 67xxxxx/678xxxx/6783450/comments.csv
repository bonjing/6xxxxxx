As somebody who knows the filmmakers, I have no problem professing that all the high reviews as of 10.31.11 are from the filmmakers or their friends and family. In fact, they haven't even bothered to type new reviews, but have copied and pasted their previous glorifying comments from Amazon.com.

As for my review; this movie is your standard film student fare. It borrows from dozens of popular movies and makes no original additions of its own. Pinching Penny would be a good movie to watch if you know the people involved or are stoned, drunk, or otherwise mentally incapacitated. If not, I would suggest you don't waste your time. "
