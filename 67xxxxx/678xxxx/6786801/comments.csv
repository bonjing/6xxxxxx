,VladCiocarlan,2012-05-09T00:27Z,Torrent keeps getting an error. Any reason for that?
,VladCiocarlan,2012-05-09T00:32Z,"Error occurs for ""438 Manly Help for the Female Supoort ~Comentitive Poem~ (Li Xiangfei Stage).mp3.bc"" Then refuses to download the torrent."
,RogerMadoff,2012-05-27T13:43Z,"It's possible that the ~ symbols are interfering with your download. Try another torrent client. If it still doesn't work, I could try to re-upload it."
