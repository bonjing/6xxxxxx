We need to get famegirls to get a top shelf camera, these grainy low res pics are fine for the 1990s but she deserves better than this."
,tza2k5,2011-10-31T05:59Z,"Sandra its done , gone , bye bye ."
,LOLTHATWASLAME,2011-10-31T06:20Z,"Aw c'mon, I don't understand how you can say this. To be honest, Virginia and her shitty make up (not only hers, but the others too) is not hot, her eye-brows are a turn off; and generally she is the ugly of the three (you are fucking blind if you cannot tell). Not sure what to say about Ella, but she is the blonde counter-part to  Sandra. I don't know why you are praising the other two so much, but Sandra has had her fair share of some nice sets (honestly you are blind, as you always say something about half-assed sets instead of the worthy ones) until Virginia displayed her cooch out-front and took out her titties."
,96ardnas69,2011-10-31T06:20Z,"Oh my poor WMI Blog guy.  I read your review.  It was more of a rant than a review.  You must know by now that Sandra is not modeling anymore, and the sets FG publishes are ones that were shot before she started a family last year.  No one knows how many surplus sets they have, but they will run out someday.  And for you dreamers that hope she will continue modeling, she has said no.  Now quick.....look up and you might yet see that bright shooting star that is the one called Sandra.  Look and be happy while you can.  "
,LOLTHATWASLAME,2011-10-31T06:20Z,"Also, Thanks."
[T],webmodelsindex,2011-10-31T06:32Z,"For the Sandra sets that are great, I've said so. She just doesn't produce that many of them.

Last weeks set wasn't that bad, and I posted some upcoming sets. Some of them look to be really good.

As for Virginia, it is true that what she did with her eyebrows was horrid, but I liked her back before the FG site went live. I've always been of a fan of hers. She is still sexy to me in a girl next door sort of way. I'd bone her, just wouldn't date her. With Ella, I wouldn't mind being seen out in public with her though.

As I said in the blog review for this set, Sandra is hot. Never said she was ugly or unattractive. She just seems boring to me. Not because of her sets per say, but just her personality and facial expressions. She doesn't scream ""I'm hot and I know it"", more like ""Oh God, another photo shoot? Let's hurry up and get this done"".

I want to praise Sandra, I really do. But if she can't take her work seriously, how can I?"
,tordolplayer,2011-10-31T06:39Z,"So, apparently there is a pre-child, post marriage video of Sandra and her husband.  Has anyone seen this yet?"
,google16112003,2011-10-31T06:46Z,"the photographer needs better lighting as well as a better camera, we know from her outdoor sets that she isnt always as pale as a ghost. What ever lighting he is using bleaches out her fleshtones.

,Holy Divr,2011-10-31T08:27Z,where's DM's re-sized Ella #170??? oh DM where are you?
,96ardnas69,2011-10-31T09:43Z,"WMI, why do you repost her sets?.......I am just trying to influence how you pirates view Sandra.  Long ago, before TPB, some of us helped Sandra fight those who would repost her sets.  So what has changed?  Why do some choose to hurt her in this way and then add insult to injury?  She's just 19, and has been defamed enough.  WMI should only repost a few samples that are smaller than the originals, and WMI should cease posting sets.  You don't need to.  You can draw hits to your site just the same without hurting Sandra. You know this to be true.   Please stop giving away sets that should be purchased.  You are in a good position to help set standards of conduct suitable for this situation.  The  pirates will still thank you, only cowards will be angry. "

I dont think you grasp the concept of this.
Well this is just to funny... people still dont understand."
,Astralia,2011-10-31T13:10Z,"I would actually love to see some of the other girls from WMI. Like Bianca, Ema, Angie..."
,TPBWhore,2011-10-31T16:32Z,"I've said it once, and I'll say it again...and I'm sure I speak for many when I say that Fame Girls will never see a penny from me as long as they continue on their present course. Between the inconsistency of quality from one week's sets to the next and the sheer lack of appeal in most of the sets, I would never even consider becoming a paying member. I know that Sandra has steered away from modeling and that all of her currently produced sets are basically backlogs, nothing can be done about that, but Ella and Virginia are still actively modeling. They are both 18-19 now. Step it up already. If and when the remaining two change their NN formats or even simply increase the consistency of quality & appeal of their sets from one week to the next, I would gladly become a paying member and support them wholeheartedly...but after 12+ years of the same garbage, I just don't see it happening."
,TPBWhore,2011-10-31T16:34Z,"In any case, I just want to say thanks to WMI for his contributions and hard work!"
,96ardnas69,2011-10-31T17:14Z,"Theleecher does not get it......TPB could be used for good, but instead is used in a way that hurts individuals (not just corporations).  Those that abuse the power they have, will suffer epic failure.   Just look at Wikileaks.  File sharing is great, until it adversely effects you.  Edjofsanity, has slipped over the line.  Legitimate business will change, and adapt to conditions if they want to survive, including those who sell glamour.
So look alive you scurvy bilge rats, and be ready to abandon ship.  There has been plenty of  warning.  Follow the code or loose what loot you have.  As for you tpbwhore, I get it, but let the market forces work it out.  Interference in the marketplace from groups like TPB will eventually destroy that which TPB lives on.  It's a self destructive activity.  TPB will have to change and adapt (as they have in the past) or they will fall to the forces that are against them.  WMI is working within the boundaries TPB have set.  I doubt if WMI would mind one bit if those boundaries changed to better help everyone, including Fame-Girls, WMI, TPB, and all other interested parties.  So thanks in advance WMI for seeing it my way.  We need to be reasonable or we will loose it all."
,96ardnas69,2011-10-31T18:00Z,"Oh and BTW, I just hope the Russian mob doesn't find me when I try to profit from my massive Russian model collection.  Yes I am a hypocrite, and a scoundrel.  Imagine that, to find someone like me here."
,buckweed,2011-10-31T20:11Z,"96ardnas69: Seriously, go read a book or something. Nobody than the OWNERS of lame-girls will hurt from this, I am sure the girls have been exploited so much already that their situation won't change much from torrenting their tame sets.

TPBWhore is right on the money, I would consider paying if there was something worth paying for (Hell I subscribe to several porn sites). But as this situation stands, even downloading it from pirate bay is a pain and I thank WMI for pushing them out every week and I also read his reviews.

Honestly, I haven't downloaded a Sandra set in months, not Ella either (I don't care for a 100-per-dusine-blonde that doesn't even disrobe anyway).

Virginia is the one that has kept my interest up, even so far out as here on TPB, but even her sets start to get a little long in the tooth now (they need to go forward, never backwards)."
,Chisinau_Moldova,2011-10-31T20:53Z,"Thanks very much WMI,greatly appreciated.

96ardnas69  You really are spouting some epic bullshit,well done."
,96ardnas69,2011-10-31T23:53Z,"Thanks to all for your respectful comments and suggestions.  I had expected much worse, like being made to walk the plank or keelhauled.  Since Sandra is diminishing, we might as well make it all about me anyway............epic BS.....I could not have said that better.......now listen up lads......watch what you say about Sandra or endure more of the spouting and epical BS that springs forth whenever Sandra is dissed.

LOL!
You still dont get it. There are ppl that download and then buy the things that they like. I think
many of us do that.
For a webpage like Sandras I would never pay. I simply dont know who gets the money. If I knew that Sandra was getting a fair share of the money I would be happy to be a member (If I think it would be worth the money and in this case I dont think so)."

You said ""There are ppl that download and then buy the things that they like. I think many of us do that.""    If that were true then Fame-Girls would post the sets here themselves.  That's what samples are for. 
 You said ""For a webpage like Sandra's I would never pay. I simply don't know who gets the money. If I knew that Sandra was getting a fair share of the money I would be happy to be a member (If I think it would be worth the money and in this case I don't think so). 
 Sandra's sites have been independently owned by her guardians since September of 2005 until May of 2007 when Ella became an official participant and they added Virginia who's photographer became a limited partner.  Before 2005 Sandra's management was fairly compensated, and they still are with residuals from her archive sites.  They are a family owned and operated site where the assets are well protected and cared for.  The proceeds they acquired,  allowed Sandra to attend private school, and helped her have a slightly better than normal lifestyle.  Since 2005 they have struggled with piracy, haters, fanatics, fakes, and a general misuse of their content, all of which adversely affects them, especially the reposting of entire sets just hours after they are released.   Don't be a nambi pambi pirate with weak justification for your thievery.  There is no justifying what is done here regarding Fame-Girls, so give it a rest, and don't get me anymore upset than I am.  Let this topic die once and for all. "
