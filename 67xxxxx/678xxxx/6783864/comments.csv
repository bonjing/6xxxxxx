Advice from a friend to a friend: -If you go to the grocery with your tank, do like me, just make sure your horn and flashers are working fine. Also to wear your seat beltâŚ Because if cops stop you, they might ask you some weird questions and be suspicious for no reasonâŚ lol"

Well,i live on an Island very few Cops here and they're so dumb they probably wouldn't even question it. lol"
