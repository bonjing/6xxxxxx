The 2nd DVD release from stand-up comediam Tony Law.

Roll up one and all and witness the wonder and mystery of Tony Lawâ€™s Brainporium. 

Behold Tonyâ€™s bits on Pirates, the perils of the misappropriation of another cultureâ€™s noise, and of course Gok Wan. 

The show was recorded on the snowiest day of the year in Cardiff. So snowy in fact, that Simon Munnery spent the day stuck on the M40, and didnâ€™t make it for his recording. This gave Tony the opportunity to perform an unrehearsed and unplanned twenty five minute long second half. Anything could happen!
