You seem to have a bit of a following so I'll keep an eye on your space.
Going to seed this to at least a 2+ ratio."

,g8aso,2011-12-12T00:52Z,"Why use Joint Stereo? the very worst of the 3 MP3 formats, it isn't even actual stereo at all.................
Dual Channel is the only format with 2 separate left and right tracks."
