,FMyLife0,2011-10-31T11:14Z,They should rename it to 'The Boring Dead' because the show has turned into 45min talk about feelings...Season1 was so much better. Hope it well get better once the stupid kid gets well and the gang will move on.

,MarkedArt,2011-10-31T14:58Z,"Great download, took 25 minutes.  And what FmyLife0 said is true, the second episode is even more shit then the first.  They need to step the game up and get it back like the first season."
,fukov,2011-10-31T15:16Z,"FMyLife0 at 2011-10-31 12:32 CET........ I can read just fine asshole. Plenty good enough to know that the 'gang' is still in the same place and the 'kid' is still not well without even bothering to watch this episode all thanks to you douchebag. If you don't like it don't comment but if you do have to just leave it at ""They should rename it The boring dead"". Surely even one with an IQ as low as yours should be able to understand that....."

,shonuffx,2011-10-31T16:11Z,"Thanks for the upload! @fukov: You are funking over nothing! That was hardly a spoiler that you are crying about. Don't you find it pathetic of yourself mouthing off in the web as if you were so tough? Trollish... Anyway, I'm going to watch this show, because I like Zombies, but I wont really be watching it as ""The Walking Dead"". It's rather ""the decent zombi tv show"". It stopped being TWD early on. The comic is yet and still the greatest!   "

,deraco96,2011-10-31T19:24Z,This series is so f***ing awesome. I think its great that it is uploaded so fast. As far as I understood this is on tv in America and I live in Europe so otherwise I would have to wait very long before I can see it. Great work! Can't wait to watch it.
,deraco96,2011-10-31T19:31Z,"wow this downloads really fast. 10 minutes with a normal internet connection (don't know how to name this, no glassfiber)"

,DavieD,2011-11-01T13:24Z,Tyvm! One of my fav shows. :-D
,DJScarlet,2011-11-01T14:03Z,"This show is becoming really tedious. It's the Zombie Apocalypse, yet they spend half the show bleating on and on about deer.... also the mother of the boy who got shot is cross-eyed... they should feed her to the zombies and get some good looking women on instead."
,bigbengy6,2011-11-01T15:14Z,"i want to see some fuckin death not crying coz some one has fucked off. where's the zombies tearing out gut's gone? i have to ask my self will this once awsome series, really be worth watching soon??????????????"
,StayWay,2011-11-01T15:20Z,AMC really needs to raise the show's budget.

Now thats bauss! Never have I seen numbers like these in the P2P community."
,shonuffx,2011-11-01T19:00Z,"Fellas, this is not Resident Evil Apocalypse, it's The Walking Dead. It's more about how people survive and change through the circumstances they are confronted with, rather than Zombie-mayhem (it does have that too). The show is supposed to be character dramaesque. Yet, the show is taking a more and more disappointing course...Read the comic book. It's da bomb for real! Guess it is just too hardcore for tv after all...Why did they mess up the characters so badly? Hard to believe Kirkman is approving all that bs.  "

,cldrain,2011-11-01T20:12Z,"This show has really gone down hill.  All logic and commonsense are out of the window. 

What we need is massive killing of the existing cast and bring some new blood into the show.

Also, stop paying 10 years old to write the story and hire some professionals.

,Luna81,2011-11-03T09:47Z,"Its amazing how many people who download movies(free movies), and are suddenly film critics. If you don't like the show..then don't watch it. As far as 10 year olds writing the story, it sounds like some of the people writing comments on here could learn something from the 10 year olds. So stop complaining, and watch something else if you don't like the show."
,VANDERLAND,2011-11-04T00:44Z,need mo' guts
,Alucard_Dalv,2011-11-04T03:23Z,"Between the budget cut drastically and Frank Darabont going ape shit about the budget and the actors paycheck, then getting fired, the show is really suffering. They cut out most of the outdoor shooting because of the cost, so enjoy it now, because the rest of the season will take place in a building. Way to fuck up what was once a great show. They better not fuck up the last season of Breaking Bad, or so help me god."
,Aeronomer,2011-11-04T21:14Z,@shownuffx The comic went the same way. It started off great but then it got to be like a fucking soap opera. Didn't think the show would follow suit so quickly. 
,shittalkerism,2011-11-05T04:50Z,badass episode.  definitely worth download.  cant wait until sunday.  
,Chippopot,2011-11-07T02:30Z,"I think the show will survive, have faith.

BUT I AGREE THEY HAD BETTER NOT TOUCH BREAKING  BAD."
,kick99,2011-11-07T04:45Z,"You hit it right on Alucard_Dalv. Frank Darabont bitching about budget cuts? Serves him right for begin stupid enough to think that making anything for TV was worth while. 20 years ago a ""series"" was about 35 episodes and repeats in summer. Made you almost want for the next school year. now, you get 6 fucking episodes if your lucky and if you cut out the bullshit repeat scenes and commercials maybe 35 minutes of real stuff at that. I lost intrest in TV for the most part after they finished BSG, which died a slow, miserable death. The last season was a waste of electricity. LOL"
,MasterCaptainMorgan,2011-11-07T05:11Z,"I do find it pretty funny that people downloading shows on a pirate site are complaining about how TV shows don't have enough money to make decent programs anymore.  Oh, the irony."
,shinobiung,2011-11-11T17:43Z,"you know, after a while of getting to know them, you really dont care what happens to these mindless, middle class, white trash hill billies who probably voted for Goerge ""lets go to war"" Israel Bush anyway. I dont know who is more dull, the zombies or these characters."
,1dissident,2011-12-08T03:10Z,"The drama should have been expected.  I mean really... why do you think zombie movies are only 2 hours long?  How many seasons can you expect to get out of showing hordes of zombies killing people, people shooting them in the head etc.  You can only take a premise so far before it loses its effect due to saturation.  I guess the drama was supposed to be a way to break up the action and make it have more impact when it does finally come in.  I'm kinda with you guys though... tone down the soap opera crap and focus on some original story telling.

thanks for the up."
