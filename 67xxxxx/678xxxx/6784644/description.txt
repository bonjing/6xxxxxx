Nightglory, the eagerly awaited new album from Italian cult sound-wizards Kirlian Camera is a mesmerizing experience of epic proportions. Angelo Bergamini and Elena Alice Fossi have fused soundtrack-like, symphonic pomp with electronic arrangements, beats and experiments in ten anthemic compositions. Charismatic singer Fossi intonates the pieces with just the right balance between fragility and powerful pathos to drive the groupâ€™s magnum opus to maximum impact. Nightglory is released as a regular album CD as well as a classy limited edition with a bonus disc which contains dramatic and inspired â€˜chamber music versionsâ€™ of album tracks, as well as two new songs.
