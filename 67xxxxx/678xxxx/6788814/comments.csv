,Pellesam,2011-11-02T15:19Z,"I have 1.9, but i have not updated to the lastet dashboard. Is it safe to update and play online with 1.9?"
,CeeJayII,2011-11-02T16:51Z,"This game is XGD3 not XGD2, FYI. I'm 100% positive of this. Either way, thanks Boobsman."
[V],boobsman,2011-11-02T18:22Z,"@ noalcoholjuzsoda, why do you bother making up BS??? It clearly a scene release and good files, with plenty of great comments, take your lies elsewhere!!!"
[V],boobsman,2011-11-02T18:24Z,"@ CeeJayII, this game is XGD2, check the abgx database as its now been updated to show XGD2 / XGD3 games:

,mattron89622,2011-11-03T01:06Z,Burned with img burn as xgd3 and works great. I was very skeptical about this torrent but now I know not to doubt the boobsman! Great upload all respect to the original ripper!
,garlic2n8t,2011-11-03T02:05Z,I think people really need to fully test there game before the upload the copy. Doesn't seem to work and I feel I wasted all this time waiting to complete.
[V],boobsman,2011-11-03T09:40Z,"@ garlic2n8t, this game was tested before it was posted however it may be an XGD3 game as i wasn't really paying attention, the game works and is not a fake! If its not working for you do you have LT2.0???"
,adamakajohn,2011-11-03T18:07Z,"hi i have tryed to burn to disc 3 times with ImgBurn

Checks out fine with agbx. Problems occur while burning. Never had this problem before. I've just  burnt a couple of other xbox games after my first 'lord of the rings war in the north' burn failure. Those recent burnt games work perfectly. img burn displays-
