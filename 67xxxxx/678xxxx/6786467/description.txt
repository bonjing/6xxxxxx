The TI-8X series of calculators work great as standalone calculators, showing 8 lines of history, using standard mathematical notation. Each model was designed with more specific purposes in mind:

The TI-82 is designed for algebra and trigonometry. Graph and compare functions, perform variable substitution, and solve single variable equations.

The TI-83 is designed for statistics and trigonometry. Graph and compare functions, and perform data plotting and analysis.

The TI-85 is great for engineering and computer science. Graph and compare functions, perform bit manipulation and convert between numeric bases.

The TI-86 is great for engineering and calculus. Graph and compare functions, perform bit manipulation and convert between numeric bases. Solve differential equations, plot vector fields.

All models allow you to write programs in TI-BASIC and perform basic scientific calculator operations.
