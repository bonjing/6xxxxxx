Hijri Calendar Software is an MS Windows based program that shows both Hijri and Gregorian (english) dates.  It also computes Qibla direction and sunrise/zuhr/sunset timings for a user defined location.  It can track and display user defined events (birthdays, anniversaries etc.) based on Gregorian or Hijri dates.  It comes with a predefined events list that includes major religious and public holidays and Urus Mubarak.
