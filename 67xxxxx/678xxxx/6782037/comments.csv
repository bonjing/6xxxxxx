,vikynair,2011-10-30T04:45Z,"watchable, audio is excellent keep up the good work mate cheers "
,touchwoodblues,2011-10-30T05:53Z,"Sorry ~ It is watchable yes, and dark in the dark places, BUT THE AUDIO IS SHITE and background music overwhelms the wordage. Vikynair is incorrect."
,michaelrwatson,2011-10-30T06:54Z,"No .MKV files please, you stupid wankers. Use MP4 instead, or better yet, XVID AVI. Thanks. "
,touchwoodblues,2011-10-30T07:34Z,"PS ... Just watched all of it and it goes play better on the PC, but when you burn to a disk it screws up the sound, and YES no more .MKV files, altho they can be converted with 'ConvertX to DVD 4' 
( found on TPB ) easily BUT THE SOUND IS STILL SHITE ... Sorry :\ "
,bramvnl,2011-10-30T13:37Z,no .mkv pleas
,vikynair,2011-11-01T08:17Z,"sorry my bad the audio has a few glitches in between, but definitely watchable"
