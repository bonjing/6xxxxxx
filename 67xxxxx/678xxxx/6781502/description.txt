This is a hard to find 2 disc set of The Beach Boys in the recording studio tracking songs like Help Me Rhonda and Dance Dance Dance. The Wrecking Crew were the session musicians on a lot of these tracks and Glen Campbell can be heard making suggestions or asking questions between takes. Also includes a drunken Murry Wilson in the studio while they are tracking Help Me Rhonda. No RAR. Enjoy.
