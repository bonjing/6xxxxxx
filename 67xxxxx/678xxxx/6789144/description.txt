                Featuring an ensemble cast of brilliant new talent,
                Top Boy is Ronan Bennett's thrilling new four-part
                drama about young people living on the edge and, for
                the most part, out of sight in east London today. In
                tonight's second episode, Dushane and his partner
                Sully find themselves hugely in debt to Raikes and
                under increasing pressure to retrieve their stash
                from Kamale. Elsewhere, the terrifying consequences
                of Dushane's ambitions begin to spill into the lives
                of his family. Lisa is still in hospital but showing
                signs of improvement. She is allowed a day release,
                and pins all her hopes on a reunion with her son
                Ra'Nell. Unbeknown both to her and Ra'Nell's guardian
                angel Leon, he has been recruited by Heather to help
                run her secret project.That same night, in
                desperation, Dushane and Sully formulate a kidnap
                plot to lure Kamale, their main rival in the London
                Fields Mandem, into the open. But things don't go to
                plan and the results are fatal.
