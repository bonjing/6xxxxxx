Mon 3rd January 1994 - Sator began working on the BBQ-killers album at Music-A-Matic studio with Jim Brumby engineering. During that time the band also squeezed in a show in Stockholm trying out the new material.

Mon 17th - The mixing of the album started this day and would be completed the following Sunday.
Thurs 27th - The album was mastered and sent to the pressing plant. A quick one this time!
Sun 30th - A low-budget video was made for Black 'n' White.
Mon 31st - The No Solution video was shot, but later it would be withdrawn. It was only shown once on a Swedish TV-show. Both videos were directed by Michael Katzeff.
