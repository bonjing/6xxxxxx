 Something terrifying and strange has occurred - outstanding even among horrors faced every day by John Constantine. Intelligence specialists have discovered elements of the Iraqi insurgency may be demonically possessed. No one in the intelligence agencies is qualified to handle this problem, and that means a private contractor must be employed. Databases identify only one potential candidate: John Constantine. Constantine is taken from the comfort of his London home to the brutal climates of Iraq due to military coercion, but also because of his interest in a mysterious, beautiful Iraqi agent whose true allegiances are kept in shadow.
