,oldpico,2011-11-02T05:34Z,why is no one seeding this magnificent torrent?
,wormsers,2011-11-02T07:16Z,please please 
,redtar,2011-11-02T08:46Z,Seed please.  The anticipation is killing me!
,idxcue,2011-11-02T11:10Z,Why the fuck isn't anyone seeding? moochers!
,curlykale,2011-11-02T11:37Z,"BRRRRRRRRRILLIANT!!!! Thank you VERY much for this, will seed........."
,Dusty353x,2011-11-03T00:41Z,Ya doofuses! Song For Children is a repeat of Wonderful. Look (Song for Children) is missing entirely. Why the hell are you all satisfied with this torrent?
,Dusty353x,2011-11-03T00:42Z,Many things are mislabeled too.
,oldpico,2011-11-03T03:17Z,"All the songs are there, but Wonderful and Song For Children are copies, and then all the files are one song ahead until the last song of the second disc. Unorganized but still fantastic"
,SloopJohnB23,2011-11-03T14:16Z,"Not only are most of the songs mislabed, some don't even play all the way through. The effort is appreciated, but can someone please throw up a working torrent? (and while your at it, make it the 5 disc version)."
,Twiztid.Asshole,2011-11-03T17:41Z,This is also not the official version as some of the songs are not what is on the actual SMiLE Sessions cd set.
,Cruzman3608,2011-11-04T04:31Z,"Indeed, wonderful was duplicated, and everything after is mislabeled."
