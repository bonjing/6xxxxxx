Many years ago I said that, â€œMusic is Godâ€™s voice.â€ Iâ€™ve often felt that I was on a musical mission, to spread the gospel of love through records. Probably nothing Iâ€™ve ever done has topped the music I made with Van Dyke Parks, my old crew in the studio and the voices of my youth-me and the Beach Boys.
So, even though Iâ€™m smiling through the tears, knowing that Carl and Dennis arenâ€™t here to share this moment, I am smiling. And I hope this music makes you smile too. Thatâ€™s why I wrote it all those years ago. Brian Wilson
