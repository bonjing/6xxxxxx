This is a release/upload date. And you are very smart because exactly same thing is written in the top of this page.

> if you damn make albums set new music in it what is made in year 2011
If me (or anyone else of us) make,as you say, ""album"", first of all I choose good music. And why? Because any fucker like you (or not like you) can light-mindedly download some tons of new music and make his own new megarelease twice a day (not even bothering to listen to it). This is why.

In total: you don't like this music because it's too bad and too old for you.
- You heard it before. Somebody still doesn't.
- Have you seen tracklist?
- Why did you download it?"
