V1.5 update:

- Removed dependency on external file manager. Unrar Pro now has its own file picker so you donâ€™t need Astro or any other file manager to choose a file. Most of the file managers have made changes recently that make them incompatible with Unrar Pro.
- The new file picker will only display 3 types of files: *.rar, *.r00, and *.001. Please email me if you have any trouble with the new file picker or if you need it to show other types of files for some reason.
