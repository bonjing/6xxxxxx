Praise be Allah, Who has adorned the aspect of man by granting him good stature and proportion, Safeguarding him from increase and decline in his aspect and measurements, We ask for His forgiveness and guidance, We seek refuge from the evils, which are in ourselves and the wicked in our actions, And may the blessings and salutations be invoked upon Muhammad, His Prophet


Prayers Gadget is a sidebar gadget that displays Islamic prayer times,  Qibla direction, Hijri calendar, and special Islamic events. Azan sound  is played at each prayer time along with a customizable reminder before  Azan.

The Gadget has an offline database of 2,000+ cities worldwide, and if an  Internet connection is available at install time, the Gadget can  automatically detect the user's location using a larger database of  290,000+ cities worldwide.

The prayer time calculator is highly configurable allowing for multiple  calculation and fine tuning methods. The Gadget can also read a prepared  prayer timetable from a CSV file. In addition, the prayer times are  displayed in different views to suite everybody's taste: docked and  undocked mode. The calendar can be switched between Hijri and Gregorian  modes.
