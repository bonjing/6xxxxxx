Like most ducks, Quax loves swimming. But today an unruly gang of beaver baddies insists on building their dams upstream, reducing his favorite swimming pond to a mere puddle. Determined to swim again, Quax has constructed a dam-busting catapult to smash the beaver dams and restore his peaceful pond, but he needs your word-building skills to help him battle the beavers. Click letters to form words and give Quax the ammo he needs to demolish the dams. Featuring stunning artwork, hilarious characters, unique power-ups, and more, Dam Beavers is a blast of word game fun!
