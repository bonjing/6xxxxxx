,black_shadow_1981,2011-10-30T15:45Z,same as the Wii game but in HD? i only ask because Ive finished it on the Wii and don't think i would get around to playing it again on the Xbox just for HD  but if there's new levels etc then i will give it a try
,SteelerJ17,2011-10-30T16:13Z,Your the King of all kings Boobsman!!!! Will you have Lord of the Rings: War in the North soon?

[V],boobsman,2011-10-30T17:41Z,"@ BatDinger, both this and Sonic are XGD3, it says that first line of the description!"
,amesy,2011-10-30T20:00Z,"always enjoyed 007 games,so i will download and SEED.

,steelllynx,2011-10-30T22:51Z,LT+ 2.0 is not for use on consoles??
[V],boobsman,2011-10-30T23:45Z,"@ steelllynx LT+2.0 is the latest firmware that allows you to play XGD3 games, you need to have that installed in your drive before these games will work."
,DarthPawn,2011-10-31T01:23Z,"If you played Goldeneye on N64 way back, this is going to be a awesome childhood memory relived. I'm so glad I downloaded this! Game works perfect, thanks to uploader! Will seed till it breeds."
,BatDinger,2011-10-31T02:42Z,"oops, missed that. thanks boobface"
,black_shadow_1981,2011-10-31T03:07Z," LT+2.0 isn't installed onto the HDD its flashed to your Xbox DVD drive, you need LT+2.0 flashed too be able to play the new breed of games as well as the newest dash update, most games run smoother once they are installed to your HDD also it cuts down on ware to your Xbox DVD drives laser so its better all round to install backup games  

thanks for the upload boobs-man keep up the good work

 not long now and us lucky people running 2.0 will have our dirty little stealing hands on saints row 3 for FREE! gotta love hackers and rippers "
,Powerslave0,2011-10-31T03:35Z,"Will never work on Hitachi drives under 78 firmware. There is no LT 2.0 planned to be made for any of them.  If you have a Hitachi < 78, then you will need a new Xbox with a newer drive to be flashed.

OR, you will need to buy xKey or Wasabi to play the ISO itself.  You only need your KEY.BIN for Wasabi.  You need your firmware with key in it for the xKey.   They allow you to play ISOs from an external drive.  WASABI has a eSATA port, for optimal speed, the xKey does not."
,enigma717,2011-10-31T08:36Z,"is this RF?
THANKS"
[V],boobsman,2011-10-31T10:22Z,"@ enigma717, yes it region free."
,Doddy2279,2011-10-31T11:10Z,"why is it every time i try to download something from this user it always comes up with ""error corrupted torrent"" ??????"
[V],boobsman,2011-10-31T11:39Z,"@ Doddy2279, what torrent client are you using???"
,celticfcps,2011-10-31T14:10Z,"hey boobsman, great work. downloaded a few of ur titles now all working great. what i want to know though is why they all seem to take so long to download? i have a max download rate of 750kb/s i know this is very low as a standard but i get that rate most times but with game torrents its usually 20-70kb/s?? any help?"
[V],boobsman,2011-10-31T15:22Z,"@ celticfcps, all my torrents are on a seed box but since i only do xbox360 games all the uploads are large (6 - 16GB). I also upload on many sites which means a higher load which slows the speed down for everyone. It wouldn't be so bad if people seeded what they take but too many hit and run!!!"
,Doddy2279,2011-10-31T16:01Z,@boobsman.. I use Miro 
,Doddy2279,2011-10-31T16:03Z,@boobsman.. I use Miro it seems to be the best for me as Utorrent id stupidly slow
,Doddy2279,2011-10-31T16:13Z,Im not saying you torrents are dodgy or anything far from it i would like nothing better to download and seed as your work in getting the latest releases is much appreciated 
[V],boobsman,2011-10-31T16:21Z,"@ Doddy2279, you should try another client, bittorrent, vuze, or like you say utorrent. Surely downloading slow is better than not downloading at all!!! Try utorrent, then go to youtube to find out the correct settings to speed it up."
,celticfcps,2011-10-31T17:53Z,"No problem thanks a lot for the quick reply. big fan of ur work :D just gona have to grin and bear it :|

My xbox is configured with LT2.0 and the latest dash. im using a samsung write master to rip back ups. ive burned a few games now XGD3 and XGD2 do u know if the samsung will be incapable of ripping efficiently?"
,celticfcps,2011-10-31T19:34Z,"Thank you boobsman, ive watched how to configure utorrent 3.0 on youtube. my downloads are working fine now :D it means i can only upload at 10kb/s but when im done d/l il uncap upload rate. thank you again"
,DragenWulf,2011-10-31T20:59Z,i honestly wouldnt bother wasting a disc on this game...activision released this last year i think its just a minor update...i played it for ten mins and will probaly never play again lol 
,n808,2011-11-01T04:06Z,"Remember to add s-ger.dvd file with this:
LayerBreak=2133520
s-ger.iso
for a proper MAX XGD3 burn with a Burner MAX firmware iHAS Lite-On drive."
,FucHollywood,2011-11-01T06:22Z,@Who ever puts MW3 this week im crowning king of the bay!
,1981heaven,2011-11-01T07:30Z,very slow speed?
,b10wme,2011-11-01T13:30Z,"i fucking comleted this already, i thought the game would rock but it dont, the enemy suck lol you can stand there taking hits forever i dont remember the n64 version being this bad"
,celticfcps,2011-11-02T00:29Z,"Ok, advice would be appreciated. ive ripped a variety of both XGD2 and XGD3 games on to disc. ive played them on my xbox flashed with LT 2.0 and with no problem. Recently heard about ABGX and the procedure of installing a stealth patch on to XGD2 files. am i at risk if i havent already. ive been straight up downloading/ripping and playing with no steps in between. Any ADVICE would be appreciated. 

also email if possible: paul.sanderson@live.co.uk"
[V],boobsman,2011-11-03T10:53Z,"@ celticfcps, abgx is used for patching XGD2 games so you can play them online. If your going to use xbox live you should download and install abgx360 and all the video waves then run the iso through the program before you burn to disc. If you don't use xbox live abgx is also useful for checking the iso for crc faults before you burn so that you don't waste discs. XGD3 games that have been ripped with the 0800 firmware do not require abgx patching as they are exact copies and do not need to be patched."
,mikethegreat4,2011-11-03T13:37Z,Where's the dvd file?
,hasibneda,2011-11-05T20:48Z,can you please upload nba 2k12?
