Really this movie Sucks.
I was really looking forward to this movie but now that ive seen it its just a real bummer.
movie is made with an Old camera so not what we are use to ... but the storyline is rather exciting but thats it"
,Bfw40,2011-11-03T00:56Z,Thanks for the upload subha1561
,AgentClaret,2011-11-03T01:48Z,"Great version!

I must be the only person in the world who liked this movie. I guess it's 'cuz I'm into Apollo stuff, but whatever, I thought it was cool."

No idea why people bother with these.... theres a small sample vid which can advise you to the quality. and noone gives a fuck what you think of the film. IMDB has a ratings system for a reason guyyyyzzzzz"
,Sharak23,2011-11-03T10:25Z,Is this like actual footage from a space mission or is it like blair witch garbage where they pretend its real. 
,Jack0ff,2011-11-03T15:55Z,kept thinking this movie was gonna get good at any moment but instead it slowly got worse :(
,Smuggles,2011-11-03T20:14Z,"@sharak, you're an idiot."
,fuckincrazyness,2011-11-04T02:20Z,"yeah they're trying to mix up apollo 13, blair witch project and paranormal activity into a space movie.  V-10, A-10, M-2.  wow so boring and dumb. there is no character devolopment, the plot is weak, and they're trying to say its based on true events, bogus, dont waste your time people"
,SerSpec-V,2011-11-04T03:16Z,"A/V is a 9, the movie is a 3. Pure low budget crap, don't waste your time."
,chrismichaeld1,2011-11-04T05:30Z,"@Everyone who gave us their opinion of the movie.

LOOK AT THE TOP OF THIS GODDAMN PAGE.

DOES IT SAY IMDB???

NO??

DOES IT SAY ROTTEN TOMATOES?

NO??

NOONE GIVES A FUCK WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE MOVIE. STICK TO AUDIO/VIDEO.. 

AND FUCK YOU I WATCHED THIS AND LIKE IT.

RATING A MOVIE IS JUST AS DOUCHEY AS GIVING THE ENDING OF THE MOVIE IN A COMMENT. THEY ARE BOTH FUCKING SPOILERS DICKWEEDS."
,luc13,2011-11-04T06:51Z,^ I have to agree. Personal taste for film is a...personal thing. Save it. Rate the quality - that's what we're all looking for in the end.
[V],Scrufuss,2011-11-04T08:58Z,I applaud the last 2 posters

Kinda like a review there.

How about sticking to A/V huh?"
,ffsdik,2011-11-04T12:44Z,"If it hasnt got transforming robots, loud noises, non-coherent plot, and wall to wall cgi, then these mongs are just not interested!!!!!! 

'errrrrr its really slow and nothing happens'- it's called plot and suspense pricks!!! Grow up and take your optimus prime/twilight posters off the wall and maybe you'll realise this !!!!"
,Bad_Bits,2011-11-04T22:55Z,"@chrismichael1
 You go on a rant saying that no-one must give their opinions on the movie and should just stick to A/V - then, u go on to say what u thought of the movie and say nothing at all about the A/V quality...... Hypocrite much?

M: I seriously could only get 45mins into this film before I turned it off from boredom.

If you want to watch a real and very entertaining Apollo mission that has gone wrong with loss of all hope of return look up the Apollo 13 documentary on youtube (the discovery one with 5 parts) :] "
,arildus,2011-11-05T11:51Z,This movie is pure crap

Movie: Low budget sci-fi horror. Emphasis on the 'low budget'. Interesting idea, spoiled by piss-poor 'special' effects, weak script and 3rd rate acting from Lloyd Owen. "
,shayaan02,2011-11-07T14:10Z,Super flop but excellent quality thanks subha1561
,hopedeny,2011-11-12T06:58Z,actually a decent movie as far as these faux documentaries go.

Stick to quality and safety "
,ecobit,2012-01-02T15:25Z,"AV ? very nice.  sound out of sync a little but you forget it fast as there is so much ""action"".  this is brilliant work so it is hard to believe the rotten tomatos ... we are all spoiled ... it must be.  this is A raw and original  docudrama - not Hollywood - if you want that watch will smith.  if you are an Apollo fan ? this is a gem.  THANKS."
