Using simple, straightforward language, this text addresses how a successful construction project is managed and administered from design through construction to closeout. With the goal of uniting the key stakeholders (contractors, architects, engineers, etc) and providing them with a workable system for operating as an effective construction team, Construction Project Administration reflects the latest technology, laws and regulations. Topics pertinent to each stage of a project are introduced and discussed as they occur throughout the life of the project. Numerous real-world examples are included.

 

This edition includes coverage of BIM, the introduction of the 2004 version of CSI Masterformatâ„¢ and a complete chapter on electronic project administration. By tracing a construction project from start to finish, Construction Project Administration offers a single source of information for all in the construction industry.
