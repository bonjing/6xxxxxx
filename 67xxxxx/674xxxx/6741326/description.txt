Please reseed!!  This is too large a file for me to keep on my very old, very slow computer indefinitely.

Either burn the folders to a DVD or navigate your video player to the VideoTS folder to play on your PC.  This is captured from an old VHS player so the quality is certainly not optimal, but the play is still great.  Enjoy!
