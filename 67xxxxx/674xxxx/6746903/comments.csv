Ran into this, which is completely wonderful all by itself. To find out who this guy is, check http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12522848 where you will learn that he is ""the man now credited with the strategy behind the toppling of the Egyptian government.
Gene Sharp is the world's foremost expert on non-violent revolution. His work has been translated into more than 30 languages, his books slipped across borders and hidden from secret policemen all over the world.""

Saul Alinsky for a new generation! As they say in Manhattan, ""You cannot evict an idea whose time has come."" Occupy the planet!"

I plan to convert it to an avi and upload it.  There is supposed to be a longer feature sometime in the near future.  When it is aired, the torrent for it will follow shortly."
