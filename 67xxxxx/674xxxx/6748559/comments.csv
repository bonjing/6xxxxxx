,googlybug,2011-11-07T15:25Z,"I'm sure most of you have already sussed it out, but if there is anybody waiting for w.e.o to upload EE it isn't going to happen on TPB. Belgium has apparently banned TPB and now EE uploads to this site can be found here: http://thepiratebay.org/user/tri895/

P.S. The upload originates from the same, very generous and appreciated, source from w.e.o"
,merton69,2012-01-01T20:03Z,"FTA of w.e.o.

Hello I am desperately trying to find an old EE episode aired on Thursday October 11th 2001.

It has a song being played in the Vic that I heard on my honeymoon and that was the only time I have heard it again."
,w.e.o,2012-02-03T09:54Z,"got now access to the TPB (temporary)
usually I can not access the website because it is blocked in my country.
this time my account is not hacked :-) or I have not done anything wrong this time. ;-)

Tri895 has joint the weo-team and is doing a very good job to help upload it here on this website.
So you can see my torrents from his account.

Thanks for your comments and seeding. I really appreciate them.
