On Friday's Mark Levin Show: President Obama is now sending some military troops over to Uganda, and for what reason? He hasn't gone to Congress to ask for the authority to do so, yet he is doing it any way. We are told that the troops are supposed to aid and help fight against the rebels, but Obama is determining this on his own.
