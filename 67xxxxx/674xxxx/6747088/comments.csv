,zoeber,2011-11-02T04:17Z,Is there a reason why I only have audio without any video???? 
,Porkka666,2011-11-03T00:48Z,"Oh man, this movie is so fake. What world are these people living in ? Seems just like an excuse for product placement.

The production values and quality of video is good, but after 35 minutes I gave up on this spiritless piece of crap."
