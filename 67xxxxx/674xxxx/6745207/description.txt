The Complete New Doctor Who Contents Summary:

Welcome to "The Complete New Doctor Who" as torrented, fixed up, rearranged, and re-created by yours truly.
Within these folders you will find the many wonderful episodes of the NewWHO series as well as a special beginning surprise.

Few who begin watching NewWHO take the time to view "Doctor Who: The Movie" beforehand.
However, here I give you the opportunity to do so, as shared by other torrent providers.

The contents of this folder are as follows:
The Eighth Doctor --&gt; "Doctor Who: The Movie"
Series 1 - The Ninth Doctor (Eccleston)
Series 2 - The Tenth Doctor (Tennant)
Series 3 - The Tenth Doctor (Tennant)
Series 4 - The Tenth Doctor (Tennant)
Series 4.5 - The Tenth Doctor (Tennant's final episodes)
Series 5 - The Eleventh Doctor (Smith)
Series 6 - The Eleventh Doctor (Smith)

As well as the aforementioned episodes and movie, this torrent also includes two mini-episodes.
These episodes are approximately three minutes a piece, and due to their continuity are kept in a single file.

A file containing actor and director commentary, with previews to Series 6 may be torrented elsewhere, as well.
However, since Series 6 is included here, I did not feel that was necessary.

As a final note, I will say that I recommend the media player VLC for this folder and its contents.
VLC is a lesser-known player that has the capability to play around 99% of all media -- the remaining 1% being three-dimensional material.
As there are multiple file types in this torrent, I highly recommend VLC. 
Windows Media Player WILL NOT WORK for most of these.

I hope to create new torrents as the new series are released, and I hope you'll look for them in the future!
I hope you enjoy these as much as I have and will continue to enjoy them!

For Whovians who've seen the older series, a warning: This is NOT your parents' WHO. :)

Enjoy~
