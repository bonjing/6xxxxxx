UnviolentPeaceMaker's TPB uploads to be banned?
That would be a relief! It would stop him cluttering up the audiobooks section with this robot drivel.

Or, how about he gets his own category ""Robot Books""

Any chance he can take his Swedish mates with him?"

Commercial harvest of an unsustainable resource and environmentalism are mutually exclusive.

Wrong. Responsible shrimping is sustainable. With turtle excluder (TEDs) devices in the proper areas, it can be responsible as well.  Farmed shrimp are far worse environmentally, destroying and polluting square miles of estuaries, the nurseries of the oceans.

Overfishing, breaking quotas and violating restrictions on allowed shrimping zones is a separate issue, and many shrimpers are as guilty as anyone of that. Not all are responsible for the industrial shrimping that goes on and not all support the political corruption that winks at the excesses of factory fishing, including srimping. 

Responsible commercial shrimping and environmentalism are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Greed is the determining factor."
