,dumas1000,2011-10-15T18:54Z,"This game is sorta fun. However, if you just locate the original, probably by Extremezone, you'll likely get a consistently faster download. The thing about those Extremezone files, in the beginning they are bogged down by too many leechers and give low speeds to most people. Given enough time, however, they will start to produce lightning fast speeds for everybody."

I have the ALI213 from long ago it never crashed finished it many times bought all the weapons!

GEZZZ! the DLC will not work on the ALI213 version"
,Banzay27,2011-12-09T19:21Z,"Good torrent, and good game, it's fun enough, even if nothing like the original. Story's weak, but cutscenes aren't all bad.
I'm actually really going for a 2nd playthrough, a New Game+ as it were, just for the wonky extras.

There's a DLC? Gotta look it up."
