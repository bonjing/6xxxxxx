,jcoolass,2011-10-21T23:37Z,"If I understand correctly , this torrent needs to be an iso first. Then I can put it on my flash drive? I want to put this OS on a Del notebook for a friend which has no DVD-ROM ... can I upload it from just the stick?"
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-11-03T10:27Z,"don't install it from XP dudes !
you must be on vista or win 7 to prepare your usb key and then install os on it as it needs to pre format your key first,before installing os .
It might not correctly work on xp anyway.
i will try from XP to let you know once i will get time enough for
regards"
,peacemaster,2011-11-09T18:49Z,Can it  be installed on to an external hard drive?
,adm91,2011-11-17T14:31Z,"Is it possible to install Windows 7 Ultimate on a macbook pro running with lion? I tried it with another torrent containing Win7Ultimate. I installed it by partitioning my mac with bootcamp. But when I want to start windows (holding alt-button) my mac restarts always after 5 seconds infinitely. What do I have to do to run windows 7 ultimate on my mac? 
Please reply!! Otherwise very good torrent! Worked 100% with vista."
,Fezziwig,2011-11-22T19:26Z,Lots of .rar-ception and most of the files came out corrupted
,blibberjib,2011-12-01T11:53Z,"This doesn't work properly when I run it on Vista 32bit. In the script it selects a volume but ends up selecting another partition of my main hard drive instead of the flash drive volume. 

When I do the commands in the script manually  and select a disk in diskpart instead of a volume it works. Seems like an error in the script to me."
,blibberjib,2011-12-01T12:00Z,".. and to answer some questions from peeps in here. 

I suspect it should also work with an external hard drive as long as the sector size doesn't get in the way of it.

For some reason this thing is compressed several times. 

1) Unpack the original into the 8 files or whatever they are. (Unpack them, don't go in further or it'll whinge later)

2) Then Unpack those by unpacking the first file, you'll end up with a single file with .z at the end

3) unpack that somewhere else on your hard drive again and you'll be ready to roll, the install script and all the files will be in there.

As mentioned above that script didn't work for me had to do some manual typing, might work for you though"
