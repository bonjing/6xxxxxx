,ygwg,2011-10-20T00:12Z,This is my first comment ever in my life.  I created an account just to reply to some of the more ignorant comments and bashing I have seen from idiotic people.  THIS IS NOT A SPOILER.  This is not a show that will air on TV.  He shared a free clip from a house show.  AND IT ONLY FEATURES DX not the entire show.  What the fuck was he supposed to call it?  You should be thanking him you dumbasses.
,ygwg,2011-10-20T00:18Z,"And yes when I first saw the title.  It was before watching Smackdown and I thought to myself OMG spoiler!!!  But if you just relax and wait and actually watch smackdown before yelling at the guy you would see that.  But poster you should make it clear that it is ""A house show"" because it will upset people especially the way you put Smackdown and the date up there."
