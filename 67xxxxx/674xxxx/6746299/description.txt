Pretty obvious, really, but it only works out as BJH's twelfth album if you ignore the Starline compilation Early Morning Onwards, which was deleted by then, and include live albums and EMI's The Best Of Barclay James Harvest. The title was also appropriate because the band members had been working together for twelve years. At one point, the working title was High, and the sleeve would have been based on Woolly's sunset photograph which eventually adorned his solo album, Maestoso. (bjharvest.co.uk)
