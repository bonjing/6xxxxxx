,HMD3,2011-10-20T20:46Z,"@MOSHPIT  If you want to swipe my torrent at least give me credit for what you got from me, which is everything except the live albums and extras folder."
,M0SHP1T,2011-10-20T23:13Z,"@HMD3 Yes your right I used the audio from 2 of your albums. But you don't own the rights to any of it stop bitching I uploaded this for others to enjoy. Your torrent didn't include I few of the things I have in mine and your torrents weren't put togeather as A Full Discography eather. I also have a video , few remixes , and 2 live albums that I don't see in any of your files.. I guess you don't do it because your a fan. You must do it for the fame or something.... 

Credits to you buddy I hope it makes you feel special."
