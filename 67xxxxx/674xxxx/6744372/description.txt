Mission: Impossible is an American television series which was created and initially produced by Bruce Geller. It chronicled the missions of a team of secret American government agents known as the Impossible Missions Force (IMF). The leader of the team was Jim Phelps, played by Peter Graves, except in the first season, during which the leader was Dan Briggs, played by Steven Hill. A hallmark of the series shows Briggs/Phelps receiving his instructions on a recording that then self-destructs, followed by the iconic theme music composed by Lalo Schifrin.

The series aired on the CBS network from September 1966 to March 1973. It returned to television, as a revival, for two seasons on ABC, from 1988 to 1990 and later inspired a popular series of theatrical motion pictures starring Tom Cruise in the 1990s and 2000s.
