Ten unique programs for fat loss, muscle gain, and strength improvement for beginners and elite lifters.
Want to get more out of your workout and spend less time in the gym? Many guys devote so many hours to lifting weight yet end up with so little to show for it. In many cases, the problem is simple: They arenâ€™t doing exercises based on the movements their bodies were designed to do. Six basic movementsâ€”the squat, deadlift, lunge, push, pull, and twistâ€”use all of the bodyâ€™s major muscles. And, more important, they use those muscles in coordinated action, the way they were designed to work.
