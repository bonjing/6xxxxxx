if you havent already"
,grrhead,2011-10-17T01:27Z,"Thanks for the re-direct on the Red Robin my friend. There seems to be nobody seeding the Batgirl...ugh. Alas, and is there a way to get Robin Specials and initial run 1-183 without such a bulk download, curious if at all possible. Thanks heartily again my friend."
[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-17T02:25Z,"Check both Batgirl torrents - I got mine from Joshua13's torrent (second on listed) - If you're using VUZE you can stop torrent, click arrow to left to open and view contents, then select the files you do not want, right click >set priority>delete. Then Queue torrent again and it will ONLY download the rest. I usually do not upload files that are so big because I have shit for internet and would be super-seeding forever. It will take awhile just because there are a lot of files. I think v1 is around 100 issues - just set it before bed and let it download while you sleep. Also if you are using another torrent program just google how to select which files to download within a torrent"
,grrhead,2011-10-17T08:15Z,"Well that makes alot of sense my friend. I just figured I would find solid files, as opposed to mix and matching but it seems that is the best bet. Thanks for all the help."
