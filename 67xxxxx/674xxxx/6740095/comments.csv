,Uncle_Fuzzy,2011-10-14T18:02Z,Non-violent pathway to peace?  Ptooey!!  That's just stupid.  You should listen to the greatest leaders our sacred nation has ever known; Reagan and GW Bush.  They told everyone with the sense to listen; God is on our side. Peace on our terms is therefore God's will. Anyone who is not with us is against peace.  We must make war on all those who are against peace. What part of that is so difficult to understand?  
,fishcow,2011-10-19T22:26Z,and uncle-fuzzy... you're a fool as well.
