as a poor, underprivileged slum shit like me who fortunately has a slow connection(it's 2.9mbps), it is with undying honour to finish downloading this torrent.

It took me 32 days 19 hours and 15 minutes to download this superfuckingly awesome video (although i haven't seen it yet, i'll rate later) at a horribitchingly average speed of 15-30kbps.

So thanks uploader and i reckon there are only 3 to 12 people who honestly seeded, but.... what the hell thanks to everybody who seeded, i would recommend this torrent to anybody who likes scary shit, especially when its winter."
