,BalisongBrad,2011-10-15T05:37Z,"Thanks EZ for yet another great torrent!

I've got a question. Probably a really stupid question. I'm sure that this is normally common knowledge but I was wondering if eztv stood for Extreme Zone TV? Cause Extreme Zone is always the leader of movie uploads, and EZTV is easily the leader of Television uploads. Plus the obvious, EZ = (E)xtreme (Z)one ?
Sorry if I'm wrong. Both of you are great! Hard to pick a favorite! Could someone educated please fill me in?"
,Scorpwanna,2011-10-15T05:59Z,I've always thought eztv stood for Easy TV. ?

get a life dude.."
,BalisongBrad,2011-10-17T05:08Z,"Nobody ever answered my question...
does EZtv stand for extremezone tv? Or are the two totally unrelated. Like I pointed out, eztv is the king of tv shows, and extremezone is the king of movies. It only makes sense that the two are connected. Someone fill me in?"
,cyberj0be,2011-10-17T13:03Z,"unfortunatly yonker is right some rar needing a code, link provided, must download some bullcrap to get the code and i got spyware warnings off the site wtf"

@cyberj0be
fuck off and die. This is not a rar. You're the same little bitch that's been flooding eztv's comments with bullshit lies. EZTV is a proven and TRUSTED name."
