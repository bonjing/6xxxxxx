,Merwynlee,2011-10-16T03:28Z,what is this for exactly?
,scheister,2011-10-16T06:54Z,"it is a collection of programs and documentation to aid a student in the field of electronics. essentially to turn your computer into a virtual work station for electronics. sound card based oscilloscopes allow you to use your mic input to convert the input frequency to visual reference from 0-44.1khz, obviously you would make your own probes and take into account what your using for resistance to get an accurate measure, and several circuit schematic simulators for testing prior to soldering. it is what ever you make of it, so be creative. you can use the scopes as a spectral analyzer to maximize audio production in a room. it does not compare to professional hardware but its a cheap way to get by without it for a little while. text books covering many fundamental aspect of electronics and a few data sheets for components i happen to be working with at the moment i posted it. enjoy!"
