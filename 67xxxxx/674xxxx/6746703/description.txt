sound card based oscilloscopes, function generators, text books, cheats sheets. everything a student would need to get by. everything from my "electronics apps pack" plus a few data sheets and a pile of text books and some fun inventors books, another oscilloscope and a few more sim programs for circuit design. 
all programs work on windows xp and most work on windows 7.
