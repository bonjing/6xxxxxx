,wwino37,2011-10-16T18:19Z,"Got my hopes up with *complete*, I'm missing issue 91 of the current series. The scanners only got to 92 and 93 recently, but seem to have forgotten about 91 unless I just missed it somehow.  Any help?  Thanks for the upload regardless!"

I just started downloading the torrent, but I don't see 91 in the files either.

You can, however, download it here:

,Lupinite,2012-01-03T04:39Z,The Darkness V3 is missing a huge gap. Or are the crossover's the missing sections?
,Lupinite,2012-01-03T04:43Z,"Nevermind, I just figured it out. You can ignore my earlier comment. I just wish the writers had made it  easier to understand"
