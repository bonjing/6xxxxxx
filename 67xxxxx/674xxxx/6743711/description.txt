Debunking commonly held notions about the rite of passage known as the college experience, this PBS documentary follows 30 students and their teachers along the path of higher education, from admission to graduation, and exposes the disappointment, disorientation and deflation many students feel in both public and private schools. This revealing study also addresses the quality and readiness of Americas future work force.

Notes:

I noticed this wasn\'t available as torrent
so grabbed the best copy I could find
and did what I could.

Ever so slight oos issues for first half hour.
This is a source file problem.
Decided against the cut job.
