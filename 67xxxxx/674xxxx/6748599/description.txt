Information
------------------------------

For over two decades, Tracey Emin's art has shocked the world. Her work explores love, loss and sexuality and draws deeply on her past. Tracey knows she will not have children of her own, so wants to look back and explore her lineage. Tracey knows very little of her maternal line, and is keen to find out more about her East End roots. She discovers that her great grandfather, Henry Hodgkins, had a tough, deprived upbringing which led him first to reform school, and then to prison and the horrors of hard labour. Delving back further, Tracey is shocked and delighted to discover an unconventional heritage which takes her away from the East End - one that she would never have imagined but which makes perfect sense.
