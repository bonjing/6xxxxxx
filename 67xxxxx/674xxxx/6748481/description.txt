The Beach Boys & Paul McCartney - Vega-Tables (1966 Sessions)(2009)(New Improved Dimensional Stereo)(Full HQ Artwork Scans Included)(MP3@320)











"Vegetables" (or "Vega-Tables") is a song written by Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks for the American rock band The Beach Boys. It was released on their 1967 album Smiley Smile with Al Jardine and Brian Wilson on lead vocals.


All versions of the song feature the novel use of vegetable chewing as percussion. During the Smile sessions, Paul McCartney was recorded chewing celery. Al Jardine remembers that "the night before a big tour, I was out in the studio recording the vocal [for 'Vegetables'] when, to my surprise, Paul McCartney walked in and joined Brian at the console. And, briefly, the two most influential musical Geminis in the world had a chance to work together. I remember waiting for long periods of time between takes to get to the next section or verse. Brian [seemed to have] lost track of the session. Paul would come on the talkback and say something like 'Good take, Al.'"

Comments:

Brian Wilson wrote the song "Vegatables" (with Van Dyke Parks) for the famous â€œSMiLEâ€ album, planned for 1967, but due to the cancellation of â€œSMiLEâ€, it was released in a much toned-down form on â€œSmiley Smileâ€ instead, (with Al Jardine and Brian Wilson on lead vocals) with one section cut out and later reused as â€œMama Saysâ€ on the album â€œWild Honeyâ€.

Paul McCartney was in the studio when Brian Wilson was mixing this song, he just walked in and joined Brian at the console. And, briefly, the two most influential musical Geminis in the world had a chance to work together - you can hear him in the background munching on celery (used instead of traditional percussion) and saying something like 'Good take, Al'.

In 1993, the previously unreleased original version of Vegetables was released along with a slew of other â€œSMiLEâ€ material on the â€œGood Vibrationsâ€ box-set. In 2004, the song was included on Brian Wilson's new release of â€œSMiLEâ€. This most recent recording was based on the original version, rather than the minimalist arrangement that appears on Smiley Smile.
