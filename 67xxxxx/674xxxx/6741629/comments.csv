,TokSeven,2011-10-13T19:59Z,Have just installed the third pre- and then decided to look here... :DD
,AzDeRi,2011-10-13T21:38Z,"@TokSeven

I hope the next one is going to be a prerelease :D"
,slitherdmd,2011-10-14T01:30Z,@IcyhaIe I joined the server but I can't build. Please reply back saying why.
,tucker95,2011-10-14T03:21Z,"OK, so I used winrar to extract it to a location.  I then clicked on the install.bat.  There is a minecraft thing on my desktop which I click but it says 

This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect.  Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.

Do I need to have minecraft already on my computer or do I need to move the .minecraft folder included in the .rar file somewhere?"
,iludeiono,2011-10-14T19:37Z,"@slitherdmd I think I saw you on the server last night...  I had the same issue.  It's a server-side thing.  @IcyHaIe will need to stop and restart the server, and that should take care of things, at least, it did when I ran a server locally."
,AzDeRi,2011-10-14T21:14Z,"@tucker95

Obviously the installation is successful. This is most likely caused by unsuccessful installation of either some components (such as Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package etc.) or java."
,tucker95,2011-10-15T00:32Z,Do you need something new for 1.9? Cause I could play 1.8.1 beta.
,isuperman11,2011-10-15T10:02Z,my play offline button is grayed out?? help?
,AzDeRi,2011-10-15T13:03Z,"@tucker95

Nope, its all-in-one."
,AzDeRi,2011-10-15T13:04Z,"@isuperman11

1. Extract files from RAR
2. Run install.bat
3. Run game from your desktop
4. Put in your nickname
5. Leave login fields blank
6. Click play offline"

And i want to know if it's normal thats I get '' Hs_err_pid'' ? it crashed my game every time and all the blocks of dirt ( the one were we walk on) are on fire ?? Oo
,Socrate123,2011-10-18T18:30Z,Thats okay for the white-List
,AzDeRi,2011-10-18T20:05Z,"@Socrate123

I highly suggest reinstalling java. Also check if your windows is 32 or 64 bit to install correct version"
,Socrate123,2011-10-19T14:42Z,My system running is 32 bite and I reinstall java. java(TM) 6 Update 29. I reinstall your Minecraft Prerelease 4 and I can connect for 2 minutes and it crashed

,ytr1488,2011-10-20T04:52Z,"@AzDeRi the server doesn't have a plugins folder, how do i install plugins to it?"
,AzDeRi,2011-10-20T14:54Z,"@ytr1488

Plugins as long as I know, aren't unfortunately supported yet. They will be supported in the stable 1.9 version, not prereleases."
,AzDeRi,2011-10-20T14:54Z,"@Jamiecow

I recommend running installer before trying to play"

,Nickyrder,2011-10-22T17:07Z,"Cant start either the 2048 or 1024 'bat' server files. both have the same error, saying 

""Windows cannot find 'java' make sure you typed the name correctly, or try again.""

im running on W7 and i already updated my java and still it doesnt work."
,DaiyaDarko,2011-10-23T00:44Z,"I'm in the same boat as Nickyrder. I literally did everything correct and my Java is updated. I even restarted my computer, but nothing changed. I just get a black screen after I hit ""play offline."""
,Nickyrder,2011-10-23T01:07Z,"@daiyadarko dude, that isnt my problem, my SP works fine, its the cracked server that wont work on mine, sorry, im on a different boat."
,DaiyaDarko,2011-10-23T03:07Z,"Fffffuuuuuuu-
The issues you listed, I'm having as well. I can't start either file, it can't find Java, I'm running Windows 7, and I've uninstalled/installed it already. Sorry, you just seemed to have the same problem as me from those things."
,Nickyrder,2011-10-23T03:35Z,"my launcher doesnt go black when i play offline, but the cracked server doesnt work."
,cubeguyx,2011-10-23T05:39Z,"works for W7 right click on 'my computer' click on 'Advanced system settings' then 'environment variable...' under 'system variables', find 'path' and click edit and change it to 'c:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre6\bin' or whatever place u have saved the java into."
,Nickyrder,2011-10-23T07:33Z,thx for tht cube. but i cant understand how to start nor join a server.
,Nickyrder,2011-10-23T07:50Z,"for the record though, i got the 1024 batch file working, but i dont understand how to use this to make a server or join one."
,DaiyaDarko,2011-10-23T20:38Z,Thanks cube. I got the two batch files working but I'm still getting a black screen after play online on the launcher.
,AzDeRi,2011-10-23T22:14Z,"""How to make a server?""

To start server, be sure you have java class path installed correctly (thanks cubeguyx). After this just launch another of the bat files inside server folder.

""How to join a server?""

Start game normally, enter your nick in the first dialog. In login screen just leave blank and click 'play offline'. After this go to multiplayer and type in cracked server's ip. If you cannot join server, most likely your or hosting person's ports are not forwarded correctly. It's also suggested to check your firewall settings. More info at portforward dot com.

If you are the host, you can join your own game by connecting to 127.0.0.1."
,SnakeTheFox,2011-10-24T10:04Z,What are the chances of you just throwing one of those more-or-less straight rips into the next release? This buggy batch installation shit is just rife with problems. It wont even properly install minecraft.jar :|
,cubeguyx,2011-10-24T13:04Z,"no problem... but i still can play with my friends....... im still trying to find my problem. if i found any solution, will post here :)"

,NerfXd,2011-10-30T10:56Z,"hm its says something about nonexistend  java environment what should i do ?
cant play it...."
,AzDeRi,2011-10-30T13:54Z,"@NerfXd

install JDK which also includes JRE you are talking about."
,LiinerZz,2011-10-30T18:51Z,"Hey I cant seem to get this to work, I open the folder and click install.bat, it puts minecraft on the desktop. I click on minecraft and it brings up the custom nickname loader. When I type in a nickname and click start, it doesnt start the game, it just keeps opening the custom name loader, and it never opens the game.

Im using windows xp if that helps."
,Kishgal,2011-11-05T23:50Z,"I've set up the server hosting program correctly and made sure that the ports are forwarded correctly. But oddly enough, I still get the error ""Failed to login: Bad login.""
