,daryan_2k9,2011-12-09T20:10Z,No november :/ ?
,indie69,2011-12-14T11:57Z,"NOV/DEC is coming soon. Sorry so late. Internet problems, personal near-tragedy (AGAIN) and just a crazy schedule has made it impossible to do anything until just the last few days.

But it will be double-sized and it's GOOD!"
,indie69,2012-01-05T00:51Z,Nov/Dec exists and is coming soon.
,indie69,2012-03-15T21:57Z,"Turns out getting all of this done in Nov/Dec/Jan was harder to make happen than I assumed.

Working on March now and best of 2011 will follow."
