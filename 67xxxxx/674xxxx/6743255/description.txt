My Perception is the latest release Belgian duo Black Box Revelation. 
These guys play a brand of rock nâ€™ roll that is lifted straight from the 70â€™s. 
But that is not a bad thing by any means! While this type of music has been done 
ad-nauseum over the years, BBR do it well and it sounds better than most.

At times vocalist Jan Paternoster sounds uncannily like Mick Jagger with an incredibly raw, sex-driven energy and delivery that is reminiscent of early era glam bands. As you might imagine, with only two musicians the album\'s production is stripped down and simple. While there may be no bells and whistles herein, this is no way does detracts from the big picture. Raw and rough around the edges, My Perception really stands on its own. Bottom line this is a really enjoyable rock nâ€™ roll record!
