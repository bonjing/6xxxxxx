It's one of those serendipitous moments in life when you stumble upon a work of genius. Such a moment happened to me today as this film found its way onto my screen. I had no expectations, no preconceptions, and no idea what to expect, and I have to say I was utterly blown away.

This is one of those films that could never be simply described. An ultimately dark story of true companionship. Love definitely plays an essential part, but I think ""Love story"" gives the wrong impression. It is the adventure of two children, traveling through America and their childhood alike, dealing with an unfair handful or hurdles and hardships. The direction is impeccable, and allows the gifted young actors to excel to their full potential. Everything in this film is meticulously brilliant, and so refreshingly intelligent. It's unusual these days to find a film that doesn't patronize its audience. It is almost poetic in the way it gives as few words as possible. Some people may find this slow and boring, but these are people who fail to see between the lines, where the true story lies.

A film both heartwarming and heart-wrenching that will sharpen your braincells, moisten your cheeks, and really make you think about yourself and the life you lead.
