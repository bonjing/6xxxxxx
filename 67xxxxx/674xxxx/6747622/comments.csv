Keeping on all the methods for getting peers (picture 2)
Turning off the benefit of utp (picture 3)
and then using the OLD method for turning on utp (picture 4)

tl;dr - pics 2-4 are worthless, pic 1 really screws things up.

Settings by an idiot with NO CLUE about torrent settings.
(ask in the TPB chan, they'll pass you on to me in the utorrent support chan, where I've been doing utorrent support for 5+ years)"

If you have any brains at all, don't bother with it."
