@vaporizebt  not fake m8 sorry your having probs but its real did you download it fully it will extract 5 files the iso the .dvd the box-art the region free proof and the nfo.

if there is corruption in any of the rar files delete the faulty rar pack only example 
{Batman.Arkham.City.0800.RF.XBOX360-XPG.part24 is corrupted} delete then redownload part 24 somtimes you do get bad data but utorrent usualy excludes people with corrupt file info hope this helps people everyone should be enjoying this game."

@babbleM u should be on at least dash 13599 if not flash drive to stock is recomended b4 you update ur dash to the latest 13604 then flash back to lt2.0. im running 13599 and lt2.0 but have herd no probs with new dash 13604 i will update soon waiting to c if were getting new fw first..
@simoxxx84  best advice there is re burn very slow xgd3 requires some burners to write at slower speeds try it and let me know 2.4x would be my suggestion also shove it on your hard drive worth a shot i always do the games run smoother and it extends the life of my laser for all the time it takes to install to hd.
@BatDinger there a problem with your conection your firewall is blocking incoming conections or you have to many torrents on the go and its chokin your connection you should never have 0.0% for any legnth of time unless you have connection probs."

       to ""Calculate Optimal"".

@timmythedl this is like any other torrent its no diffrent use a good port shut down as many other torrent you can also the move you upload the more you will get back remember it could be as simple as restating your torrent client and as of right now there are 408 seeders 2128 leechers and around 50 versions within those leechers so in that respect speed should be good maybe not super fast given the amount of people on it. setup your torrent client properly it makes a big diffrence but nout wrong with this torrent m8."

,rrstyxx,2011-10-20T03:19Z,IM SICK OF PEOPLE DISRESPECTING BOOBMAN!! All his torrents are legit and i have no problems ever with his uploads. Im playing this game connected to live and no banning yet. Game is awesome and I have no problem. Make sure that when you burn with imgburn you set it right for XGD3 its not the same settings as before when you had to change the layer break now it auto.....anyways just google it noobs and stop talking crap about boobsman he knows what he is doing and doesnt produce fakes. I only download his torrents now because i know im not going to get coasters out of it
,Revolver31,2011-10-20T03:23Z,@mrnexus ye its telling you there its r01 thats the problem r01=rar01 or the whole name would be (Batman.Arkham.City.0800.RF.XBOX360-XPG.part01) so delete rar 01 and redownload all rars are numberd the first part of the message you got is telling you i cant extract cause theres a problem the 2nd part of the message is telling you where the problem is i.e complex batmanac.r01:the archive is either in unknown format or damaged= rar01 so now you can fix also you downloaded the complex release not the boobsman release i dont think the complex release works anyway cause everyone is on this release others were having the same probs on complex release but try delete rar 01 and redownload try it a few times if still faulty then you have to download this boobsman release as i know it works.
,pirates4eva,2011-10-20T04:12Z,all of the complex releases of XGD3 games work flawlessly as long as you know how to burn them properly all of my XGD3 games are complex release on lt2.0 with no problems at all on benq and liteon phat.

THANKS VERY MUCH TO: BATMAN: ARKHAM CITY - XPG - XBOX360 - REGION FREE - XGD3 0800 {BOOBSMAN}


10 EASY STEPS TO FOLLOW IN HELPINSTRUCTIONS BELOW:


It workes for me because I have Flashed/Chipped my XBOX 360, and updated with LT+ 2.0! (NOT LT 1.9)
DASHBOARD: 20135990

DOWNLOAD THE 82 FILES OF THIS GAME. THEN EXTRACKTING THE RAR-FILES INTO 1 ISO GAME FILE, AND 1 DVD-TEXT FILE OF THE GAME TO PUT 2GETER IN A FILE AT THE DESKTOP. 


Normaly I Allways Test ALL Xbox 360 games and Verify it to 100% before burning the game with the easy program: ""Abgx360"". 

But now it don't even recognize the imagefile or dvdfile at all? But donÂ´t worry about that - It works 100% anyway. 


INSTRUCTIONS FOR BURNING XGD3 BACKUPS WITH IMGBURN: I recommended that you download and use the latest version of ImgBurn (v 2.5.6.0) downloadable at:
http://www.imgburn.com/index.php?act=download)

Older versions may handle this burningprocess differently and/or give a different set of errors.


1. Click and open the >IMGBURN >HELP >About Imgburn. U now will see if u have the latest Imgburn version: (v 2.5.6.0) Coded by: LIGHTNING UK!

2. >Tools >Settings >Write. In Options itÂ´s allready selected: User Specified, and written 1913760 Change this numbers first to: 2133520 and then select >Calculate Optimal and click OK. 

3.  Click >Write image file to disc

4. After ""Please select a file..."" U click on the yellow map: Browse for a file

5. Hold U Pointer abowe the top smallest dvdfile (37 bytes) and click On it.

6. On top it should now say: \rrod-gow3.dvd

7. Click on ""Write"" at the bottom.

8. Choose and click on: Write until end of disc (Truncate)

9. It will now ask if U would like to burn the game that is 8.7 GB on u 8.5 GB disc.
Click >Yes

It now burns the game for about 35 min. and then says: Operation Successfull! Just click OK, close Imgburn, and take out the disc.

10. Install the finished burnt 7.5 GB game to your Harddrive on U Xbox360 untill 100% is complete. Start the game. The Intro comes, but then it all goes black screen? Turn OFF your xbox360, and start the game from the begining again and then it works PERFECTLY A 100%!!!


THE ONLY WRITEABLE DISC WORKING A 100% IS: ""VERBATIM DVD+R DL 8.5 GB""
THAT U CAN ORDER CHEAPEST DVDPACK OF 10, 25, or 50 DISCS = (1 EUR/DISC + mail price) DIFFERENT SIZEPACKS ON: http://www.sweburn.com/search.php?mode=search&page=1

NOTE: (IF) U HAVE OLD FIRMWARE: WHEN U DOWNLOAD ANY NEW GAMES, N U PUT THE DISC IN, IT WILL ASK IF U WANT 2 UPDATE U XBOX JUST TO START THE GAME? 
AND I PRESSED (YES)... WARNING..!!!! IT WILL MAKE U DOWNGRADE U FLASH/CHIP N U WILL ONLY PLAY ORIGINAL GAMES, 
UNTIL U FLASH/CHIP IT ALL OVER AGAIN WITH NEWEST FIRMWARE. BUT WORKS 100% IF U HAVE LT+2.0!


LETÂ´S KEEP WORKING TOGETHER GAMERS - AND SEEDING, AND PLEASE COMMENT RIGHT WORKING INFO SO WE ALL CAN ENJOY MORE UPCOMING GAMES...

PLEASE UPLOAD: CALL OF DUTY-MODERN WARFARE 3, TOMB RAIDER, SAINTS ROW-THE THIRD.

THANKS A 1000-TIMES AGAIN, AND KEEP UP GOOD WORK: BOOBSMAN

,kjdj65,2011-10-26T22:01Z,drsdre- I got the same problem. I asked for iggeman to post the correct file location. Then once we get the same download we can go down his directions and maybe get a good burn. I have a litescribe with the new flash for XGD3 games and new image burn. So hopefully someone will copy the correct file for us.

i just got LT2.0 and went to try arkham city on it. the game loads but it says straight away that an update for the game is available and it must be made in order to play the game. i dont have the xbox connected to the internet so this update is contained in the disc.

is it safe for me to run this update, or will it screw with the LT2.0 and mess it all and render the console useless to XGD3 games? are these updates, in general, safe to be applied? or i shouldnt do them?

thanks in advance!"

,KingKool,2011-11-28T23:47Z,"C4E released the iXtreme LT+ v2.0 CFW for all versions of the Hitachi-LG GDR-3120L drive (â€˜PHAT Hitachiâ€™):

C4Eâ€™s iXtreme LT+ in association with Team Jungle & Team Xecuter

Official release of the iXtreme LT+ v2.0 for Hitachi drives
- Support for XGD3 ixtreme backups using LT-MAX for maximum capacity on standard DVD+R DL discs.
- Support for large capacity DVD+R DL media (no errors when burning)

About upcoming iXtreme LT+ 3.0 â€“ released after December 6th
Originals will need to be analysed by XBC to gain disc topology data. This data replaces the need for ap25/dae.bin data and enables any ap25 challenge to be answered correctly. The topology data method is very efficient using only 24k and is very accurate. Each title will need its own topology data as there are differences between titles, even xgd3 titles and backups can be detected if the same topology data is used between titles.
Backups will remain the same layout but will need the new topology data inserted by the new abgx or re-dumped with the new XBC for xgd2/ap25 or xgd3 titles.
Non ap25 titles will remain unchanged

Thanks go to Team Jungle for their hard work and efforts in the development process.
Thanks also go to Team Xecuter for their support to this project."
