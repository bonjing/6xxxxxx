,Orob,2011-10-16T17:47Z,What about subtitles for this chinees film ?????????
,drewkrew,2011-10-17T18:35Z,"BONE, as i imagine you already know, the only other release of this has been up'd by extremezone which is chinese audio only, and no english subs are available for it. 
Is this version different, mainly i can see that it says chinese subs are hardcoded on, so can i assume there is an english audio track? 
I don't fully understand the statement: 
Audio: AC3 @ 384 kbps @ Mandarin | English (both partial)

And again, the greatest of respect to you and your TPB u/l efforts."
