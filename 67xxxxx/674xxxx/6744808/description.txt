Encoding:
Encoder Tool - Personal/custom tool
Bitrate - 256 kbps (1000 kbps uncompressed)

Seed, comment, rate, and request!!!

PS: If you want to rate MY torrent down then comment whats wrong with it.  Otherwise troll somewhere else.

PPS: Mods, move this to Audio&gt;Music please and lift the ban on M4A files not being able to be uploaded.  Its REALLY annoying since all iPods support M4A's.
