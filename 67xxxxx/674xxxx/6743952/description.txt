Plot: At forty-something, straight-laced Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) is living the dreamâ€“good job, nice house, great kids and marriage to his high school sweetheart. But when Cal learns that his wife, Emily (Julianne Moore), has cheated on him and wants a divorce, his â€œperfectâ€ life quickly unravels. Worse, in todayâ€™s single world, Cal, who hasnâ€™t dated in decades, stands out as the epitome of un-smooth. Now spending his free evenings sulking alone at a local bar, the hapless Cal is taken on as wingman and protege to handsome, thirtysomething player Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling).
