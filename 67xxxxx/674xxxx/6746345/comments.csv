,gamory,2011-10-16T21:08Z,Having some trouble mounting to drive...any directions? Thanks. 
,zero05,2011-10-22T21:21Z,"It works! Thanks! New effects takes a lot of CPU capacity. In Samplitude 11.05 I am getting problems with realtime monitoring and recording with other words -  occurring errors in recording. It could be Samplitude fault. I am getting to install Cakewalk Sonar 8. Lets see, what will hapen then.
! ! ! IMPORTANT! ! ! There was no crack, I just diconnected internet (for safety reasons) and installed GR5. After that Service Center of GR asks me to register GR5. I choose third registering option (nothing happend) and then closed this window without typing anything. And... it worked. Loaded banks and pressets also. Thank you for uploading! "

Don't bother mounting it, just extract it with Magic ISO (http://www.magiciso.com/download.htm).  After installing, it will ask you to register.  Just close the form, it's not necessary.

Cheers."
,j_slamz,2011-10-28T19:28Z,"i downloaded both magic iso and this torrent but can't seem to understand how to install.  someone said to just extract it with magic but that still leaves me with 30rar files and grip of others labeled somehthing like ""R37, R38, etc""  Any one help?  Thanks!"

,bimpy123,2012-01-05T13:16Z,"Hi, I'm really new to this and having a lot of frustration. Cant seem to get MagicISO to extract. It says the version I have cannot do anything above 300mb? Can some one guide me through this, please?!! This would really help as Ive noticed cubase 5.1 is the same. "
,profsciencephd,2012-01-14T04:18Z,Where should I be extracting this to with magicISO? Is there anything else I need to do to make this work? If anyone can help I'll be very grateful!
,profsciencephd,2012-01-14T17:52Z,"For anyone that's still having trouble, I figured out how to make this work.

1) Extract any of the .rar files (""extract here"" is the easiest).
2) Mount the .cue file to a drive using Magic ISO.
3) Installation should start automatically. Ignore anything about registration, it'll work fine!"
,travelian,2012-01-25T16:36Z,A mac version is seriously NEEDED!!! Please!
,r0bbinh00d,2012-01-28T17:33Z,"Can't you Mac users just run this in a windows emulator?  Or how about this, instead of spending $3k on a macbook you just drop about $500 on a normal laptop that has comparable specs.  Other than the phone and mp3 players Apple is dead."

Avoid this lame and useless torrent."
,demonkratzie,2012-05-15T09:39Z,I saw something about acativate battery 3 on activation panel. What it means? Is it necessary activate all the resources on registration panel to works completely?
