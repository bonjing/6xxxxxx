About the Game
The Acela Express hauls North Americas famous Amtrak high speed rail service between Washington D.C. and New york City. Now available fully-optimized for Train Simulator 2012, the Acela Express is highly detailed and includes all the familiar features of the real thing, including the tilting system which enables the train to take bends at high speed.

The Acela Express is the only train in North America which exceeds the Department of Transportationâ€™s 125mph minimum speed for true high speed rail services. It was designed specifically to operate along the Northeast Corridor serving the bustling cities of Washington D.C, Boston, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York City, and can reach up to 150mph though it is restricted to lower speeds for much of the route. Each Acela Express set comprises two power cars running on 11,000 volts via overhead power cables, plus First and Business Class coaches. The Acela power cars develop 6,000 horsepower and with one at each end of the train, high speeds can be reached and maintained over long distances, with the in-built tilt mechanism allowing bends to be taken at speed without passenger discomfort. The Acela shares some design features with the French TGV, though its passenger cars do not share central bogies like the TGV, and they are heavier due to Federal Rail Administration safety standards.
