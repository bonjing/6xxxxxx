,Opake,2011-10-18T01:21Z,"Is it a rwp package from the zzw1983's upload of does it come from an other source, because the two same scenarios don't want to work with your upload too (I play on a Skidrow update 4 now)."
,RailGamer,2011-10-18T15:09Z,@Opake the reason the first scenario is not working is because you don't have NEC Optimized installed. Once we have this update the express scenario will work. Although i have heard that NEC Optimized is awful! turns North East Corridor into a slide show.
