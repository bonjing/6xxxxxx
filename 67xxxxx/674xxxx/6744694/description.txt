                The Comic Strip team return for a special 50s-style
                'fugitive' film noir spoof. Prime Minister Tony
                Blair, is wanted for murder and on the run. Escaping
                from Number 10 and leaving behind his adoring wife
                Cherie, Tony vows to clear his name no matter what
                the consequences. But on a foggy London night, Tony
                has few friends willing to harbour a wanted man.
                With front pages demanding his capture, Blair has no
                choice but to go on the run, with Inspector Hutton
                and his sidekick hot on his trail. The chase unfolds
                thanks to evidence gleaned from his 'allies'
                Mandelson and Brown, as well as an unlikely
                encounter with Margaret Thatcher. Surely Tony's an
                innocent man, pursued for a crime he didn't commit?
                The cast also includes Harry Enfield as Alastair
                Campbell, Rik Mayall as Professor Predictor, Morgana
                Robinson as Carole Caplin, John Sessions as
                Thatcher's butler and Ross Noble as an 'old Labour'
                tramp.
