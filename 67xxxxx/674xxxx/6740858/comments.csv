,Susquatch,2011-10-13T11:30Z,"Ha. ""ΓΓé¼á"" was supposed to be a cross symbol. Sorry about that."
,hades0505,2011-10-13T21:10Z,"Trusted. No transcode and, aparently full album, thx susquatch!"
,hades0505,2011-10-13T21:16Z,"Meeec, sry, just analyzed helix and 2 or 3 more. Not all the leak, but some of the tracks are transcodes"
,hades0505,2011-10-13T21:23Z,"Verifyed: except for ""Helyx"", ""Civilization"" and ""Audio, video, disco"" tracks the album is a transcode (not even reach de 17 kHz). BTW, newlands is a 128 cbr rip"
,totsuko,2011-10-13T21:25Z,"it was supposed to have the fabulous ""planisphere"" mix as bonus track on retail version...
anyway, 
great album! ohio is amazing!!

,Susquatch,2011-10-14T06:47Z,"Haha. Anytime someone points out any audio defects/inconsistencies/etc. in the leaks I upload, I'm always forced to note that I'm NOT the one who leaks the albums, and that I simply find them and post them here for others to download. Plus, I'm not much of an audio snob to begin with, especially when I'm listening to an album before it's officially released :)

Thanks for pointing that out, though. And Newlands being 128kbps was my mistake - I should have caught that. In my defense, it was around five in the morning when I uploaded this, heh heh."
