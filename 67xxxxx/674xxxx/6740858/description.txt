THIS IS THE FULL ALBUM. I uploaded the title track earlier this year, so I want to clarify that this torrent contains French duo Justice's entire highly-anticipated second LP, Audio, Video, Disco, their follow-up to 2007 debut album, â€ . It contains previously released tracks "Civilization," "Helix," "Canon," "Newlands," and the aforementioned title track. Seed and enjoy!

1. Horsepower (3:39)

5. Canon (3:39)
6. On 'n' On (4:30)
7. Brianvision (3:11)
8. Parade (4:01)
9. Newlands (4:14)
10. Helix (4:31)

NOTE: There's a small audio dip towards the end of the eighth track, "Parade." I'm assuming this is an audio error. It's not a big deal and I don't know if there are any corrected versions of that track available, but I thought I'd let you know.
