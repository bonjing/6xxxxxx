::Plot::
The narrator narrates that long ago (in puppet-style animation) in ancient China, the peacock clan that ruled Gongmen City brought happiness to the land with the creation of fireworks, until their son, Lord Shen (Gary Oldman) harnessed its destructive potential as a weapon with which to rule the entire country. When he learned from the court's goat soothsayer (Michelle Yeoh) that "a warrior of black-and-white" would one day defeat him, Shen had an entire village of pandas killed to avert the prophecy. Shen's parents were horrified at this atrocity and exiled Shen from Gongmen City, who swore revenge.
