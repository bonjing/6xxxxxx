,MetallicaSucks,2011-10-20T12:14Z,"How many greatest hits you need?lol
Smashes,Thrashes & Hits isn't here either.
I knew they weren't here but i called it a discog anyway.I realize DP has a different version of strutter and STH had Let's Put the X in Sex(on box set disc 4)but i never liked either record and they don't exist in my world.How about all those extra live records?????? :)"

""How many Greatest Hits you need""  THAT I agree with.  What's the use if you have the core CDs.

Many thanks."
