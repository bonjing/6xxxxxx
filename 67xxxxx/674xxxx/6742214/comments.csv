,lokado,2011-10-14T00:47Z,thanks :)
,Deadgit,2011-10-14T00:55Z,Thanks for this mate ;)
,Giancarlo1001,2011-10-14T02:27Z,could someone please upload the TS2012 Update for the Northeast Corridor
,airband1,2011-10-14T02:41Z,"Thanks for the download mate, I was going to buy this on Steam but thought i'd try here first and i'm surprised it's here so quickly.

Please remember guys that the Acela Express requires the Northeast Corridor Expansion Pack  to run."
,skull2811,2011-10-14T02:49Z,"Hi, thanks so much for the Acela. but i think it needs the updated Northeast Corridor to work. Hopefully someone uploads it quick. Thanks :)"
,skull2811,2011-10-14T03:09Z,Correction: I mean the scenarios need the updated TS2012 NEC to work. Thanks.
,jontoupin,2011-10-14T04:26Z,Thx M8 looking also for the update to  the NEC
,zzw1983,2011-10-14T04:36Z,"hey guys, i think the update is included in this package. I checked the content folder and usually with a loco addon it only includes the scenarios but this has all the route files. "
,zzw1983,2011-10-14T05:20Z,forgot to thank bayp4amd for this. sorry mate i get you and pendolino confused sometimes. ;)
,zzw1983,2011-10-14T05:41Z,ok i double checked and it doesnt look like this is has the updated NEC. I will keep you posted.
,BigUglyMotha,2011-10-14T05:56Z,Hi Thanks for this but could someone please explain how to install this ? I would be very grateful. 
,samthepup,2011-10-14T06:27Z,Thank you so much for the torrent.
,samthepup,2011-10-14T07:02Z,I'm having trouble installing the addon any tips
,shamus178,2011-10-14T07:14Z,Thanks again buddy your a star!!!
,Giancarlo1001,2011-10-14T07:49Z,Does it work for anyone? It crashes on my computer when the scenery is loading...
,zzw1983,2011-10-14T07:51Z,"To install: Extract the Assets, Content, and Manuals folders to your Railworks folder."
,BigUglyMotha,2011-10-14T08:21Z,"Ok m8, followed your instructions but the scenarios fail to load. I can see them but they refuse to launch. Oh well thnx all the same."
,skull2811,2011-10-14T12:06Z,I believe the scenarios require the latest NEC update. Haven't found it so far.
,zzw1983,2011-10-14T12:15Z,"i got the scenarios running fine without the NEC update except the acela from philly free roam which gives me a invalid consist/broken consist error. Try deleting the blueprint files. If you are getting errors with no coordinates, try going into the scenario editor shuffling the consist around and then saving. That fixed a bunch of broken scenarios for me. I don't know what else to suggest. Again make sure the Assets, Content and Manuals folders are copied to your Railworks directory and not the Acela Express folder."
,skull2811,2011-10-14T14:42Z,"Went to play around with the scenarios and got most of it working. Fixed the phili freeroam too but got a problem with the standard ""Acela Express"" mission. Thanks for the tip."
,Opake,2011-10-14T14:50Z,"Thanks zzw1983 ! But for your next uploads, could you make a rwp package instead of a rar file. Here is the trick to package a rwp with protected assets:

1. Create a ""backup"" folder in the root of your railwork folder
2. Move all the folders (not the files: exe, dll...) of the root (except ""Assets"", ""Content"" and ""Manuals"" into this backup folder
3. Launch TS2012 and create the rwp package with the Packager tab
4. Once done, exit TS2012 and move the content of your ""backup"" folder in to the root of railworks (in their initial location actually)"
,aidy70060,2011-10-14T17:23Z,"Works perfectly fine for me, I just installed the standalone NEC before this (just in case, the one for RW2) then this, and it all works perfectly fine. The route got updated along with the Acela so it's all good. Thanks mate."
,zzw1983,2011-10-14T17:48Z,Thanks all and thanks opake. I wasn't sure on how to properly make the .rwp. I usually don't install addons with the package manager. I extract the files from the .rwps!
,Inoetea,2011-10-14T20:50Z,":) No problem, Zzw... No problem..."
,alanko007,2011-10-14T20:55Z,"Thanks a lot zzw1983, your post is appreciated as always :) I hope you will share the updated NEC route with us soon :)"
,Opake,2011-10-14T21:06Z,"My bad. In step 2, don't move the ""Assets"", ""Content"", ""Manuals AND ""Languages"" folders. "
,zzw1983,2011-10-15T00:06Z,you're welcome guys. I will post anything new I find the minute I get it. The real thanks goes out to the guys at semboyan35.com. Pendolino and bayp4amd in particular!
,SiriusXAim,2011-10-15T13:15Z,"This torrent is crap to me. No .rwp file is still OK but annoying.

But The train just doesn't work. I mean, In every scenarios it says ""failed to load"". The acela appears to be missing...

I've moved all the folders into the Railworks folder, overwrtited when asked...

If it needs the NDC advanced thing, then, I would be glad if someone would tell me where I can download this.

The worst in this is that There will be no other acela torrents, a good one, with the.rwp file etc...."
,zzw1983,2011-10-15T14:03Z,sirius: you don't even know what you're talking about. Understand this: an .rwp file is just a rar file. The only thing it does is make uninstallation/installation easier because it keeps a record of all the files installed in package manager. You think that if this were packaged in an rwp you wouldn't get the same errors? Get real.
,SiriusXAim,2011-10-15T15:03Z,"NO I didn't mean that. I was kinda mad because I had enough of trying to fix the problem...

I'm just reporting that the addon doesnt work on my computer by just installing it. First time it happens to me in Railworks.

I load the scenarios, but the train appears to be missing. Impossible to find it at all, nor to add it manually trough the scenario editor. Like of it contains everything BUT the train."
,Thootjeajax,2011-10-15T15:05Z,"@Sirius 
It's not because it isn't a .rwp file.
If you have a steam version of railworks, most of the pirated add-ons won't work.
Download a pirated version of railworks and play that one, cause the add-ons will work for that one!"
,SiriusXAim,2011-10-15T15:07Z,"No, I was getting mad because I had enough of trying to get this thing working. First time it ever happens on Railworks to me.

To be more precice, The scenario fails to load the train. It starts with an error message that says that the train is missing. When I edit, it, there's no Acela nowhere.

It seems that everything is installed but the train.

Does anybody have this problem up here ????"

,Opake,2011-10-15T15:54Z,"With my SKIDROW version (update 4), the hardest scenario and one of the free roam don't work."
,SiriusXAim,2011-10-15T21:37Z,"So It's steam that blocks the Acela ? Strange, Ieve downloaded a lot of other mods that worked just fine.

And I don't seem to be the only one who finds flaws on this one. Some have scenarios that doesn't work either. I'm just a little more unlucky than the others..."
,Deadgit,2011-10-15T22:07Z,"Most of the stuff ive downloaded like addons, expansions/trains don't work for me they just say failed to load scenario, so don't get moody with it. Just save alot of money and buy the original and the addons :)"
,zzw1983,2011-10-16T01:57Z,"@sirius: The scenarios and the acela seem to be working fine for me barring a free roam scenario, but I don't use steam. If you're on steam should have the NEC update? I don't think it's the fault of this upload. All the files are there. I'm not sure what to tell you guys. Seems like more than a few are having trouble with this. I wish RSC would get their act together and stop rushing out garbage."
,torchajo,2011-10-16T12:47Z,"Actually guys this works perfectly...!!!
All you have to do is Install the NEC Pack from here.
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6640384/RailWorks_-_Northeast_Corridor_Expansion_Pack

Then Extract the ACELA Express from this torrent and paste the AcelaPack01 folder to this path - F:\Games\Railworks 3 Train Simulator 2012 Deluxe\Assets\RSC\

Then in the extracted there will be this path in - Content\Routes\00000030-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\
Just copy and replace the scenario folder in your RW3 installation with the same path and also the route properties.

Then just refresh and open railworks 3 and you can play all the scenario's, free roam etc.."
,SiriusXAim,2011-10-16T14:31Z,"Nope It still doesn't work. NEC is installed, i've installed the addon manually, file by file, by overriting the whole thing, double checked everything, it doesnt work....

Every scenarios fails to load because the train apperas to be missing.

Jesus crap, I've waited for thiis addons since it was announced and It got to be THE torrent that doesn't work
And since it's popular, nibody's gonna release another version of it..."
,torchajo,2011-10-16T16:22Z,"Sirius bro i think u better reinstall Railworks and try again coz jus now i tried in my friends system, he has a pirated and it works fine bro...!!!
Only the Assets and Scenario folder in the Contents has to moved along with the routeproperties.xml"
,apreston,2011-10-16T19:25Z,"the file loads into railworks OK, but only the Power Car works all the passenger cars are there with there relevent files but for some reason they will not load. Even using RW Tools will not let you select the passenger cars to insert."
,zzw1983,2011-10-17T00:19Z,@sirius: RailGamer has just uploaded another one. try that and see if it works. Reinstall your NEC first. 
,zzw1983,2011-10-17T00:21Z,@sirius. can you report here if it ends up working for you. Again I personally am having no problems with this. Maybe it IS a steam issue (which is why i'll NEVER use steam)
,SiriusXAim,2011-10-20T13:57Z,"Well, nope it doesn't work. Fuck THE only one addon I really wanted. So Either I buy it (good karma)

Either I wate like 5 hours or more of my time downloading a pirated version Of Railworks then install it. Taking the rick of loosing the addons I bought.

The trains is shown as installed, but does not appear in game?. it says broken scenario asset. I want to edit it, but the train isn't in the list of rail vehicules."
,zzw1983,2011-10-21T06:49Z,"you won't lose anything if you backup your ASSETS, CONTENT and MANUALS folders. Every thing you add on gets installed to those folders only. Only official patches to the game get installed elsewhere. The problem is on your end."
,JackSpencer,2012-01-13T08:42Z,"Yeah, I cannot get this to run on the Steam Version either. Always showing train cars missing. Tried several version of the Northeast Corridor too..."
