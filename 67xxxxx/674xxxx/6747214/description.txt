This torrent contains both "Lucy in the Sky with Dynamites" a bonus CD included with the games limited edition, and "LSD & Remixes" a later two-disc soundtrack. The first contains extended remixes of songs from the bonus cd, and the second performances by other artists. Including some by the creator of Rez.
