,extensistan,2011-10-14T04:54Z,Is this proper 1080p or just an upscale of this >>> Cars 2 720p BluRay x264-METiS 
,PorlyHung,2011-10-14T20:10Z,"It didn't look up-scaled to me, quality was very good.  

What I don't understand, is why Windows has problems deleting it?  I can delete them in safemode, or via command promt - guess that means its a driver issue.

Thanks uploader"

,Tazadar3,2011-11-19T09:46Z,"If u have probs playing 1080p on vlc it can be ur cpu thats to slow, cant handle all the data that need to be processed. I had this problem myself, tried vlc seeting like upping buffer, use hardware.. then got wmp cinema etc etc.. nothing worked(some better but none would run it without ""lagg"" and /or audio getting out of sync). Via different forums and Q/As i got hold of the classic WMP and it worked, no problems at all!
Someone in a forum mentioned that WMP is one of the few that takes advantage of direcx. And yeah 80% of the time vlc works, its a great player for allmost every video extention out there, but like someone said here, WMP is actually a great player as well, stable and for those with an ""older"" comp it might solve some lagg/flicker/sync problems with the lager/heavier HD and mkv files :) Hope it helps."
,sweetp267,2011-12-03T03:38Z,can anyone explain why I cant get it to play with DTS?  I played it back and all I was getting was 2ch audio instead of surround.  I took the .mkv file and converted it to a proper blu ray using AVS converter and then burned the converted blu ray format to a disc and it played flawlessly but no DTS or any kind of surround.  Any thoughts?
