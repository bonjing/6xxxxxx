Sarah Connor Presents her Fourth Album. Emotionally, She Feels Even More Connected to this One Than to Its Three Predecessors Because this Time She was Able to Bring Much More of Herself Into the Composition and Content. Sarah Opens Up to the Listener in a Very Special Way. The Songs on "Naughty but Nice" Relate Situations and Stories from Throughout of her Life, Describing People who Are Close to Her. "Naughty but Nice" Captivates Through Uptempo Numbers and Intense Passages of Soul; Also, this Time Guitar Riffs Step Further Into the Foreground. All of the Songs Are Enhanced by Sarah's Unique Voice, Giving them a Very Special Edge. 

The album debuted at number one on the German albums chart and was eventually certified Gold for more than 100,000 copies sold within the first two days of its release. Naughty but Nice was the 16th Best-selling album in 2005.
