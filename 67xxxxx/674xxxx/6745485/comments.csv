,banukaknight,2011-10-15T13:42Z,thanks for this sir!
,arun48,2011-10-24T19:06Z,"does this one contain e02
because i couldnot find in thepiratebay.org singly"
,grablife,2011-10-29T12:03Z,4 episodes in 600mb? Quality must be horrible. I'll pass. Even a half decent avi will take 350 mb for 1 tv episode.
,grablife,2011-10-29T13:04Z,"For those considering it, E03 is:

Nominal bit rate                 : 410 Kbps
Width                            : 720 pixels
Height                           : 400 pixels

It's watchable considering the file size."
,jennysaysfu,2011-11-13T00:26Z,@arun48 here's episode 2 http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6813179/Terra.Nova.S01E01-E02.FIX.SWESUB.HDTV.XviD-Martin
,polony69,2012-01-04T07:25Z,Quality is pretty decent for a 608.44 mb file . Only thing is .... where is ep 02 ? Says its 1 to 4 ???  Or am I missing something ?
