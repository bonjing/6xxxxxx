Luv Agnihotri (Ali Zafar) has recently broken-up with his long-time girlfriend, Piyali (Tara Dâ€™Souza). Luv then calls his younger brother, associate director Kush (Imran Khan), and asks him to find him a bride. Kush then sets out on the mission to find his brother's bride. He looks everywhere he can, and is then invited over to a rich government officer, Dilip Dixit's (Kanwaljit Singh) house. There he meets their younger daughter Dimple (Katrina Kaif). Dilip would like Kush to get Dimple married to his brother Luv. Kush agrees, until he finally learns who Dimple is. He remembers her, as the film goes back into a flashback. There, Kush and Dimple first met on their college trips and became friends, until Kush leaves for a film-industry life. Dimple then agrees to marry Luv, and during the wedding preparations, Kush and Dimple suddenly fall in love with each other. They therefore call over Piyali, and make her think Luv still fancies her. After a while, they make Luv and Piyali get married secretly, and they run away. Therefore, with no other choice, their parents get Kush and Dimple married. Though, Kush has one condition, which is later agreed to. At the wedding, it is revealed that the condition was that Luv and Piyali could get freely married infront of everyone.
