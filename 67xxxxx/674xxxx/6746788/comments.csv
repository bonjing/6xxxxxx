You clueless piece of shit. People who know what they're doing with their iDevices need stuff like this (Firmware) to help them restore, Develop Etc.

""This is a waste"" - A waste of fucking what? The internet isn't going to run out of space you know, stupid ass cunt. The only fucking waste around here is you, you're a fucking waste of our Earth's precious resources. Why don't you go die in a lonely hole..?

Fat ass piece of shit.

I just can't get over how homo you are.

Cow shitter."

Oh, I almost forgot...

I was just about to award you the world's 2nd biggest cunt award. Right up until I read this part -

""AND I'm not sure how you got your hands on an initialiser firmware for a NEW device""

""initialiser firmware"" ..? Are you a crackhead? ""initialiser""?? What the fuck is this? Fucking Star-Treck? What a Fucking shit hole.

""a NEW device"" ..? Who gives a shit if it's a new fucking device? The fucking point of the fucking matter is, is that it's a device. The device needs firmware. Hence the fucking reason iOSGuy has uploaded it, for people with fucking devices. Pathetic little fuckwhit.

Mummy never loved you, did she?"
