,numberone123,2011-10-17T10:01Z,Is this upload any good ?
,Sithnian,2011-10-17T14:24Z,"Game seems to work, downloaded SKIDROW's release, added this crack and cracked it with the crack included. Challenge mode is available for selection in single player menu."
,soe8484,2011-10-17T14:36Z,Where do I access the single player DLC content? :-/
,BlackEcho,2011-10-17T14:42Z,There is no singleplayer dlc content. Only challenge mode.
,pa3kjosh,2011-10-17T15:00Z,does this only includes the challenge mode? I really can't see any difference except for that accessible challenge mode...
,pa3kjosh,2011-10-17T15:04Z,"BTW, is this the DLC pack released by Valve for this October 4th?"
,Sithnian,2011-10-17T15:04Z,"I'm sorry, made a mistake in my previous comment. I added the patch and then cracked it, didn't really crack it twice. Also, thanks for the upload."
,BlackEcho,2011-10-17T16:53Z,It includes DLC pack from Valve.DLC contains challenge mode + 9 maps for coop. Maplist is located in portal_2dlc_1 folder. All dlc coop maps are playable with the old method 
,Sithnian,2011-10-17T20:18Z,"Okay, to finish my series of comments, the co-op part works perfectly (the new campaign), just finished it.

Only had to restart once, when my partner's game suddenly decided to exit itself."
,Insomneac,2011-10-18T00:20Z,"This works great thanks.

And it includes all the patches except for the 2 most recent.

Thanks again."
