To play easily and switch among audio tracks and subtitles try VLC or Media Player Classic Home Cinema ;)

In the folder there is a short "valuation" preview, sized about 35 Mb; if you aren't sure about download, take it: may help you to decide if worth

If you want to burn on a DVD9+R and receive an error about insufficient space on disk, you have to enable some option like "finalize DVD" or "write disk at once instead of track at once"
