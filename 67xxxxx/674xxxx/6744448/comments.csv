ABOUT Blue Mountain State
â€œBlue Mountain Stateâ€ follows the on and off-field antics of college football powerhouse, Blue Mountain State. Former NFL running back and veteran actor, Ed Marinaro, stars as no-nonsense Coach Daniels. In season 3, Coach Daniels will have his authority challenged when the boosters force him to hire a hotshot offensive coordinator/head coach-in-waiting. Alex, played by Emmy AwardÂ®-winner Darin Brooks, will have to step up in season 3 from being a fun-loving second-string to the starting QB. The cast also includes Thad, played by Alan Ritchson, the teamâ€™s over-the-top team captain and Sammy, the teamâ€™s mascot, played by Romanski"
