i found the ""airbusnewhud.dll"" in add on module folder, i forgot this folder in my upload maybe this is the problem.
Can send by email i you want and if it's ok you could re-upload all the folders on TBP, if you want."

,Romes121,2011-10-15T21:42Z,"Sorry fellas, but I really am a complete noob (amongst other things!) at this! Where to all the files/folders go before I edit them.....at least, it looks like I need to edit them! Thanks in advance guys for your help and patience!"
,grandfred29,2011-10-16T11:55Z,"@Romes121: 


You should download that:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6744442/FSX_Wilco_Evolution_vol_2_fix

I think Mickyfinny explained how to install these folders."
,Romes121,2011-10-16T23:08Z,"Yeah I did that grandfred28....ant the RIP...and your original upload.....no readme's in any of them! And I can't see for the life of me, any mention of where the files/folders go within any of the posts! If anyone can help then I thank you in advance!"
,grandfred29,2011-10-17T06:28Z,"@Romes121:

feelthere and uninstall.exe in fsx root, all include in gauge folder in gauge fsx folder, all feelthere pic in fsx simobject... airplane  and the fix upload by Mickyfinny in add on modules, create this folder if it doesn't exit in fsx. That's all"
