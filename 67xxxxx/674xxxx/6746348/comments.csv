After a good install, the first execution of this program brought up an error message ""Invalid Argument to Date Encode.""  Press OK and the program starts.  Created a user name and Generate but the program rejected several tries.  All said ""Wrong License"" This problem may be caused by the wrong user name or license code. .....
Also, during this attempt with several user names and keys, the 'Invalid Argument..."" error appeared several times."
