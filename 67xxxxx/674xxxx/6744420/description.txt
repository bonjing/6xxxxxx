Product Description
Scott Kelby, author of the groundbreaking bestseller â€œThe Digital Photography Book, Vol. 1â€ is back with an entirely new book that picks up right where Vol. 1 left off. Itâ€™s more of that â€œAh haâ€”so thatâ€™s how they do it,â€ straight-to-the-point, skip the techno jargon; packed with stuff you can really use today, that made Vol. 1 the worldâ€™s bestselling book on digital photography.

In Volume 2, Scott adds entirely new chapters packed with Plain English tips on using flash, shooting close up photography, travel photography, shooting people, and even how to build a studio from scratch, where he demystifies the process so anyone can start taking pro-quality portraits today! Plus, he\'s got full chapters on his most requested topics, including loads of tips for landscape photographers, wedding photographers, and there\'s an entire chapter devoted to sharing some of the pro\'s secrets for making your photos look more professional, no matter what you\'re shooting.

This book truly has a brilliant premise, and hereâ€™s how Scott describes it: â€œIf you and I were out on a shoot, and you asked me, â€˜When I use my flash, the background behind the person Iâ€™m shooting turns black. How do I fix that?â€™ I wouldnâ€™t give you a lecture on flash ratios, or start a discussion on flash synchronization and rear curtain sync. Iâ€™d just say â€œLower your shutter speed to 1/60 of a second. That should do itâ€ Well, thatâ€™s what this book is all about: you and I out shooting where I answer questions, give you advice, and share the secrets Iâ€™ve learned just like I would with a friendâ€”without all the technical explanations and techie photo speak.â€

Each page covers a single concept on how to make your photography better. Every time you turn the page, youâ€™ll learn another pro setting, tool, or trick to transform your work from snapshots into gallery prints. If youâ€™re tired of taking shots that look â€œokay,â€ and if youâ€™re tired of looking in photography magazines and thinking, â€œWhy donâ€™t my shots look like that?â€ then this is the book for you.

This isnâ€™t a book of theoryâ€”full of confusing jargon and detailed concepts. This is a book on which button to push, which setting to use, and when to use it. With nearly another 200 of the most closely guarded photographic â€œtricks of the trade,â€ this book gets you shooting dramatically better-looking, sharper, more colorful, more professional-looking photos every time.
