                                 STORM(2005)




Donny Davidsson is a very successful guy with an eye on the situation and a heart of polished granite. A slick, cool, slippery guy to have fun as long as we're talking no strings attached fun, free drink and illegal substances. But no one to hold in your hand when the century storm is approaching Stockholm at a rate of fifty meters per second.

Within one day will Donny have their lives shattered by a strange woman's apartment pulverized by her pursuers, being ordered to guard a box with unknown contents, be sought for murder, confronted with all he wanted to forget and thrown back to the last place on earth he wants to be on. It is probably the best thing that happened to him ...


Enjoy!!! =)
