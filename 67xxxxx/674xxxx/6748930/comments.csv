,EdgarS789,2011-10-17T08:00Z,Hope your issues worked out OK. Thanks for the uploads of 10/12 and 10/13. 10/11 is still missing. Do you still have a copy of that?

[V],NomDePlume,2011-10-18T00:25Z,"@EdgarS789  Unfortunately, I don't have the 11th.  I will try to get it if and when it replays."
,BoonesFerry,2011-10-18T04:44Z,"I'm fine without episode 11 :-)  
Your well being, of course, is far more important than any torrent. 
Glad to see you are back...I'll take that as a sign that things are better or at least ok. 
Thank you for all the work you put into providing us all with episocdes of Chelsea Lately. "
