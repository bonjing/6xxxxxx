alright mickyfinny
almost done, just need your help with one thing

i read the instructions, and copied the ""AirbusNewHUD.dll"" to my ""Addon Modules"" folder,located in my main FSX folder.

however, the other part i'm too dumb to understand it. 

I made a backup of ""A330NightPanel_feelThere.dll"", BUT, the other part was unclear. There's a bunch of stuff to write, could you please enlighten me how to do it?
Please?"
,mickyfinny,2011-10-15T00:24Z,"@suitretas Important Make a backup of your dll.xml !!(in case you make a mistake)Mine is located at C:\Users\mickyfinny\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\FSX (Win7)or do a search if your o/s is different.Open the dll.xml with notepad,copy and paste the lines ive upped into it near the end inbetween  and 
Now that you have done that you need to edit one line : D:\FSX\Gauges\A330NightPanel_feelThere.dll
And change it to whatever path your FSX/GAUGES folder is.As you can see mine is at 
D:\FSX\Gauges\A330NightPanel_feelThere.dll
I hope this helps,if not write back cos i know you have been waiting for this one"

However, I now need the Lufthansa livery for the A330 (for A340 it is available at Wilco). Could not find it anywhere. Any hints?"
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-10-18T18:47Z,"Hello everyone,

An easy way to get everything working:

1) Download this torrent:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4320606/FSX_Wilco_Airbus_Series_V._2_-_1g_Installer_(B-H)

2) Then download this torrent:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6743066/wilco_evolution_vol2_RIP.rar

3) Install the Airbus vol 2 with the installer [first torrent] and then replace all the equivalent files from the second torrent.

4) After that download this fix:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6743066/wilco_evolution_vol2_RIP.rar

5) And implement the fix by reading the instructions carefully. NOTE: If you don't have the 'Addons Modules' folder in FSX, then create it.

6) Download and install the latest airac cycle [select only which you want to download]:
https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6693463/

7) Enjoy!!!

Great job mickyfinny, grandfred20, imr147 and bonehunter!"
