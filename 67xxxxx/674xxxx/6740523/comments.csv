,cat3333,2011-10-13T11:50Z,Downloaded way over 20 times and not one seed! If no-one seeds... I can't upload any more files!
,SYNAESTHE5IA,2011-10-14T00:43Z,"It's picked up a bit now. When I joined this morning there were 11 seeders. It stayed at around 20 for most of the day, so obviously there were a lot of people hitting and running after they'd completed it, but there are 37 seeders now so it should have a good life."
,cat3333,2011-10-15T01:21Z,Are you a member of any private sites?  If you are interested in some GOOD ones... holler.  I will need your email address though to send the invite to.....  You will be able to get all the tv you want with no worries of virus and hit n runs then... lol
,SYNAESTHE5IA,2011-10-16T07:46Z,"I'm a member of a couple of private sites - TorrentDay and Demonoid (though I haven't used Demonoid in ages) - was it one of those? I normally use TorrentDay for anything I'm after quickly, because if people actually have a ratio to worry about they tend to be more community-minded and so stay on after the download has finished!

With TPB, I usually come here to browse, if I'm not after anything in particular, in the hopes of finding something good. Like early CSI in HD!"
,cat3333,2011-10-20T16:54Z,"No, but I am a member of both of those , too!  lol  I was speaking of maybe I Love Torrents(***one of my favs).. or Torrent Leach... Pretome (***one of my favs) or a TV site or 2....  ROFL"
