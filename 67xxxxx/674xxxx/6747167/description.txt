         Max Scherzer (1-0) is scheduled to start for Detroit, while   
         Texas is slated to send Derek Holland (1-0) to the mound;     
         both started Game 2 but did not factor in the decision,       
         as Scherzer pitched six innings and Holland was pulled        
          after 2.2 innings.
