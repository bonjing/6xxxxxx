DLC: Roesha - One Bad Mutha Co-op Character
Roesha is a downloadable co-op character who helps DeathSpank in both his battles and his adventure.

A 70's era inspired police woman with a nasty attitude and an over-sized pistol. Roesha gets results! When her gun is simply not enough she calls on her electric disco ball to take down a big crowd (watch them dance!). She can also fire First Aid shells at DeathSpank to heal her crime-fighting partner. And when she taunts, get ready for a Charlie's Angel inspired pose and some Roesha attitude. She is One Bad Mutha.

â€¢ She kicks ass and provides some additional funked-up style to the game. Not only can she help DeathSpank on his adventure, but she makes the perfect coop character.
