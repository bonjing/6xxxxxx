My client hasnt crashed/bugged a single time so i am actually gonna skip this!"
,johnniebrasco,2011-10-16T23:28Z,"hmm, thanks alex, i know you're uploading the real deal, but it won't install? just a pop-up that says games for windows needs  to activate the game first..."
,johnniebrasco,2011-10-16T23:29Z,more people has encountered the same problem on rlslog.
,Insomneac,2011-10-16T23:30Z,Thank You.
,johnniebrasco,2011-10-16T23:37Z,"And skidrow didnt know what was updated, so there is no changelog. well, there is, but no info of use there."
,johnniebrasco,2011-10-16T23:56Z,.
[T],alexisthebest,2011-10-17T00:15Z,"Yea. seems to not work, but someone said ""Remove the ZDP folder from Install path, then Update works""

Could work."
,Insomneac,2011-10-17T00:39Z,"To make it install, here's what I had to do:

Install the game, don't use any crack it's not needed.

Run the game so it unlocks Games for Windows LIVE.

Exit and install the patch.

Again, a crack or No CD is not needed unless you want to run the game without Game for Windows LIVE."
,johnniebrasco,2011-10-17T01:03Z,"I saw that, and tried it, the update installs, but it didnt solve my issues; it lags because i'm using mouse, i guess. Got the solution to use an xbox 360-controller instead of mouse on several sites, but thats not a real solution. And i wasnt sure if the update had anything to do with that folder, so does it update properly without the zdp-folder? "
,johnniebrasco,2011-10-17T01:24Z,"thank you, insomneac, i can confirm that your method works, but the update doesn't solve the mouse issues. it only lags when moving the mouse."
,Hancock79,2011-10-17T10:59Z,"you guys sure if it's even supposed to fix the issues you're having?  cuz there's not a changelog anywhere whatsoever.  someone post one if I'm wrong please, I couldn't even find it on google

obviously, don't install this if you don't have issues with the game people until there's a changelog"
,shauwy,2011-10-17T18:46Z,"thanks bro ;)
If you can't install delete the ""ZDPconfig.xml"" in the ZDP folder where you game is installed and run the setup of the update the install works fine ^^"
,johnniebrasco,2011-10-18T13:03Z,"ok, seems i found a fix... the solution was to plug the mouse directly into the motherboard instead of the case/usbhub. After googling for days, i was near giving up. And i installed catalyst 11.10 preview 2, which was an improvement from 11.9. Not for other games though, just dr2 otr, bf3 beta and rage. the mouse solution was actually from the last dr2, incredible that they haven't come around to fix this shit."
,Bargetti,2011-10-19T07:04Z,"your lucky you found a solution to the xbox controller, anyone know if this fixes the xbox controller bullshit?"
,johnniebrasco,2011-10-20T20:08Z,"i've heard of a solution where you paste a file called x360ce.exe in the game directory, i have not tried it myself, since i don't have a controller, but might be worth checking up on. Hope this helps you. "
,VSiig,2011-10-20T21:48Z,Can i play Co-op if i update this?:O
,lrmn83,2011-10-21T13:15Z,Is there A working triner somewhere???
,shinobiung,2011-11-16T14:52Z,I hope this fixes the constant crashing.
,AlbinoFox,2012-03-14T16:39Z,"@ shinobiung

Do you know if this fixed the crashing issues? That is the only problem I constantly run into when playing this game and also some glitchy blood mess on Frank when killing zombies? "
,MakaveliKingOfRap716,2012-04-03T09:31Z,"@Insomneac
