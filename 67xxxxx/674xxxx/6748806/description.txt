Amazon Review:
Charlie Daniels represents the best America has to offer as is known as a worldwide Patriot. In the special package of his best Patriotic songs, Charlie has hand-picked his classic renditions and added two new tracks "Iraq Blues" and an updated 2010 version of "(What This World Needs Is) A Few More Rednecks!"

Allmusic Review:
Rounding up patriotic cuts, the Charlie Daniels Band has recorded for Koch over the past decade or so -- mainly re-recordings of standards or older CDB hits, such as â€œSimple Manâ€ and â€œStill in Saigon,â€ although it also has the rabble-rousing â€œThis Ainâ€™t No Rag, Itâ€™s a Flagâ€ from the early days of the Iraq war, all culled from his 2003 album Freedom and Justice for All -- The Land That I Love also adds the brand-new, self-explanatory â€œIraq Blues,â€ along with a remake of â€œ(What the World Needs Is) A Few More Rednecksâ€ for good measure. This may not be a great enticement for the fan who already owns everything featured here, but it surely adds a bit of modern patriotic fervor to a collection designed for the reddest of the red states. The remakes arenâ€™t as good as the originals -- and the recitations are quite heavy-handed -- but The Land That I Love delivers what it promises, no more and no less.
