In the album notes to Trespass Trio's "...was there to illuminate the night
sky...", saxophonist Martin KÃ¼chen provides a colorful yet somewhat
fragmented essay, regarding the evisceration of society, partly tied into the
Iraq war and the everlasting Israel-Palestine conflict. He sets the stage for a
life force panorama, iterated through the power of music that casts a dour or
ominous state of affairs. Recorded in Norway, the Scandinavian trio exercises
some bloodletting here.

The injustices of society in general are transmitted via KÃ¿chen's often
gut-wrenching baritone and alto sax phrasings, topped off with a nicely
articulated gruff tone and fluent craftsmanship that's supported by the rhythm
section's blustery mode of execution, which assists with the saxophonist's
angst-driven tone poems. With frenetic abandon and yearning lines, KÃ¿chen's
hyper-expressionism could make Albert Ayler sound like a purveyor of children's
lullabies, as the band embarks upon a whirlwind course of action, sans a few
temperate moments.

The trio goes on a search and conquer mission during "Strid Comes," letting it
all hang out. The group exorcises the demons here and during other works, while
paralleling the heady subject matter. At times, it appears that Trespass Trio is
communicating doom and gloom or something akin to a Faustian bargain, but in
effect the musicians simply rev it all up and move forward with an underlying
theme, seemingly structured on a chaotic premise. Conjuring up an aggressive
stance set forth by a brutish modus operandi, there is the occasional contrast
with minimalist-like detours along the way.
