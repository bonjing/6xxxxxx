In 1995, Jack concentrated on his keyboard playing and recorded a set of piano solos and duos with organist Bernie Worrell, who played previously with George Clinton, Funkadelic and Talking Heads. The release of the recording, entitled Monkjack, represented a new departure for Jack.  He was delighted to have been invited to present this material at the Edinburgh Festival and the Queen Elizabeth Hall in September of that year. (jackbruce.com)
