The More than Complete DC-Now More Completerer!

This fortieth alphabetical installment is: DC from Spe-Stq (Minus Star)

What's This?
     It's a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.
       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those "Pre-DC" comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some "Post DC" comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c.875-885gb in total. It will take as long as it takes. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.

=================================

I have decided on the makeup the rest of the torrents - small changes are possible. I plan on 14 more. Most are 13-18gb. The Superman torrent will be around 35-38gb. The big Batman one was popular so I'll do the same with Superman.

This is a real oddity. - But DC was behind it.  There were no more issues. You've probably never heard of it, my friends and I like it better than pop-magazines. We're way cooler  than you. You can tell I'm lying because I said I have friends

Spirit World 001 (Hampshire Distributors(1971)

The Spirit is amazingly famous among "comics folk" but not so much in the world outside.  Will Eisner for whom the comics "oscar" was named (Eisner Award) drew this guy originally. Many newspapers used us to carry a special section of comics - the "Spirit Section", many of which are included here, either in reprints or original newspaper scans. There is considerable overlap in the newspaper strip scans because I didn't want to spend the time to sort it all out and remove the duplicate strips. Then too, some of the reprints come with extras such as notes from the author.

Not a comic, don't know if it's any good, but if you like steam punk, give it a whirl, give it a try, a look-see, a chance, a once-over, a glance, send it up the flag pole and see if you salute, Or not.
     Steampunk Tales 001.pdf  - 

You probably don't need to like Steam Punk to like this item, but it would help if you like girls, Victorian or otherwise.  If there are any surviving Victorian ladies they are over 111 years old and that's counting babies born the day of her death. So I'll stick with the "otherwise" Meanwhile in japan apparently there is a growing interest in "elder porn", No word on wether there is "elderly octopus  porn" or "elderly schoolgirl porn" (for the uninitiated - the regular schoolgirl pics are young-looking women dressed in school uniforms, not actual schoolgirls, though that surely exists in Japan too.) The octopi & squid pics unfortunately are all too real. I try to be broadminded about such things, but the tentacle-porn (and related stuff) is one of the preferences I can't begin to understand and shudder to think of. Rule 34 is all very well and all that, but rule 34B adds "You do NOT want to test this by looking" 

I wonder if it is coincidence that Japan is an island heavily dependent on sea-food, or that they make octopus ice cream in Japan? 

Wash those thought out with this, guys. You gals can find your own mind-wash, sorry. 
     Victorian Secret Girls of Steampunk 001 ctc (Antarctic Press(2011)

======================
No one says gals anymore, and I wonder if this is in any way related to other gender related english word changes of the last 50 years or so. I really don't think so, since "guys" survived and became inclusive of females, whereas new terms were created for postman, garbage man, fireman etc. So I had to look up the origin of guy and gal. because I'm a bit of a word nerd, I've heard.  Seems gall is nothing more than an altered pronunciation of girl. Whereas guy derives of all things from "Guy Fawkes" -  the failed  political bomber/assassin/conspirator from a 1605 plot to kill the king of England. You may know of Guy Fawkes Day/Night . Originally a celebration of the King's escape from death, later just a party with some political overtones (or not), featuring burning of an effigy, originally the Pope, sometimes current political figures. Later the effigy was called a "guy". I was deeply disappointed to learn that "effigy" did not come from the phrase "eh, f***ing guy".
	GF himself shifted from villain to a bit of a buffoon (the plotters did fail, after all), to even an action hero in kids books. So at some point the British made  the verb "to guy" meaning "make fun of, to ridicule". Somewhere in all there people started calling man a guy sometimes. Probably not a compliment. So now Im not sure I'll ever feel the same about being called a "guy" after this. I'm a MAN golly ding it! I demand more respect!
	Why are the people at work making a sort of scarecrow that looks kind of like me? Hey! put down that match!
======================

Steel
Just Steel. Pure Iron you know, is not as strong as Steel, so take that "Iron Man"!   Cast Iron as in "Cast Iron Skillet", famed weapon of choice for angry wives in days gone by, is  actually carbon-steel with more carbon than usual. So maybe if he was "Cast Iron Man" he'd seem like less of a wimp.

Now "wrought iron" has too little carbon to be called steel, so you might say "Steel is over wrought" but I wouldn't He's a bit sensitive on the subject.

Covers only. Could not find. I found what might be a Korean language scan of this, but I don't know enough Korean to be sure.  I'd have to know more than none at all.

Storming Paradise 01-06 (WS(2009)

Sounds a lot like a weather team, or fans of the X-Men character. You can tell I've never read it. Why aren't they X-People or somethings. What is this, September 1963? As for me I like to watch storms and found Halle Berry quite pleasing to watch as Storm. She has such nice "lightning bolts". nudge nudge, wink wink know what I mean?

This is a children's book. I wouldn't include it but the list I use as  a reference for what's scanned of DC contains it. I decided when I began the original MTCDC that if it was in the list in was in this series. I didn't feel the need to include every cereal box someone scanned with Batman on it or the like. so I just let the list choose what of that kind of thing would be in. Of course anything I deem MTCDC worthy comes in wether this list has it or not.The list giveth, but the list doesn't taketh away.
