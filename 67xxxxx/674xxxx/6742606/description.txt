        Oranges and Sunshine tells the story of Margaret Humphreys,  a
        social worker from Nottingham,  who uncovered one of  the most
        significant  social  scandals  in  recent  times:  the  forced
        migration  of  children   from  the  United   Kingdom.  Almost
        singlehandedly,  against  overwhelming  odds  and  with little
        regard for her own well-being, Margaret reunited thousands  of
        families,  brought  authorities   to  account  and   worldwide
        attention  to  an extraordinary  miscarriage  of justice.  She
        discovered  a  secret  that the  British  government  had kept
        hidden for years: one hundred and thirty thousand children  in
        care had  been sent  abroad to  commonwealth countries, mainly
        Australia. Children as young as four had been told that  their
        parents were dead,  and been sent  to children's homes  on the
        other  side of  the world.  Many were  subjected to  appalling
        abuse. They were promised oranges and sunshine, they got  hard
        labour and life in institutions.
