How is he an ignorant pig when you live in a country where most everyone is fat? Your country promotes a stupid religion that doesn't believe in evolution but believes in talking snakes. You even deny anthropomorphic global warming despite the huge amount of evidence. 

Asian people (Oriental) are more educated, not FAT PIGS, and generally FAR nicer people than Mericans.

What about dolphins and their massacre at the cove in Taiji? Personally, after the events in Iraq, I've grown even more resentful of the American GOV'T, but if it wasn't for American PEOPLE, I would never learn about Taiji and incidents alike. As for supremacy of one nation over another my country's example should suffice as a lesson for us all, when THEY almost exterminated US because they believed their race/nation/religion is better than ours. And where we are now? We both have crumbling industry, culture, education and so on. HATRED LEAVES US IN RUINS. Besides, let's stick to our mutton.....

Dude, I'm sorry I don't mean to be an ass, but Jesus Christ, could you complain a little more? You got the freakin' movie for free and you wanna talk about a grainy picture?

Not to mention had you read the notes on the torrent file you would've know it was Xvid video running @ 640x272...... grainy picture... Cry me a river! 

The only thing that annoys me about this site is all the bitchy complainers..... People getting stuff for free and crying over something petty like that. "

You missed the point, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this, the picture is perfect. The only reason it came off as grainy to you is that you played it at a larger resolution than it was intended for.

Watch it in 640x272 or even something close to it and the picture is perfect."

Excellent quality for a DVDRip and a very good movie! 

I agree with annalia about the quality theme... If you are willing to watch the movie in a 50'' TV monitor, then download a Blu Ray Rip this is not the uploader's problem.
 Standard DVDRip quality is nothing better than the quality of this torrent and of course DVDRip quality movies with 90 minutes length aren't at all smaller in size than this one!!!"
