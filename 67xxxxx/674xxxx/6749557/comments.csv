,maximoz,2011-10-17T09:45Z,"Thx man, better than that stupid of sceneline with his rars!!!!"
,balanced,2011-10-17T13:31Z,Yes it's good to see people are finally getting the point there are more seeders / leechers for the UNRAR'd versions.  RAR's don't help me one bit through bittorrent.  They really need to keep them off here and stick to their usenet.
,RARsucks,2011-10-17T14:57Z,"@maximoz

no shit, fuck RARs, set bt.sequential_download to 1 in utorrent and you can watch with VLC straight away.

RARs belongs to the modem days, fucking morons never moved on."
,RARsucks,2011-10-17T15:02Z,"Pro tip:
When using bt.sequential_download in utorrent

Also set:
""peer.disconnect_inactive"" to ""true"" and ""peer.disconnect_inactive_interval"" to ""10"" 
in utorrent when doing sequential downloading.

This will make utorrent disconnect the slow uploaders so the early pieces in your sequential download won't get clogged with slow uploaders.

,RARsucks,2011-10-17T15:04Z,"Fuk RARs.

Pro tip (pirate bay, stop deleting my comment):

Use bt.sequential_download in utorrent so you can watch mkv/avi while downloading.

Also set:
""peer.disconnect_inactive"" to ""true"" and ""peer.disconnect_inactive_interval"" to ""10"" 
in utorrent when doing sequential downloading.

This will make utorrent disconnect the slow uploaders so the early pieces in your sequential download won't get clogged with slow uploaders.

,gendrith,2011-10-17T18:22Z,"Thanks a lot, I'm always waiting your torrents :D"
,stimpj,2011-10-17T18:57Z,If you don't like rars then be patient next time and wait for an uploader to do it for you like the weak little suckling-tit babies you are. Otherwise SHUT THE F UP ABOUT IT ALREADY! It only makes you look like an ignorant whiny cunt.
,Norilor,2011-10-17T19:56Z,"@stimpj

It's originally in .mkv, then morons rar the shit out of it because it's so much fun."
,stimpj,2011-10-17T20:33Z,"^ Dude, they rar the shit out of it because it has to be posted through Newsgroups first when it's released. Why can some of you not grasp this concept? No one is using rars just because they *want* to..."
,pjsat,2011-10-17T22:47Z,"Talk about some ungrateful people.
Getting something for free whinging about it.
These are the type who will spoil it for those who appeciate the torrents.
Uploaders and seeders, please ignore these morons."
,balanced,2011-10-18T01:06Z,"Yes - RARing is good for newsgroups.  But THIS ISN'T newsgroups ya fackin' morons so UNRAR it first before ya up it, k?"
,RARsucks,2011-10-18T02:17Z,"@pjsat

Are you stupid or something?

It's not a matter of being ungrateful, it's simply a matter of efficiency, why the fuck make 1000s of people waste their time and diskspace to unrar when all the seeder has to do is unrar once, making mkv/avi the default also help get rid of fake torrents.

If everyone is ""greateful"" about everything we'd still be living in a cave, there'd be no light bulbs because every idiot is greateful for the sun.

What the fuck is so hard about unraring before seeding? 

And stop whining about people whining."
,fish121,2011-10-18T02:40Z,Thanks !
,pjsat,2011-10-18T03:05Z,"@RARsucks

Wow...a few seconds to unrar it...big deal!"
,stimpj,2011-10-18T03:40Z,Baby needs his baa baa
,Monty2k,2011-10-18T10:44Z,"Video - 10 
Is it just me or does this rip/episode look even sharper than normal?"
,myndctrl,2011-10-18T17:21Z,"I agree with @pjsat

Unless you have a pc from the 90's why can't you take just a few seconds of your precious life to unpackage a file? I mean really ppl, if you really want to see episodes or movies that have been packaged don't you think it would be worth the 20 seconds to unpackage the damn thing? 

I look at it this way, I download smaller files faster, so I get more shit in less time."
,Norilor,2011-10-18T19:36Z,"It's a matter of archiving your files and seeding at the same time. I usually don't dump every episodes I download in one folder located on one hard drive.

Realize it takes double the space to seed a folder full of rars and an archived .mkv file.

You'll say, ""then unrar, watch and delete but keep the rars to archive later"" and I'll answer ""go back to my first paragraph."""

""bt.sequential_download"" in utorrent? Did you get that from MIRC you bloated whiner? And, such an organized man you are, right? Hardisks, folders, arrangements? Learn Ikebana you twat!  "
,logan_morgoth,2011-10-18T22:58Z,"@RARsucks

And, raring is good against people like you fighting for sequence downloading and infect the whole swarm with ""inefficiency."" "
,logan_morgoth,2011-10-18T23:01Z,"@RARsucks

raring is good again people like you crying for sequential downloading on utorrent. "

now that makes sense. thanks for the insight!"
