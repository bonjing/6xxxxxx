I have one question, normally I play everything on my Popcorn hour A110, which plays everything except your F1 uploads. The audio doesn't work (with VLC/notebook it works fine). 
Do you use any special encoding, that the popcornhour doesn't understand?"

Is this the complete BBC coverage with the comments before and after the race?"
,wlqcmzw,2011-10-16T14:03Z,"@S_A_U_S
obviously your A110 doesn't support corresponding audio codec. throw it away."
,wlqcmzw,2011-10-16T14:04Z,"@Spikkie

I'm uploading 10x faster than I'm downloading and I have 15%

Can I avoid seeing the result for 89 days lol?"
