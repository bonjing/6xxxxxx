 if u got a expired trial installed you will have to hit the register button on the expired nag screen.
1) Use the gen to make it registered,once it says registered, then X out of the nag screen.
2) It will load up the main program, then go to the help and register screen again.
3) Use the gen again, then it will remove the nag screen after you X out of the screen.

Note: Do make sure that you do what the read me says first, otherwise you may cause this gen to become invalid.

Rate: 10 of 10, thanks webchella & the cracker."
,MikeTemplar,2011-10-28T12:20Z,"Works Great! No Viruses.  A little confusing on what Darkseid said. 

Register (I had to wait a little while for it to go through) Then go to Help, then About. And it SHOULD let you through every time. "

,JediJew,2011-11-19T08:27Z,"Are you serious?! Alcohol 120% released as a .iso? Now (tell me if I'm being stupid) but if I want  alcohol then I need to access the iso, but you need alcohol to access the iso but I don't have alcohol because it's on the f****** iso!! 

I know I can burn it to cd, and that is what I will do, but you should never have to resort to hardware when it's easily done with software alone.

As I say, if I'm being an idiot, let me know."
,JediJew,2011-11-19T08:29Z,"And I just realized that I forgot to thank the webchella for going through the effort to get this out there and I'm sure it will work fine once I've gone the long way round.

So thanks!"
,Spinfx,2011-11-19T14:59Z,"Thanks for the upload... but... why is this an ISO?!!! Don't you think some of us are getting this because we DON'T already have something capable of mounting images?

Jesus fucking christ."

,john-a,2012-01-12T20:00Z,"Good idea putting the files in a iso file... Anways, it works fine and no viruses found by mse."
,spakattack,2012-01-20T19:21Z,the fuckin key generator keeps crashing in win 7 x64 and yes as administrator and multiple compatibility modes tried. So basically this torrent is a waste of my fucking time. the damn file doesn't even have an extension you have to add the .iso extension to even fucking open the piece of shit. Complete waste of time.
,ske1th,2012-04-14T10:59Z,"@spakattack: I use win7 64-bit, installed long ago without problem. But now, the keymaker stop working, just like your problem. Anyone with solution?"
,djlust,2012-04-30T00:09Z,use 7zip to extract iso archive to file
,djlust,2012-04-30T00:13Z,"Win7 64 err: 

Loading Alcohol device drivers failed! 
Emulation options and native driver interface of Alcohol 120% will not be available!
