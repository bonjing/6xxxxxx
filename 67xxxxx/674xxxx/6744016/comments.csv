,geuheo28,2011-10-26T23:55Z,any one can tell the name of the player in which it can be play??????? i think it is fake...fake
,BinkyDeath,2012-01-13T23:01Z,"Don't know if it's a fake but there's a LOT of files and really there should only be one or two. I'm not risking this download, esecially with all of these zipped files. If I can't scan for viruses without unzipping the files first then it's too risky - skull by your name or not.
geuheo28 - if you've unzipped them and can't get any movie files you find to play in VLC Media Player then yeah I would assume it's fake or a dangerous download. I don't see any movie files but I don't want to unzip that lot. I've only risked that kind of download twice. There was a movie in ONE of the zipped files for the first one (so I don't know why there were 20 zipped files when I only had to unzip one). The second time I found no movie, but I did get computer problems and can't find a virus even though my computer's been acting like it's got a virus ever since. Don't know how to fix it or find out what's wrong - so I don't trust a movie download with a ton of zipped files anymore.
Try at your own risk I guess. *shrug*
If anyone does try it please post if it works. If noone posts that it works and how they got it to work then we can only assume it's because your computer doesn't work anymore. :/
I don't know why anyone would upload tons of zipped files for one movie file. Anyone care to enlighten me on that? :/"
