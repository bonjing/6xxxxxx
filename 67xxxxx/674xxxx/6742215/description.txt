"Attention must be paid" to this abbreviated but superb 1966 television adaptation by Arthur Miller of his Pulitzer Prize-winning modern tragedy, starring the incomparable Lee J. Cobb and Mildred Dunnock recreating their original Broadway roles as the Lomans. In a career-defining performance, Cobb portrays the suffering Willy Loman--the middle-aged man at the end of his emotional rope--with Dunnock equally impressive as his patient wife, Linda. George Segal and James Farentino play their disillusioned sons, Biff and Happy.

Shattering and unforgettable, this landmark television production has been digitally remastered and will endure for all generations to come. "In a word, superb." --New York Times.

Not my rip. Note from original poster on Karagarga:
While the production is indeed superb, the visual quality is iffy at best. The image quality is very soft, bright areas are too burnt in, etc. Nevertheless, itâ€™s never coming back in a better format, so get it while you can.

Trivialists will note not only an early career performance by Gene Wilder, but a rare on-screen appearance (as Jenny) by June Foray aka the voice of Rocky the Flying Squirrel (among many others).
