,cowidster,2011-10-15T11:18Z,"Thanks for separate between the installer and the kaygen. I downloaded only the keygen and the readme file, and download the installer from direct download server, because of my sluggish internet connection.
Yes, the keygen is good! Don't forget to add line to the host file.
Thanks scene4all and CORE! Every CORE crack is good."

,skulldragon,2011-10-21T01:10Z,"I only got myself the KG and it works on latest official dl.

Thanks for telling about the HOSTS file entry and about the registry entry too. Even the most popular Windows defense programs won't allow you to live that good.

Now, what we need, is an universal program, that prevents programs from launching any browsers.
You know that new protection method?
They randomly launch any of your accessible browser with special address and then that webpage tells you if you are legit or not and of course if not, then they log your IP.
That's why we need somekinda either browser side anti-autolaunch or some tool that forbids executing browsers."
