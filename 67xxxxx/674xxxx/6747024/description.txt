RELEASE NOTES
-------------

- Strapon will not auto appear in custom poses (will have to be activated
  manually).

- For compatibility reasons, small batch files were created in place of
  \\\'build-mod-db\\\' and \\\'build-models-db\\\' tools that will execute ExBsData with
  appropriate parameters to emulate the obsolete tools\\\' behavior. These commands
  can still be used to easily rebuild modfile.db and models.db required by other
  tools.

- As ModGen framework is intended for mod developers only, plugins will be
  provided separately.

- Note, that the new GameSet format is *incompatible* with the format previously
  used by the BackupSet Manager tool.
