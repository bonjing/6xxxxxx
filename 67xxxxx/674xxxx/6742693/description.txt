Notes:

Well that took a bit of f-ing around, the original 1080i.ts file played fine on VLC but we could not do anything else with it as it is in a newer audio format of AAC HE (High Efficiency)used by broadcasts. I changed the streams to AAC LC (low complexity) in order to do the work I need to release this.

Thank you very much to Paul @DIME without his advice I would still be bashing my head against the wall trying many things that never worked.  I used over 20 programs to try and get that audio all failed until he explained a bit, with what he said and my own "fill in the blanks" I was able to get the audio and create a dvd.

Once converted my first thought was convertxtodvd, tried this 5 times and everytime the chapters were messed up, and in Womble easy dvd I could not get the whole movie to show up *sigh*, so I ran it in convertxtodvd without chapters then took the result and built menus and chapters in Womble easy dvd. Worked slick as shit.

So thanks to TLS @ DIME for uploading the 1080i, Paul @ DIME for helping understand what the fuck was wrong and to all others who attempted to get these streams yet could not, thanks to everyone who offered help or support on this release.  WIthout those words of support I would have trashed the project the first night as it was a hard one.

I went for a Dual Layer to preserve as much as possible the quality of the 1080i, obviosly it is not the same as it is compressed but this is the best source for a dvd we have.  

Thanks to everyone involved and enjoy the DVD!

I will be uploading the audio streams in the hopes that we can get some Audio torrents and DVD Bluray etc, my job here is done I only intended to release a DVD, it is your turn!
