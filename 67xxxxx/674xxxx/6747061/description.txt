Academy Awards Best Picture project notes â€“ 

In the case of almost every BP winner, especially the more recent ones, there is no shortage of available torrents. However, these have been ripped to multiple formats and standards. What I noticed is that there was both a shortage of the older films, and that many had not been ripped to the most basic and widely used format; Xvid AVI files. Many also had various other deficiencies, such as missing extras, no subtitles, low resolution, poor seeding, or comments from downloaders noting various technical problems.

So, I have endeavored to create new and clean, fresh rips, including all the extras and so forth. I am seeding each film (starting with the first BP winner, 1928s WINGS) individually, complete with full documentation and screenshots, and clearer labeling. A couple of the oldest films were swiped from existing torrents because a good commercial copy of the DVD is unavailable, but the rest are fresh rips Iâ€™ve made using DVDFab. My technical standards were to convert frame rate to 29.97, and to try to keep each film to at least .15 pixels. Each film has two passes.

In a further attempt to keep these torrents alive, I am bundling them in five-year chunks (seven in the case of the first one). The corresponding smallish file size (about 10 to 15 gigs per, I am guessing) should be small enough to keep people interested. I have deliberately decided to offer these chunks as RAR files so that people CANNOT just grab one, fail to seed, and let the torrent die. If you want just one individual film, they are already seeded and torrented that way. The RAR files are NOT password protected, encrypted, or any other dumbass scene nonsense. No tricks or games, just offered as one big lump file to help keep it seeded. In a few cases (GONE WITH THE WIND, for example) I am going to omit some of the extras in the interest of size and space. You can still find all of them in the individual files. My plan is to take this collection at least into the 1960s. Most of the BP winners since then have so many torrents that it would be unnecessary to offer yet another.

So, if there are gaps in your personal list of â€œWhich BP winners I have seen,â€ grab the torrent and start watching. 1928 and 1929 kinda suck (in my opinion), but these films start being worth it from 1930 on. Enjoy!
