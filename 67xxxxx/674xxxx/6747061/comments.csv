Anyone (like me) who might want to seed this long term won't because the RAR files are completely useless sitting on my hard drive. The AVIs themselves, on the other hand, would have been there to watch at any time. 
Great project idea. Terrible execution. (This has been discussed at DNoid many times and the consensus has always been that RAR'd files do not get the kind of seeding that unRAR'd files get and for exactly this reason.)"

Even I, a blonde, middle-aged woman can do it."
