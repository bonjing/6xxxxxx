,dumas1000,2011-10-14T23:06Z,"I bought the retail version of Rage and cannot get it to run on my high-end gaming laptop that runs everything else under the sun, including Crysis 2, DirectX 11, with full, maxed out specs. You may very well be sorely disappointed with Rage, so be careful what you ask for. Even if you can get it to run, it still runs substanially less than flawlessly for a large number of people. They screwed the pooch on Rage, big time. I wonder if this game is any good. To be honest, I have troubling finding the motivation to download just about any none AAA game. I've heard of the TV show, but know absolutely nothing of this game."
