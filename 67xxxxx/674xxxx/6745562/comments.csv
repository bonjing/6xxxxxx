,the_fbi2,2011-10-15T12:07Z,"As M0biu5 said, this doesn't look good.
This however does.

,M0b1u5,2011-10-15T12:30Z,fbi2 is right. His link is the good one. Go get it peeps.
[T],cad40,2011-10-15T12:59Z,there is absoutlty   nothing wrong with this torrent i have got someone else to check and start downloading and its working fine please ignore all previous comments
[T],cad40,2011-10-15T13:06Z,@M0b1u5 please learn how to use torrents properly at the moment all peers are between 2 and 75 percent so stop lying and promoting other torrents that are nothing to do with tpb will be trying to get mods to delete your link as if is not from tpb and may contain virusis 
,wci,2011-10-15T13:36Z,"cad40: I'm not bitching here, but he was right.. many ppl cant get this to download as we all get leechers with 0% we can see that there is seeders and leachers but we dont get access to them, prolly because off trackers holding ppl that download are pw protected or some shit like that. This is not the first time and you're not the only one.. But again.. this is how this shit works sometimes. just a heads up. In a hour or two ppl will prolly be able to Download without probs.."
,the_fbi2,2011-10-15T14:24Z,"cad40: I don't know what the issue was, but there was definately an issue with either tpb's tracker and this torrent, or ""the torrent"", in some way. As has been pointed out there were 70+ people all with 0% and none getting any content, over a significant period of time.

I posted an alternative (which couldn't be unclean given the host/source) so ""the fans"" were happy.

Your torrent is now working fine, and if I could edit my previous post I would, unfortunately we'll have to wait for a mod to turn up.

Please in future don't assume that people who are having issues with your torrents are clueless, some may be, but don't assume.

Keep up the good work :)"
