100 Jukebox Golden Oldies 6CD 320k + 40 Bonus tracks (musicfromrizzo)

We got this as a 6CD Golden Oldies offering, yet the songs ranged
all the way into the 80s and with a few songs we didn't think were
rally fit for the collection. So we dropped a few and added as many
as 50% for a total of 140 songs in a 1GB collection of some truly great
Jukebox songs for you overall! It is transformed over what we started with
and many tracks I should add are remastered quality versions and all are a
full 320k once more.

Enjoy this collection with some great picks included for you!
