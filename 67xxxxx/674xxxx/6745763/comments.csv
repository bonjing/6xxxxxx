The .torrent purports that this is a BRRip. The video quality does not back that up. This appears to be the same version available by other uploaders packaged in a .mkv container. Honestly, this appears to be a DVDRip at best. 

The official US release of this movie is October 25th. My suggestion, if you just want to watch the movie and then discard it, this is a suitable option. However, if you are like me and collect movies, I would suggest looking for a true BRRip shortly after the 25th."

I am equally surprised that MXMG even has the balls to upload such crap (sorry MXMG, but this is true about this torrent, and many others of yours). 

As I see it (not even contributing myself, shame on me...), the pink skull should be black."
,sting88,2011-10-29T11:11Z,"Just compared this torrent with many others and can't see a difference in the slightest.

The video looks exactly as it should for a good 720p rip. The other people commenting on here have no idea what they're talking about.

For what it's worth, this is the best copy of Captain America that is x264 720p, AC3 5.1 in a .mkv (which is exactly what I was looking for)."
