  Grissom, Catherine and Sara investigate an apparent suicide but soon realize that the death has not only been staged but is almost identical to a case they investigated several months before (in episode 1.1). The case takes yet another turn when Grissom's fingerprint is found on an object from the crime scene. Warrick and Nick, meanwhile, look into a car accident, but the only occupant is in the backseat and no driver is to be found. When fingerprints from the car are examined, they find them embedded with a strange blue dust.
