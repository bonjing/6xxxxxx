I don't have as much free time anymore as I used to and as a result I'm afraid I have to drop Y&R from my upload-list. Not to worry, since this soap will be uploaded by at least 2 other uploaders, so you won't miss out. 

I'm sorry for the inconvenience!"
,Fan_of_Claudia_z,2011-10-18T10:35Z,Thanks for the efforts. I'm sure that everyone here appreciated it. Thankfully we can still rely on Ms Fenmore and ClaudiaZ to continue this invaluable contribution to our daily lives.
