Lockwood learned a lot from Robert Johnson, and has a high regard for his music, but he long ago became fed up with those who only valued him for his association with Johnson and Sonny Boy Williamson II, and only wanted to hear Johnson\'s songs. He\'s a master guitarist in his own right (he was a mainstay of Chess sessions in the \'50s), a musical adventurer when allowed to be, and a capable, if rather dry, singer. He played mainly acoustic guitar, and his recordings when he played on electric guitar is rather rarity.
This live album, was captured in Tokyo, Japan at the Park Tower Blues Festival on December 9 and 10, 1995.
