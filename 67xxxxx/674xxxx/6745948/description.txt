At the age of two was the girl Mann blind. 18 years later she regains some of his views, thanks to a new and risky corneal grafting. But a series of inexplicable events lead her to suspect that her new vision shows her more than what is actually happening around her. Mysterious black-clad shadowy figures seem to announce a sudden death, and images of fearsome, disfigured people persecute her daily
