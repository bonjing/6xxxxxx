HALO 2 KEY/UPDATE FIX [TyMoD]

You will need how to use proxy's in Internet Explorer.  I would just make a list of keys but it would take FOREVER to get them. This is for my torrent only.  Pretty sure it won't work on Dopemans torrent.

Proxy IP - 77.65.19.35 Port - 3128

How to use a proxy....  It's easy.  Goto Tools on Internet Explorer and hit Internet Options.  When in Internet Options click the tab Connections and then LAN Settings (at the bottem of the page). You will see a box that says Proxy sever.  Check Use proxy server.... and then type in the IP and Port posted above. Your internet may be slow by using this proxy but it does work.

Then goto forum.cdaction.pl/register.html and register.  Activate the account and then sign in.

Then goto cdaction.pl/seriale (SIGNED IN AND USING THE PROXY. THIS IS WHERE THE PROXY IS USED.  IT MAKES THE SITE THINK YOUR POLISH.)

Select the game Kayne and Lynch and the site will email you a key. Save this key but don't use it in Halo 2 just yet.

In this torrent you will find a MF.dll for 64 bit computers which you will need to place over the System32 crack ( C:\Windows\System32 ) (ONLY IF YOU USED IT.  ALSO THIS STEP IS NOT NEEDED FOR 32 BIT COMPUTERS AS IT WILL SCREW YOUR COMPUTER UP!)

Then run the registry file (Fix.reg).

In the Halo 2 Crack folder is a MF.dll also.  Place this in the Halo 2 folder overwriting the original.  THIS IS FOR ALL COMPUTERS!!! ALSO DO NOT PLACE THIS IN THE SYSTEM 32 FOLDER.

FINALLY RUN THE GAME, USE YOUR INDIVIDUAL KEY TO ACTIVATE THE GAME AND IT SHOULD UPDATE.  ENJOY THE GAME!!!

NOTES:  IF the game does not update after you enter the key and it exits then run the update manually by running UPDATE.exe in the Manual Update folder. ONLY if the game does not update correctly.  I will also only seed for a few hours so if I were you I would seed because once it's gone I will not reseed it.
