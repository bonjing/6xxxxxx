,Espionage724,2011-10-16T21:36Z,"Quite nice, although I heard about this months ago on cs rin ru lol. It's been said you can also use a Age of Empires Online key too (since it's non-SSA, and free)."
,TyMod,2011-10-16T21:48Z,"Yeah,  I have another way to get keys but its complicated and I was giving keys out but my Direct Play was precracked so I had to make a reg file and fix the cracks so you can update the game correctly.  

Please let me know how this works for anybody downloading this to strictly use with my Direct Play (and 420Dopemans if your feeling lucky).  I tested it and it worked on two 64 Bit Windows 7 laptops but thats a small test group."
,TheBGuay,2011-10-17T01:54Z,"This finally fixed the please update message, but now i cannot play past outskirts?"
,TyMod,2011-10-17T02:51Z,You have to activate the game with a key. Did you do that?
,Link2692,2011-10-17T09:44Z,"So, i did everything in instructions, im positive i probably did something wrong but, everytime i get past the update screen it keeps asking me to update after halo 2 restarts :\ i've updated it 4 times , and i've even tried using the manual update, i cant get past the update screen"
,TyMod,2011-10-17T13:00Z,Tell me step by step what you did so I can tell if you missed anything...  MAKE SURE YOU RAN THE REG FILE (FIX.reg)
,tc0566,2011-10-17T16:43Z,This does not work for me even when changing lan settings it still detects that I am not Polish and will not let me have a key
,tc0566,2011-10-17T17:00Z,and a virtual tunnel won't even let you log in
,Link2692,2011-10-17T18:39Z,"well, i replaced the mf.dll file, i just ran the reg.fix, placed the Mf.dll file in the halo 2 folder, went to run halo 2, activated it with key, it started to download my profile then it asked me to update, i updated went to open game and it kept asking me to update :\"
,tc0566,2011-10-17T18:53Z,I would really like to know how everyone is getting the key because the lan fix don't work for me
,TyMod,2011-10-17T23:27Z,It does work.  If you really want a key I will give it to you.
,TheBGuay,2011-10-17T23:56Z,"Yes, you gave me a key before hand. Do I need one of these? Because now i can't change keys if needed."
,joshbaro1212,2011-10-18T00:18Z,"Hi really sorry to add to all the q's but i also keep just getting a repeated loop of asking to update , dunno if ive missed a step but ive done past the key bit etc"
,joshbaro1212,2011-10-18T00:20Z,"Hi really sorry to add to all the q's but i also keep just getting a repeated loop of asking to update , dunno if ive missed a step but ive done past the key bit etc also manual ipdate doesnt seem to work either"
,TyMod,2011-10-18T00:27Z,No you don't need one of the keys from this website. The one I gave you works.   
,TyMod,2011-10-18T00:36Z,FOR THOSE WITH A PROBLEM GTETING THE KEY.  MAKE SURE YOU ACTIVATE YOUR ACCOUNT FROM CD PROJEKT THROUGH YOUR EMAIL!!!
,TheBGuay,2011-10-18T03:09Z,Is there something i did wrong then?
,tc0566,2011-10-18T04:44Z,I did that and it shows I am logged in but still even with the lan fix tells me to contact an administrator and will not let me have the key
,tc0566,2011-10-18T07:10Z,well I finally got past the key part but like others cannot get past the update even tried putting manual update in the halo folder anyone figure out how to fix this
,tc0566,2011-10-18T07:48Z,ok finally got it updated and still can't play online still the live and network settings are grayed out
,Link2692,2011-10-19T21:09Z,"hey tc056, what did you do to finally update it?"
,tc0566,2011-10-19T21:53Z,I had to do an install with an actual cd iso in order for the update to work
,Inciner8r,2011-10-20T20:03Z,"Thanks TyMod, everything is working great! I'll make sure to seed for quite some time to make sure everybody can grab this."
,wickeditsme,2011-10-23T18:17Z,Tymod. Can i get a key? I set up a proxy and went to the site but was not able to create an accounts. I moved all the dlls and cracks to their correct position and now I only need a key. Also this will work using my already registered xbox live account? Thanks so much.
,TyMod,2011-10-23T19:48Z,"It will work with any account. silver or gold.  I use my Xbox live account, (I have had it forever.)  I will get you a key later.  I am a bit busy and have not looked at any emails. Hope you understand.  As soon as I get a minute I will surely get you one though. :)"
,wickeditsme,2011-10-23T22:55Z,"Alright sweet. Will you just email it to me or pm me? Also do you think you could get one for my friend? Trying to get back into halo 2 since they shut down the xbox servers :p
Thanks so much,
Sam"
,TyMod,2011-10-23T23:01Z,I understand cause its the same thing I did lol.  I ill say the Online SUCKS lol.  The more I play it the worst I realize it is...  My emails tymodgames@gmail.com Just send me a email with you Thepiratebay username.
,djxbyrne,2011-10-23T23:05Z,"Could use a key myself, I've gone as far as to re-DL the game to try and make it work but only with fail. The key site doesn't seem to want to send me a key with or without using the proxy IP. Thanks ahead of time. :)"
,djxbyrne,2011-10-23T23:10Z,"Sorry for double post!

Here is an image of the message windows is giving me.

,tc0566,2011-10-24T00:57Z,Same error I was getting even with TyMod's version I had to look for an actual iso in order to get the update to work but even so the online play still does not work
,tc0566,2011-10-24T07:08Z,another thing is that everyt ime i start the game it tells me to activate and the key will not work for that
,tc0566,2011-10-24T07:45Z,also just found out it is in demo mode since i can't get past the activation with the key
,TyMod,2011-10-24T12:31Z,"Hmm, never had this issues.  Try re-extracting the game and start over.  "
,TyMod,2011-10-24T12:33Z,"Also update games for windows live to its latest version.

EVERYONE WHO DOWNLOADS THIS NEEDS TO UPDATE GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE TO ITS LATEST VERSION FOR THIS TO WORK."
,tc0566,2011-10-24T19:36Z,tried that 2 times Tymod the key will not allow me to activate the game says it is an invalid key and now I can't even get back on the site using the lan settings
,Inciner8r,2011-10-24T22:06Z,"@tc0566 and djxbyrne, The first time I went through this before this updated fix I was getting that same error. All that I did was a complete uninstall of the Windows Live and then re-installed and updated it from there. Worked perfectly for me. "
,Inciner8r,2011-10-24T22:09Z,"As for the key, there are other workarounds to get that up and running if you are having troubles with the site, they are pretty simple from what I understand."
,tc0566,2011-10-25T00:52Z,The key gave by the site does not work it already updated but can't play online because the key is bad
,wickeditsme,2011-10-26T18:53Z,"Hey I sent you an email for the keys. Its from mygarbomail@gmail.com. I know you are probably busy and have not had time. I just wanted to make sure my email didn't go into your spam :p
thanks."
,tc0566,2011-10-27T02:43Z,Does anyone else know where to get a key so I can play online?  the key i got from the polish site is not valid.
,Inciner8r,2011-10-27T15:15Z,"@tc0566, there is another workaround that will get your copy valid. If you want instructions for it, leave an e-mail address."
,tc0566,2011-10-27T17:51Z,my email is tc0566@hotmail.com please send those instructions
,Inciner8r,2011-10-27T23:03Z,"@ tc0566, Sent."
,TyMod,2011-10-27T23:55Z,I'm real busy.  This weekend I will get a few keys to send out.  As of now though I am busy encoding songs to upload. :)
,tc0566,2011-10-28T00:39Z,ty Inciner8r that worked
,Inciner8r,2011-10-28T02:53Z,"No problem tc0566, glad its all working for you!"
,grizli995,2011-11-05T00:58Z,"Ok ,TyMod , i'm still getting that irritating error about windows live,and dedicated server running and shit.What i did wrong here was that i couldn't find where to register on your polish site,therefor i didn't get the key.But other than that i did everything right...but 1 more problem appeared,when i ran the halo2.exe after cracking for the second time(crack from this torrent(64 bit user)) i get the same error.And where do i need to input the key?And when i run update from this torrent it ""updates"" in a millisecond,which is very suspicious for me.Can you PLEASE reply and help me solve this problem.Here's my e-mail so you can send me the Key,and give me some more instructions:
Grizli995@gmail.com
I may be doing something wrong,don't know what...PLEASE HELP!


I'm a Windows 7 64 bit user."
,jellowK,2011-11-05T01:41Z,"Did everything acording to the instructions but as soon as i completed the first level ingame
it ended saying that i need to activate it 
The key that i got from the polish site doesent work in this case is there some way to go around it to be able to continue with the campaign ingame

my mail is jellowK@hotmail.com "
,TyMod,2011-11-05T03:12Z,"IF you find the update ""suspicious"" download it from Microsoft.  YOU MUST DOWNLOAD THE LATEST Games for Windows Live client which doesnt matter now anyways since the new update took Halo 2 pretty much offline.  Users can still host games but there is only 2 people online.  My suggestion to you is if you really want it buy the game or just leave it cracked and play the campaign for what its worth.  The online has turned into a joke."
,TyMod,2011-11-05T03:14Z,"PRQHY-W86MM-VRWPM-3FM4B-6QGWC
and
9BTG3-8FFTD-JBCP3-T4YRM-94RKH

are actual product keys.  Activate the game with these keys.  If it says they are over used then call microsoft and they will give you a new key. :)  Easy as that.

And for people not getting this to work.  You need to read comments or follow instructions because this guy and others are testiments to the fact that this does work."
,Mason9564,2011-11-14T12:39Z,"is there any way anyone could either get me a key or help me run it without the key? just looking for campaign basically, email is mason9564@live.com"
,vallan16,2011-11-24T02:37Z,Hey I followed the directions to the letter and I have not being able to aquire a cd key for halo 2
,gipro1,2011-12-14T03:54Z,"Can someone pleas get me a key? 

I did the IP and Port stuff, went to both links, translated everything with google translate and it will NOT let me make an account. 

The first link sends me to an error page, the second link sends me to the page with the games but when I click Sign up(ZaÅ‚Ã³Å¼!) it sends me to the same error page. I also tried clicking Forum below the Sign up button and it sends me to the error page as well. 

Pleas someone get me a key.

Or better yet just use my email to make the account and email me the username and password you made the account with. 

Email: person_321@hotmail.ca"
,iKruzie,2011-12-16T01:08Z,Could anyone give me the phone number needed to call them and ask for a replacement key? Microsoft's support site is the most redirecting piece of crap I've ever seen.
,iKruzie,2011-12-16T03:26Z,Or just send me a key/method to acquiring a key - kruzxl@gmail.com 
,TyMod,2011-12-21T19:05Z,The IP and Port # don't work anymore.  You will need to find a new Proxy at http://spys.ru/free-proxy-list/PL/
,DingbatKiller,2012-01-04T00:23Z,"For get about the crack just buy the game.
Now look microsoft know's that you are going to use a crack to crack the files with a key that Is not yours like PRQHY-W86MM-VRWPM-3FM4B-6QGWC or 9BTG3-8FFTD-JBCP3-T4YRM-94RKH. you need to use your own key for the game to work."
,TyMod,2012-01-06T04:43Z,"Nope.  Just called them the other day and they reset the key.  If you don't know, Halo 2 isn't sold anymore, (you can't even fucking download it off of games on demand and the dedicated servers were shut down).  And I used those keys to activate my version on my laptop but after building my new tower and trying to activate the game it wouldn't work so I called them up and bam.  All is good."
,The_K176,2012-03-11T01:02Z,"Tymod, I have followed this tutorial to the letter. I did not copy MF.dll into the System 32 folder. I downloaded the game from your torrent ""Halo 2 (Vista and 7) Direct Play *TyMod* Fully Working."" I registered on CD Action and now have a product key. The game PERFORMS fine with my specs. I have Windows 7 32-bit. I created an offline account. The only problem I have is that, after the first level, it tells me that in order to activate the game, I need to insert the disc. Is it that I have to create an ONLINE LIVE account? Do I have to use a mounted ISO? If so, is there a good torrent for an Halo 2 PC ISO?"
,The_K176,2012-03-12T23:53Z,TyMoD?...
,TyMod,2012-03-15T03:44Z,You need to create a online account man.  Thats all.  If you need an iso then any will do.
,The_K176,2012-03-15T14:41Z,"So, just to be clear, you have to create a Games for Windows LIVE account and have an ""original"" Halo 2 ISO? Well, I'm downloading one. Thanks for the heads up. But I really think the people who tried this torrent and found it not to work should know this."
,phazedlol,2012-03-15T22:21Z,"Tymod, I am having problems with the polish site, I have been at this for hours.  If it not a problem for you can you help me out with a keycode?"
,Sovvy12,2012-04-13T05:21Z,"This proxy will work fine for registering everyone, I used it, registered, and got a key.

,Sovvy12,2012-04-13T11:22Z,"Well in the end I got an actual ISO and used the actual product key posted a couple pages back...

PRQHY-W86MM-VRWPM-3FM4B-6QGWC

and it actually activated... rofl. Thanks to whoever reset it recently. Trololololol."
,TyMod,2012-05-01T00:17Z,I did lol. I had to when I built my new computer. So your welcome.
,failcritic,2012-05-07T06:51Z,"I have followed every step to the dime, and it seems to have worked all the way. There's just one little thing that's tripping me up. When I log in with the LIVE account I made, it says that there is an update for the game, and that if i don't apply it, the game will kick me out. I go ahead and do it, but as soon as the progress bar fills (about 3 seconds) the game closes. I open it up and same thing happens again. I tried the manual update that came with your torrent, but the update notification still occurs. I tried restarting my computer while applying the update, but no go. Any help you can offer is appreciated. I'll try and google some sort of solution. Thanks a lot for the torrent and instructions up to this point!"
,TyMod,2012-05-11T02:56Z,Just honestly don't try to update it. If you want to play online then download a cd image torrent and follow my instructions. It will save you alot of time. If you just want to play offline then don't let it update and play through the game man.
,Blizzard2381,2012-05-18T01:56Z,"When I try to sign in, it gives me the error code 80048821. How do I fix this?"
,Blizzard2381,2012-05-20T23:07Z,"nevermind. had to change my password because it doesnt accept advanced charracters for some reason like the '!' or the '%'. pretty gay and outdated, but whatever. it works."
,XxItZ_CANIBAL_xX,2012-05-25T18:23Z,Seed Please
,mjdedle,2012-05-29T00:10Z,"I have left a comment on your other torrent for Halo 2, and I was wondering if applying a cd image would allow me to use the update. Another person was having trouble, and you told them to download the image then follow your instructions. I already have activated the game, so will following the rest of the instructions with the cd image allow me to apply the update, or will the image itself allow me to update it and play, with out changing the mf.dll files? I have downloaded dopeman's torrent, where it asked me to put in a cd key, which I did so the game is activated. In his torrent, he had already changed the mf.dll files so I don't think your first steps discussing how to activate the game are unnecessary. "
,mjdedle,2012-05-29T00:12Z,"Sorry, necessary. "
,XXPirateXXi,2012-06-02T21:29Z,"I did this and I am having the same problem as failcritic. Can you please give step by step directions on how to play multilayer (if it's possible)? Or just a way to manually update. Btw, its suprising to find someone who has consistantly helped people on their torrent. Nice job."
