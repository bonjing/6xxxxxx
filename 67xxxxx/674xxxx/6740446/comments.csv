,soupcip,2011-10-13T16:08Z,"thanks for the up, great quality !  But I have to say the show is a real let down for me. I don't like it so much uptill now , I think the talent is mediocre and the format is getting, well, kinda boring. Don't know if I am gonna watch it all the way. But thats my view. "
,casstin,2011-10-13T17:52Z,"FYI, the source of this isn't HDTV, because then it would be widescreen format. This thing is 4:3 standard format."
,BoonDockSaiNt30,2011-10-13T19:31Z,Tiny screen. WTH? It used to be decent widescreen. Why are you uploading such a small screen TvTeam?
,BoonDockSaiNt30,2011-10-13T19:40Z,Nevermind it got bigger as it moved along.
