,mymoto500,2012-01-29T08:55Z,"a man who supported iraq war then gives moral judgement of mother Teresa ??? has he visited india and saw the work she did ? and did he talk to people whose life she changed ???

i guess no. 
only judjing people by their views on abortion and per-marital sex, is lame.

author is disgusting asshole. glad this turd is dead."
,tararrr,2012-02-08T21:36Z,"mymoto500- have you ever visited India and seen the work she has done, and spoken to people whose lives she has changed?? 

I didn't think so. 

You should read some unbiased accounts from people who have gone to India and seen her 'work', here's an interesting one http://www.newstatesman.com/200508220019

This is what infuriates me so much about religion, it total blinds people! This is why no one questioned the way she ran her 'missionairies of charity'. No one is a 'saint', there is good and bad in everyone.  You need to be more openminded. I bet neither of you have read Hitchens work, or sat and watched a full interview with him. You just hear one thing and start mouthing off. She was a sadist, and anti-women. Everything she did was for her own self gratification, to get herself closer to 'god'. That is what's wrong with religious extremists, they feel they have to force everyone else to think like they do. That's not how a healthy mind works. 

You call yourselves religious, yet you are glad he is dead and wishing him to hell. Why are you so hate-filled? Religion clearly isn't working for you, isn't it meant to make you better people? You need to really examine your morals , ya know 'what would jesus do'? He would be ashamed of you, that's for sure "
