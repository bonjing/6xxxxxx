20th Century Masters Millenium Edition remastered CD 

Don't you just love the Tootsie theme for the memories of Dear Ms. Jessica Lange
looking her finest most beautiful! The memories I live with forever more
Amen!

btw I couldn't ever bring myself to say to someone I once loved
"you got no right to speak to me so kind" as is contained
in the lyrics of the famous song as written titled "separate lives" 
(below) but then live and learn I suppose - to each his own, but
as for me, I prefer to be altogether more different in this respect

Theres other songs here made famous by Stephen Bishop too
