The blood coursing through Blade's veins is half-human, half-vampire, the result of a vampire attack on his mother before he was born. Blade has been working with Scud, a brilliant slacker and inventor of devious weapons, to destroy any vampires that cross their paths. The hunt for vampires takes them to the lair of Blade's sworn enemy - Vampire overlord Damaskinos, who now needs Blade to deal with a far more deadly threat than either has ever faced before. Nyssa Damaskinos's strong and darkly exotic daughter, and her co-warrior, Asad come to meet Blade to formalise a truce. They will have to work together to stop the Reapers, a Super race of vampires. A mutated form of their vampireâ€¦predecessors, the Reapers are infiltrating humanity and vampires alike with the reaper strain that will leave thousands of carriers roaming the streets in just a short time. The infected trail leads back to Patient Zero, Jared Nomak and Blade must destroy him before he and the Reapers destroy the human race.
