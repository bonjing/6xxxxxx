,sarsapil,2011-10-15T17:02Z,"In other words, a queer film made by some queer about very young queers to promote queerdom... What the world is coming too? Next they're going to say that being a queer is the most normal thing in the world... Keep pushing like this and get ready for the inevitable backlash, you queers don't know how good you have it today, don't risk losing it all trying to promote your abnormal, very minority, tendency among the young, most people won't take it lying down..."
,jakebot,2011-10-15T22:10Z,"sarsapil: sounds like you would gladly ""lay down and take it""...if you catch my drift, cutie-pie."
,sarsapil,2011-10-15T23:44Z,"No chance, I'm as straight as a crooked arrow... I just respect the right, like my granny used to say,  those folks have to do with their bottoms as they please as long as they don't start telling porkies to the kids..."
,rauthony,2011-10-16T13:44Z,"Gosh, this film is ""to promote queerdom"", is it, sarsapil? I'd better not watch it, then, seeing how I turned black after watching ""New Jack City""."
,sarsapil,2011-10-16T17:36Z,"You're a funny guy... but if young people watch it they may start thinking since all the other kids took the abnormal feelings between the two 'in love', as quite normal, then it must be normal... But it ain't, no matter how hard queers try to make it look like it is. I'd rather have queers have the attitude: 'Yes, I'm queer, I can't do anything about it, so I'll try to be as happy as I can' rather than: 'It's great to be queer, why don't you try having your bottom drilled by any boy you like, you'll love it...', which can lead to experimentation and disruption of an otherwise normal life. In other words, admit your lifestyle is not the best in the world but you're stuck with it, try to be happy like that and not, It's great to be queer, come and join us...."
