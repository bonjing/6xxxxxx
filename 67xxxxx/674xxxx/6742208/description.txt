This was done straight off the bluray3D disc and STRAIGHT out of the package to the burner and i wore gloves.  im not even joking.  and after all that apparent nonsense, the results came out so good i was proud of myself which doesnt happen very often.   

This is the best Remastered Film so far.  3D is Oscar Worthy, Audio is Epic, in fact there's still people standing up clapping right now that watched it yesterday...

Figure out specs for yourself  this will work on on 3D TV that can display SBS  or stereoscopic, or laptops or EVO3D or Optimus 3D

This is My new show-off film and i've seen about 200 films now in 3D on the EVO3D.   its FUC KIN amazing.     watch it with bad ass headphones and tell me you dont want to cry.
