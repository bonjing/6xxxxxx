Take care

[V],neil1966hardy,2011-10-18T02:02Z,"You can disregard my previous comment. I have now managed to fix this damn torrent and it is uploading just fine.

Please also disregard the comment by rabbit42.  Yes this is a rar file but I can give my assurances that it is not password protected and that all 8 episodes of Nightmares and Dreamscapes is included in its entirety in high quality video.

Enjoy and Seed!!"
