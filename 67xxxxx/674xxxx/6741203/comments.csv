Skidrow included tons of  useless  files  in  their  crack to  emulate  ubisoft  launcher.  They  didn't  investigate  the  protection  to  see,  that   it's  completly unnecessary, as the game may be  launched  in offline mode. Their crack  caused  problems  for  many  people  as  it  wouldn't  work  when  ubisoft   launcher got updated. We release single-file crack,  that works without any problems. "

Then run  'mmvi_1.1.exe -->' by doble clicking on it in Winrar to install

C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Might & Magic Heroes VI
or for (32bit OS)
C:\Program Files\Ubisoft\Might & Magic Heroes VI

,ThWar,2011-11-29T03:43Z,"to Mr. Lim and others... for off line mode, make a shortcut to your game, then edit the Target portion of it to say ""....Directory\GAme Name.EXE"" /offline
the ""/OFFLINE"" takes care of that...

too me a while to figure that out since it's NOT Listed in any of the instructions provided with any of the patches or the games that i've DLed!"

does anyone know how to fix this?"
,Lexiar,2012-02-18T09:21Z,"To all who had the crashing at startup screen, i solved it in that way: 

1. Clean installation from here http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6739165/Might_and_Magic_Heroes_VI-SKIDROW
2. Download and install the update using gu.exe in game folder
3. Again download the second update (v.1.1.1 I suppose) using gu.exe in game folder (with first update it just doesn't work)
4. Replace the ""Might & Magic Heroes VI.exe"" with one cracked by PROPHET http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6741203/Might.and.Magic.Heroes.VI.Update.v1.1-PROPHET
5. Made a shortcut of this *exe, go to shortcut properties and add to the end of it's target line "" /offline"" (without quotation marks)

It seems that in my case the problem was solved by the second update, which was meant to solve the starting problems on some laptops. "
