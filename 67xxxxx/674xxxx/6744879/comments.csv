,Jeros420,2011-10-15T07:42Z,"See my above comment?  It just now finished the DL, and lo and behold, none of the tracks work through windows media player.  Encountered an error yadda yadda...Thanks for the try, but fail is fail."

But i have question for ya sir why in itunes is it reading your mp3 as encoded with musicmatch but like a day or two ago it said encoded with lame 3.98 is it some glitch in itunes update or something?
