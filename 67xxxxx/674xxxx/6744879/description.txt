Foo Fighters
Greatest Hits (2007)









During the last dark days of Nirvana in 1994, tapes of Dave Grohl's solo demos circulated among alt-rock royalty. Greg Dulli commented positively about them in more than one place, but few suspected that these homemade tapes would launch one of the biggest modern rock bands of the post-grunge era. As it turns out, thatâ€™s exactly what Grohlâ€™s Foo Fighters became, perhaps the one band of the alt-rock revolution to enjoy continual success on the charts and on the road without a dip in popularity. It was this consistency that distinguished the Foos; other bands burned brighter or had bigger hits, but Grohl's band -- which coalesced into a permanent lineup around the groupâ€™s third album -- always climbed into the upper reaches of the charts, churning out singles like â€œEverlong,â€ â€œLearn to Fly,â€ and â€œMy Heroâ€ that built upon the heavy, melodic, loud-quiet-loud template of the Pixies and Nirvana, pushing it ever so slightly toward the realm of classic guitar rock.
