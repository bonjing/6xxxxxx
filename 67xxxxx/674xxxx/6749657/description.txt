Oscarwinner Mira Sorvino and Ashley Judd deliver stunning performances in this acclaimed psychological drama that takes a revealing look at the two personalities of screen legend Marilyn Monroe.

Abandoned by a mentally unstable mother, young Norma Jean Baker (Judd) dreamed of becoming a movie star. But even after changing her name to Marilyn Monroe (Sorvino) and achieving superstardom and the adulation of millions, Norma Jean's troubled past continued to haunt her. Increasingly dependent on alcohol and drugs after failed love affairs with the Kennedys, fights with studio executives and high-profile divorces to baseball great Joe DiMaggio and playwright Arthur Miller, Marilyn's life ended suddenly in 1962 at the age of 36. More than four decades later, the mystique and the mystery surrounding her life lives on... amazingly recreated with astonishing accuracy and haunting performances.
