Race to World First, a feature-length documentary film that follows the 25-person World of Warcraft guild Blood Legion as it strives to become the worldâ€™s number one, is set to be released on October 14, 2011. It will be available on Looking for Group Productionsâ€™ website, www.RaceToWorldFirst.com.

While Blood Legion is consistently one of the top-ranked guilds in the United States, it has so far been unable to defeat the EU guild Paragon. Race to World First documents the struggles, triumphs, and frustrations of Blood Legion as it prepares to beat the newest bosses released in World of Warcraft.

This is a global battle between 12 million people, and competition is intense. As the race gets underway, the film broadens in scope to include players from Finland, Russia, Australia, Great Britain, Greece, Canada, and Germany. They discuss what it takes to compete at the highest level, and the rivalries and life/game conflicts that inevitably arise.

Race to World First is the inside story of a community that remains largely hidden from the general public, and is negatively stereotyped in the media. The film redefines the image of the gamer, focusing on the commitment, cooperation, and tremendous diversity within this culture, and on the many positive aspects of the massively multi-player online (MMO) community.

For gamers both proud and closeted, it is about time.
