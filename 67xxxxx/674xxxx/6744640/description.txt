Not a complete discography but rather representative. The remastered editions (2000) are prefered to the original releases because they sound much better. Most of the discs are downloaded from the net (thank you, uploaders!) and tested for authenticity by true audio apps. Regarding the artwork I added scans of my copies (made by copier machine more than 25 years ago) of the original LP-booklet of Songs In The Key Of Life (1976) because it is quite comprehensive and I thought it would be interesting for some Stevie Wonder fans. Innervisions (1973) is presented in 2 remastered editions because I can't decide which one sounds better. But I scanned the artwork of my disc (the original release) for completeness.

Enjoy and pls seed!
