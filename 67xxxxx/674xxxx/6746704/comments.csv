,badbob999,2011-10-18T17:09Z,many thanks
,whiddett,2011-10-18T20:11Z,"Excellent! Does anybody have the unabridged version of Small Gods? Its the only audiobook not available on here from the Discworld series in its unabridged form.
Also, anybody know if the Science of Discworld are available in Audiobook form?"
,StepRazor,2011-10-18T22:37Z,@whiddett - I have Small Gods but the quality is pretty crappy and the reader is horrible (not Stephen Briggs or Nigel Planer) so not worth your effort.  Good luck finding it.
,CRennings,2011-10-23T01:48Z,I'm working on another batch upload of all the Discworld books right now.  I'll see what I can do to find a good quality copy of Small Gods for you.
,whiddett,2011-10-27T16:37Z,@StepRazor - you probably have the Tony Robinson version that I have of Small Gods but his readings are the abridged versions. @CRennings - if you find the unabridged version I'm sure it will make many people happy!
,kjcox28,2011-10-28T03:20Z,Just wondering if this is a fake as Amazon list this as being relased on 1st Nov but will try it
,kjcox28,2011-10-28T03:35Z,apologies this is the unabridged Stephen Briggs version Many Thanks !!!!
,BabeB,2011-10-30T03:19Z,Thank you SO much for sharing this! I'll be watching closely to see when you upload any other Pratchett audiobooks. :)
,Rose-mad,2011-12-12T06:34Z,"Thank you.  Audio sounds good to me, and it downloaded well.  Good work."
,Archancell0r,2011-12-18T08:27Z,"Having recently read Snuff and been constantly interupted it occured to me that maybe an audio book would be the answer, so I am trying your seed and I hope it's as good as the other reviews say."
