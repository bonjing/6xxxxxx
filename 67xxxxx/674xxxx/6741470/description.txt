While the accident causes Balwant to die right away, his wife is rescued by Sartaj, and she later gives birth to a child named Lovely. Lovely Singh (Salman Khan), now grown up, is the bodyguard of Sartaj's daughter Divya (Kareena Kapoor). He is very devoted to his duties but irritates her all the time by following her everywhere. Consequently, Divya and her friend Maya (Hazel Keech) call Lovely and start a prank love affair, hoping to keep him away from them. Lovely starts loving the mystery person but doesn't realise that it is Divya who was behind all of this. Divya tells Lovely that her name is "Chhaya". Meanwhile, Sartaj begins to suspect that Lovely and Divya are together and sends his men to kill Lovely in case his lover turns out to be Divya. Sensing this, Divya sends her friend Maya to tell Lovely her true identity. In a twist, it is revealed that Maya is also in love with Lovely. She falsely accepts that she is his lover. They marry and have a child. Maya dies early and reveals to her son in her diary about her fraud and asks him to unite Lovely and Divya.
