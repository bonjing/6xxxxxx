Just want to make sure this will be compatible with the Option Files that get uploaded and also the Konami patches that fix the ancient rosters.  I'm pretty sure that Gravesen will still be at Everton such is Konami's ineptitude at keeping things up to date."

I have this problem too, looked in xbox backup creator is because this version is not Region Free, is Australia/Rest of Europe, I will use abgx360 to try to make it Region Free. I lost 3 dvd's to discover this."
