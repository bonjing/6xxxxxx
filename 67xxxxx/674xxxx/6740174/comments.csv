I tried to migrate from your previous released version (6.8.7.0) to this one but I encouter a little problem on my computer. I have done all you've say to install this version (uninstall, folder deletion, regkeys deletion, reboot, install, reboot, uncheck update, register) but the key you provided only activate the non-HD part of AnyDVD, so no blueray support. If you have a suggestion I'll listen it :)
Thanks for your upload anyway. "
,Eldoryne,2011-10-13T10:56Z,I found the patch made by the team RESURRECTiON (like the one you provided in the last version) for the version 6.8.8.0 and it works.
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-10-14T01:46Z,"yeah,found it also and up this new one as well now.
Yeah,you are right,this not an HD key :(

,Eldoryne,2011-10-20T18:31Z,"Yes for the star wars, works perfectly with the anydvd ripper, not tried avatar but i received the blueray today :)"

So I downloaded this 6.8.8 and it works perfectly

just install anydvd, uncheck ""automatically check for new version"" and ""use online protection database"" then run the patch and you're good to go

THANKS A LOT!"
