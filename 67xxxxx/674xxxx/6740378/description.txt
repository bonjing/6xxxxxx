Tons of reports come from the famous Friars Club including sounds of someone walking down the stairs, full bodied figure, shadows, doors opening and closing on their own, waves of cold air, being pulled on, disembodied breathing, and voices being heard.  Could any of the activity be coorlated with the passing of comedian Al Kelly who had a heart attack and died there in 1966?  The next stop is at Main Street Armory in New York where the staff is frightened by unexplained activity and the apparition of a soldier being spotted.
 
Guest starring Maddie and Haily Hawes.
