,Minerva7101,2011-10-13T08:55Z,"Awesome books! Extremely informative and well written. But do yourself a favor, buy the paper edition. You probably don't want to read this massive amount of text on a computer screen."

The number of pages is in the description "
,Minerva7101,2011-10-13T16:36Z,"I know how many pages there are, I have the paper books. I was just suggesting people buy the paper books instead of reading thousands of pages on a computer screen.

If you are interrested in WWII, you will not regret buying the books."
