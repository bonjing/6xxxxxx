Ubehage's EasyCopy v1.22
------------------------

A tiny update, to fix a few errors from the previous release.


This one works fine. I haven't found any errors so far - just note, that it is limited to 2GB-files.
You may create jobs with large files in, but they cannot be copied.

I am working on a new copy-module, to fix that issue.
