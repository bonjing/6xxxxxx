,d0n601,2011-10-19T04:12Z,"""Audio outputs protected by Cinavia...""

what the fuck is that, audio cuts out for a substantial part of the movie. way to put that in the description you dick. 

do not DL"
,d0n601,2011-10-19T04:15Z,strip the DRM off you fucking idiot
[V],Hackulus,2011-10-19T21:25Z,"the audio is fine all through the movie, use a decent media player, I dont see anyone else complaining"
,Anil_TnT,2011-10-23T21:12Z,"Thanks and Good work. A=9, V=7.5. Video a little dull on my PC. Will see how it shows on my 48""."
,Primon9,2011-10-24T13:01Z,"@ d0n601:

The problem is your playing through the PS3 you fucking moron.  Nothing wrong with this file at ALL.  Thanks hackulus!  "
,jch3x23,2011-10-31T03:14Z,I played through the PS3 too. But have done that with hundreds of movies with no problem until this one. DO NOT DOWNLOAD... not safe should not even contain copyright info if it was a good rip. Way to screw us
,Gweilo,2011-10-31T15:08Z,"@jch3x23 are you retarded? PS3 has protection software on it....some internet enabled blu ray players do too, watch on your computer, or get a box that doesn't have this and it's fine....it's safe, you're just stupid"
,atk444,2011-11-02T10:46Z,"If you retards that complain about the PS3 not playing certain media files can't do a basic fucking Google search to see how the DRM software works than you don't deserve this quality upload. 

The PS3 and all internet enabled currently updated Blueray players will sample the audio and cross-reference that against a database to see if there is a match. If the licenses aren't intact for a Blueray then you are fucked as well. But then again this is a sub 700MB rip of a current movie... go fuck yourselves. 

Or buy a Roku and stream it to your TV..."
,citysurfer,2011-12-27T15:59Z,"I see selfish little shits that complain about something that they are given for free all the time. And they are SELFISH LITTLE SHITS!! Quit complaining about the upload. If you got nothing constructive to say, don't say anything!! Deadshits!!
Thanks for the upload. Works fine!!"
,strikerace100,2012-01-21T00:53Z,"**DO NOT DOWNLOAD***
CINAVIA PROTECTED
I DOWNLOAD TO WATCH NOT REWRITE THE DAMN THING !!!!"
,strikerace100,2012-02-08T18:45Z,"Cinavia is copy protect software embeded in the file that mutes the sound after a period of time when streaming from your computer to the PS3. It is a pain in the ass. Many flatscreen hi-def televisions will not play computer input in a full screen mode. If you stream the media from your computer to the PS3 you get a full screen movie experiance without having to burn the file to DVD. When you do burn it the blue ray player will still not play the file properly. 
IF YOU SUBMIT A FILE WITH CINAVIA AT LEAST MENTION IT SO PS3 USERS WILL NOT WASTE THEIR TIME!"
,jmyster6000,2012-04-01T07:46Z,"A: 10 V: 9 for standard DEF a really good copy. Sound is great and video Decent on a 51' plasma.

,kathlene07,2012-05-14T14:53Z,Was playing great until half way through. Voice goes off. SO annoying to watch peoples lips move and then hear the words after.
