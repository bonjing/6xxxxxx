Wikipedia detail:
According to Xavier de Rosnay of Justice, Audio, Video, Disco will be lighter than their first album. With the first album being darker, and this one being "daytime music", not as aggressive as the first one.[1] The album also features more collaborations than on â€ . In a 6/10 review, Spin describes Justice's style on the album as, "trying their hand at '70s arena rock...melding Italo-disco and singeing hair-metal guitars."
