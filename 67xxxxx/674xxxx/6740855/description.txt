A one-off novel according to Shan, The Thin Executioner was released in April 2010. Inspired by The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and based in a brutal world of tyrants, it details the perilous quest of Jebel, the thin son of a respected executioner, to petition a fire god for invincibility and succeed his father.

Jebel Rum is a thin, scrawny boy. His father is the famed executioner in the city where they live. When Jebel is humiliated in public, he sets off on a quest to gain great strength and invincibility. If successful, he will be able to compete in a gruelling contest to prove himself and replace his father as the wielder of the axe. Failure, on the other hands, means certain death.

To win the favour of a fire god, Jebel must make a human sacrifice. He finds a slave who is willing to pay this grisly price, and the pair set off on a trek through lands deadly and unwelcoming. In the course of their travels they will encounter hatred, bigotry, slavery, death and a whole lot more. It is the nightmarish adventure of a lifetimeâ€¦ Shan has often stated that this is his favorite out of all of the books he has written over the years
