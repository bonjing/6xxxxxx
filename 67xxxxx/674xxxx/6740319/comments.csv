i'm guessing the written text throughout the movie is in spanish? like the title, credits and background text/writting in the movie?"
,skarai,2011-10-13T21:09Z,"ptv83: yeah, general text is in spanish, isn't distracting. "

,carma73,2011-10-14T10:44Z,"@Meganfox
Thanks for the tip about that website. I've registered & DL speed is good!"
,TerryN,2011-10-14T22:12Z,"Audio is english, video is spanish. roadsigns, papers and such are in spanish. They were pretty lazy though. Some newspapers are spanish, some are english and others are both. Shopsigns are english, road signs are spanish."
,muLineZu,2011-10-14T22:13Z,"Yes, there are a few screens at the beginning subtitled in Spanish (1:30 OCEANO PACIFICO instead of PACIFIC OCEAN) and 46:20 the letter that Matter left to Lighting is also written in Spanish. The spoken language is English (it wouldn't be the same without Larry the cable guy, Owen Wilson, or Michael Caine), so from my my point of view, the fact that is a ripped from a Hispanic blu-ray doesn't diminish at all the quality of the rip, which is great.
Thank you very much!"
,tucot,2011-10-14T22:18Z,thank you guys but im gonna download the 1080p version of this movie.

,the_devious,2011-10-20T09:34Z,"This should be N-U-K-E-D for the video quality as well. The video is bleeding off in the last 9 rows of pixels. This glitch is also present in METiS' repack release.
Come on guys, you only have to use your eyes. At time of writing, the only way to get faultless video with DTS audio is to mux the video from e.g. the FLAWL3SS release, with the DTS audio from this METiS release."
,the_devious,2011-10-20T10:54Z,"UPDATE.
The bleeding occurs only in my KMPlayer, but not in VLC Player. I don't have this issue with any other video, so I'm not sure what's going on. In any case, the soft focus of the METiS release is overdone IMHO. The FLAWL3SS release has much higher edge sharpness, so I'm still going with FLAWL3SS video and METiS DTS audio.
Thanks."
,muqeet9868687686,2011-10-20T19:37Z,i love this movie
,mydearmedical,2011-10-22T02:14Z,"This one doesn't play on PS3

PS3 saids the file is damaged, works great with VLC on computer but who the hell watches movies on a computer screen anyway?"
,Racso64,2011-11-14T18:37Z,"Now wonder is in spanish. This movie is the Spain version. Pixar released this movie in different version in the respected countries. 
I do not see a problem with this video.
