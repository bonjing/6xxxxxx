,Ardeet,2011-10-16T05:51Z,@lonefunman - thanks for putting this up again and saving me from having to watch it on the HBO site.

(although if you click on the vid at HBO's site you can 'share' it and copy the embed code, and repost it somewhere else, it usually plays better, althought i still notice occasional buffering."
