At first, the strong-willed teenager embraces her fugitive lifestyle as an adventure but in time the ever-increasing fear of discovery and close quarters prove nearly unbearableifor the eight personalities in hiding, which include Mr. Dussell (Ed Wynn), the abrasive Mrs. Van Daan (the Oscar-winning Shelley Winters), her husband (Lou Jacobi), and their son Peter (Richard Beymer), for whom Anne develops an impossible love...

George Stevens directed this 1959 film adaptation of the hit play based on the writings of Anne Frank, a Jewish girl who hid in an attic with her family during the Nazi occupation. When Holland was invaded by the Germans in 1942, some of the Jewish refugees attempted to survive the war by hiding out, aided by sympathetic Dutch nationals. The Frank family hid above a spice business at 263 Prinzengracht, accompanied by a neighbouring family ? the Van Daans and another man named Mr. Dussell. The film plays through the eyes of the Frank?s youngest daughter Anne (Millie Perkins) and the diary she kept documenting her captivity and telling of her struggle to cope with such claustrophobic living conditions.
