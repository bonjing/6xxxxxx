  Forget the likes of Wipeout, when it comes to extreme obstacle        
  courses Sasuke is the gold standard!                                  
                                                                        
  W4F is proud to bring you a quality release of the latest Sasuke      
  competition, direct from Japan. Previously we brought you the 26th    
  competition, now we are back with an even better HDTV source.         
                                                                        
  Yes, its pure Japanese audio, but English speaking Ninja Warrior      
  fans will have little difficulty following the competition. We find   
  watching raw sasuke more engaging then its English edited             
  counterpart - Ninja Warrior.                                          
                                                                        
  A note on editing: Sasuke uses an unusual 'overlaped' type of         
  advertising placement. Through careful editing its possibe to edit    
  most ads out seamlessly so that you won't even notice there was an    
  ad break (the breaks usually occur during action scenes).             
                                                                        
  Enjoy this quality release, and for the hardcore fans check out our   
  720p HD version of this!
