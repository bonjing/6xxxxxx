,THE_SK1TZ,2011-10-14T17:16Z,"Why is it that every time we see a high demand title uploaded, its always 720p? Yeah granted the file size is pretty large for full 1080p at 30fps. Honestly though, most would want to see this movie with the best possible resolution. Some of us do actually have the hard drive space. For god sakes I hate watching in 720p I have a 55 inch plasma with a 600hz subfield. It looks like shit if I watch a 720p file when my TV is running at 1080. I have to force it into 720 for it to look good. Its like 720p is the standard on TPB. 1080 is best that should be the standard. if you have an issue with the file size, then deal with it. Or invest in a bigger Hard drive and a better internet tier.I have not one but, TWO 3TB ex hard drives and 60mbps VDSL Why should we all have to suffer. just because someone else cant afford a bigger hard drive, or faster download speed?

Lol but seriously, sk1tz, you're an idiot. You have look at other factors too. This one isn't an example because this release is too large but 720p is a standard in tpb for two reasons
1) It's usually possible to get below 4.7gb a.k.a DVD size, 1080p for most cases is unlikely.
2) Generally people watch these movies on their hardrives connected to their PS3's. The PS3 compatible  hardrive format must be in FAT32 in order to function, the max single file size a FAT32 format hardrive can take is 4gb, no matter how many Tb's it is.

Really I can deal with 720p and even the standard versions of most video.

Below is a brief summary of my findings (hopefully they will be of some use) - 

* NB: The following assumes your computer specs aren't ancient. If you have a shit computer, unfortunately no media player will run at optimum capacity.
* There is no one player which will give you the best quality/performance for every single kind of video
* Keeping the above points in mind, the media players I have found to consistently transcend the others over a range of codecs are 
     - Splash Player Pro for most 720p+ videos
     - PotPlayer for pretty much everything else
     - I also keep VLC as a last resort 
* Many people are unaware of VLC's ability to play youtube videos. This is pretty useful, especially when you're watching a youtube video with low volume. Open VLC => Goto Media => Open Network Stream => Copy paste the video's url.
* Also, for music fans (especially with large libraries), I'd recommend giving MusicBee a try"

I've encoded numerous Bluray movies myself. Good quality movies which in the past I've encoded at 1080p and 720p and then compared both to the original on my 50"" Plasma.
After several comparisons I now encode everything at 720p. I have plenty of hard drive space.
You can't just compare apples with oranges. I've downloaded 720p encodes in the past which look better/clearer than 1080p encodes. A lot depends on the source, encoder settings, bitrate etc.

If your player/TV can't upscale 720p to 1080p properly there's something wrong, but not necessarily with the 720p encode. Maybe you need to deal with that.

A 600Hz subfield is nothing new. Aside from the fact it's become a marketing gimmick.

There's nothing wrong with his TV, upscaling looks far worse than native 1080P. I don't know what TV you are using but native 720P, a bluray encoded in 720P, hell, ANYTHING in 720P will not hold a candle to native 1080P, simple as that. It's not rocket science, you have a 1:1 pixel ratio on a 1080P TV with 1080P content or you have less with a lower resolution. It's not an opinion, it's a fact that 1080P is superior. Some perfect 720P encodes can look really great (this specific release is a good example), but when you are using a large, high-end television, there is a huge difference, especially in darker films absolutely require a higher resolution and bitrate. I still don't understand why people feel the need to dispute this. No sub 10 gig encode, regardless of how perfect it is, is going to rival a 50 gig blu ray disc.  "
,fillinthisspace,2011-10-17T10:36Z,"crzy101,
Most people don't disable the overscanning on their TVs, if it can be disabled. If your TV is overscanning, your 1:1 pixel ratio goes out the window. Is your TV overscanning?

THE_SK1TZ said in order to get 720p video to look good on his TV he has to force the TV into 720p mode. Yet if he doesn't do that isn't the video still 720p, only upscaled? If one looks much better than the other, but the TV still has the same number of pixels, how can you be so sure the difference isn't due to his equipment?

The human eye can only see extra detail according to screen size vs viewing distance, and my TV is only 4"" smaller then yours. Most people, including myself, don't sit close enough to a large enough screen to see any difference.
If you're one of the minority who do (or think they do) then wait for a 1080p encode.

,master620,2011-10-18T03:35Z,"I'm with fillinthisspace.. 720p and 1080p are damn near the same. in fact, unless you are using a tv that is larger than 46 inches, the difference is non existent!!! The human eye can only see so many ""pixels"" at a certain distance. At any viewing distance with a 46"" or less screen, the MAX you can distinctively see, is 720p. Having 1080p on screen sizes that small does NOTHING, you aren't even able to see the difference. sure you can watch a 1080p movie on them, and they will look ""better"" than the 720p version, but you know why? its because of its damn bitrate, contrast settings, saturation levels, and shit like that. The 1080p version contains more data, so its able to display a wider range of colors and black/whites; THATS ALL. The resolution may be in 1080p as well, but the pixel density is so damn small, our eyes can not see it, so its a waste. And you know what else? If you take a 720p video, and give it the same exact settings at the 1080p version of it, it will look EXACTLY the same on those 46"" tvs even with its lower resolution. 

Now sure, people are saying ""well he keeps talking about 46 inch tvs, we aren't using those so ha!"" well guess what, still doesn't matter. yes you can see ""more pixels"" because its a larger screen, but you still have to sit FARTHER away from that screen to be able to actually have the pixels mesh properly to display a proper picture of which your eye can see easily and without strain. So in the end, your 1080p video simply allows you to see a video are a much farther distance, while the 720p lets you see the EXACT SAME QUALITY at a CLOSER distance. I'd rather be able to sit close to my screen and feel like i'm actually immersed within the movie, then sit 15 ta 20+ feet away from my damn tv screen.

Hell, i'm using a 24"" LED monitor right now, and sure it has 1920x1080 resolution, and is labeled as a ""full 1080p display"" but that doesn't mean shit. all that means, is that the images on my screen are smaller which allows me to have more shit on my screen at one time. Image quality hasn't changed one bit from when i was using a LCD display at 1680x1050 (of which i just switched to this new display about a week ago). Only difference is that my actual images look more vibrate because of the amount of colors this display can project compared to my older one as well as the contrast ratio and all that bullshit. 



Soo all in all, your ""video image quality"" is only ""amazing"" if the bitrate and some other aspects are really good. Resolution has nothing to do with it unless you are using a huge ass tv that forces you to sit miles away from it, because at a greater distance, you need more pixels to make up your images.. PLAIN AND SIMPLE..

Dont go saying shit like ""oh well I've been selling tvs for half my life and i know this and that and blah blah blah"" because even if you really did sell tvs for half your life, it doesn't mean you actually KNOW wtf you're talking about. Sure you know some important aspects of the TV, but you know NOTHING about the CONTENT and how it works.

,fillinthisspace,2011-10-18T08:55Z,"@ master620,
So far in this discussion nobody I've seen has specifically said they've directly compared a quality 720p encode with the original 1080p video (aside from me). There's a lot of theory being offered (and not all of it sound), but no ""apples vs apples"" examples.
I just did a little more experimenting and now I'm even more convinced when people are seeing a huge difference between 1080p and 720p it's probably a lot to do with how well their equipment is upcaling.

I just opened a 1080p encode I'd downloaded, along side the 720p encode I took from it (I wanted to burn in the subtitles so I downloaded a 1080p copy and re-encoded it at 720p). I synced the two videos and switched between them while running the media player maximised on my 51"" Plasma. I'm sitting four feet from it.

The first time I compared them I thought I was going to have to post back and recant all my 720p beliefs. The difference wasn't massive, but the 720p video was noticeably less sharp when it came to fine detail, although I still doubt I'd see it in my normal viewing position. Then I remembered I switched resizer in MPC-HC's options a few days ago while I was testing something.
So I switched the Bilinear resizer to a Bicubic resizer and compared the two again. This time, even from 4 feet away the difference in detail was so minor it was virtually non-existent.
Lastly I disabled MPC-HC's internal decoder, used ffdshow to decode, using ffdshow's resize filter to upscale the 720p version up to 1080p. Once again, if I could see any difference at all it was only a minor difference in the film grain and nothing else. All the detail in skin tones, background objects etc remained indistinguishable.

For piece of mind I'll probably do some more experimenting next time I encode a Bluray disc to see if the results are any different, but at the moment I'm suspecting a good part of the reason there's a 1080p camp and a 720p camp has more to do with the way the 720p video is upscaled than it has to do with the resolution of the video.

I virtually always use my PC for playback. I've compared it to the Bluray player connected to the same TV several times and even when displaying 1080p encodes I prefer the PC picture. It just looks more ""natural"". 
And that's with the PC connected via the VGA input. I'll have to try connecting it via HDMI one day to see if the picture improves even more."

The original 1080p encode:

Now there must be a difference. The first pic was 1.8MB in size, while the second was 1.6MB (the original PGN pics were converted to jpeg in the upload process but they look virtually the same), but much of a difference can you see?"

If you're planning on watching this on anything other than a computer (like a PS3, BR player, etc.) don't bother to download this because it won't play on those.  If you're going to rip and upload something, rip it so that it can play on anything!"
,Hypnosis4U2NV,2011-10-19T16:21Z,"I can confirm that the 5.1 audio on this rip is bad, pretty much non-existent and plays like stereo..

,deftond,2011-10-22T16:28Z,"@ master620 your a retard

do some research online before you start saying there is no difference between 720p and 1080p

dig your head out of your ass...your VGA cable can't even display 720p anyways..it can't stream enough data for that resolution.  Use hdmi you dip-shit and let us know if you see a difference.  1080p is for people with bigger tv's but there are more colors and the image is indeed sharper.

do you see a difference between 480p and 720p?  of course you do because stretching a 480p(dvd quality) image to a resolution of 720p will pixilize it.  You arn't going to notice a difference on your 24'"" monitor..wtf.
Nice write up there buddy.  1080p is only noticable on bigger than 42"" tv's.

nice fucking un-educated gues...oh and lets have a discussion about the human eye not seeing more than 30fps...because it does"

,digs5446,2011-10-24T14:11Z,"@ Hypnosis4U2NV

i would re-check your system.  i just watched this last night and it is indeed a good 5.1 track.  not only did the rear surrounds sound correctly mixed when i stood right next to them, but the loud action scenes feature really nice panning and atmospheric immersion.

it's funny though - during the dialogue heavy scenes  everything - including music - sounds unusually front-loaded and i wondered myself whether the audio was bad.  but when the action heats up there's no question.

just my $0.02"

Every other torrent is off atm but If I turn them on I'll connect to 30 out of 44 and pull approx 117 kb/s almost immediately, this thing has been sitting for awhile now and hasn't made any progress, even with setting the bandwidth allocation to high.

Can someone explain to me why this is happening, i'm fairly sure it has to do with not connecting to enough seeders, but what I don't get is why."

The difference between 720P and 1080P is not HUGE. Noticeable to those that pay attention to detail, but if you want to go and download 30GB movies, then do it. We dont want to hear about it.

Formula for your ""Look at me i'm awesome I think I am cool because I have 2x3TB"" situation: 6000 GB/30GB 1080P movies ='s not many movies.

6,000GB/5.46 GB ='s a lot more free movies at the expense of other people's time and effort...so thank the U'lr, move on and shut up about your crappy ass, 55"", Costco bought, Maxent.  

5.46 GB for a crap movie in great quality...well worth it.
