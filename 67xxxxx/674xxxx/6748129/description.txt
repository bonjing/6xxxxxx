***THIS MODEL IS MADE WITH CINEMA 4D AND WORKS BEST ON CINEMA4D***


***IF YOU ARE NEW IN CINEMA4D BETTER SEARCH FOR A FEW TUTORIALS BEFORE USING THE MODEL***

DO NOT DELETE the \\\"PlayaN3\\\" text below the engines on the aircraft body.
(You can add the same texture as the one you put on the body to cover it)
