,icecoldcanadian7,2011-10-20T16:20Z,"How did any of you extract the files? There is no password given. I know there's a password.txt file, but it's just a scam which leads you to a site where after doing a quiz, you have to enter your cell phone number. And apparently they unlock the password via text message. But by giving your cell phone number, you subscribe to spam text message service which charges you 3$ per text message, but no more than $40 a week. So again, how did you guys extract the files? Is there a legit password?"

THANKS VERY MUCH TO: Batman Arkham City [Xbox360][RegFree][MULTi5][XDG3] webchella

10 EASY STEPS TO FOLLOW IN HELPINSTRUCTIONS BELOW:


It workes for me because I have Flashed/Chipped my XBOX 360, and updated with LT+ 2.0! (NOT LT+ 1.9)
DASHBOARD: 20135990

DOWNLOAD THE 4 FILES OF THIS GAME. THEN PUT THE 1 ISO GAME FILE, AND 1 DVD-TEXT FILE OF THE GAME 2-GETHER IN A FILE AT THE DESKTOP. 


Normaly I Allways Test ALL Xbox 360 games and Verify it to 100% before burning the game with the easy program: ""Abgx360"". 

But now it don't even recognize the imagefile or dvdfile at all? But donÂ´t worry about that - It works 100% anyway. 


INSTRUCTIONS FOR BURNING XGD3 BACKUPS WITH IMGBURN: I recommended that you download and use the latest version of ImgBurn (v 2.5.6.0) downloadable at:
http://www.imgburn.com/index.php?act=download)

Older versions may handle this burningprocess differently and/or give a different set of errors.


1. Click and open the >IMGBURN >HELP >About Imgburn. U now will see if u have the latest Imgburn version: (v 2.5.6.0) Coded by: LIGHTNING UK!

2. >Tools >Settings >Write. In Options itÂ´s allready selected: User Specified, and written 1913760 Change this numbers first to: 2133520 and then select >Calculate Optimal and click OK. 

3. Click >Write image file to disc

4. After ""Please select a file..."" U click on the yellow map: Browse for a file

5. Hold U Pointer abowe the top smallest dvdfile (37 bytes) and click On it.

6. On top it should now say: \Batman Arkham City [Xbox360][RegFree][MULTi5][XDG3. Check write speed 2,4x

7. Click on ""Write"" at the bottom.

8. Choose and click on: Write until end of disc (Truncate)

9. It will now ask if U would like to burn the game that is 8.13 GB on u 8.5 GB disc.
Click >Yes

It now burns the game for about 35 min. and then says: Operation Successfull! Just click OK, close Imgburn, and take out the disc.

10. Install the finished burnt 7.8 GB game to your Harddrive on U Xbox360 untill 100% is complete. Start the game. The Intro comes, but then it all goes black screen? Turn OFF your xbox360, and start the game from the begining again and then it works PERFECTLY A 100%!!!


THE ONLY WRITEABLE DISC WORKING A 100% IS: ""VERBATIM DVD+R DL 8.5 GB""
THAT U CAN ORDER CHEAPEST DVDPACK OF 10, 25, or 50 DISCS = (1 EUR/DISC + mail price) DIFFERENT SIZEPACKS ON: http://www.sweburn.com/home.php

NOTE: (IF) U HAVE OLD FIRMWARE: WHEN U DOWNLOAD ANY NEW GAMES, N U PUT THE DISC IN, IT WILL ASK IF U WANT 2 UPDATE U XBOX JUST TO START THE GAME? 
AND I PRESSED (YES)... WARNING..!!!! IT WILL MAKE U DOWNGRADE U FLASH/CHIP N U WILL ONLY PLAY ORIGINAL GAMES, 
UNTIL U FLASH/CHIP IT ALL OVER AGAIN WITH NEWEST FIRMWARE. BUT WORKS 100% IF U HAVE LT+2.0!


LETÂ´S KEEP WORKING TOGETHER GAMERS - AND SEEDING, AND PLEASE COMMENT RIGHT WORKING INFO SO WE ALL CAN ENJOY MORE UPCOMING GAMES...

PLEASE UPLOAD: CALL OF DUTY-MODERN WARFARE 3,  SAINTS ROW-THE THIRD, TOMB RAIDER.

THANKS A 1000-TIMES AGAIN, AND KEEP UP GOOD WORK: webchella

I am a mac-user that has been using ISOx360 for a long time at it has been working great. Just drag the .iso file to the box and click burn after extracting the files. But with the latest three games (Batman, Forza4 and BF3) it does not work, it will not start burning. Does anyone now what this might be and what is the solution to it?

And one more thing, I just downloaded FIFA12, NHL2012 and Dead Island and they worked fine..

Thanks a lot."

,KingKool,2011-11-28T23:45Z,"C4E released the iXtreme LT+ v2.0 CFW for all versions of the Hitachi-LG GDR-3120L drive (â€˜PHAT Hitachiâ€™):

C4Eâ€™s iXtreme LT+ in association with Team Jungle & Team Xecuter

Official release of the iXtreme LT+ v2.0 for Hitachi drives
- Support for XGD3 ixtreme backups using LT-MAX for maximum capacity on standard DVD+R DL discs.
- Support for large capacity DVD+R DL media (no errors when burning)

About upcoming iXtreme LT+ 3.0 â€“ released after December 6th
Originals will need to be analysed by XBC to gain disc topology data. This data replaces the need for ap25/dae.bin data and enables any ap25 challenge to be answered correctly. The topology data method is very efficient using only 24k and is very accurate. Each title will need its own topology data as there are differences between titles, even xgd3 titles and backups can be detected if the same topology data is used between titles.
Backups will remain the same layout but will need the new topology data inserted by the new abgx or re-dumped with the new XBC for xgd2/ap25 or xgd3 titles.
Non ap25 titles will remain unchanged

Thanks go to Team Jungle for their hard work and efforts in the development process.
Thanks also go to Team Xecuter for their support to this project."

Since then I am trying to burn my own copy and I have tried both clonecd and Imageburn to burn my discs but still no success.

With image burn u guys have instructed to change laye break from 1913760 to 2133520, but when I start imageburn there is no layer break specified, its blank but i put 2133520 anyways.

With Clonecd it detects the layer break correctly  but still my disc says ""disc is unreadable"" with both burners. What am I doing wrong?????
