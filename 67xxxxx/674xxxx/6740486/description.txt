The 2011 debut release from Luke Doucet and Melissa McClelland as Whitehorse.

"Whitehorse, the marriage of songbird and falcon, is where McClelland and Doucet take their ample talents and distinct voices and meld them together into something greater than the parts... greater than the sum... into something great. Many clichÃ©s about marriage will be thrown around to describe the coupleâ€™s project, and they wouldnâ€™t be contrived. Although Whitehorse contains a track from both of their solo careers (â€œPassenger 24â€ and â€œBrokenâ€), the album is far from just adding new harmonies to old songs." - NxEW.ca

"McClelland and Doucet are great individually, so it astonishes me how much better they are together. It's definitely an album of the year contender." - Snob's Music
