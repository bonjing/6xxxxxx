  Love them or hate them - there's no getting away from caravans in     
  Wales. 11 million caravan nights bring around 300 million pounds to   
  the Welsh economy every year and this series gets to know some of     
  the people spending their leisure time in their own fibre glass box.  
  We explore the joys of hitching your home to the back of the car and  
  hitting the open road or settling down in a static on one of Wales's  
  many coastline sites.                                                 
                                                                        
  Fontygarry caravan site just outside Barry in South Wales has been a  
  favourite for people from Cardiff, Swansea and the South Wales        
  Valleys since the 1970s and it's just as popular today. John and      
  Jean from Port Talbot dread the day they have to stop coming every    
  weekend, but for Dave and Sue from Barry the holiday goes on and on   
  as they are the only couple allowed to live on site. Club compere AJ  
  takes a huge risk when he decides to replace the popular Friday       
  night bingo with what he considers to be more entertaining -          
  himself, and avid gardeners compete to win the accolade of Perfect    
  Pitch.                                                                
                                                                        
  Enjoy this from Cymru!
