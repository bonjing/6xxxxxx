,Aizu_san,2011-10-15T20:11Z,Eheh ^^ Grateful for the special thanks! :D
,PedoTed,2011-10-16T06:38Z,Is it like Aizu's? Does it come with a iso and able to play games on the English save?
,PedoTed,2011-10-16T08:29Z,Aw man.. its in 7z format...
,8bPa,2011-10-16T08:46Z,"PedoTed: Yes, it is an ISO and will work with your current saves just fine."
,Aizu_san,2011-10-16T14:05Z,"Hi PedoTed,

You can consider it as my ""V2"" since it correct bugs I wanted to fix in my version.

Also, I'll work on this one now and help Majin to complete it if we find bugs."
,PedoTed,2011-10-16T23:47Z,"Ah, that's awesome! If I find any bugs, I will tell you, hope you can fix some things like what he wrote to do."
,8bPa,2011-10-17T02:01Z,"Sierra wished me a merry Christmas when I talked to her in the store. Which surprised me, as it's currently the 18th of Spring. She says ""yaho!"" in the Japanese version."
,Majin_Vegeta,2011-10-17T17:00Z,"8bPa: Damn, I hoped she was just joking or something. Guess there are bugs after all...
Thanks and please keep reporting everything you find."
,alycancis,2011-10-18T08:54Z,"Not directly related to the undub but you guys are my best bet on this
Since it's proving to be exceedingly hard to track down either the gender value or the character_controlled_on_screen value, I am thinking about just overriding Azel's model with Sonica's. The models are obviously in the .dat file but I got no clue how to even start looking for what part the model is and how to override it. I _hope_ the animation indexes are the same for both models ( would make sense ) but I'm willing to put up with some bugs if it means I can have my lesbian marriage
any help appreciated"
,Majin_Vegeta,2011-10-18T16:08Z,"""Fairytale"" from GBAtemp, huh? :P
Interesting stuff you want to do there, but sorry, no clue where the models are.
I'm lucky that I even found the audio files in there..."
,alycancis,2011-10-18T22:07Z,"Oh well, was worth a try
thanks for the undub though, no more bleeding ears with natsume"
,Cross878,2011-10-22T18:18Z,"Thanks so much for the undub.
Only issues I've come across so far is the ""merry christmas"" thing and also, sometimes Azel will use Mikoto's voice after eating RP replenishing food.
"
,8bPa,2011-10-23T00:40Z,"Just letting you know I finished the Water Spirit Shrine and I haven't spotted any more bugs. Great job Majin, many thanks!"
,Majin_Vegeta,2011-10-25T12:35Z,"Hopefully Aizu knows how to fix them as I didn't try fixing any such bugs yet, heh.

*busy playing Atelier Totori on PS3*
Too bad Rune Factory wasn't localized by NISA...
I will gladly buy stuff from NISA but Natsume doesn't seem to want my money. Oh well~"
,Aizu_san,2011-10-26T14:32Z,"About Serra saying""Merry Xmas"", I think it's just a minor bug cause when I worked on my version it was the same. Just a path problem, think I can fix it (when i got time)"
,OverlordKhaine,2011-10-27T02:59Z,"Thanks for this. Great job. I haven't found an issue yet.

Would you be able to look at giving the PS3 version the same treatment? File size and structure is identical, the only difference being the RFF2.dat file contains more data for PS3 controls and such. Using a JPN base with the english .dat and .bin allow it to be played and undubbed for 3.55CFW."
,Majin_Vegeta,2011-10-27T19:42Z,"To OverlordKhaine: Sorry but I updated my PS3 a month or so ago to OFW and I don't feel like undubbing something I won't even be able to play...
Btw, you can use Dolphin to emulate the Wii version at 1080p and up. 2D images won't look as good but you'll get better graphic overall.
You can also use your PS3 controller :P"
,mordrun,2011-10-31T05:15Z,"i've come across a really wierd glitch, i'm getting the tour from Odette. Everything runs fine until we end the Tour at the house. She explains the bed and the calendar. Then walks over to the Chest/Window and just stands there. Not sure if i'm supposed to do something, i've pressed like all the buttons and she just stands there. She's still moving and the sound is still playing but nothing is happening

I'm running Dolphin btw."
,icecoffemix,2011-10-31T15:26Z,"Any plan or ETA for bugfix release?

Sorry if this annoy you, am just curious."
,Aizu_san,2011-10-31T20:21Z,"Dear mordrun, 

It's just a bug with Dolphin, try to change some configurations. I run it with dolphin and my wii and there is not a single problems with this part.

icecoffemix :

I'm currently trying to fix Serra ""merry Xmas"", if you find some others bugs, i'll ty to fix them as well."
,ultranoobxd,2011-11-02T06:02Z,"I wish to see how to extract the ISO off the .7z, as I cannot with 7zip or WinRAR."
,Majin_Vegeta,2011-11-02T17:35Z,ultranoobxd: Update your 7Zip/WinRAR. Both have been able to unpack LZMA2 archives for a while now.
,Crosmando,2011-12-31T10:50Z,"So what is the latest and best undub version of Tides, this torrent or this one:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6737425/

???"
,Majin3,2012-01-08T13:20Z,"Damn it, can't log in anymore and recover password shows a blank page... Whatever, I wanted to change my nick anyway.
Finally got to play the undub.
Another bug I noticed is Sonja saying ""Let's check out this island"" when you press down to change the view on Ymir which I didn't realize until I spent a lot of time searching for this ""islands""...
I also found out that ""Marpudding"" is the official Japanese name for Melprin (the trophies in the Japanese PS3 version are in English and one of them has her name) but it doesn't matter now anyway.

@Crosmando: So far it's this one."
,Aizu_san,2012-01-09T23:04Z,"Hello Majin :)

Well I'm playing the game when  I got time (Work is killing me >_"
