[Wii] Rune Factory: Tides of Destiny [USA] (Undub v1)

Done:
- replaced /Sound/stream/ (most of the japanese voices)
- edited RFF2.dat (essential fÃ¼r /Sound/stream/ replacement + remaining part of the japanese voices + name editing)
- adjusted /RFF2.bin (essential for RFF2.dat editing)
- replaced /opening.bnr with a custom one ("Rune Factory: ToD" as game name for all countries + sound from the japanese file)
- deleted /Movie/LOGO_MOVIE_0X.sfd (no company logos, only wrist strap screen before the opening)
- deleted update partition
- scrubbed

Still to do:
- change all names to the original ones (takes too long)
- change the game name and all logos back to "Rune Factory Oceans" (too difficult)
- properly edit RFF2.dat (don't feel like messing with pointers to save 15 MB)
- delete wrist strap screen (too difficult)
- search for bugs~

Name changes back to the original ones (or at least some romanization close to that):
Aden -> Azel
De Sainte-Coquille -> Hattain Viviaju
Maerwen -> Melprin

Enjoy!
