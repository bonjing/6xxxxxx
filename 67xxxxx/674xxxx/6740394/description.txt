"Duplicity"

The recent scandals have the Graysons 
on edge, driving Conrad to pay a secret 
visit to Lydia and Victoria to submerse 
herself in her Mothers and Daughters 
charity event for mental health. The 
benefit provides the perfect 
opportunity for Emily to train her 
sights on taking down Dr. Michelle 
Banks, the psychiatrist responsible for 
institutionalizing her as a little 
girl, separating her from her dad for 
good. Meanwhile Jack and Declan face a 
difficult decision about the future of 
the bar, and Daniel's college buddy, 
Tyler, gives proof to Emily's 
apprehensions.

Evolve...or die.
