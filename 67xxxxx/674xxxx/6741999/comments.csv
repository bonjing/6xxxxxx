Unfortunatelly though, the company hasnât provided any release notes with it so we kind of donât know what exactly this patch fixes or adds. One of the changes is that the menu theme is changed to different tracks and that the default resolution is now the 720p."""

,Eraknelo2,2011-10-15T22:37Z,"Works perfectly! And I think I can tell you guys what it does. I have had EXTREME lag in this game (I play on my laptop btw), when the battery was out, (yes, the video and CPU get under clocked when the battery goes out because it can't generate enough power, I know that) it lagged unplayably much every 5 seconds or so for 5 seconds, and when plugged in, it got constantly worse FPS.
My laptop has a GTX 540M 1GB, so it's good enough to at least run at lowest, which was the condition played in in the above description."
,Eraknelo2,2011-10-15T22:38Z,"Works perfectly! Can't see how you could get this wrong. Run the update, copy and paste (+ overwrite) the files, as in description.

I've also noticed a MAJOR performance increase!

Thanks, Alex!"
