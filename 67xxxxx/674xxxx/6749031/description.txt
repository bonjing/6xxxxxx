Let's see - hope this works - been a long time.

Anyway, here's a VHS tape of Loverboy videos.  Not sure if this is available on DVD.  Rip is a single file that has been coded to DIVX video with MP3 audio.  You'll have to split it into individual files for individual videos.  Included are Working For The Weekend, Lovin' Every Minute Of It, Lucky Ones, Turn Me Loose, This Could Be The Night, Queen Of The Broken Hearts, Gangs In The Street, Dangerous, and Hot Girls In Love.  Also included are scans of the front and back cover graphics.

Let me know if it downloads for you.  I'll try to seed for a few days.  Enjoy!
