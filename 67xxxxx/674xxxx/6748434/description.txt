Nintendo GameCube NTSC (US) version. Use Dolphin emulator for PC to play or De-compress the ISO by right-clicking the game within the game list and then burn the disc in slow speed in a DVD-R. Works fine on my hard-modded Wii. My upload speed is not very good so please be patient. Please seed as long as you can. Feel free to post comments. Thanks.
