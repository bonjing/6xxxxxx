,micko84,2011-10-14T14:00Z,the game is 2 disc's
,cable126,2011-10-14T14:03Z,"Still wont work till c4eva releases the the name/model of the burner he has desinged the custom firware for. Forza 4 does hash checks on the disc space that you cannot burn with a normal dvd burner, not only will the ban hammer drop big time, the game will only play sporadically (15min-30min) then it will boot you out saying you have an unauthorised disc"
,cable126,2011-10-14T14:04Z,"Just a further note, doesnt mean you cant download it (well at least im relatively sure all the data is there) you just can't burn it yet"

"
,irishguyroy,2011-10-14T22:22Z,"Sorry I almost forgot to mention this drive naturaly has the Ixtreme Burner Max firmware
Fashed to the drive.  In order for it to burn 100% 
Correctly in Img burn.
No disc erors or CIV errors. 
All we can do is wait for the release of the firmware for this particular model of drive.
This is only one drive of a possible 7 or 8 drives, currently being worked on with the Ixtreme Burner Max firmware. I would imagine over time it will support a broad range of different manufactured drives from different companies."

,spellsofmorpheus,2011-10-18T08:57Z,@every1 u cannot play this game as there is a new check in 3% of the disk space..... the solution is yet to be released in the form of a new BURNER fw that will be available shortly and correct the cIv check........ some drives might play the game with right combination of fw and dash version but beyond that its not recommended!
,spellsofmorpheus,2011-10-18T08:59Z,also don't waste the discs now as it is not an issue that can be corrected by a fw upgrade of the 360 drive but the actual burner drive requires a specific make and fw yet to be released!
,Mr.T_3,2011-10-18T14:09Z,"Those having problems playing this game obviously don't have a clue ! 

To be able to play this game off a normal DL Dvd you first need to make the dvd drive in your pc force the whole 8.5gb available to make sure the game actually fits to the disk"

hope this can help"
,neCso,2011-10-18T16:33Z,"None of you know THE truth. So here I am to explain all to you.

This game won't work until DVD-ROM firmware is released. Rip of this game is good, it's not the problem. In order to play this game, you have to wait for c4eva to release DVD-ROM fw, then buy that DVD-ROM model (one of these):
iHAS124B
iHAS224B
iHAS324B
iHAS424B
iHAS524B
iHAS624B

Then you have the ROM, bring it to your flasher to flash it with c4eva's fw and THEN you'll be able to burn 100% of game's image to Verbatim DVD+R DL disc. Right now you are only able to burn 97% of image to disc, because as you probably see, image is larger than disc capacity, but when you burn with specific ROM with c4eva's fw, it will be OK. You see, you all get errors because console notices, that your disc if not full. So that's all. Trust me, I spend much time on these things, I know it that damn good. If you want any more info, feel free to search in c4evaspeaks.com

So, let's wait for new DVD-ROM fw to come, and then we will be able to play this !"

,humbye,2011-11-12T08:30Z,"@Mecroob,

Contrary to what broxter said, just update to the latest ImgBurn version (at time of writing it is 2.5.6.0). When you try to burn the image file it will give you an error saying there isn't enough space on the disc. Choose the option that ends with ""(truncate)"". Since you're using good quality media. you should be all right. I've burned a couple of XGD3 games in this manner and all work perfectly. Make sure you burn at x2.4 speed though."
,briebee72,2011-11-13T21:09Z,"Seeing as how no one reads the commens before just bitching that shit dont work. here it is again all the new games including this one are the new xdg3 format . the game images are bigger then a standard dual layer dvd and will only burn at 97% giving you the error messages that you all been getting on image burn. In order to burn them fully 100% you have to buy special burners and reflash thier firmware to allow overburning so you can get the full 100%. you can not in anyway shape or form get your standard burners to do it and you WILL get the error messages when tring to burn these new games. NOW you can still play the new games at 97% burn but may encounter errors with your xbox like invalid disk and so on.  just google how to burn the new xdg3 disks with imageburn to find out how to set up image burn to burn these new games properly.  standard settings dont work and you will get fucked up disks.  BUT I STRONGLY suggest you get you a new burner that will allow the overburn to 100% if not when you play online you will get banned.  do some research before you come on here bitching and you will find the problem is you and not the uploader. the image is fine i burned mine 100% with the proper burner and mine plays just fine. I looked up how to do it and so can you. the burners are only around 20 bucks at xconsoles and tiger direct. all the information you need  you can find on www.360mods.net. and google how to burn the new xdg3 disks useing imageburn so you can set up image burn to burn them correctly with or without 100% burn. But I will repeat get a new burner and do 100% burns or you wil be sorry truncating the images to 97% the old way. plus you have to have the latest firmware lt2.0 to play these or even if burned right nothing will load.  the burners used to do 100% are liteon ihas revision b models. they have to be revision b no others will work. like i said xconsoles sells them for 19.95, thats cheap. microsoft is making this harder and if you dont keep up with current events and cant get your shit to work dont come here downing the uploader because you are a dumbass."
,briebee72,2011-11-13T21:19Z,PLus  stop being an impatient shit head and burn your disks on 2x speed.  burning your disks faster just makes more errors. and always use verbatim disks useing cheap ass disks to save a few bucks will just get you coasters and cost more in the long run. i use to use memorex but the new firmwares and dashboard dont like them just use verbatim. also noo abgx360 does not check the new xgd3 disks yet if you try to check them it wil just say not a valid 360 image  again all this is on the net  if you just google it and read instead of coming here and bitching your stolen games dont work.

Official release of the iXtreme LT+ v2.0 for Hitachi drives
- Support for XGD3 ixtreme backups using LT-MAX for maximum capacity on standard DVD+R DL discs.
- Support for large capacity DVD+R DL media (no errors when burning)

About upcoming iXtreme LT+ 3.0 â€“ released after December 6th
Originals will need to be analysed by XBC to gain disc topology data. This data replaces the need for ap25/dae.bin data and enables any ap25 challenge to be answered correctly. The topology data method is very efficient using only 24k and is very accurate. Each title will need its own topology data as there are differences between titles, even xgd3 titles and backups can be detected if the same topology data is used between titles.
Backups will remain the same layout but will need the new topology data inserted by the new abgx or re-dumped with the new XBC for xgd2/ap25 or xgd3 titles.
Non ap25 titles will remain unchanged

Thanks go to Team Jungle for their hard work and efforts in the development process.
Thanks also go to Team Xecuter for their support to this project."
