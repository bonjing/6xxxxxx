In this absorbing new book, Watson argues that despite the advances of the digital age, it has also robbed us of some of our best ideas; to regain them, he advocates for the benefits of boredom and going solo, among other techniques. Future Minds illustrates how to maximize the potential of digital technology and minimize its greatest downside, addressing the future of thinking and how we can ensure that we unleash the extraordinary potential of the human mind.
