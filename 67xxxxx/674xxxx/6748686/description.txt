Throughout the series, Galt and Thorpe challenge the simplistic and inaccurate assumption that digital camera resolution is all about the camera output pixels. Instead, they help serious motion picture creators to understand the difference between optical sampling from camera imagers (where resolution is totally determined) and the camera digital sampling.

They explore in depth what is meant by Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) and the compounding effect of lens MTF, camera MTF, and the MTF of subsequent production system elements.

Their discussion emphasizes that the relationship between the lens-camera MTF profile and associated residual aliasing in both the horizontal and vertical domains constitutes the only rational metric on imaging resolution. These two criteria apply to all 2/3-inch three-imager and to 35mm single-imager digital cameras. Nyquist theory, optical prefiltering and imager sampling lattice are explained in the context of camera design criteria that seek a pragmatic compromise between high MTF and minimum aliasing.
