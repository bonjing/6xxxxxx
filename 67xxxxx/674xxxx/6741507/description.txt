Arabic music is evolving. Still hardly anything (of any quality) can be found on the Net. Personally I am still looking for Latifa (Hobak Hadi). If anyone has that record or something similar, please put it on the net (its easy).

This collection contains a random selection from tracks that can be played without annoying your friends or neighbours (HQ).

Enjoy (and show our western freeloaders that greed is a western sickness)
