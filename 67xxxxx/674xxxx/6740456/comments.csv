,sharpsponge,2011-10-15T10:53Z,Anyone know if there's a way to combine these files into something watchable on a Mac? Or is there any way the hi-res version could just be uploaded as 1 .avi file for future episodes? Thanks!

sharpsponge -- Download a program called The Unarchiver, unzip these files with it, and watch the video file with VLC. This is how I do it on my Mac."
