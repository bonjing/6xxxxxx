Nice of scenebalance to up it but really just useless to not unRAR it for us first."

,zymod,2011-10-20T01:49Z,"Thanks for another great up.

Can anyone explain situations where it is better to use iso or rar format (at least when there is no compression possible in rar). If there's no compression, what is the point?"
,phrend,2011-10-31T00:03Z,zymod - The rar releases are also posted to newsgroups (google NNTP) and other file-size-limited file sharing sites - it doesn't have any benefit for people torrenting.
