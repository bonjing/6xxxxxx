The Vegan Magazine


Summer 2011 Edition


This is an incredibly informative magazine covering news, food, interviews, current issues, book reviews and of course, some fabulous and creative recipes. Read about issues as diverse as raw foods, senior nutrition, vegetarian celebs and summer festivals - there's always something for everyone. And, just for fun, there's often a comics and crossword section.
