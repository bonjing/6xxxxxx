Strength & Honour - The making of Gladiator (2000)



3h:16m Documentary, ripped off the Blu-Ray with DVDFab. Not sure whether to upload this in TV documentaries or movies. It's a bonus or extra or supplement to a movie, but never got a separate release itself.

It's rare for movies to have documentaries longer than the movies themselves. Most 'extras' you find on DVDs/Blu-Rays are short PR-puff pieces with actors saying how wonderful it all was interspersed with trailer footage.
However Ridley Scott, David Fincher and Peter Jackson have embraced the DVD/Blu-Ray format and the notion of feature-length documentaries. Unfortunately, James Cameron and Steven Spielberg haven't.

This is the 7-part, 3 hour & 16 minute documentary of Gladiator (2000) starring Russell Crowe and directed by Ridley Scott. It's quite comprehensive - covering pre-production, production, and post-production, including the famous score.

[Note: The aspect-ratio jumps between 4:3 of the behind-the-scenes footage and the examples from the movie in widescreen, so DVDFab was a little thrown-off with this. If you force your player to be in 16:9, it plays fine. Otherwise, in auto-aspect ratio mode, there's a slight elongation during the 4:3 scenes]

If there's sufficient interest in this, I can upload some other feature-length (i.e. 2 and 3 hour behind-the-scenes) documentaries to films such as King Kong (2005), Aliens Quadrilogy, and Blade Runner.


Enjoy and Seed!!
