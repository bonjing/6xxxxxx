Quality does cost in life and movies are no exception.  2 Hour TV program 2.68G = Good watching.

A = 10

V = 10"
,dukeford57,2011-10-16T20:20Z,"YEAH, TV TEAM'S DOWNLOADS OF THIS SERIES ARE APPROX 700 MB AVI FILES AND ARE OF GREAT QUALITY. SOMETIMES BIGGER AIN'T BETTER. YOU CAN PUT 6 EPISODES ON A DISC. WITH THIS FILE ONLY 1. UNLESS YOU CAN AFFORD DUAL LAYER. IF WE COULD, WE WOULDN'T BE DOWNLOADING FREE VIDEO."
