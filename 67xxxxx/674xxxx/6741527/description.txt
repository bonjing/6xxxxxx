An audacious hidden-camera series with Chris Hollins. An acting rogue tradesman tries to rip people off in their own homes using well-known con tricks to show how easy it can be to be taken in. Paula from North Wales has no idea that the rogue roofer is trying to con her. Roger plants muddy tennis balls in her gutters to convince her to sign up to his costly clean-up and roof repair worth several thousand pounds. Will she sign his contract? Meanwhile Gary from Kent is set up by his wife, who calls in Roger to fix their erratic boiler. Using matches to char an old computer part, the bogus gas fitter tries to convince Gary that a replacement circuit board is needed. Will he fall for one of the oldest tricks in the book? Police and Trading Standards officers in Yorkshire explain how hidden camera technology helped them to crack down on so-called 'distraction burglaries' carried out by an infamous local fraudster.
