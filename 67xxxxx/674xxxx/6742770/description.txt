Editorial Reviews
Let it be known; this is not your typical Alela Diane record. There is no banjo plucked and drenched in ghostly reverb, no violin wielded like fine china at your chest cavity, no chiffon blowing curiously in the wind and most importantly, nothing vaguely freaky going on that goes beyond the inevitable waxing and waning of the moon. Rather, there comes a time when artistic pursuits warrant a new approach--one that reflects personal growth and its continued path--and therein lies the root base of the expanded sounds of Alela Diane and Wild Divine, released worldwide on Rough Trade Records.
