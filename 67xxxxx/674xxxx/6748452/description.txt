No DAT file or MD5 check this time. Kind of rushed this out just to get it out there but it should be the same level of quality as normal. The number next to the book indicates quality (five is the best). Not a ton of new books but some good ones.

Thanks to all uploaders who contribute.


Enjoy and Seed!!
