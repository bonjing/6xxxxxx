   Evenside Church is an upstanding and venerable institution that has    
   served African-American families in rural Maryland for 200 years.      
   Minister Karl Upton is proud to be its young, up-and-coming assistant  
   pastor. Karl takes the Gospel and his calling very seriously, so when  
   God calls him to reach out to at-risk young people in his community,   
   Karl can't say no. The world of the poor, however, is not nearly as    
   simple as Karl had imagined. As he brings their world into contact     
   with his own, sparks of conflict and controversy ignite into a scandal 
   that threatens his family, his faith, and the integrity of Evenside    
   Church. Trapped in a web of secrets, accusations and temptations, Karl 
   must face the shadows that haunt not only the poor, but his own family 
   and church as well. It is a struggle he seems destined to lose -       
   unless his faith in God's greatness can dispel the doubts that have    
   befallen his soul and the good people of Evenside.
