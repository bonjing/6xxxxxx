On Thursday's Mark Levin Show: The Democrats are eyeing your 401k and are going to want to tax it. There is no way the Left is going to allow all this money to go untouched. They want to tax and take away more of your liberty and property and share it with everyone, which is what a statist does. Mark also goes into Herman Cain's 9-9-9- tax plan, and gives the conditions on which he would support it. Hank Williams Jr. calls in and talks about his new song, "Keep the Change," as well as the reaction of him leaving ESPN Monday Night Football. Finally, Rick Santorum calls in and talks about the Republican primary dates.
