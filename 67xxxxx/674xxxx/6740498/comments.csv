I have tried not to be a leech and offer some of my downloads in a format that simplifies my efforts.

Mr Pink skull ""thetorrentlord"" again sticks his 2 cents in not knowing of what he talks.

All my complete seasons are rar files done by the folder.

After lots of thought, I have decided that NCIS Season 6 is my last torrent upload.

the effort to return favors is not worth the agravation of dealing with irratating, self centered, ignorant, know it all types that know nothing."
