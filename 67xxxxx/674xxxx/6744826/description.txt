A portrait of Vaclav Havel behind the scenes starting approximately in 1993, as his country contracted from Czechoslovakia to the Czech Republic. We see him talking candidly, and with a fair share of sarcasm, with his aides, family and friends. Not in any way an analysis of the man as a politician, unless one wants to bring in rather irrelevant observations to the table for criticism. He meets Bill Clinton, the Rolling Stones, and many others, and really, gives the impression of being a citizen of the world more than anything else. I gather calling him Citizen Havel was not anything novel for this documentary.  There's another one called "Citizen Vaclav Havel Goes on Vacation" from 2006. If anybody happens to have "The Power of the Powerless", yet another documentary, from 2009, do post it.
