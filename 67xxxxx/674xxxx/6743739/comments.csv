These Torrents Are Way heavily seeded @extremeshare. User registration Is Open...  Cuz They want More Users. ""TeamGenti 2X DVD's Are Released Here @ Max Speed""

If You Download any freeleech torrent >Rule says

""This torrent has FreeLeech
The download will be deducted from your account after you seed for 72hours.
In case you won't seed for 72H, the download won't be deducted."" >> Please Note .. If You download a ""freeleech"" torrent @3GB you need Not to Upload back 3GB. Just seed back the time/More that they requested

Most Of The Torrented games by scene release are ""Freeleech"" , so have Fun.. this Only applies to the Pussies around here that complain about ""Seed Seed"" bla bla.. which makes This about 47% of TPB

,fine_wine,2012-01-10T23:03Z,"Actually, the 2.6 patch replaces the pes2012.exe in the install directory, so its no need using the crack.

I tried everything. The way I should. I even took the steps again, restarting each time i used any exe file.

I tried to run it in different compatibility modes too. Same problem

I normally run into this http://postimg.com/image/58000/photo-57136.jpg pop up when I launch the game. In PES2011 & 2010, I have that response, but I'd just click 'ignore', and it'd run smoothly.

This is the avatar freezing/closing stage http://postimg.com/image/58000/photo-57138.jpg

I checked the 'specifications' tab in 'settings.exe' and saw this http://postimg.com/image/58000/photo-57140.jpg

I guess my GPU is incompatible at all. But thats supposed to be the job of the crack. I really don't wna have to touch the interior of my laptop (upgrading the VRAM). But its gna take a long time before I can get a better laptop, so I'll just exercise some patience. No knowledge is wasted. Thumbs-up solutioN-ghost


Wait a minute, the avatar created and other information has to be saved to a file, right? What if we have that savefile or optionfile and place it in the proper directory, that should mean we wouldn't have to create the avatar. Any thoughts?"

,solutioN-Ghost,2012-03-27T11:26Z,"solutioN for PES 2012 to crash in creating Avatar, first you must have the PESEdit 2012 Patch 3.1 & 3.1.1 patch. Just Google it and find the one from Pes Gaming website. It's updated every time and this is the latest so yeah, follow :-

http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56957.jpg

Open PES 2012 folder and open ""kitserver"" and open config.exe as ADMINISTRATOR

http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56959.jpg

Follow these settings

http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56960.jpg

Tick all and Slide all the S3 to slide all S1,S2,S3 to the minimum to save time :) Finally, SAVE.

http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56961.jpg

Now open manager.exe as ADMINISTRATOR and click Attach. Usually it is automatically attach-ed but just in case like mine not yet attach-ed

http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56962.jpg

SUCCESS!

http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56963.jpg

Now right-click pes2012.exe and click Properties and follow those. Usually no need but just in case.

http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56964.jpg

Now open settings.exe and follow those settings. Screen mode is in Window mode. IMPORTANT!!

http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56965.jpg

Now finally run PES 2012 and as you can see I was able to create my avatar. :)

http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56966.jpg

Now you can edit your Avatar in any way you like, just like mine, cool ! :D But it was in the lowest quality, look at my Avatar's face, it is sol blur! But hang on, it ain't over yet


http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56967.jpg
http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56968.jpg
http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56969.jpg
http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56970.jpg

Now quit your PES 2012 and go back to your PES 2012 and go to ""kitserver"" and open config.exe as ADMINISTRATOR

http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56971.jpg

Simply untick all of them and SAVE !

http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56972.jpg

Now you're ready to play or edit your blur Avatar ! Run the game and go to Personal Data Settings and click your data and you can see your cool Avatar in a better quality like mine above :b

http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56973.jpg

You can even edit your Appearance and other stuffs too !

http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56974.jpg

Now testing the game. Exhibition, my team Liverpool vs Man Utd

http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56975.jpg

Game's working fine ! That's it !

NOTE : Every PESEdit 2012 Patch that is released, you need to delete the folder ""kitserver"" before installing, that's why you're going to repeat the above steps on config.exe again ! Have fun"

,solutioN-Ghost,2012-03-27T11:39Z,P.S Install PES 2012 then PESEdit 2012 Patch 3.1 & 3.1.1. Then simply follow those steps :D

Usually when you click ""GET THIS TORRENT"", a Launch Application will pop up and ask you to choose an application to download the torrent. Usually it finds the torrent application by itself, if not, you have to manually click Choose... and find your torrent apllication that you are currently using.

@F3MK3

Yes it is possible. Just update when KONAMI releases a new update for the game."
