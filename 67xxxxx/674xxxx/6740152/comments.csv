[V],HobbitGamez,2011-10-13T01:52Z,"It is important to note that this game is NOT an official sequel to ""New Super Mario Bros Wii."" It is a fan-made sequel created by Casper666 and published by DarkUmbra that has earned enough respect by Nintendo fans to earn it's own game ID.

This game is almost identical to New Super Mario Bros Wii, but almost all of the levels are MUCH more difficult and longer. The bosses are harder and the action is fast-paced.

It is also important to note that your Wii save file for [SMNE01] New Super Mario Bros Wii is compatible with this game. If you have already beaten that game, you can access any level in this one.

The way I softmodded mine was through letterbomb because my Version was 4.3u
it was VERY simple to do.

Go here if you have a 4.3* version http://wiibrew.org/wiki/LetterBomb (Simple instructions)
go here to submit your wii MAC addy and if you leave the little box checked beside ""Bundle the HackMii Installer for me!"" it will download the files you need to put on your SD card for you as well[(just make sure there are no other files on your SD card. Most are already formatted to FAT(aka FAT16)]:  http://please.hackmii.com/

they will send a letter that looks like a red envelope with a bomb in it in your wii messages.

happy hacking!
