NOTE:  Read by the excellent ATT voice Crystal.  Dont like it?  Dont download it. Dont complain.  Dont get in the way of serious citizens.

DISCLAIMER:  Several years ago I recall undertaking the scanning and TTS conversion of this important book.  I recall it being a very difficult layout.  Yet, my visual scan now of these files suggests that for the serious Unviolent Warrior this audio will be worth the effort, and far preferable to the delay of YEARS it may be before I have the time to clean this further.

PLEASE COMMENT IF THIS IS SEVERELY IMPAIRED.  I'm not interested in petty complaints, but if it is really unusable tell me, and I may remove it.

If there is no struggle there is no progress.... This struggle may be a moral one, or it may be a physical one, and it may be both moral and physical, but it must be a struggle. Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will. Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both.
