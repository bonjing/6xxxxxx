This time Jools is joined in what one writer recently called the 'oval of excellence', 
but we'll call the studio, by veteran British rock singer, songwriter and cultural 
innovator Peter Gabriel, reinventing his back catalogue classics like Solsbury Hill 
with the striking arrangements of the 46-piece New Blood Orchestra as featured on 
Gabriel's latest album New Blood.

Making their Later... debut are Southend on Sea's The Horrors, whose acclaimed third 
album Skying is a blend of 80s cinematic rock and insurgent 21st-century energy.

On the eve of their biggest ever UK tour, the sharpsuited, folk-driven Noah & The Whale 
play songs from one of this year's success stories, their second album Last Night on Earth.

Online sensation Lana Del Rey, a torch singer for this century who describes herself 
as 'Lolita got lost in the hood', debuts on TV with her single Video Games, which 
already has a million hits on YouTube.

Plus, there's also the witty, sleepy hip-hop poetry of Ghostpoet, who performs tunes 
from his Mercury-nominated debut album Peanut Butter Blues and Melancholy Jam.
