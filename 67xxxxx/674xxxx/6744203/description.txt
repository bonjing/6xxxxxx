An audacious hidden-camera series with Chris Hollins. An acting rogue tradesman tries to rip people off in their own homes using well-known con tricks to show us all how easy it can be to be taken in. Essex businessman Peter is set up by one of his employees, who has called in Roger to investigate problem plumbing. Our pretend rogue tries to con Peter with stories of a squirrel infestation, not realising that he has a sharp-witted consumer on his hands. Later he tries to take Nicola to the cleaners, when she house-sits for her friend in east London. He plants muddy mushrooms in the airing cupboard, to set up a toxic-mould scam, but Nicola suspects him of putting them there. Will she fall for his fungal fraud? A pensioner reveals how he fell for the tall stories of a West Midlands conman, who used fake literature to target more than 30 victims and pocket around 57,000 pounds as part of his devious plan.
