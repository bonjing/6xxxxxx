,ereveton,2011-10-16T14:27Z,"it's my first upload,i tried to make it look ok and easy to use!"
,ereveton,2011-10-17T17:59Z,"i will upload marvel's ultimate xmen,but before i waste my time,is anyone going to download it ???"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-17T19:21Z,"The first volume of Ultimate Xmen has already been uploaded in the Ultimate Marvel torrents, and the recent issues have been being uploaded by mirrormaster82, wowcabbage and gunninghawk"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-17T19:23Z,"PS. Always check Pirate Bay for items before uploading to avoid splitting seeds between duplicate torrents

But keep uploading :D"
,ereveton,2011-10-18T17:31Z,"oh thanks for the tip man!
what about Astonishing Spiderman & Wolverine?
i couldn't find a torrent about that"
,ereveton,2011-10-18T17:33Z,what about astonishing spiderman & wolverine?
,circumvent,2011-10-18T20:55Z,spiderman/wolverine individual issues to make up the story arc were uploaded by another superb comic uploader ShipJ...but I don't think anyone combined them into one torrent...
,circumvent,2011-10-18T20:58Z,"oh and btw..aside from just searching, in my opinion, you should always check the major comic uploaders (imho); mirrormaster82, wowcabbage, gunninghawk, Joshua13, and ShipJ (he does the O-Day torrents)...just something I do on a regular basis...happy uploading..off to a great start.."
,ereveton,2011-10-20T12:56Z,"thank you for the tips my friend,i'm new as uploader and i don't want a bad start!"
