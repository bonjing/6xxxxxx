The macabre black comedy Shanks (1974) was created by one of the most unlikely partnerships in the history of show business: the American horror film producer William Castle and the world-famous French pantomime artist Marcel Marceau. Released by Paramount Pictures and utilizing top-tier talent like composer Alex North, cinematographer Joseph Biroc, and production designer Boris Leven, Shanks is an exceedingly strange film, a horror-fantasy punctuated by stretches of dialogue-free narrative, morbid black comedy, and occasional sentimentality. Unfortunately, the tone of the film is inconsistent and shaky, as are the motivations of the hero, a mute puppeteer played by Marceau. The unique premise is also subverted in the final quarter as the film takes an unexpected turn.
