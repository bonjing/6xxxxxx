Or, click your way to it through explorer: C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Macromedia\Flash Player\#SharedObjects\"
,Zachk,2011-10-17T16:54Z,"Forgot to add that after going to said location, you'll see random letter and numbers; go through that and go to 'Localhost'. That's where they SHOULD be located I think."
