Thats pretty sad, 50 waiting in queue and ive personally shared it 9x now. Meaning not one of you are helping in the seeding of this. Help seed, quit being little piggies, and trust us, we can see who is downloading what from us on our torrents, we can certainly block the ips of the non sharers cuz those leechers are the reason why we get so many fakes sent to torrent. Everyones looking for a quick fix for themselves and wont help others."
