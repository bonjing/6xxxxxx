Fleetwood Mac - Rumours - Remastered CD 320k plus xtra bonus (musicfromrizzo)

Here is one of my favourite groups from the 70s with lovely
music tracks that hit the chords quite enjoyably indeed

An important group for this genre of music and the time period involved
Nice to keep this music alive around today just as much
