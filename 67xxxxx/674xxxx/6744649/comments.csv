[T],Ferrelas,2011-10-15T01:04Z,"By the way, is anyone interested in 1080i?

Remember though, interlacing is death ;)"
,sDxTc,2011-10-15T01:20Z,"Yeah 1080i Would be good, As my TV's Highest output is 1080i and not 1080p... FAIL :P"
,neXib,2011-10-15T01:53Z,Thx. Kinda waiting for HD though. Why asking about 1080i and not 720p?
,fasterthanlight,2011-10-15T01:53Z,"Thank you for the torrent. :)
And yes , 1080i would be nice. I also have a TV with 1080i."
,fasterthanlight,2011-10-15T02:07Z,Thank you for the Torrent. :)
,fasterthanlight,2011-10-15T02:08Z,"Thnx. And Yes to 1080i. :)
Sorry if I doublepost, but the comments arent working correctly."
[T],Ferrelas,2011-10-15T02:23Z,"I upload 720p by default as I come by it, but the guy who seems to be the only one providing this has been very slow with the 720p version this season, it can take 12+ hrs after broadcast before it's out.

The reason I ask about 1080i is that interlacing == death, and I though people realized that 720p really is higher quality than 1080i, but since there seems to be demand for it, I'll get that out too."
,britfag85,2011-10-15T02:29Z,"Thanks Ferrelas, 2nd week of saving my ass as i missed it again :D"
[T],Ferrelas,2011-10-15T02:41Z,"There you go, 1080i of ep 1 and 3 is up, there was none for ep 2 though, don't know why, looked around the web too (a little), but didn't find anything (except me complaining that interlacing is a horrible trade off for higher resolutions :P )."
,spartan777,2011-10-15T07:57Z,Yes please to 1080i!
[T],Ferrelas,2011-10-15T09:26Z,hd here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6745442
,Erik_O,2011-10-15T14:41Z,thx!
,twastard,2011-10-17T18:10Z,"1080i u FOOLS is no worse than 720p. infact its 720p ""mirrored"" and seeings as everything we watch is 25-30 fps then i dont see the harm. the tvs now refresh at 60hz meaning you can easy watch 1080i tv shows without thinking death. interlacing is fine in tv shows and movies. not so good in games!
60/2=30 interlacing 30fps is fine."
