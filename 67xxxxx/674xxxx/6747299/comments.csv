[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-16T16:38Z,love this series. 
,plattekak,2011-10-16T22:09Z,sad to see it has been shipped off :(
[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-16T22:33Z,"Only reason Im reading New 52 teen Titans.

Of all the stupid ass crap that got its own series, why did they have to cancel or combine all the good series. I want my Red Robin and Zatanna Back -I dont want them on teams with a bunch of other idiots"
,grrhead,2011-10-17T01:22Z,Awesome sauce!!!! My request is victorious!
,Calel1234,2011-10-17T02:21Z,"I really liked the Red Robin series (except for the last few of them, though the last one was awesome). "
[V],GunningHawk90,2011-10-17T05:43Z,Atleast Zatanna has an ongoing series. These morons seem to have wiped Power Girl out of existence :(
,grrhead,2011-10-17T08:19Z,"Yeah and I dont get it either, I mean she is always so popular with fan boys and girls even, and her last (first) series proved adequate sales. It just find it a bit off considering some of the new 52 choices and all. I hope to see her back soon. "
,Calel1234,2011-10-17T11:30Z,"I actually wasn't a fan of Zatanna. But either way, I'm grateful for Mirrormaster, GunningHawk, MrDownTown, and WowCabbage (who I just discovered two days ago). "
