TemÃ¼jin, a PC video game consisting of 6 CD-ROMs by South Peak Interactive, released in 1997.  Includes the ISOs of each disk, burn or mount.

Based partially on the life of Genghis Khan, the plot involves an unidentified character (the player) who has appeared in the Stevenson Museum where ancient Mongolian artifacts are being displayed. The protagonist must find out who he/she is and who the other people in the museum are and solve the mystery of strange goings on at the museum. Along the way you'll be helped by a ghost girl, Mei, who you free after the first mission.  The game is a live action first person adventure with 360 degree movement. It is a point-and-click adventure (occasionally pixel-hunting). The game consists of seven chapters, spread out over six disks, in each of which you must fulfill a specific goal in order to clear the act. Most puzzles are solved by examining items and combining them.

Includes a patch to install the game on 64 bit copies of Windows; confirmed to work on Windows 7.  Run xp_fix.exe with administrative privileges and in compatibility mode for Windows XP SP3.
