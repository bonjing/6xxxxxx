,bad0ne,2011-11-03T00:11Z,Is this english dubbed or subbed ? 
,Zell94,2011-11-03T10:26Z,"if you look at the info up top it says that it has both english subs and english voice, i know alot of people dont like the dub but for this particular anime i think its pretty good, i would have made it dual audio but the software i was using didnt let me"
,bad0ne,2011-11-03T12:00Z,"Was just checking too make sure, don't like the english one -.- "
,AARRGG,2011-11-18T21:58Z,i am running k-lite codec pack version 7.90. up until now i have had no need for anything else. can you please suggest the right codecs or files needed to run this set of vids? i am a huge FMA fan and would love to be watching it all again
,Hellkatbrat,2011-11-23T01:40Z,every time I try to open the folder windows explorer crashes 
,hb1979,2012-01-28T04:17Z,"i have just finish d/l this, but unable to get it to play, can only here sound. any clue to get to watch this?"
,Zell94,2012-02-03T16:40Z,"ok guys sorry, it wouldnt let me log in for a long time, had to reset everything. umm you should be able to view them perfectly by having the newest version of the k-lite codec pack, also playing them with vlc, if explorer crashes find out which episode is causing it and re-download it, chances are that it got corrupted while you were downloading, scanning the file generally works for that. if it still wont play my only advice is to use 'any video converter' and convert the files to AVI or MKV with xvid compression and keeping the resolution the same. hope this helps and sorry for the super delay :D"
