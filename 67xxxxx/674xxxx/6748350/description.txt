Lonesome Road brings the Courier's story full circle when you are contacted by the original "courier six", a man by the name of Ulysses who refused to deliver the Platinum chip at the start of the main storyline in Fallout: New Vegas. In his transmission, Ulysses promises the answer as to why, but only if you take one last job - a job that leads you into the depths of the Divide, a landscape torn apart by frequent earthquakes and violent storms.
