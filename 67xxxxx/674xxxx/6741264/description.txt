[#] INFOS (READ THIS).
------------------------------------------------------------------

(o) General Infos:

* Unattended Installation with Prompt repair option.
* Valid WGA CD-Key already inserted and no Windows XP Activation needed and a WGA crack will be also installed.
* Includes all official and some unofficial Windows XP Service Pack 3 Updates till 2011.10.11.
* Over 200 MB integrated drivers for SATA/ACHI, LAN, WLAN and Monitors.
* A lot of Windows XP settings have been already set and will be also set for new created Windows XP accounts.
* Booting and Running a little bit faster then normal, because some worthless Windows XP files and Programs are removed and all Windows XP Updates have been slipstreamed.
* After the Windows XP Installation is finished it is possible to choose if the Preconfigured Windows XP Settings and the Extra Programs should be implemented to, if nothing has been chosen in 60 seconds then the option Yes will be automatically selected.

(o) Important Infos:

* This Windows XP is not for Upgrading you must make a clean installation on a formatted Hard disk drive or Partition.
* It is possible to add Extra Programs and Custom Settings by editing the files in the directory "(source)\OEM\RunOnce" and the file "WINNT.SIF" in the directory "(source)\I386". To do this you need to use a ISO Editor and all files should be opened with a text editor like Notepad.
* If you are installation this Windows XP on multiple Computers and want the installation process to run full automatically. Then use an ISO Editor program and replace the file "WINNT.SIF" in the "(source)\OEM" folder with the one that is in the "(source)\I386" folder. If you now Boot from the Disc then your main Hard disk drive will be formatted and a new partition will be create and Windows XP will be automatically installed on this partition. Note that replacing the "WINNT.SIF" file will disable the Recovery Console and Repair Option that noramly can be run from the Disc.
* If the installation of Windows XP hangs or you get a Blue Screen error during your Windows XP installation then this is probably because due to a SATA driver problem. To fix this problem you should do the steps under "Infos on how to Remove the included Drivers and include your own Drivers". If you get a Blue Screen error then you can use also a workaround for this by going into your BIOS and turn off the option SATA/ACHI or change the SATA mode to IDE. This should normally fix the Blue Screen error, But with this workaround you will loss +/- 15% of your Hard disk speed.

(o) Infos for Newbies:

* Minimum Computer Requirements ia a "600 MHz Processor" with a "256 MB RAM" and "4 GB Hard disk drive" and a "Super VGA (800x600) Video Adapter".
* If you miss some standard Windows XP programs then open the Favorites folder of Windows XP and you will find alternative links to better programs. Some standard Windows XP programs are removed because they outdated for example the free Microsoft Outlook Express that has been replaced years ago with the free Windows Live Mail program by Microsoft.
* If you want to change the Windows XP CD-Key after Windows XP was installed then use the Tool "Keyfinder (Key Changer) v1.51.exe" that you can find on the Burned Optical Disc and in the ISO file. You can also change the Windows XP Owner and Company with this Tool also.
* If you get a malware warning about the files "Keyfinder (Key Changer) v1.51.exe" and "Windows Genuine Advantage Crack for v1.9.0042.0.exe", this is normal because almost all Anti-Virus Programs are detecting Key Changers and Cracks as malware.
* If you have a question or a problem then visit the Website "www.zone54.com", but first make sure that you can't find the solution for your problem in 10 minutes over a Web Search Engine or over the forum search engine at "www.msfn.org".

[#] HELP GUIDES.
------------------------------------------------------------------

(o) Infos on how to Remove the included Drivers and include you own Drivers:

1. Download the Driver for your SATA Controller that is in your computer and then make a new folder and extract all the files with a Zip Program like 7-Zip into the new folder (If there is no file "txtsetup.oem" in the Zip file that you downloaded then use google to find the SATA Driver that has this file included because this will not work without this file).
2. Make a new folder on your Hard disk drive and name it "WINXPCD".
3. Open the ISO file "Windows XP Professional 32-bit en-US - Black Edition v201X.XX.XX.iso" with a Zip Program like 7-Zip and extract all the files into the folder "WINXPCD".
4. If you see a folder "[BOOT]" in the "WINXPCD" folder then delete it.
5. Now go to the directory "WINXPCD\OEM" and run the file "DriverPacks BASE - Remover vX.X.cmd".
6. Download and install the program nLite from "http://www.nliteos.com/download.html".
7. Start the program and click Next and Browse to the folder "WINXPCD" and after the loading is done click two time on Next and then select the option "Drivers" and the option "Bootable ISO only" and then click Next.

10. At the Option "Label" write "WinXP_32-bit_BE" or whatever you want (Maximum 16 characters) and then click "Make ISO" and then Browse to the location where you want to save the new Windows XP ISO file and you done.
* To test if the ISO file with the new integrated SATA/AHCI driver are also working on your Computer you need to install the program VirtualBox from "www.virtualbox.org". It is important that you set in VirtualBox the Virtual Hard disk to SATA not IDE or the test will be useless.
* If you have a problem to include your SATA into your Windows XP then visite the MSFN forum at "www.msfn.org/board/index.php" and post the topic about the problem you have. But first make sure that you can't find the solution for your problem in 10 minutes over a Web Search Engine or over forum search engine before posting a new topic in the forum.

(o) Infos on how to install Windows XP from an USB Flash drive:

* First make sure that your Computer (motherboard) is also supporting USB Booting, if you can't find any option like this in your BIOS then your Computer (motherboard) isn't supporting this so an installation of Windows XP from a USB Flash drive will not work.
1. Make a new folder on your Hard disk drive and name it "WINXPCD".
2. Open the ISO file "Windows XP Professional 32-bit en-US - Black Edition v201X.XX.XX.iso" with a Zip Program like 7-Zip and extract all the files into the folder "WINXPCD".
3. If you see a folder "[BOOT]" in the "WINXPCD" folder then delete it.
4. Now download the Program WinToFlash at "www.wintoflash.com/home/en/" and install it.
5. Start the WinToFlash Program and now the Wizard will help you to do the rest, only but note that the "Windows files path:" is the "WINXPCD" folder you created and the "USB drive:" is the USB Flash drive that is connected to the Computer.
6. If you done then restart your computer and press the key to enter the "Boot Menu Option" and select the USB device that has the Windows XP on it. If the computer starts and there is no key to enter the "Boot Menu Option" then press the key for the for the "BIOS Settings Menu" and set the Boot Priority for the USB device above the Hard disk drive and then select save and exit.
* If you have a problem installting Windows XP from an USB Flash drive then visite the WinToFlash forum at "www.wintoflash.com/forum/index.php" and post a topic about your problem.

(o) How to install Windows XP new:

1. BACKUP YOUR FILES FIRST ON A CD/DVD OR TO AN HARDDISK DRIVE and download all the Up-to-Date Drivers that you need for your Computer from the "Chip Cards" manufacturer Websites.
2. Go to your Mainboard or Computer manufacturer Website and look if there's no a new BIOS update for your Mainboard (You can skip this but it is always better to have an bug free BIOS).
3. Select in your Burn program the option for Burning an Image file and then select the file "Windows XP Professional 32-bit en-US - Black Edition v201X.XX.XX.iso" and then Burn the Disc at a low speed like 4x to avoid missing file errors if you install the Windows XP. If you need a good Burn Program i recommend the free ImgBurn program at "www.imgburn.com".
4. Insert your burned Windows XP Disc in your Optical Disc Drive and then restart your Computer. If your Computer starts you should see the message "Press any Key to boot from the CD." if you see this then press a random key on your keyboard. If you don't see this message then you need go into your "BIOS Settings Menu" and set the Boot Priority for the Optical Disc drive above the Hard disk drive.
6. If Windows XP has loaded the drivers then press on your Keyboard the key "ENTER" and then press the key "F8" and then press the key "ESC".
7. Now select the Hard disk drive where you want to install Windows XP (Default is "C:") and then press on your Keyboard the Key "D" and then press the Key "ENTER" and then press the Key "L".
8. Now select the same Hard disk drive again (Default is "C:") and press on your Keyboard the Key "ENTER" and then you should select the option "Format the partition using the NTFS file system (Quick)" and then press the key "ENTER".
9. After the Windows XP installation is finished you need to install all the Up-to-Date Drivers for your Computer and then your DONE. :-)
* If you get corrupted file error(s) or missing file error(s) during your Windows XP installation then you should try this:
1. Burn the Disc at the lowest possible speed.
2. Don't use old scratched Discs.
3. Try to clean your Optical disc drives.
4. Use another Optical disc drive to install Windows XP.
5. Try to install Windows XP from a USB Flash drive.
