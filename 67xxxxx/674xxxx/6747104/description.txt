There\\\'s this neat song named Grievous Angel, and this torrent contains the elements which comprise it. Within:

`rendered channels (32 bit 44.1)
`samples
`Renoise project file (.xrns)
`wav (16 bit 44.1)
`mp3 (320)
`version of GA, without percussion
`version of GA, only percussion
`short description

Up for grabs, but won\\\'t be forever (2 gigs is still a significant portion of my hard drive).
