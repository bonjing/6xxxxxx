Yes, I won't add them.
You can install them yourself.

Write with minimal speed. Let's say 4x.
If it doesn't help, try using another type of empty CD's.
Good luck."

You need to make sure that you burned the CD correctly and your 1st boot device in BIOS is set to your CC/DVD ROM.
Search Google how to do it.

Oh, come on! Did you really Google it yourself?
The first result will send you to driverpacks.net which is where I get SATA drivers from.

No, you only need to go to

When you click in there, microsoft will look for any updates for windows."
,TheTovagulet,2011-10-31T05:09Z,"@sumitchahal  You probably did something wrong...
It works for me :) U SUCK

Various reasons why it could have failed...
- You probably extratced the files form the .iso and just putted them on the CD.
- You burned the .iso into the CD with a fast speed, making it skip some parts.
- The CDs could just be bad."
