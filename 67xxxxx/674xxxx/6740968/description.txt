DARK SKY had been founded as a school band in the very early 80â€™s in the South German city of Rottweil. Financial problems with their record company made a release of their completely finished debut album during the late 80â€™s impossible and the band more or less called it a day. After a couple of line-up changes, DARK SKY seriously returned to the scene at the end of the 90â€™s and signed a record deal with Malaysian label Life Records. The official debut album â€œBelieve Itâ€ was recorded in time and brought the band lots of success in South East Asia in 1998. 

In the year 2000, this album also saw the light of day in Europe, being signed to German label Goodlife Records. Shortly before the start of the recordings for album No.2, â€œEdge Of Timeâ€, guitarist Ashes left the band and was replaced by former band member â€“ guitarist Steffen Doll â€“ who definitely left a brilliant stamp on his comeback album. â€œEdge Of Timeâ€ was released in Autumn 2002 once again on Goodlife Records. In the beginning of 2004, the band started to rehearse and pre-produce new song material for the next album. In August 2004, DARK SKY signed a record deal with German based label AOR HEAVEN. 

The recordings for â€œLiving & Dyingâ€ at Bazement Studios near Wiesbaden, Germany were finished at the end of 2004 and â€œLiving & Dyingâ€ was released in 2005. After playing lots of concerts during 2005 and 2006 the band started to pre-produce songs for the new album â€œEmpty Facesâ€. It was again producer Markus Teske (VANDEN PLAS) who made sure that â€œEmpty Facesâ€ was provided with the required power. The recordings were finished in February 2008
