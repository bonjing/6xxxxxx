"Subject 9" 

Olivia uncovers a dangerous force that 
may be connected to Walter's past 
experiments with the drug Cortexiphan. 
Their investigation forces Walter to 
leave the lab for the first time in 
years as he and Olivia head to Massive 
Dynamic in New York to examine old 
case files. Walter struggles with life 
outside the lab as he comes face-to-
face with the demons of his past.
