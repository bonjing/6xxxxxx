,u2r1,2011-10-14T14:40Z,"maybe suggest use more info of the torrent in q
rather than the description you already got
all mumbo jumble to me"
,PegazAss,2011-10-14T22:41Z,also not working :-/
,otnemem,2011-10-15T00:05Z,up it on fileserv or something and link it and I'll seed it.
,otnemem,2011-10-15T00:07Z,"or download this same torrent, set it to save the file to the folder where you have the original file and watch it seed."
,marty2004,2011-10-15T00:47Z,"guys help, never had a problem uping  shows to you, it just wont seed? what am i doing wrong? using bit torrent 7.5 can someone up a new step by step guide to this version, its different than the others."
,otnemem,2011-10-15T02:49Z,"for now you could try as I said on my second comment, then next time you could try using another torrent client perhaps? it's very straight forward with uTorrent."
,mohbq,2011-10-15T07:49Z,agree with otnemem
,myseee,2011-10-15T11:42Z,"could you please upload it to somewhere, like rapidshare or?"
