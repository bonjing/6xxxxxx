Chris's recordings have always been rooted firmly in the blues with a rock and roll edge which further established Duarte as one of the rare musical talents of his generation. Blues In The Afterburner continues in the tradition of smokin' blues with doses of heavy psychedelia throughout. Blues In The Afterburner contains a heavy load of Duarte 's legendary blues guitar chops over a diverse set of grooves and lyrical themes.
