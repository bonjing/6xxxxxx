,Dedward76,2011-10-17T05:44Z,"Hey, quinchO if your on this site obviously you have not bought the DVD.I'm just trying to encourage leeching S.O.B's like yourself to seed.You are a fu*king troglodyte!   "
,coolbeans69,2011-10-17T07:19Z,Not ps3 friendly. Works in wmp though. Quality looks good.
,Kooblukhan,2011-10-17T21:54Z,"Definition of TROGLODYTE
1
: a member of any of various peoples (as in antiquity) who lived or were reputed to live chiefly in caves
2
: a person characterized by reclusive habits or outmoded or reactionary attitudes 

Sounds like Dedward76 is the troglodyte mr outmoded and reactionary.  only tards spam paragraphs bitching about seed/leech ratios.  why is it so many wannabe hipsters use this word without ever looking up a definition first?

Thanks for the up frogs"
,Dedward76,2011-10-17T22:34Z,"I did use the definition right I called him a caveman, but thanks for confirming that, Professor Koobulkhan...(only leechers would retaliate my comments, feel justified now).Any way I got it now and seeding a few...Thanks! "
,Dedward76,2011-10-17T23:58Z,"Definition of Koobulkhan
1
: a person who has to use a dictionary.
2
: will use the words from the dictionary to try and make an intelligent sentence. "
,Kooblukhan,2011-10-18T01:52Z,"Why, exactly, would you call him a caveman there?  Pretty obvious to anyone reading that you did not, in fact, understand the definition.  But by all means, continue posting hilariously poor excuses for insults at me.  I DO even use the dictionary sometimes.  I mean gosh."
,Kooblukhan,2011-10-18T01:56Z,"Oh and like everyone else here I'm sure, I downloaded this in about an hour.  So maybe don't live in bumfuck and get a decent internet connection.  Lol maybe you should get a new cable line into your cave :)"
,Dedward76,2011-10-18T22:25Z,"For the last time I called him troglodyte because only a neanderthal would tell some to buy the DVD, when there on a web site like P-Bay.It's obvious you have never tried to download something that's rare (and takes forever or cuts off)Ya I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth like you.Noticed you called me a wannbe...funny coming from someone who used LOL and a smiley face.That's o.k. most women or childern are into that short form text garbage."

""That's o.k. most women or childern are into that short form text garbage.""

Nothing wrong with attracting the opposite sex.

Anyway, as the third party here, i say Kooblukhan won that, and you really outlamed yourself a couple of times there...

Moving on... Anyone actually going to give a visual rating for this rip? Or do we all have to read comments from people who watch Big Bang Theory too much?"
,Blacker.Death.Metal,2011-10-19T15:53Z,"I'll do it!

The start had me worried, some visual tear and artifacts, but none after that.
Overall good quality.

For file size, and source, i expected a little more, but only a tiny bit. True to the screenshots (some minor blur). Audio had no flaws.

V:8.5
A:8
M:7

Not the best movie, but couldn't expect more from a superhero movie."
