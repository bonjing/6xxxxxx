The old BitComet crap that you created this torrent with has been obsolete for years."
,chaiyont,2011-10-17T09:53Z,"BitComet works far better than the latest versions of Utorrent which I gave up on. Hung all the time. Oh, I am not the only one. Lots of people have abandoned uTorrent. Vuze is crap, IMO.

BTW, this is my first UP in ages, so it there is a problem (other than a crappy Asian Internet connection) downloading, let me know and I'll see what I can do."
,chaiyont,2011-10-17T13:51Z,"OK - I see what you mean - the padding files. Downloading with Bitcomet is no problem, but that is not good. I will redo the torrent with Utorrent shortly.

Sorry - everyone!"

If it is not a problem, you should delete this. I have done a new torrent file and uploaded it already."
