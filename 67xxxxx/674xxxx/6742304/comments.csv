,Bruza005,2011-11-13T02:06Z,"Hey i get this message when trying to rip a Transformer bluray:

The AnyDVDHD trial is intended for functionality testing only and,
for business reasons, updates for processing some new discs are not available.
ERROR processing Blu-ray disc!

Some other discs has worked fine...i suspect some of the newer discs requires access to their database.....any help appreciated!! 

PS i have the database check unticked...."

,Someonefun124,2011-12-01T21:10Z,"Much like Bruza005, I can't rip certain Blurays.

However, I disconnect from the Internet when I try to rip Blu-rays, so I get a different error message.  It wants to connect to the Internet to download an update.

It won't rip certain Blu-rays unless if I download the update.

Any suggestions?
