The Bay City Rollers Greatest Hits 320k 2010 CD(musicfromrizzo)

This was a group I also now and then enjoyed during my growing up years.
Oldies style songs like "The Way I Feel Tonight" "I Only Want To Be With You"
and "Saturday Night" were fun thrills. There is a bit more rock style
to some of their numbers however there is enough of the stuff I used
to like to be quite happy with the CD for whatever I can pick for my
own collection updates now.
