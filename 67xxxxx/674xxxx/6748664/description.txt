Robert Axle, an eccentric inventor turned ego maniacal infomercial guru, loses it
all when one of his inventions maims thousands of customers. After 8 years in maximum
security prison, Axle is ready to redeem his name and rebuild his billion dollar empire.
But first he must convince his estranged 22 year old daughter to let him live with her
and her quirky, over protective roommates.
