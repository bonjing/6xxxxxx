,rkodrkod,2011-10-21T07:28Z,"Any word on that detection? Heuristics? What does it ""detect""? The usual stuff, dropper or something?"
,Thricemice,2011-10-24T12:44Z,Yep malware detected with a scan. Used malware bytes. Avast didn't detect it like it usually does when I downloaded it. Noticed problems after downloading and they got better when I got rid of it. Don't download this guys. 
,PyRaTu,2011-10-29T16:24Z,isn't work :((
,Silver4k,2011-11-01T01:16Z,"I'm guessing what's being detected as a virus, is the nfoviewer program. Everything I tested that on, has shown it to be a virus."

I doubt you are who you say you are but I would love to buy this game ligit but we don't use credit cards too often in our country and PayPal is not available here and there is no boxed release sold so a pirated download can not count as a lost sale in 3rd world countries as we can either pirate the game or can't play it at all for the time being.
Rest assured that your game will sell in countries where people have the means to buy it."
