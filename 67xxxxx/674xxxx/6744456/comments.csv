,jeffabe3,2011-10-16T12:41Z,"V: 9
A: 5

Audio sounds like crap, very low quality."
,TM85,2011-10-16T23:03Z,"Video = 9
Audio = 0

The AC3 5.1 was ripped into 2 channel...

But each side is a blend to all 5 channels...

It is in effect MONO DISTORTED...

It is terrible sound... The real audio in this movie is fantastic...

Get this instead:
