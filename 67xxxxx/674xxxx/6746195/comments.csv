,Windwood,2011-10-15T18:17Z,"well i am using it and its work for me so i upload it 
try and see"
,SR666,2011-10-15T18:29Z,It does indeed appear to work.
,MiniZaggy,2011-10-15T21:35Z,"It works. I had this start up problem, theres was a black screen and got back to windows everytime i tried to lauch ithe game. This resolved to problem. Don't forget to add /offline to the shortcut. Tested on Windows 7 64 bits, nvidia video card."
,MiniZaggy,2011-10-15T21:43Z,I forgot to mention that I use Prophet patch (and never used the skidrow crack)
,seososeleos,2011-10-16T01:57Z,thx works good
,daveron,2011-10-16T14:08Z,Doesn't solve my problem - game still crashes after few turns in-game.
,d0000h,2011-10-16T19:11Z,"Works for me (Win7-64, nvidia). All I did was install the skidrow version, copied over this crack and then created and modified shortcut as mentioned. I did not install any other skidrow or profit patches.

Game crashed once while I was trying to save a game. Otherwise finished first tutorial map (1h?) with no other problems.

(I tried with and without vsync and they both worked fine)"
,d0000h,2011-10-17T08:06Z,"Hmm well FYI. I started with clean install and this fix. Things seemed to work OK as I finished first map. Then I updated with prophet 1.1 and no matter which .exe I used it would not let me continue to second map.
Perhaps it was because of the upgrade, anyway I:

- disconnected internet
- reinstalled
- blocked all 5 .exe with firewall
- updated with prophet v1.1 
- created shortcut with /offline
- added [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers]
""tdrLevel""=dword:00000000 
to registry (some kind of nvidia fix for some problems. I don't know details)
- and now have played through to second map
- NO CRACK was needed"
