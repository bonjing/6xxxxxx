,cjsing4,2011-10-13T14:06Z,Can you make a discography of Snoop Dogg? It's hard to find any iTunes Ripped Album of Snoop here
,Rio_almusbahi,2011-10-13T14:30Z,buddu also Mylo Xyloto for ColdPlay this will be the best thing ever :P thanks :) 
[T],theLEAK,2011-10-13T20:08Z,"@cjsing4

MP3 iTunes Rip? (320 kpbs)

or AAC iTunes Edition? (320 kbps)"
,sahilravisherr,2011-10-13T22:49Z,can u let us know ur upcomin uploads?
[T],theLEAK,2011-10-13T22:53Z,:/
,sahilravisherr,2011-10-13T23:11Z,discographies u have in mind..
[T],theLEAK,2011-10-13T23:19Z,"Planned discographies:

*Michael Jackson Studio Albums
*Coldplay Studio Albums
*Bon Jovi
*P!nk
*Nas
*N.E.R.D
+Snoop Dogg


* = means iTunes Edition
+ = iTunes-Rip (MP3 CBR)



Not accurate but that's a rough idea."

[T],theLEAK,2011-10-14T17:56Z,"@lwhennen

Is the artist well-known?"
,lwhennen,2011-10-14T22:18Z,"@theLEAK yes i would say so probably most well known for their song handlebars... Also I was thinking of another good request though daunting would be Lil Wayne. Albums would be Tha Block is Hot, Lights Out, 500 Degreez, Tha Carter, Tha Carter II, Tha Carter III,The Leak Ep, Rebirth, I Am Not a Human Being, Tha Carter IV. What do you think?"
[T],theLEAK,2011-10-14T23:53Z,"@lwhennen

Lil Wayne's discography has already been uploaded."
,lwhennen,2011-10-14T23:57Z,@theLeak correction I see you already have a Lil Wayne torrent but could you please add tha Carter IV itunes edition at 320kbs your current one is 256...
,lwhennen,2011-10-15T00:02Z,@theLeak one more thing I was shocked to find(Your torrents are usually perfect) that on the Lil Wayne Discography your missing the last three songs on the album I am not a human being according to the itunes track listing... I would appreciate it if you could upload these or point me in the right direction :)
[T],theLEAK,2011-10-15T20:18Z,"@lwhennen

No need to point direction. Just need to re-do it, it will be uploaded soon. It will include Lil Wayne's Complete Discography and studio albums of Young Money's artist such as Drake, Nicki Minaj, Tyga, Birdman.
