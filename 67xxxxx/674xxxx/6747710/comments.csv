Quality work as always.  Much appreciated.  "

*shakes head* Your ignorance and incompetence to read information. Amazes me as the instructions and key are located in several places in the description above and in a text file and a nfo file in the torrent. The key is clearly located you eyeless buffoon. Also I was ask you to go take that potty mouth some where else. You obtuse, uneducated, mindless, cretin!

Also if you properly read the description above you will notice that the game has been tested on a 32bit vista system. If you are running a 64bit win 7 system I can say it will work on not. Hence why I state it (hopefully win 7) Also stated to play on line you will need a proper legit key.

So again I will state this for all the ignorant fools that do not decipher data. READ THE DESCRIPTION PROPERLY BEFORE POSTING!

,greggermain,2011-11-15T05:01Z,"Hi I just downloaded this torrent and when i tried to open either one of the disks it says the trial run has expired, iam not sure if Iam doing anything wrong? I dont really understand the instructions about mounting the image either."
,greggermain,2011-11-15T05:42Z,"Nevermind, after snooping around on the internet i figured out what mounting an image is. Thanks Servius, appreciate the time you put in"
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-12-06T15:15Z,@greggermain - I am at this point just going to ignore your question. Not out of rudeness more out of ignorance. If you have delt with games from here before then you should know. If not then read up. Via google!
