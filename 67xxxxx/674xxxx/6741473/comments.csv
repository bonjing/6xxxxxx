,haidaboy,2011-10-14T23:52Z,"Not bad at all for a cam.

A-8
V-6

Cropped a little, but not enough to interfere with viewing.

Sync is off in a couple of places.  But again, not long enough to be an issue.

Played fine in VLC Media Player.

Thanks BONE for the upload."

,AriGold45,2011-10-19T22:01Z,"Christ, what's up with all the ""i found a better version at..."" shit?  First of all, go away you fat fucking trolls.  Second, the movies that you find there are the exact ones you find here, only some of those sites stream and/or download instead of just download.  Gay"
,drewkrew,2011-10-23T17:48Z,"A: 5
V: 6

CAM does have a flicker and audio is slightly echo-y (typical of a camcorder microphone) 
Its ok-ish to watch though, so dont let it put you off."
