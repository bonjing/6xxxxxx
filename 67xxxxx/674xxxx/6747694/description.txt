Beyond Ryan Adamsâ€™ well-documented personal life â€” his marriage to Mandy Moore; his battle with the hearing disorder Meniereâ€™s disease â€” lies the fleshy heart and soul of a brilliant singer and songwriter. His fragile lyrics and his voice, sounding strong and clear, better than it has in years, twist into a perfect union on â€œAshes & Fire.â€

Still scrappy and floppy-haired at 36, Adams has released almost one album a year since leaving alt-country band Whiskeytown a decade ago, starting with his first solo album, 2000â€™s â€œHeartbreaker.â€ â€œAshes & Fireâ€ recalls the best of â€œHeartbreaker,â€ except inverted, matured. Instead of strumming acoustically about the shreds of a relationship, he sings softly and nostalgically about distant youth and a love-filled future: its hopefulness, its vulnerability.

Ballads â€œLucky Nowâ€ and â€œInvisible Riversideâ€ have the kind of clamped-to-your-brain melodies that drift into territory worthy of â€™70s classics. â€œChains of Loveâ€ is upbeat, with an orchestral kick. Norah Jonesâ€™ piano fills in the gaps on several songs, alongside his wifeâ€™s harmonies and keyboard by Tom Petty right-hand Benmont Tench. The smoothness of producer Glyn Johns (Bob Dylan, the Band) can be felt everywhere. â€œI Love You But I Donâ€™t Know What to Sayâ€ actually says it all, with words that set your eyes close to tears: â€œI promise you/ I will keep you safe from harm.â€

Embedded in a world of crashing, pounding pop music, Adamsâ€™ solo rawness brings with it sweet release.
