The world around us hangs in doubt

You face a crime that we'll hear about

To pay the cost, would never be the same


Eternal lovers, we're not to blame

There's no mistake, there's no refrain

The same surroundings that stood

Are here again - this time around


As I look around you can't be found

To lose you, I'd rather see the endless

Time and space go passing by


This time around

This time around


So look around, we all will be found

In love


The world around hangs in doubt

You face a crime that we'll hear about

To pay the cost, would never be the same


Eternal lovers, we're not to blame

There's no mistake, there's no refrain

The same surroundings that stood

Are here again - this time around


As I look around, you can't be found

To lose you, I'd rather see the endless

Time and space go passing by


This time around

This time around


STILL BIG LEGEND FOR ME!!!!"
