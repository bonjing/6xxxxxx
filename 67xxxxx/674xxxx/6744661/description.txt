Bee Gees - Mythology: The 50th Anniversary Collection



This is the newest and amazing last collection celebrating the 50th anniversary of them as a band. Each disc compiles each member favourites, including one disc devoted to their youngest brother Andy, who was never really a member of the band, but his albums were full of Bee Gees compositions, and were mainly produced by Barry.

If you like the Bee Gees this is the compilation to have, along with 1990's "Tales from the Brothers Gibb".

Includes the hits, rarities, and never released tracks.

Full artwork included. You may notice that according to jpgs names, a couple of them are missing, but that's just because I've screwed it up while naming the files. Nothing's missing - at least, that I know of.
