thanks!"
,mecooley,2011-12-08T10:22Z,Sorry guys! My source for the comics on here is the internet and I find these everywhere and put them all in this torrent! I have not found issues 14 thru 16 anywhere! LOL and it makes me mad! I buy the Volumes as they come out! Not the separate issues! So when i receive the next Volume. I will comment again with a link to the new torrent for the comics! Ok Thanks guys! 
,mecooley,2011-12-23T16:14Z,"New torrent that has Issue 14. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6907615
