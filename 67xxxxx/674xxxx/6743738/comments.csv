,teikyo30,2011-10-18T05:39Z,"My computer hated this file. Not sure why, but it kept crashing explorer."
,pb185,2011-10-18T19:20Z,"A10/V10, movie looks fantastic, esp for only 2.2gb. 
I'd give the movie 8, but i'd watch it for the animation alone.
And it is AC3 DolbyDigital, i don't know what people are so obsessed about with DTS, there is almost like no difference! Perhaps if heard in juxtaposition, but who's got time for that!!! besides, all Sky movies and Box office are transmitted in DD! 
Anyways, thanks for the up, good work man. Looking forward to Hangover 2!"
,dta151,2011-10-19T20:24Z,How do you burn a Mp4 file to dvd with no quality loss?I use tsmuxer for mkv files to create a AVCHD but it wont work with mp4

Seems a little weird too that it's been changing in the % complete, 99.9% when I first looked, then when I checked again it was at 99.6% and keeps changing. Anyone know what's up with that? =) Looking forward to see this movie. Thanks for ul."
,SergeantSpoon,2011-10-30T00:23Z,Cool they made a movie of World of Warcraft's new expansion!
,Tromper,2011-11-01T20:45Z,"Hey guys I'm having a problem with this torrent and it seems to be happening with increasing frequency with TPB torrents. I'm not an expert at this by any means but I'm not exactly new either. I can't get through to any of the trackers-they say invalid url and the piratebay.org/announce says closed by peer. My connection is good, another DL is coming in fast and 2 trackers are working well. Any help would be appreciated."
