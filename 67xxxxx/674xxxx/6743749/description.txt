Force of Nature: The David Suzuki Movie 
David Suzuki, iconic Canadian scientist, educator, broadcaster and activist delivers a last lecture-what he describes as "a distillation of my life and thoughts, my legacy, what I want to say before I die." Filmed before a live audience, in front of a memory box of moving, distilled images, he articulates a core, urgent message: we have exhausted the limits of the biosphere and it is imperative that we re-think our relationship with the natural world. Suzuki looks unflinchingly at the strains on our interconnected web of life and out of our dire present circumstances, he offers up a blueprint for sustainability and survival. 
The film interweaves the lecture with scenes from the places and events in Suzuki's life. As such, the film is a biography of ideas forged by the major social, scientific, cultural and political events of the past 70 years.
