,brutal_product,2011-10-14T07:05Z,"to all concerned:
please seed at least for a day or two for each episode to spread this important program, regardless of ratio. with the current (heh) Occupy Movement, and people-like me-who do not have access to this channel, it will be greatly appreciated for the future of not only this show, but the information involved. Thank you. and ty theburningbush although we seem to have lost the meta seed at about 87.5%. :("
,GForce1Down,2011-10-14T07:45Z,Thanks theburningbush for this one and the previous dozens I've downloaded from you.  I'm also stuck at 87.6% for this date's show.  Could you reseed so we can complete the program?
,brutal_product,2011-10-14T09:15Z,"am going to attribute this delay to an act of nature, eg. theburningbush's ISP went down and/or electrical failure, etc. 
keep it up tbb! I'm already @5.8 UL.
seed or die ( at least in this case for a day/episode or two!)

,barometerrising,2011-10-14T14:52Z,"Yes, tbb must be having a real problem, and it's too bad, because this IS such an important program. I hope tbb is back soon. When the program is finally downloaded, I promise to seed for at least a full day."
,edesart,2011-10-14T23:03Z,"Blows, 92.3% and holding. Is TBB the only place in the whole wide world seeding these? That blows."
,GeekHillbilly,2011-10-15T05:51Z,Stuck at 92.3%
,OrpheusDude,2011-10-15T06:08Z,"Just to confirm: it is on Demonoid, posted 14 October with the wrong broadcast date given.  It's 287 MB but downloaded in 3 minutes 42 seconds.

I trust theburningbush will be back up and running in due course, and will remain my primary source for Olbermann.

If any of you are occupying Wall Street (or anywhere else in the USA) I'd be right there with you if I were in the country!"
[T],theburningbush,2011-10-15T14:23Z,"I need someone who's been at this longer than I to explain how long I need to seed.

I've been uploading these for at least a couple months, and this is the first problem I've seen re: seeding.

For this specific torrent, I had uploaded over 200M for a 133M file, and at the time I quit seeding, there were about ~65 seeds and ~70 peers (AKA ""leechers""). 

When I just now re-started this torrent, there were 15 seeds and 255 peers, and yes, many folks appeared to be stuck at 92.3%.

Q: Why weren't these ""stuck"" people being ""serviced"" by the other 14 seeds?

Q: When can I finally quit seeding a given torrent, especially when lots of other folks are seeding it?"
[T],theburningbush,2011-10-15T14:28Z,"Addendum: the tracker at openbittorrent reports that 76 people downloaded this torrent. With all the folks that were stuck at 92.3%, does that mean that none of those 76 stuck around as seeders?"
[T],theburningbush,2011-10-15T14:32Z,"OK, I now see 175 seeds and 135 peers.

Surely I can quit seeding this now?

Surely I'm not some choke point?"
