Game is not running. Any solution?"
,MalFusiOn,2011-10-19T05:46Z,"@ everyone with AppID error
go to where you installed the game and open ""skidrow.ini"" with notepad. simply make the first line under [Game] look like this.

# Environment Application Id.
AppId = 65842

 the appid there can also be changed to delete all progress on your profile if you want to do that."
,MalFusiOn,2011-10-19T05:48Z,"also, yes you are meant to replace all files with the ones in the skidrow folder."
