So far, it seems to have only Japanese audio and English subtitles.

I've only downloaded the last set (Part/Vol 5, episodes 53-64), which is the one that many are waiting for the English dub on.  It seems we must continue to wait.... :("
,Xenorex,2011-10-17T09:03Z,"DOH!  Nevermind....just found it.


Excellent work!  Thanks for forwarding this on to TPB community!"
