From the OP of the Wiki entry:

""The Dance is a live performance by Fleetwood Mac, released on Cassette, CD and VHS in 1997, and later on DVD. It hailed the return of the band's most successful line-up of Lindsey Buckingham, Mick Fleetwood, Christine McVie, John McVie and Stevie Nicks, who had not released an album together since 1987's Tango in the Night. It was the first Fleetwood Mac release to top the US album charts since 1982's Mirage. Debuting at #1 in the Billboard 200, The Dance became the fifth best-selling live album of all time in the United States, with over 5 million copies sold there.

The concert was recorded for Fleetwood Mac's MTV The Dance special at Warner Brothers Studios in Burbank, California on May 23, 1997, and features the University of Southern California Marching Band who perform on the tracks ""Tusk"" (having played on the original studio recording) and ""Don't Stop"".

Although predominantly a live greatest hits package, The Dance also features new material written by each of the primary songwriting members of the band (two from Buckingham) as well as popular album tracks. For example, ""Bleed to Love Her"" was a previously unreleased track when this album was released, although the song was later recorded during the Say You Will sessions. No tracks from the Mirage album were included on the CD, although ""Gypsy"" is included in the video and DVD versions..."""
