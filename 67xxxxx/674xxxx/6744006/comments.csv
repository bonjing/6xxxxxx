,enterthehole,2011-10-14T22:02Z,Has this got the first mission glitch still?
,dumas1000,2011-10-14T23:12Z,"Rage is garbage for the PC. A technical mess and likely not worth the hassle. Half the people will not even be able to get that game to launch, and Kaos likely does not want to take the blame for faulty coding on the part of the developers. It's not the fault of release groups that Rage is effed, but release groups still take heat when the game fails to work properly. I bought the retail version of Rage, it does not run on my computer, and considering my computer's high-end specs, it is inexcuseable. Rage is incompatable with a large variety of graphic cards, or at least with the drivers for those graphics cards."
