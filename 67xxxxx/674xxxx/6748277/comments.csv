,Xanthium1,2011-10-17T00:30Z,"I want to say thanks again to RUDOS and scene4all.

Once again you've enriched my life with what you've provided...

Although others provided it initially. 

By that I mean the fighters themselves.

Then, after that... the promoters and after that, the TV network producers and blah blah blah.

I can't access this, I can't afford this. (the viewing spectacle of this event, which enriches my life to an extreme degree as do all the viewings [pirated] of combat sports [which is my only option]. I'm unable to produce the $ to pay for the PPV itself, or else I would. I sure as hell don't want to wait a day to see it at -30fps... nobody does.)

Well... I guess that's why Robin Hood did what he did... because he had a heart like yours.  Fuck the king and Fuck less privelaged.  I'm crippled and can barely walk.  But then again... We're all crippled to some extent.

Because the people deserve to have what they need.  After all, is it a crime to steal if you're starving?

Naw, but it's still important to contribute to the artist.

Just like if nobody pays for musical albums... 

The music industry itself will probably die off.

It's just so fun to get shit for free though.

Bottom line is though... thanks."
,Xanthium1,2011-10-17T00:40Z,"Holy shit! This is at 60fps. (first time since magicpotatoes)

Well I guess that if you're gonna do it then you should do it right.

Well done."
