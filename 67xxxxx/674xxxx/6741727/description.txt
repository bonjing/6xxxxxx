Courtney B. Vance is a talented actor who is often overlooked for his many fine performances. This 1995 film produced by HBO Films for airing on the popular cable network being one of them. Vance portrays an American soldier fighting during World War II who begins having an affair with a married woman (Kerry Fox). When word of their affair gets out, racial tensions emerge and the soldier stands on trial for his life all because of racial bigotry. Vance gives one of his all time greatest performances in this little known film that even by HBO standards didn't get the attention that it deserved.
