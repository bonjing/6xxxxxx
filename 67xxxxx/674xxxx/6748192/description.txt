The best of Cat Stevens  20th century masters edition (remastered) VBR
(musicfromrizzo) 

I remember having to work hard as a teenager to afford things others
were easily more given as a result of inherited wealth along the way
I suppose. Cat Stevens "Tea for the tillerman" was a CD I admired
but couldn't afford at the local department store as I liked a couple
of his songs such as "wild world" "morning has broken" "peace train"
"moonshadow" "on very young one" and "hard headed woman". I haven't
listened to these songs for decades, however while growing up I
certainly did find them fun although I mainly was a fan of Tom Jones
and Englebert along with the Bay City Rollers Donny Osmond and the
like. I had a nice expensive hi-fi stereo I bought from working part
time, my parent had a lovely house in which we lived and I bought many
records on the record of the month club plan back then.

enjoy Cat Stevens for those that like this music
that hasn't lost its appeal one bit, I'm sure
