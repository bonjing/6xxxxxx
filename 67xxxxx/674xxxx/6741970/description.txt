[/b][/color] Forget who gets to keep the ring ??? when a couple splits, the real question is, who gets to keep the friends?
Alex and Dave's wedding was supposed to be the happiest day of their lives, for them and their long-time friends... until Alex left groom-to-be Dave at the altar.
The breakup, in the words of one pal, was a "huge game changer" that complicated everyone's lives and made everyone question their own choices.
Alex and Dave were the glue that kept their urban family together: Alex's sister, Jane, a suburban housewife, and her buttoned-up husband, Brad; Max, their perpetually underemployed gay friend; and Penny, who worries about never finding the right guy.
A year later, this gang is still friends, although Alex and Dave are trying to figure out just where their relationship stands.
