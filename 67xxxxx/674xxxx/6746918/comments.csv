I have a question. I am Dutch and I know somebody who has the official version of Photoshop Elements 10. 
Could I install the dutch version by using your instructions for editing the hosts file and his serial number so I get the dutch version?
The English version of Photoshop Elements is to difficult for me."

All of us out here greatly appreciate all that thethingy has has done and all the obvious hard work that has been put into it.  I learned long ago that if it's from thethingy, it works.  Many thanks to you, my friend."

So now I have it and can not install it properly and Can not delete it either....Any Any advice would be good.. Thanks"
,Malakka,2011-12-09T14:07Z,"@ popsgog 
Go to ""Task Manager"" and kill every process that has with Adobe and/or Photoshop to to. Then you will be able to delete all. 
OR start the computer in ""Safe Mode"" (from setup/BIOS) and delete al folders. In that mode no on these processes are running. "

,Mort1s1,2011-12-14T10:25Z,I am new to this area and can not see how I download - any instruction?
,twosipp,2011-12-17T08:24Z,"This install has not shown up on my computer as a virii.

However I am a little worried.

First of all just the extract of the files. (not the install) is an exe .... why?  

Not only that it extracts something into my windows32 folder, the one folder every hacker loves.

Now.. my virus protection hasn't found anything and the software from this download is fine..but i still must ask...why the exe and the extract to win32.  
"
,RavenGal,2011-12-31T21:52Z,"Thanks Thingy! You're the tops, especially for taking the time to give clear instructions for newbie & oldies alike... :-) 

Your torrents are always A1A excellent... Happy New Year 2012"
,normabet,2012-01-01T05:52Z,"@twosipp 

That's a fair call, BUT: if you can ever trust an exe file to not be a virus it is when you got the file from thethingy. 

With every new torrent he is just trying to make it easier for everyone, that's why the extraction file is an exe (I think).

thethingy has such an amazing history of uploading current adobe/microsoft etc and provides clear product support too. He's a pirate like no other, you can always be confident about what you're getting."

,nilecrystal,2012-01-20T13:39Z,"@Mort1s1
