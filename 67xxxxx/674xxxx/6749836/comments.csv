I might have missed this one, thinking instead that it was some kind of documentary with Lesh, Kreutzmann and Weir talking about Jerry Garcia."

Quality is real nice- if 720p is what you want for your talk shows
Patton Oswalt and James Gunn chat with a host about Walking Dead and what it all means. Appeared just after the season 02 first episode so watch after you see that or some spoilers may slap you in the face.
Good times."

How can one be an expert in something that does not exist outside of the movies/tv-shows. Think i'll skip this one, and watch the show instead. However, scenebalance, you do a great job posting both interesting and uninteresting stuff, i guess both have it's fans!!!"
