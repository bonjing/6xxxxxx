
Recorded in 1962 - originally released in 1963 - this release on OJC 7812 in 2000.

Review by Scott Yanow:
This excellent CD by the classic John Coltrane Quartet (with pianist McCoy Tyner, bassist Jimmy Garrison, and drummer Elvin Jones) is highlighted by a 26-minute version of \"Mr. P.C.\" Also included on the album are \"The Inch Worm\" and the ballad \"Every Time We Say Goodbye.\" Although the sound and passion of the group on this date will not surprise veteran listeners, it is always interesting to hear new variations of songs already definitively recorded in the studios. The Paris Concert is recommended to all true Coltrane fanatics. 

01 - Mr. P.C.
02 - The Inch Worm
