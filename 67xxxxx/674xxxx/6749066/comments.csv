Completely Agree With U.. Rather I haven't Read Much, Expect one  or more. 

There is Just The Mind's Psychology which motivates ..

Yep ! , I agree it is Just Crap.. Instead of that I always prefer Novels etc."

Secondly, if you're going to read any book on self-esteem, it should be ""Honoring the Self"" by Nathaniel Brandon, if you can handle such material. Brandon was the first and I believe the only psychotherapist to present a complete treatment on the subject, exploring not only what self-esteem is, explaining it's developmental process, the reason it is required, how it gets blocked, etc. but also how to build it. 

But again, what's presented here is not a book, it is a self-hypnosis session to effectively retrain your brain for you... of course, you'd have to actually use it consistently for 30 days or so for it to work, just like you'd have to do the exercises in the books you read if you actually wanted them to work...

maybe some of us have bad sight. Others could be spending many hours driving every day and enjoy a good book. Did you ever think of that?"

Are you an idiot? Driving, running, walking, sleeping.
That's just a few things where audio books come in handy. Not to mention all the fucking activities that uses your hands.. So ignorant."
,fazal127,2012-05-01T08:23Z,"this stuff really works.i have searched this kind of material much.it helps a lot.
A good suggetion is that if you want to use many sessions than you should download this torrent or torrents like this.download a mp joiner cutter sofware than cut these sessions in that way that at start you put session which have induction and at the end put the session which has wakeup.in middle put the middle portions of the mp3's. in this way you may have upto 1 hr of long session.before gong to sleep listen it.you will sleep while listening.i am doing it for one month.very very effective it is"
