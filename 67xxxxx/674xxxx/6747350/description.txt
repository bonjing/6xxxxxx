How to play:
1) Download the game;
2) Mount or burn disc images;
3) Run Setup.exe to install (it will start automatically if autorun is enabled);
4) After installation is complete, run hgp187d.exe to patch the game;
5) Launch the game from the main executable or using the desktop & start menu shortcuts (keep the second disc inserted, I could not find a working no-cd fix).

Warning! This is a really old game. I could not get it working on Windows 7 x64, but I did play it using VMware with Windows XP SP3. It probably won't work on Vista, either. You should get a copy of Windows XP or earlier versions of Windows and use those (either with a virtual machine like I did, or by actually installing them alongside your current OS) to play the game.

If you like the game, SUPPORT the producer! I don't think you can find copies of this game anymore.
