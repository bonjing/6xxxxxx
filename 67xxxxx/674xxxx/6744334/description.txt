The 13.5 Lives of Captain Bluebear - Walter Moers

Captain Bluebear is a bear with blue fur, a creature as unique as the
fantastic adventures he undergoes. Unlike cats, which have only nine
lives, bluebears have twenty-seven. This is fortunate, because our hero
is forever avoiding disaster by a paw's breadth. In this remarkable
book, Captain Bluebear tells the story of his first thirteen-and-a-half
lives spent on the mysterious continent of Zamonia, where intelligence
is an infectious disease and water flows uphill, where headless giants
roam deserts made of sugar, and where only Captain Bluebear's courage
and ingenuity enable him to escape the dangers that lie in wait for
him around every corner. In company with our indomitable hero, we enter
a realm of the imagination that combines the fantasy of The Lord of
the Rings and The Neverending Story with the humour of Baron Munchausen,
and where anything can exist except boredom. It's a land of imaginative
lunacy and supreme adventure, wicked satire and epic fantasy, all mixed
together and turned on its head. Playful enough for young adult readers,
yet as intricate and engaging as any work of literary fiction, The 13
1/2 Lives of Captain Bluebear has the plot of a novel and the spontaneity
and humor of a vintage comic book, making it an instant international
