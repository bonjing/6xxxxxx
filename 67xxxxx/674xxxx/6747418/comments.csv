I don't know why the stupid ""BBC America"" channel just shows re-runs of Star Trek when there are so many great British shows I can't get my hands on. Thank you so much for your efforts. Please keep posting QI- you make me very happy.

Sounds weird, but apparently at least some of them would be very expensive. If QI is ever crossing the ocean, they will probably just do a remake."
