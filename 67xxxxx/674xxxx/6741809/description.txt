100 Oldies - The 4CD Best Memories collection 320k (musicfromrizzo)

While we have other posting of oldies that are certainly great
offerings, you might like the appeal of this line-up for yourself
for some particular reason - if  that happens to be so, by all means
help yourselves. Obtained as a 4CD collection with two mis-labelled tracks
which we fixed the title of, the artist couldn't be certainly determined
as the renditions are old. One track was replaced with a remastered version
while nothing else was changed other than all mp3 tags are properly affixed
for you, along with a nice image.

bringing you the best in oldies and more - please browse through all our
offerings too
