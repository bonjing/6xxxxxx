Praise be to Allah, the King worthy of worship, the Merciful and Caring Lord. He keeps His Gates open for seekers, and He encourages, in His manifest Book, people to supplicate Him[for help]. I do exalt and thank Him for Hisgenerous blessings.
I testify that there is no God but Allah, alone without parteners or assistants, and I testify that Muhammad (SAW) is His slave and faithful, trustworthy Messenger. May Allah's prayers and peace be upon him, his family and his sahaabah (companions).
