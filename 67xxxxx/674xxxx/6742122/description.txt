
Early years

Kamelot was founded in Florida by Thomas Youngblood and Richard Warner in 1991. Three years later, the band signed a deal with Noise Records; the release of their debut album Eternity followed in 1995. The next album, Dominion, was released in 1997. Later that year, drummer and founder Richard Warner and lead vocalist Mark Vanderbilt were replaced by drummer Casey Grillo and vocalist Roy Khan (formerly of Conception). With these two new members, Kamelot released their third studio album, Siege Perilous, in 1998. The band undertook their first tour during the fall, playing shows across Europe. Following this, the band returned to Tampa to write music for a new album, titled The Fourth Legacy.

Live album, Karma, Epica and The Black Halo

The summer of 2000 brought the "New Allegiance Tour" through Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Greece and Spain during which the recordings for Kamelot's first live album The Expedition were made. A few months later, the band presented their fifth album Karma. Their sixth album, Epica, was released in 2003. To support the Epica album, the band went on tour through Europe (with At Vance as a supporting band) and Japan. Both "Epica" and the band's seventh effort, The Black Halo, which was released in 2005, are based on Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's version of the legend of Faust, a man who sells his soul to the devil. To support the new album, the band went on tour through Europe and Japan. During the first leg of the "Black Halo World Tour 2005", they played a headliner show with Epica and Kotipelto. In Japan the support was Silent Force. They also played on the Bang Your Head!!! Festival in Germany and the Graspop Metal Meeting in Belgium.
In 2005, they shot their first music videos for the songs "The Haunting (Somewhere in Time)" and "March of Mephisto" from the album The Black Halo. Both videos were shot by the prolific director Patric Ullaeus. On October 5, 2005, Kamelot added Oliver Palotai as the fifth official band member; Oliver handles both keyboards and (additional) guitars.
On the second leg of the "Black Halo World Tour", they visited North America (Canada and the United States), South America (Brazil), and Europe (Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden). On February 11, 2006, the band's live DVD, One Cold Winter's Night was shot by Patric Ullaeus at Rockefeller Music Hall in Oslo, Norway. It was released on November 17, 2006 in Germany, November 20 in other parts of Europe and November 21 in US/Canada via SPV Records.

Ghost Opera and Poetry for the Poisoned

In fall 2006, the band returned to Gate Studios in Wolfsburg, Germany to record the album, Ghost Opera, which was released on June 1, 2007 in Germany, June 4 in Europe and June 5 in the US. The album was recorded and mixed at Gate Studios and Pathway Studios in Wolfsburg with producers Sascha Paeth and Miro. Music videos have been made for the songs "Ghost Opera", "The Human Stain", "Rule the World" and "Love You to Death". A re-issue of Ghost Opera labeled Ghost Opera: the Second Coming was released shortly after its predecessor. It contains the entire original Ghost Opera album and a second CD with 10 live songs recorded during a concert in Belgrade, Serbia, with additional bonus tracks, "Season's End", "The Pendulous Fall", "Epilogue" and "Rule the World (Remixed)". In December 2009, Thomas Youngblood announced that bassist Glenn Barry had officially left the band and has since replaced by touring bassist and original Kamelot member Sean Tibbetts.

In January 2009, Kamelot started working on their ninth studio album in a cabin in Norway and it was stated that the band was exploring "new sounds" and that the topics on the new album will be diverse. During early 2010, Kamelot published the titles of three songs from the upcoming album on their official website: "The Great Pandemonium", "Hunter's Season" and "Thespian Drama". They also revealed that Simone Simons (who would provide vocals for the ballad â€œHouse on a Hillâ€ and the albumâ€™s title track), and later Gus G, of the Greek power metal band Firewind, would be appearing as a guest musicians. On March 25, 2010, they began their "Pandemonium Over Europe" tour, which ended on April 26, 2010.
It was on June 21, 2010 that Kamelot revealed the title of their ninth studio album: Poetry for the Poisoned. It released by earMUSIC (international label of the entertainment group Edel) in Europe on September 10, 2010 and by the bandâ€™s own label KMG Recordings in North America on September 14, 2010. A music video for "The Great Pandemonium" was directed by Owe Lingvall and was released on September 1, 2010. Poetry for the Poisoned debuted at number 74 in the Billboard 200 charts, selling 6,100 copies in its first week.
On September 6, the band announced that Roy Khan fell severely ill during rehearsals for the upcoming North American tour, just a few days before its scheduled start, and had returned to Norway. While it was initially reported that the band would continue the tour with Norwegian vocalist Michael Eriksen of Circus Maximus in Khan's place, the band later announced that they would postpone the tour until Khan recovered from his illness so he could join them on the tour, though they did perform one show with Eriksen at the ProgPower USA XI festival in Atlanta, GA on September 10, 2010. However on December 16, due to Khanâ€™s lingering illness, it was announced that Fabio Lione of Rhapsody would replace Roy Khan for the remaining and rescheduled dates on the tour supporting "Poetry for the Poisoned".

Roy's departure and current activity

On April 15, 2011 the band released Poetry For The Poisoned & Live From Wacken - Limited Tour Edition, containing the audio from Roy Khan's last recorded show with the band. Roy Khan released a statement on April 21, 2011 and Kamelot released a statement on April 22, 2011 announcing that lead singer Roy Khan had left the band. According to founder Thomas Youngblood, the band is already searching for a new singer. They are planning on a new album after their current tour, and is scheduled for release either at the end of 2012 or the beginning of 2013.
