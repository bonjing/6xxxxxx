          It refuses installation saying that it is already insalled the permissible no of tims."
,osdmis,2011-10-13T14:17Z,it refuses to install.Checking from their server.Hence kindly post a RIP.
,aarque,2011-10-13T14:22Z,"Thanks for the up and welcome to TPB. Do you know and are you able to tell us if this package adds new, or updates existing aircraft? The reason I ask is that I recently reinstalled everything FSX, while keeping my original ""Airplanes"" folder. After applying the ERJ Vol 2.2 update, I saw that my Volume 1 planes had remained untouched and a whole new selection of the same aircraft had been added instead."
,grandfred29,2011-10-13T15:39Z,"I saw it, tried to reinstall my own product and can't too.
Wrote a message to wilco, but i think it will be diffcult to seed the new code product, cause all news installations wilco's product have a non limitted installation.

Sorry for my english, i'm french and use this language rarely :)"
,suitretas,2011-10-13T19:43Z,"anyone kindly enough to post a rip?

,saintamadas,2011-10-13T20:49Z,"For now... this baby is f**ked! As long as activation is made through the manufaturer's server, then the birdie is cripped. It will not be long before they all use the CLS B747-200 method of activating... Bottomline, where there is a will there is definitely a way. Peace!"
,mickyfinny,2011-10-13T21:15Z,"@grandfred.Written by belltaco:That update FSC 9.1 (non-Aerosoft version) is available at FS Commnader site for free, simply download, copy and paste two files, and whole update is finished. 
Tested and fully working btw,and i like the new added updates ALSO read the readme file for extra info.Thanx belltaco.
Really would appreciate a rip of this.if you can you will need to up:,Aircraft folder(respective aircraft)-FeelThere folder-Gauges folder (which should include)-A330NightPanel_feelThere.gau-HUDControl.gau-ISIS.gau Modules folder-(which should include)-AirbusNewHUD.dll-ConfigModule.dll-FSX Main folder-Uninstal_Airbus2_evo_FSX_wilco.exe.Thanx if you can"
