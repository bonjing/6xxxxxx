After his stints performing as Palace, Palace Songs, Palace Brothers, and under his own name throughout the 90s, by the end of the decade Will Oldham seemed to finally settle on the Bonnie Prince Billy moniker as the main outlet for his work. Regardless of the name he used to release his music or the musicians supporting him, Oldhams style remained largely the same, pitting shambling and often sparse music against his creaky, world-weary voice and literate lyrics.
