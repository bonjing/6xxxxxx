,killa_is_here,2011-10-15T23:44Z,"Everyone try to act surprised. Catwoman, who was confirmed as a second playable character for sections of Rocksteady Studios' Batman: Arkham City, out October 18, will also be a featured player in her own DLC release. If a recently updated GameStop product listing is to be believed, at any rate.
The retailer's product page for the strategy guide from BradyGames says that the book will include a ""bonus"" Catwoman walkthrough, with ""complete coverage of Catwoman's DLC content... all four episodes"" of it (via GamesRadar). There's no additional detail, but the wording seems pretty telling.
The mention of ""episodes"" makes it sound like Catwoman's DLC will be a bit more full-featured than additions to the game's challenge room modes. I'd wager that a fair portion of you were expecting to see some kind of more story-driven DLC for her at some point, especially since Arkham City's open-world environment lends itself pretty well to that kind of add-on.
While there's no further information available, the fact that the BradyGames guide will feature a walkthrough for the DLC strongly suggests that, whatever this Catwoman add-on is, we'll be seeing it pretty close to the game's launch, perhaps even on day one. "

,DARTHESGOOBIS,2011-12-06T15:53Z,hey how do we install? I finished the download I'm just a bit stumped... thanks :)
,technicalrevolutionary,2011-12-09T07:24Z,"I dunno, I haven't downloaded it yet, but says it's JTAG, so it is probably for Jtagged or fully hacked 360s??  At the very least it's a DLC and has to be installed using a usb stick or something.  My guess, at the moment, is that it's for JTAG only.  If you don't know what that is, google it.  If you can't even get utorrent to work, you are in WAY over your head with this one, tbh.  Go to itunes, they has musix for you there."
,technicalrevolutionary,2011-12-09T07:27Z,"Oh, fully hacked means the system firmware has been replaced with custom firmware, not just the dvd drive.  Usually it's referred to as JTAG because that's the first method used to bypass the security on the 360 CONSOLE."
,dududus,2012-01-09T02:42Z,"I have a JTAG console..

Whats the easiest way to install this?"
