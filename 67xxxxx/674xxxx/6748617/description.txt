CandyBar allows you to change the system icons in Mac OS X that you normally can't, including including the trash can, volumes, default folder, and more! CandyBar 3 also now includes a full-featured icon organizer (formerly called Pixadex) that acts like an iPhoto for your icons: collect and store your icons in the same application you use to change them!

Version 3.3.2: 
Fixes an issue where application icons could not be applied
Added fullscreen support in OS X Lion
