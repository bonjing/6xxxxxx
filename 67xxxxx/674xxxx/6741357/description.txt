Through the Wormhole Season 2

Ep8:  Can We Travel Faster Than Light
The speed of light is the speed limit of the universe...186,000 miles per second. According to Einstein, nothing can go faster, leaving the stars and distant galaxies almost impossibly out of our reach. But the dreams of star travelers are not dead. There could be ways to break the speed of light. Scientists around the world are challenging Einstein's speed limit and turning one of the most fundamental laws of physics upside down. By delving into the mystery of light, physicists are designing warp drives, hunting for wormholes, and discovering ways to teleport matter. The stars await and our chance to explore the final frontier might be within reach.
