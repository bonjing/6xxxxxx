,CrucialRhetoric,2012-02-10T12:57Z,"Thingy, thanks for helping me test a lot of this software out... just out of curiosity, how do I stop Norton's 360 from erasing the keygens without turning it off all the time ( if you know ). thanks"
,Hammerfrom3GH,2012-02-10T17:57Z,"BIG CAUTION! Do not download this! This file crashed my whole computer, first I get side by side error, then ksuser.dll crash error and then I wasn't able to open any windows folder or control panel. There goes whole my work, I'm f*cking rip your eyes off THEHINGY!!"
,BlastedRemnants,2012-04-10T18:38Z,"Thanks a lot, works great. The only problem I'm having is activating the MPEG2 component. Any tips on how to find a key for it? Unless I'm missing something, there doesn't seem to be one in the torrent."
,BlastedRemnants,2012-04-10T18:50Z,"Oops nevermind, I got it. If anyone else is as silly as I am, all you gotta do is activate the MPEG2 thing  online with Adobe. I couldn't do it on my computer (presumably due to my hosts file) but it worked just fine on my roomie's computer."
,pryminister,2012-04-13T00:47Z,"I've done the hosts file thing, then when I run the installer, it says ""The installation package is not supported by this processor type. Please contact product vendor"". Can someone help me. :("

,demon18,2012-05-01T02:50Z,Does anyone have this for Mac? 
,Majestik1,2012-05-03T01:34Z,"hey Thingy - hit me up at youtube: User: L45V3G45 - i have something for you to make your installer/extracters look fuckin SWEET!!!

i used to have the tutorial up online at Lycos back from 2001, but it seems some OTHER fucking assholes must have bought the service?? ESET warns the page is bad - can't get to it any longer.

i can zip my old webpage up for you and send you a copy of how to manipulate the SFX/EXE files to make your installers look bad ass.

As a matter of fact, i sent it to WinRAR back in the day, and they thought it was cool enough to give me a lifetime license to WinRAR - how cool is that man?

hit me up at youtube if you want, i don't know how else to get a hold of you."
,vecuccio,2012-05-29T13:47Z,ONLY SUPPORTS WINDOWS 7 - IF YOU HAVE VISTA64 OR XP64 IT WON'T INSTALL AND TELLS YOU TO DOWNLOAD THE 32BIT VERSION (!!)
,Leopardi,2012-05-30T03:13Z,don't download this. I installed using Method 2 but it still stays as a trial version.
