,UltraBlueBomber,2011-12-09T02:25Z,Can you get banned if you add those files to your kindle then go online? 
,moltodaddy,2011-12-12T01:27Z,"Thank you so much for these. Amazing collection. Quick question: Are the different torrents incremental updates? In other words, does the torrent with 4,189 books overlap with this one? Or are they contain totally different books? Thanks again."
,guccicar,2011-12-12T05:49Z,"Hi there, I was wondering if you could help me out with digital text
books for my next semester. Money is getting kind of tight and it
would be simple for me to load the book onto my cell phone and follow
the instructor. I will list the books I need and if you can help me to
find the download link I will appreciate it.

I will post the title and a link for you to see the actual book for
cross reference.

,elil123,2011-12-19T05:41Z,Could you please any one give me this list detail 
,tpb.pml,2011-12-21T10:53Z,"@elil123

The amount of books included is fairly substantial so having a list on here would be very cumbersome.

However, if you open up the torrent file, there should be a folder called Book List and in that folder are multiple lists in different formats (html, excel, etc.). Just uncheck all other files except for whatever format you want and browse away."
