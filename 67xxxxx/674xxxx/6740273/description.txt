Allmusic Review:
This seems like an unnecessary collection, considering that All Time Greatest Hits -- released on the same label, just five years previously -- has all 12 songs on this grandly titled "20th Century Masters" edition, and adds four tracks not on this collection. If it's just the big hits you're looking for, and as a matter of convenience it's easier to acquire this title, it does have the main familiar hits, from "Where Were You When I Needed You" and "Let's Live for Today" to "Temptation Eyes" and "Sooner or Later." Those wishing for more obscure, worthy early cuts like "Mr. Jones (Ballad of a Thin Man)," "Tip of My Tongue," and "Feelings" need to go to Rhino's two-CD Anthology.
