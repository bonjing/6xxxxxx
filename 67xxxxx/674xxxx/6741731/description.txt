Britain's Most Fragile Treasure

Arts Documentary hosted by Janina Ramirez, published by BBC in 2011 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Historian Dr Janina Ramirez unlocks the secrets of a centuries-old masterpiece in glass, the East Window at York Minster - the largest medieval stained-glass window in the country and the creative vision of a master craftsman called John Thornton. Within its 311 panels is the entire history of the world, from the first day to the Last Judgment, and the scale of Thornton's achievement is revealed as Dr Ramirez follows the work of a conservation team at York Glaziers Trust. They have dismantled the window as part of a five-year project to repair centuries of damage and restore it to its original glory. It is a unique opportunity for Dr Ramirez to examine Thornton's greatest work at close quarters, to discover details that would normally be impossible to see and to reveal exactly how medieval artists made images of such delicacy and complexity using the simplest of tools. The window is far more than a work of artistic genius, it's a window onto the medieval world and the medieval mind.
