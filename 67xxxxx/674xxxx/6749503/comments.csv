Their technology is millions of years more advanced than ours! 

But we will kill them all with these old WWII machine guns!"

Watched the trailer, your right this is seriously shit. When will yanks stop making this crap and spend the money on helping people instead of hurting their eyes like Kadanz said."

,DustiFinga,2011-10-18T18:34Z,"First, thanks for the up mate.

Second, it's alright you lot complaining about the film. At least the makers got off their arses and did something.....

...I just wish that 'something' was group suicide.

Watching 1 minute of this film, was like being in the queue at Ikea on a bank holiday while rubbing my eyeballs with a cheese grater and then having Satan give me a facial."
