"Love, Loss, and Legacy"

The residents try their hardest to impress 
surgical great Catherine Avery (who also 
happens to be Jackson's mother) when she 
arrives at Seattle Grace to perform a 
groundbreaking transplant surgery; Arizona 
and Alex find their hands tied with a 
confidentiality issue when a familiar patient 
comes into the ER; meanwhile, a love-struck 
Teddy throws a dinner party for the couples, 
and Bailey makes a decision regarding her 
love life.
