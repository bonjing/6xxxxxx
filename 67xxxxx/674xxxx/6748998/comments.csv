,jumpingphil,2011-10-18T03:16Z,"I have a problem with the sound on Garden Party, it is about 1 second behind the video.
The 3 are perfectly ok.
Any ideas.
I use VLC media player."
,beaujoulais,2011-10-18T06:37Z,very nice ... thanks
,beaujoulais,2011-10-18T06:53Z,"@jumpingphil: you're right ...
VLC media player gives you the function of delaying video vs. audio. In menu ""Extras"" you can find ""Synchronization"". With about +1.5 seconds delay added to the video the sound is nearly fitting.
But looking to the lips of Ricky Nelson you'll then still may mention some disharmonies - they will be based on the situation of a separate, independant audio recording added later to an existing video. "

[T],zlatkopupovac,2011-10-18T21:18Z,"Hallo  beaujoulais 
I agree and I think you're right!  The film track and music track are recorded separately during the creation of a music video .Ricky is singing PLAYBACK!"
,beaujoulais,2011-10-18T23:23Z,"yes, it's supposed to be playback - but it's a real great song and a great video - it's rock and po music history ...
for me it was a great surprise, that Ricky Nelson had such a revival with the song ""Garden Party"" a decade after his greatest hits - this I didn't realize before this great documentation - thanks 2u Zlatko"
,beaujoulais,2011-10-19T07:50Z,"Zlatko, is there the song ""Rock'n'Roll I Gave You All The Best Years Of My Life"" from artist ""Kevin Johnson"" in your archives ? I didnt't find a video so far."
