RELEASE NOTES

mIRC is a full featured Internet Relay Chat client for Windows
that can be used to communicate, share, play or work with others
on IRC networks around the world, either in multi-user group
conferences or in one-to-one private discussions.

It has a clean, practical interface that is highly configurable
and supports features such as buddy lists, file transfers,
multi-server connections, IPv6, SSL encryption, proxy support,
UTF-8 display, UPnP, customizable sounds, spoken messages, tray
notifications, message logging, and more.

mIRC also has a powerful scripting language that can be used both
to automate mIRC and to create applications that perform a wide
range of functions from network communications to playing games.

mIRC has been in development for over a decade and is constantly
being improved and updated with new technologies. The most recent
changes can be found on the latest news page.

Whats New?

This is a small update that addresses a number of important
issues that have been reported by users since the last release.
It includes improvements, changes and fixes to a number of
features, including:

The identd server issue that prevented identd from working
correctly in some situations has been fixed.

The /window -a command now correctly sets the focus for
maximized windows.

The time-out check that monitors the server connection has been
changed so as to decrease the number of 10053 disconnection
errors.

The $findfilen/$finddirn identifiers now return the correct
results for large numbers of files and folders.

The SSL certificate validation issue that resulted in
validation errors when connecting to a secure server should now
be resolved.

Other changes and bug fixes.

This update builds on and improves the stability of the new
Unicode version of mIRC (see the previous v7.1 release
announcement for details).

INSTALLATION NOTES

Install mIRC722.exe.  After installation copy precracked exe from
the Crack folder to the installed folder of mIRC.  Launch mIRC
and use ANY information for registration.  You now have a fully
activated version of mIRC!  This version is also compatible with
the fish_10.

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT PORTABLE INSTALL:

If you choose to make a portable install while doing the
installation its important to note that the registration info is
then stored in mIRC.ini on your portable device.  If you copy
over your mIRC.ini from your Windows Program Files/User
installation of mIRC, then when you launch mIRC it will ask for a
key again (if you have entered one before) because this time it
started to look in your registry.

Either don't copy your old ini over, or make sure to find, then
copy and paste the [user] section from the portable version ini
into your old ini you plan on using.

Thats it!  Enjoy.
