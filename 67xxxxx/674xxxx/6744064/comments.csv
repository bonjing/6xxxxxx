I love Sensi Pearls body type, but I have a feeling she won't last long in the industry, but I plan on enjoying the hell out of her stuff while she lasts. Oh and the green skull means they are a VIP and the pink means they are trusted. I believe that trusted means that everything they have uploaded has been legit and is properly labeled. VIP I believe means they are trusted but also they have a high volume of posts. I am not sure but I think that is the general gist."
