,ShinraArmy,2011-10-13T09:10Z,"Allright people! Those having issues with opening this file with comical try this:
1) Copypaste the file.
2) When you have your ''Copy of...'', rename it from .cbz to .zip
3) Extract all the images.
4) Make a new zip folder
5) Put all the images into this new zip folder.
6) Rename this new zip folder from .zip to .cbz
7) Read, enjoy and seed to 2.0 or more ratio"
,ShinraArmy,2011-10-13T09:11Z,"Oh yeah!
8) Remember to say ''thank you wowcabbage for uploading another great comic''"
