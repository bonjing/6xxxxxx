Original Release Date: 1998

I Got To To Find Me A Woman was nominated for a 1999 Grammy for Best Traditional Blues Album.

There's no substitute for experience, and that's something bluesman Lockwood has got in excess. He learned to play the Delta blues at the feet of Robert Johnson himself, who happened to be Lockwood's common-law stepfather. Decades later, an octogenarian Lockwood is still applying the lessons he learned from the master with great alacrity, as evidenced by I Got To To Find Me A Woman. Though he was schooled in the acoustic country blues, which he can still tear off like nobody's business, Lockwood learned early on that electricity was a blues guitarist's best friend, and began taking a few tricks from the Chicago blues book.

Both sides of that fence are represented here, as Lockwood performs affecting solo numbers alongside full-band Chicago-style stompers. His solo reading of the Delta standard "Walkin' Blues" showcases his sinuous guitar style, while the steady pumping of such tunes as "Big Legged Woman" shows Lockwood to be an authoritative interpreter of fully-charged electric blues. Naturally, it doesn't hurt to have people like Joe Louis Walker and B.B. King pitching in, either.
