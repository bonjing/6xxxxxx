At least 10,000 Palestinians are imprisoned in Israeli jails today. They are called \'Security Prisoners\'. For most Israelis they are assassins and criminals. For most Palestinians they are heroes and freedom-fighters.

With unique access to the most guarded Palestinian prisoners in Israel, director Shimon Dotan and producer Arik Bernstein explore the evolution of the Palestinian Prisoners into a political force and the impact that\'s having on Palestinian politics out of jail. The film culminates in the historic elections to the Palestinian Parliament on January 20, 2006, which brought to power the militant Islamic organization Hamas.

HotHouse tells the stories of Hasan Yusuf, Hamas leader in the West Bank, who was recently elected to Parliament from his prison cell; Abu Naji, Fatah leader in jail, imprisoned for more than 24 years; Ahlam Tamimni, Hamas leader of the female prisoners, sentenced to 16 life terms for planning and executing the attack on the Sbarro restaurant in Jerusalem.

The prison experience has become a Palestinian rite of passage, and the prisons for Security Prisoners are in fact nationalist academies - seen by Palestinians as their Robben Island. The film raises questions about the impact of this incubator-culture on both Israeli and Palestinian society.
