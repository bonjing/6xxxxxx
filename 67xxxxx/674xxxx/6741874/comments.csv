,DarkerSkies,2011-10-15T03:03Z,"Please note the x264 METis  source does have some spanish ""written"" text during a few bits of the film  (not much i`ll grant you) but the likes of Maters written letter is displayed in written spanish , as are some GPS coordinates on screen, and a few others. It doesn`t  ruin the film by any means but it`s just a heads up for to expect them."
