,filipexx,2011-10-15T00:35Z,"Hi Bozx. I'm a newbie in Pbay... For sure this is not the right place to post it (maybe someone could tell me where is the right place), but I want to ask if you could share this torrent: Ghost Ship 2002 720p BluRay x264-HDCLASSiCS BOZX. There are no seeders, everybody stays in 87,00% :(. Thanks."

,lizardomanson,2011-10-15T03:44Z,"I can't believe some people are downloading at 2MB/s??? speed right now is 12 Kbps and my cable modem service can reach 1MB. BOZX do you use only torrents, no Megashares for example? or of someone with fast upload speed could save it to Megashares."

,bigough,2011-10-18T06:13Z,"Great copy, thank you.  30 seconds that need subtitles, not really worth it.  

Converted using MKV2VOB and MKVMerge, worked great on the PS3.  

Thank you very much for the upload.  "
,BillVero,2011-10-18T18:48Z,For some reason this file will not play on my WD Live Media Player which plays all the other .mkv files I've tried. Is this .mkv different in some fashion or is my download somehow corrupt? I tried it on BS Player - same result. Any ideas? Thanks to BOZX for the upload all the same.
,bbb_ozoz,2011-10-19T01:20Z,"great u/l as usual. Thx BOZX!!!!

,Taevious,2012-04-29T05:54Z,"The source of these vids is actually 1080. The encoders did us the favor of simply removing the black bars above and below the actual movie. Personally, I prefer it this way. Thanks uploader for movie!"
,Wave_rider,2012-05-07T23:25Z,"@ all noobs on TPB requesting ""plz upload in 1920*1080"" (or something similar about the size).

Here is something your dumb daddy never told you, but should have. Then again. You come from him, so... guess you stem from a family tree of idiots, and further supports my belief that people should need a license to breed. Wish I could just stamp your foreheads for ""non-breeding"". 

In short, and like my father told me growing up to avoid such moments: Think before you speak (or in this case use Google search (so you can avoid looking stupid)). Or just read comments on other torrents and edumacate your dumba$$.

THIS IS FULL HD 1080P. Sad we have to continue to see the same comments from the same noob DL'ers, requesting we answer...""black bars are removed"". Be a problem solver, use the tools in front of you and figure some sh#$ out on your own. 

BOZX. Thanks as always. Great stuff. 

A/V: 10/10 
M: 5... but need it for the collection. 

Avengers (2012) was BAAAD A$$. See it if you haven't. Mark Rufalo. You suck."
