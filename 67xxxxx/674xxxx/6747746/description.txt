Late in 1964, George Jones switched labels, moving from United Artists to Musicor. Musicor was already home to pop hitmaker Gene Pitney ("Town Without Pity," "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence"), and label execs quickly struck on the idea of pairing the two successful artists. The duo's first session produced the hit "I've Got Five Dollars And It's Saturday Night." Although the duo only charted once more with a cover of the Kershaw Brothers' "Louisiana Man," the pairing lasted long enough to complete two albums. During the same year, Pitney recorded a solo country album. Bear Family's GEORGE JONES & GENE PITNEY contains all three of these albums in their entirety.
