    This episode of the documentary series focuses on the      
    new giants, the heavyweights of the dinosaur world. It    
    is only in recent years that experts have unearthed the  
    biggest dinosaurs that ever lived.                        
                                                               
    One monster eclipsed all others; more than seven times    
    as heavy as diplodocus was the immense argentinosaurus   
    - a single backbone was bigger than a human.              
                                                               
    For years, these giants were considered immune to         
    attack from any predator - until the discovery of        
    mapusaurus, a new giant killer whose fate appeared to     
    be inextricably linked to argentinosaurus.
