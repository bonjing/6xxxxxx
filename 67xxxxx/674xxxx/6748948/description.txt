Alan Moore's The Courtyard is a 2-issue comic book mini-series adaptation of a 1994 prose story written by Alan Moore, published in 2003 by Avatar Press. It was adapted for comics by Antony Johnston, with artwork by Jacen Burrows, and Alan Moore as "consulting editor".

Originally it began as a short story by Moore, as part of H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. The plot centres on an FBI agent who specialises in "anomaly theory," being assigned to investigate three seemingly unrelated murder cases in Red Hook. When the investigation leads to a night club, and onto the apparent use of a drug named Aklo, the agent soon finds things are not at all as they seem.
