The Financial & Economic Crisis - Collection 8:

In these days we celebrate the grassroots movement against the greed of Wall Street and corporate corruption. The protests have gone worldwide. Pissed by the failure of their governments to protect them from the thieves and thugs in higher places, the people are trying to taking the matter in their own hands to save their own livelihoods and the future of their children.
