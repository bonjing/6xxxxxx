,illiria,2011-10-15T22:56Z,Can't really understand why so much fuss about a ring. But it's not my business. Just doing my job. :)
,alienzerox,2011-10-15T23:21Z,"hello illiria, i just wanted to say that you make excellent installation packages & it must take a lot of your time to put them all together, your contributions are very much appreciated, i thank you :)

i was looking thru the files that you uploaded and noticed that da2 was not included among them, only the dlc packs. was there a reason you didn't make a da2 + all dlc repack like you usually do? not that i need it since i already have the reloaded version... i was just curious"
,agranel,2011-10-15T23:36Z,Thank you very much.
,illiria,2011-10-16T00:43Z,"@ alienzerox

DLCs are being constantly released. Once the last one is out, I will consider making a game repack with all the DLCs. But since more DLCs are to come, making a game repack with current DLCs would be an incomplete work.
Also, I can release new versions of my DLC repack as soon as new DLCs come out. If I was to release it along with the game every time, you would have to download 10 gigabytes each time, not 2. :)"
,mire9000,2011-10-16T13:05Z,is this full game or only DLC pack??
,uroshuchiha92,2011-10-16T16:29Z,"@mire9000

You really need to start reading comments.
Thanks Illiria. Everything is here as far as I can see. Nothing is missing. Not a single item. Thanks "
,Mr-Rivet-Head,2011-10-16T17:46Z,"Thanks muchly for this,
makes the game that little bit more interesting :D"

,HenryVII,2011-10-17T11:43Z,"Thanks for your constantly hard work illiria but would it be possible to include the DA2 Fan Reward Pack with three more items?

,illiria,2011-10-17T14:05Z,"@ HenryVII

Looks like this ""Fan Reward Pack"" has not been released yet. When it will be released, I will include it. Will probably ship it along with the next major DLC though. Repacking for every new item released is a pain."
,HenryVII,2011-10-17T16:13Z,"@illiria:
No problem, thanks a bunch in advance:D"
,Insomneac,2011-10-18T00:42Z,"@ illiria;

What registry monitoring program do you use?

I want to make some installers, and was wondering if you could recommend one?

Also, what program do you use to make the installer (not the autorun, just the setup.exe)?

Thanks for your time and advice."
,Thompson93,2011-10-18T16:52Z,"Hey thanks -illiria today i checked your new torrent :) im busy too ! 

Thank you very very much for your repack :)
and I will help you to retrieve ""hide"" items for dragon age 2 if you miss them. 
I've been searching the fan reward pack these days. Guys the Fan Reward Pack has only three items but there are plenty more. 
We will have some surprises from BioWare this month. "

,Suir,2011-11-01T12:04Z,Does this pack contain the DLC that comes from dragon age legends?
,powerangah,2011-11-03T08:00Z,"Umm, if you can, can you release just the Item Pack 2, I have crappy internet so downloading this would take up to two weeks! Even with many seeds, thanks!"
,mystryspt,2011-11-09T17:44Z,this looks amazing! do you know if there's a way to install on a mac?

,scifi95,2011-12-27T04:15Z,"I found the installer for the ""Fan Appreciation Pack"" that came out in July.  However, it is encrypted.  How best to de-crypt it?"

,WinEd01,2012-04-26T19:24Z,"I downloaded and I think something went wrong with the install. After I click install, green bar advances half an inch and then it says ""Installation complete."" It updates my game to 1.03, but doesn't install the DLC. Any of them. Anyone else having this issue? I'm using Windows 7 x64."
,billias1020,2012-04-29T15:56Z,pease illiria patch it to 1.04..thanks
,EliteGuard009,2012-05-03T09:02Z,thank you! much appreciated!
,rye_encoke,2012-05-09T17:53Z,"works okay, but I can't move skills on hotbar around without the whole thing freezing then crashing...anyone have same problem or know a fix"
,BizkitBoy_,2012-05-16T16:54Z,"illiria, thank you so much for putting the effort in this! Since it was announced no further DLCs are going to be released for Dragon Age 2, do you think you can take the time to update this pack with patch v1.04 and also the missing DLCs? A full list can be found here http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Downloadable_content_%28Dragon_Age_II%29 Or if you can teach me how to do this, I`ll gladly update it :) Again, thank you!"
