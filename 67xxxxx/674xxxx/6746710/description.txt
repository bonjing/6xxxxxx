Normally I don't bother remaking the whole repack because of one item, but it was a request, so I did it. But for future - all the items that come out between storyline DLCs I will include when the next storyline DLC comes out.


Anyway, in this new version of repack I have included the bonus ring called "The Deep Green", which comes along the DLC "Mark of the Assassin".


If you want a standalone DLC without having to download the full repack, please use this torrent:

And lets all thank Thompson93, because without his contribution, this would not be possible. And we would still be missing that ring.



************************************************************************************

THE INSTALLER WILL AUTOMATICALLY PATCH YOUR GAME TO VERSION 1.03 AND COPY THE CRACK. ALL DLCS ARE PRE-CRACKED. INSTALLER AUTOMATICALLY DETECTS YOUR GAME FOLDER.

You only need to press "Install".

The usual warning: some anti-viruses may detect all and every my installers as viruses. This is a false positive. I have no idea why it happens, nor do I care.


Also, Windows Vista/7 may take a couple of minutes to launch this repack, because Vista/7 pre-load large EXEcutable files BEFORE they launch them.


You can share this torrent wherever you want. The more, the better.
