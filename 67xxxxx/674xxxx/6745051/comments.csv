[T],raidy,2011-10-21T01:51Z,"Seriously? We provide you a new BOX set of floyd; 16 cds! on our dime and time... And you want to suggest a cbr 320k over vbr scene? Laughable. 

So.. Not only do you speak from your arse about encoding, I haven't seen you offer this particular set. I tell ya what, As ours just isn't what you're looking for; Why don't you provide a flac version? I'm sure some will even appreciate your efforts.

,transarctic3,2011-10-26T06:26Z,Awesome torrent! Thank you! and thank you making it mp3 and NOT FLAC
,oobaka,2011-11-01T02:49Z,"To make this VBR and not FLAC is like spitting in the face of God.
May as well listen to it with bargain bin ear buds"
[T],raidy,2011-11-06T02:24Z,"I know this is confusing for some.. HHI is an mp3 release group. Mp3s is all we've ever released for Audio. It's all we're going to release. You won't ever find an HHI FLAC release. Please don't continue commenting, ""this should be flac."" If you must have flac, google, or failing that, do it yourself. Thanks and enjoy the tunes!"
