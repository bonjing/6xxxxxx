God lives underwater's best album. It's too bad this band has been forgotten they released some very good music. This is a complete album - each song can stand on its own, its not like most albums there's only one or two good tracks.

If you like my life with the thrill kill kult, kmfdm, nirvana, the crow soundtrack, the jesus and mary chain, you'll like this music.

This is my own rip so feel free to complain about it ;-)
