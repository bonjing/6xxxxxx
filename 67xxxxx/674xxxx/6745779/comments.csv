,blackjackel2,2011-10-24T23:42Z,So is this legit or a fake/trojan?
,EonsWrath,2011-10-26T06:11Z,"Uhm... Dude, Skidrow is trusted by TPB. They aren't going to throw away there reputation for a game almost noone has heard of. Lol. A lot of torrents have virus', and sometimes it's necessary in order to have cracked them. A version of terraria i got had a ""trojan"" but it's just what the company uses."
,wessoo,2011-11-13T18:38Z,"Agree, if it is really a trojan, i could'nt have placed this text?"
,wessoo,2011-11-13T18:41Z,"By the way, it isn't a fake/trojan/virus.
My Windows Essentials is really really fast, and i didn't get a warning and i could just use the file.

THIS IS NOT A FAKE."
,Epicosss,2011-12-18T18:46Z,this isn't a trojan or a virus.... if next to the name of the uploader says VIP or trusted it has NOTHING!!
