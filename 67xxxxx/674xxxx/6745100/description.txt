Everytime I hear this most beautiful of gals doin a famous Russian medley
I feel I shpuld perhaps place a call the State department to arrange an
Official State visit as an honourary Princess ambassador she could be for the
spirit that is there - and Ive even thought of getting a nice diamond ring and jumping on a plane to go see her there. but then I think she lives in beautiful
Germany now, her actual fatherland given her real roots, despite being born in
Russia. so I guess Ill have to wait till I'm fuehrer eh! Just kiddin of course! 

Here are two Russian Medley mp3s in 320k settings from her
The Best of Live So wie ich bin 2010 performance, in addition to
her 2011 Fuer ein tag (Fan edition) CD

Between the two mp3s are the great "Kalinka" melody as well as "Those 
were the days" (Mary Hopkins) set to Russian lyrics tunes!

I love the great peoples there and certainly their true kin
in Germany as may be the case!

enjoy!
