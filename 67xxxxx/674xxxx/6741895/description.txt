       What would happen to planet earth if the human race were      
       to suddenly disappear forever? Would ecosystems thrive?       
       What remnants of our industrialized world would survive?      
       What would crumble fastest? From the ruins of ancient         
      civilizations to present day cities devastated by natural    
          disasters, history gives us clues to these questions and

      No subs and poor audio on this one, but hey, it's not like    
      narration changes a lot with 7.1 HD audio, right?             
      What really might make you cry is the image quality...        
      Once again we see a masterpiece of idiocracy. What you might  
      think looks like interlacing or ghosting or both is none of   
      them, yet probably caused by both. We first thought our       
      25fps source was fucked (Hi studios, wasn't that DVD where    
      we had fixed fps for NTSC and PAL? This is Bluray, right?)    
      but we saw the same when we checked the season 2 rips that    
      have been taken off a 23.976fps source...                     
      This is some truely well done mastering that has been fucked  
      in so many stages that no remedy has been found by our        
      devasted specialists.                                         
      No need to feel bad about pirating this one. Studios that     
      show such enormous lack of interest in the insult, sorry      
      'product', they plan on selling to you don't deserve a
