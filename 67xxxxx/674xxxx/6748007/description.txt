Understanding antibiotic chemotherapy at the ecological level is necessary for more permanent advances in development and in the usage of antibiotic agents. This book traces the history of bacteria, from the development of life on earth to the evolution of diversity. It is this diversity that led, almost automatically to the development of pathogens as well as antibiotics. If we are to create long term antibiotics we must design them with this history in mind.
