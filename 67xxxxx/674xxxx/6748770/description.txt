First time trying a 2D to 3D conversion and with the soon-to-be released Cars 2 3D release I thought this would be a fitting trial.

This was a Bluray reencode 1080P 5.1 Surround Sound. I believe that it is in AC3 640kbps. Nevertheless it sounds good through my Yamaha receiver.

The 3D upconversion is a half side-by-side, so you lose the 1080P to both eyes, but for a conversion I still thought it had a lot of depth. It lacks the pop-out-of-screen effects that Cars 2 will have, being made for 3D, but I thought the depth was a great improvement to the original.

The container is mkv, pretty universal, should play on just about any mediaplayer/bluray player.

Like I said, this is a first post for me, so leave feedback and let me know what you think. I haven't tried non-animated film yet for conversion, but my guess is that it won't be as good as animation.

Oh and please seed to others ;)
