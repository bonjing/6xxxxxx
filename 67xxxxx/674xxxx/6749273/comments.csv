,jenchai,2011-10-17T15:26Z,I think its mainly for USA to avoid MPAA from detecting the files.
,InterClaw,2011-10-17T16:32Z,Thanks for maintaining intact scene releases.
,Ihatetpblogin,2011-10-17T18:35Z,Rar files are broken.  Can't unpack.
,CakeMonster,2011-10-17T21:38Z,"@Ihatetpblogin 

You need to use winrar which is free and unpack to the desktop

If the complete file name of the location plus all the folders is greater than 280 characters long then it cant be unpacked

To decrease the character size you need to unpack the specific file to the desktop which is easily done with winrar extractor which is free

the problem is that many unpacking programs choose to unpack the file into a new folder and place that folder into the folder with all the rars and people have their folders inside a torrent downloading folder, so basically you get a very long name with a folder inside a folder inside a folder plus the file name"
,stimpj,2011-10-18T02:33Z,"mmm, love me some rars... tasty! For the people who have trouble extracting the file just use free Winrar and pick the option in one of the pull down tabs that says to ""extract without confirmation."" Works every time."
,fish121,2011-10-18T04:56Z,thanks
,ninline,2011-10-18T05:28Z,"If you're using linux it's as simple as opening a terminal and going to the directory the rar file is in and typing ""unrar x homeland*rar"" and bang!  There it is.  "
,liebezeit,2011-10-18T06:52Z,"Surely the MPAA finds torrents the same way everyone else does? The real reason the files are rared is because they are posted on usenet, I believe. Some uploaders take the time to unrar, some don't."
,bonez511,2011-10-18T16:23Z,"Unraring takes all of 30 seconds.  I don't understand the issues people have.  As long as the quality is there, I'm a happy person, and the quality is always there with sceneline.  +1!"
