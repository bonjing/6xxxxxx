Personally I have no opinion on aliens, I am not convinced they are beings from another world or if they are real at all. But I do find it interesting. So i will watch this, thanks for uploading it."

He makes everything seem so dramatic. Ive had friends that have also watched the show and have commented to me about the same people. ""WTF!!"" , has become a weekly household term every Wednesday, because of this awesome show. Thanks."
