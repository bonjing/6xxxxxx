One Way Out is a live album by The Allman Brothers Band. It is the first live album to feature Warren Haynes and Derek Trucks together, although both had appeared separately on previous live albums. It was recorded during the group's annual Beacon Theatre run in New York City on March 25 and 26, 2003, and released a year later.

The album features extended jams and guitar solos that showcase the virtuosity of Trucks and Haynes. While the original Allman Brothers Band focused both on jazz-based soloing and looser free jamming, the more modern version of the band is loud and tight throughout. Trucks and Haynes show a great respect for the legacy of Duane Allman and Dickey Betts while still managing to do something original with their guitars.
