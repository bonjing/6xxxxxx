,johnhancock,2011-10-24T06:40Z,"Excuse me, but what do you play this in? I've tried EVERY SINGLE PLAYER available, downloaded countless codecs and installers and identifiers, nothing works, vlc, divx, media player, you name it, so now what? Why so many seeders and leechers when its that hard to play the avi file? "
