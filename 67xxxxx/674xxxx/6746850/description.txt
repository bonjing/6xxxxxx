The restoration and conservation of stone monuments is a complicated multi-disciplinary task and the decisions finally reached must be based on a firm and detailed knowledge of the mechanical behaviour of both the authentic materials and the substitute stones.

In this volume scientists from different disciplines (Structural Engineers, Archaeologists, Architects, Chemical Engineers, Geologists) present their experience and their scientific work in progress concerning the properties of a series of stones that have been used for the erection of some of the most important stone monuments of the international cultural heritage and are used today for substitution of missing parts or completion of damaged ones.

Thus it is seen that the volume will be a very useful tool in the hands of a broad variety of scientists working in the field of the building materials of ancient monuments: It deals with the subject globally and it contains unpublished research results concerning the materials that are used or could be used for the conservation of the international cultural heritage.
