Information
Documentary series following the work of specialist bomb disposal teams in Afghanistan.

Adam's team
Adam is halfway through his tour of Afghanistan as a bomb disposal operator. Captured on helmet camera, we see what Adam sees as he is standing over the bomb which could kill him if he makes one wrong move. Over the past weeks, Adam and his team have cleared 17 IEDs from a compound, so that it can be used as an army base. When they're called out to the compound one final time, they take a casualty. The Bomb Squad is full of revelations - what an IED looks like, what it's like to risk your life as a highly trained operator or as a young searcher, and what it's like to be the family left behind, wondering if their loved ones will come home.

Rod's team
After a missile strike kills an insurgent laying an IED, bomb disposal operator Rod and his team are dropped into the area by helicopter to investigate. Captured on helmet camera, we see what Rod sees as he is standing over the bomb, which could kill him if he makes one wrong move. Three months into their tour, Search Team 9 have already taken casualties. They have lost three team members but they're still at the front searching for IEDs and they are about to search one of the most dangerous villages in Helmand. The Bomb Squad is full of insights; from what it's like to be a bomb disposal operator working in Afghanistan for the first time, to searching for IEDs after you've seen friends killed or injured by them.
