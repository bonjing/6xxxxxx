The old BitComet crap that you created this torrent with has been obsolete for years."

I would try utorrent. Thanks for suggestion."

I use the old BitComet 0.63 too,I like it for many reasons,1 being that I can personally ban those who haven`t configured their client properly,and are sharing empty packets (errors which count against bandwidth).I have tried utorrent,and personally,I think it sucks bigtime."
