Found this book a little while back when the writer was giving it away for free and thought it was pretty good. Its pretty short and I read the whole thing on my kindle in a day. 



Book Description from Amazon: Dale had everythingâ€”dream job, dream girl, dream life. When he moved to New York to chase his dreams, he never planned on returning to the Indiana farm where he grew up. Yet, one phone call from his ex-fiance brings him back to face the brothers he abandoned and the consequences of the choices he made in pursuit of those dreams. Will a father's last wish be the key to reuniting a family torn apart by tragedy? Or will Dale lose everything while driving to BelAir.
