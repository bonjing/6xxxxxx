                The Night of the Stag.
                Barnaby and Jones are sampling the local cider at
                Midsomer Abbas spring fair when the body of a missing
                tax inspector is found floating in the cider vat.
                Meanwhile, publican Samuel Quested says that he wants
                to restore an ancient rite called the Stag in which
                men go in search of women from another village in
                order to 'refresh the gene pool'. As Barnaby and
                Jones investigate the murder, they uncover family
                secrets and an array of possible motives. Can they
                stop the killer from carrying out his final act of
                violence?
