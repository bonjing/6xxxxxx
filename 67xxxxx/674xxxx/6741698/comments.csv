,shiva2012,2011-10-14T22:38Z,"Sorry to read this. I checked with freeware players VLCPlayer, KMPlayer,  BSPlayer and even with Windows Media Player 11 - all worked fine. Next time i will use another codec that is more common."
,thousandvisions,2011-10-15T02:58Z,"Thanks for the upload, much appreciated.
I installed the mp43 codec and it works now.

 Yes there seem to be some jpeg artifacts. Might be the mp43 format.  I've never had a problem with xVid......

Once again thanks for the upload and much appreciated."
,Fangular,2011-10-16T14:55Z,"Thank you so much for uploading this - all the other versions of this episode are about 2.7GB - they're ridiculously large!

But I have a question: I download this show for my parents (who are big fans) - my Dad converts it to DVD and then they watch it as a DVD together. So what I would love to know is what is a 'jpeg artifact'? And do they have the potential to compromise their enjoyment of the show in any way?

Thanks again for the upload - it is appreciated.
Cheers."
,thousandvisions,2011-10-16T15:48Z,"Pixelated or ""blocky"""
,shiva2012,2011-10-16T16:54Z,"@Fangular For converting to DVD i would recommend the big mkv file: https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6740082/Midsomer.Murders.S14E06.720p.HDTV.x264-BiA

(download with jdownloader recommended)

I posted there a link for fast direct download.

This was a quick release, that i converted for my wife (slow pc) to watch (she said it was ok for watching) - as thousandvisions wrote, some Pixelated or ""blocky"" sequences in my release."
,Fangular,2011-10-27T16:56Z,"Thanks so much for your help, shiva - I really appreciate it! :-)"
,Johnlittle1990,2011-11-03T05:29Z,One of the worst quality I have downloaded. If you want to watch on a TV bigger than a laptop screen don't both.
