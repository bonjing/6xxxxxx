FamilyTracker allows you to track your children, wife, husband and fiancÃ©e. You can now find out where they are, at anytime, as long as they have their Android phones or iPhones with them.
So how does this work?
Simple. Install Family Tracker on the Android/iPhone/iPad you want to track. From then on, you can use either a web browser or via the Family Tracker app itself installed on your own device to locate your family member.
Each device with FamilyTracker installed has the option to automatically update its location at regular intervals (from every 1 min. to every 1 hour). You can adjust the frequency of the updates on the "Settings" tab. The automatic feature can be turned on/off by the user by going to the "Settings" tab as well.
Whether the user has their automatic tracking service disabled or not you can always force an update of their location at any time.
Any time you would like to see the current location of a device you can "ping" it, which will send a tracking notification to the user. The "Stealthy Ping" feature works only if the targeted device has Family Tracker ver. 2.4.4 or above.
There are 2 ways to set up tracking a phone with our application:
1. Having the application installed on both phones- yours and the person you want to track. Once it is installed on both phones, you can send a request to track them from your phone and they have to approve your request. Then you can track them from your phone.
2. Install the Family Tracker application only on the phone you want to track and then use our website to track it, force location updates and send free messages. To do this, your email address needs to be added under the "Locate Me"
tab of the Family Tracker application on the phone you want to track. Then you will automatically get an email with instructions how to track the phone via the web.
Family Tracker does not need to know your phone's cell number to function, as it does not send SMS messages for notifications. Your email address is instead used to send free Push Notifications to the device being tracked. These notifications are free, specific to our Family Tracker application, and work anywhere in the world as long as the device being tracked has internet access via the cellular network or WiFi.
