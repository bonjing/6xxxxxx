Description:
You're flying just feet above real landscapes. There's a dragon in front of you, killer crabs behind and some guy on another carpet cutting you to ribbons. Not enough mana for the accelerate spell. Looks like you're gonna have to fight this one out, then. Shred the skies on the worldâ€™s fastest, most heavily armed flying carpet. Duel rival wizards and wade into hordes of deadly beasts in your quest to restore 50 shattered worlds. At your disposal is an impressive arsenal of devastating spells. Summon lighting storms, meteors, raise the dead to fight for you and, of course, cast the classic fireball spell, and that is only the beginning! The terrain is fully deformable so if you suddenly have an unresistable felling that those peaceful and green fields need more fire, death, and thundering volcanoes, there is nothing that stands in your way!
