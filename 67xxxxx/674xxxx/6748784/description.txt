Disc One Ep 1, 2, 3 & 4



.Plot
Set in the 1960s to 1970's about Australia's involvement in the Vietnam war. On the homefront it mainly focusses on the Goddard family - Douglas (Barry Otto), Evelyn (Veronica Lang) and their children Phil (Nicholas Eadie) and Megan (Nicole Kidman.

Vietnam is a stunningly powerful re-enactment of the bitterly controversial issue of Australia's involvement in what was perceived as an American War.

Twelve Thousand young Australians were conscripted to Vietnam. Five Hundred never returned. On television, terrible images of war were impossible to ignore - in the beginning, few voices protested, but as the war worsened and casualties increased things began to change.

The arrival of conscription into the lives of ordinary Australians changed families lives forever. VIETNAM tells the story of one such family.
