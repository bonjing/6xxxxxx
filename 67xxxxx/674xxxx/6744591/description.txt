Culture, Travel Documentary hosted by Paul Merton and published by Discovery Channel in 2008 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Imagine how a pasty, panama-wearing Brit blends into the crowds and culture of Delhi and Rajasthan. Picture him dining with convicted criminals in a high security prison in Hyderabad and hanging out with a gang of eunuchs in the Punjab. Or meeting India's world record holders in Mumbai (including a man who attempts to smash three records in just one hour - using some string, a frisbee and a skipping rope), and getting swamped by thousands of naked holy men at a remote hilltop festival in Delhi. Hard to imagine? Some things just have to be seen to be believed; Paul Merton in India presents a wonderfully idiosyncratic perspective on a land of startling contrasts in this five-part series. 

Never has a country and presenter been better matched. As a surreal and intense journey gets underway from crowded city streets to the harsh beauty of rural India, Paul Merton in India journeys right into the heart of a country where anything can happen...and usually does.

Merton visits a temple in Rajasthan devoted to rats, where the revered rodents swarm through the corridors and sip en masse from specially laid out bowls of milk. He attends a festival in Gujarat celebrating the god Shiva and watches naked, ash-covered sadhus suspend boulders from their genitals. Then stumbling upon the beach in Chennai, he watches a group of men and women practice the art of laughter yoga - proving hard for a professional comedian such as Merton to endorse!

Part comedy, part social documentary and completely entertaining, Paul Merton in India discovers a picaresque collection of oddballs and eccentricities you won't find in any travel brochure. Revealing what makes this emerging superpower so unique, Merton shuns the traditional tourist spots in favour of unexpected sights and surprising detours.


1)  Delhi 
The comedian embarks on a fascinating journey through India, shunning traditional tourist spots in favour of the surprising detours the enormous subcontinent has to offer. He visits Delhi, where he takes a course in etiquette before going for a ride on a stationary plane and finding out about the city's street monkeys

2)  Bathinda and Ahmedabad 
The comedian meets dancing policemen in the Punjabi town of Bathinda and attends a cricket match for the blind in Delhi. He also visits a Jaipur clinic where prosthetic limbs are made, which helps around 20,000 people a year, and follows a gang of racketeering eunuchs in the town of Ahmedabad.

3)  Shillong and Kolkata 
The comedian visits India's self-proclaimed capital of rock 'n' roll, situated in a remote part of Shillong in the far east of the country, as well as the Apne Aap community project housing the children of Kolkata's prostitutes. He also takes in the sights during a trip to the countryside in the state of Kerala.

4)  Hyderabad and Bangalore 
The comedian visits Hyderabad to see the world's largest tricycle and meet some of the area's snake catchers. He also takes a trip to a Bangalore, where he visits a prison so well known for its excellent food that released prisoners ask to be sent back in, and watches a man try to set world records in skipping, thread-winding and disc throwing.

5)  Mumbai 
The comedian meets children who live in Mumbai's central station, and discovers the joys of 'Bollywood' cinema, the country's low-budget film industry which produces spoofs of some of India's more well-known movies. He also meets the man who holds the world record for being kicked in the groin the highest number of times in one session, and is invited to test the man's eye-watering endurance. Last in the series.
