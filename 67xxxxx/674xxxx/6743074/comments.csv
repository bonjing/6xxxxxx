WHO in there right mind waits for the one to emerge with LESS quality. He must know that the more ANY file is compressed, the worse the quality you get. If he could understand that even a regular DVD can take up as much as 7.5 GB of memory so 700Mb is about almost 11 times smaller!!! (10.9) to be exact. If it was a Blue-Ray, it is about 18 to 23GB in its uncompressed size so 700Mb in this case is compressed even more. . . . 33.64 times SMALLER!!! If you have ever used software like Xilisoft Video Converter Ultimate App, you would know that the settings to get a file that is 7GB (the amount of memory a NON hi-def retail DVD movie may use if not compressed) reduced to 700Mb you have to reduce the AUDIO from 7 channel dolby 5.2 at 48000k sample rate and a 320 bit rate down to 8000k sample rate (44000k is CD quality for reference)and a bit rate down to 32 (256 is CD quality) and it is reduced to 2 channel stereo. The VIDEO bit rate is mushed down to a bit rate of 1200, (2500 is min for hi-def) and a frame rate of 30 (30 is the standard for most retail DVD) to 23.97 fps (not as big a loss as the audio sacrifices but still a good bit less). (obviously, the more frames per second, the better).

IMO, I'd rather have an uploaded movie be less then the retail version, but the absolute smallest it can be compressed. That is why some are too DARK and have artifacts, pixelation, and other problems. The less it is mashed down to save memory, the more loss in quality you should expect to see. You can still fit 5 movies of this size (@1.4Gb) on a 8GB Dual Layer Blank (DVD-R DL or DVD+R DL)
Again, just my humble opinion.
THANKS .Dude. been looking for this. Will comment on quality after I download."
,Jugg141,2011-10-21T20:54Z,"there are numerous of reason why he wait, maybe his internet is slow. maybe he dont want to waste his bandwidth or maybe he just want it..
the quality isnt that much better on this as on the 700mb.

but if u feel that why, why dont u wait on the 4,5gb version? oh i know why! u dont have time to wait after u wrote that little book of urs"
,licketh,2011-10-23T06:52Z,dude ek kaam kar kyu 1.73 gb ka movie wast kara hai uplaod karna 700 mb wala nahi tho hd 720p 700mb wala yaar itna tho kar aisa movie 1.73 gb me worth nahi hai
