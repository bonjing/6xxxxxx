Hi.
U can always do a partition to ur C drive and install Win 7 on the new partition.Then transfer any needed files from the old partition to ur new one when u get an external or a big flash memory.This way u'll have an operational Laptop and won't loose any needed files.Hope this helped.."

You can try those steps other friends mentioned.. Also, you can try to download magic partition software, it's a small file and once you download and install you'll be ask to make a partition and you can create a new drive and move all the important files to new drive and format or reinstall your os.

thanks guys....

one last question, if i didn't do the partition, and install WIN7, whether the installer will make a folder called ""Windows Old"" and store all my documents in it..?"

,sentimentalen,2011-10-24T13:16Z,Thanks man ... Can you upload Colombiana in 1080p? 
,FreeLancer1080,2011-10-30T18:36Z,Ok so why when I look for a real 1080P movie torrent all I find are 720 videos labeled as 1080. Even most of he ones posted state in they're notes that the movie is 1920x800 (or some close proximally) which is not a 1080p video. So does any know why that is?
,d945gnt,2011-11-04T13:37Z,Thank you.
