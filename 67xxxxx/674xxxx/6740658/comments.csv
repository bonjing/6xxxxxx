[T],PirateBoy,2011-10-14T04:52Z,"@YIFY

keep up your great work....really a fan of your torrents... :)

Well, I would like to say one thing...all your movies are of great quality (720p) but why is this series(1-4) of DBZ Kai not of that quality? Its written 720p but the quality is similar to the old Dragon Ball Z animations series. The textless opening and textless closing videos in the 1st series torrent were of 720p...they were great...but i saw that the episodes are of lower quality. Please do a 720p quality Rip... :)"
[T],PirateBoy,2011-10-14T05:12Z,"@YIFY

O... I forgot ask you one more thing.....will you only do Dragon Ball Z Kai series...or will you do other animes like Naruto, Bleach and others too?"
[V],YIFY,2011-10-14T09:44Z,@ imsourav all of the episodes - including those openings were encoded at the same bitrate. The opening segment has been clearer across all of the releases on every episode - same with the end credits. All the other torrents of this series elsewhere will show the same thing & it won't be re-done :)
,sufuru,2011-10-14T17:06Z,great work.. bro... love ur work...
,sufuru,2011-10-14T17:11Z,"@ imsourav
Bro, they havn't made dbz kai as a whole new thing.. its the same as of the old dbz.. they jus hav cutted and edited the long lousy parts, so that they could end the 291 episodes old series with less numbers.. say 150 or so... as for the opening and closing of the episodes, they are made for attraction of the fans... hope you liked the info.."
,sufuru,2011-10-14T17:14Z,@ imsourav so its the real quality of the anime not anyone's fault.. u shouldnt doubt yify bro.. he's awesome..
[T],PirateBoy,2011-10-14T19:25Z,"@ sufuru

I am not doubting YIFY....not at all.....he is a GOD in 720p quality rip !!!

@YIFY

Thnx again. By the way, you didn't answer my 2nd question. Will you only do Dragon Ball Z Kai series...or will you do other animes like Naruto, Bleach and others too? Please reply... :)"
