HDR comes to Android!
Introducing Pro HDR Camera, the world's first real HDR app for Android!

name: HDR Camera Pro.apk
version : 2.0
REQUIRES ANDROID: 2.2+
CATEGORY: Photography


if you have a LG, Sony, or other device, the HDR capability may not function properly.
Full functionality has been verified on the following phones:
* HTC: Thunderbolt, EVO 4G, MyTouch 4G, G2, Incredible, Desire, Legend, Bravo
* Motorola: Droid, Droid 2, Droid X
* Samsung: Galaxy S, Epic 4G
Sorry, CM7 is not yet supported. Coming soon!

  Check out our gallery here: http://www.eyeappsllc.com/Gallery.html


  Features:
â€¢ Automatic in-app HDR capture, where all you have to do is tap to capture
â€¢ Manual in-app photo capture, where you get to choose the exposure of each image in your HDR
â€¢ Proprietary image alignment algorithm that precisely aligns full-size images in seconds
â€¢ Sophisticated image blending creates one beautiful output image nearly instantly
â€¢ Live-updating image adjustment sliders to perfect your HDR: 
Choose the perfect brightness, contrast, saturation, warmth, and tint, or let Pro HDR automatically maximize image quality.
â€¢ Take pictures using hardware buttons (volume up/down or the shutter button if your phone has one)
â€¢ Silent capture (mute your shutter sounds for quiet capture)
â€¢ Fullscreen image preview in portrait and landscape orientation
â€¢ Save HDR images at the full resolution of your camera, up to 8 megapixels
â€¢ Seamless background processing that renders your HDRs while you keep on shooting
â€¢ Built-in HDR gallery view to peruse, share, and re-edit your HDRs
â€¢ Share your HDRs with the world with e-mail, Facebook, Twitter, Picasa, and more

IMPORTANT: Pro HDR Camera requires Android 2.2 (Froyo) or later. Pro HDR Camera works on Motorola, HTC and Samsung devices. The exposure functions on LG phones and the Nexus S seem to be broken, so HDR functionality will likely not work (though the rest of the features will). The Nexus S doesn't truly adjust the exposure, but seems to darken or brighten the image in software as a post-processing step. CM7 Not supported!

Installation Notes:

1) Go to settings - applications - enable the 'unknown sources' option.          
2) Put the .apk files somewhere on your SD card.                                 
3) Open your file manager on the device (like Astro Manager from market).
