get your facts straight before going off half cocked.

If you knew anything about blu-ray ripping or encoding you would be aware that the video frame is cropped. (i.e. to spell it out: the top & bottom black bars are removed).  Nothing is lost of your precious ""full HD"" image.  The only thing you should care about is the horizontal resolution (1920 pixels). *sigh*"
