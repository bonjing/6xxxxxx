If your comments were in reference to my Jane's Addiction upload, the reason I left out the apostrophe is TPB tends to have issues with special characters and I Didn't want the title to be messed up.  There is no way to edit anymore so I didn't want to take the chance.  As for log + cue, EAC doesn't run in Linux and if you trust the uploader you don't need a log."
