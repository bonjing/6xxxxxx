,darklordvyper,2012-03-31T23:31Z,"This works. Just make sure that it is installed in the correct location. It made a Dragon age 2 folder INSIDE my Dragon Age 2 folder, so just cut the items from the second folder and paste it into the original DA2 folder. Works fine otherwise. Just has a habit of installing in the wrong folder. LOL."
