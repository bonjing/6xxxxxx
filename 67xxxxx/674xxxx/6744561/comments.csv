,RaSe_77,2011-10-23T14:36Z,Again.....Not sure why you have asked for the same films from me again. Im only assuming maybe you have lost track of who you are requesting from. Pls see my reply: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6761062/The_Vampire_Diaries_S03_E06_HDTV_iPod
,deadpool315,2011-10-29T19:26Z,"thank you for this. quick question, it is because you ripped in from a blu-ray that the size of this file is more than 500mb? :)"
,RaSe_77,2011-11-02T05:39Z,"@deadpool315 In my findings, yes and no, BRRips create larger output files when a film has 'high action scenes'. For example, this torrent is 602.08mib compared to my recent BRRip upload of Larry Crowne  which is only 399.66mib. 

Sorry this was a 'long winded' response to your quick question :D but hope it answers it."
,deadpool315,2011-11-02T17:50Z,"LOL don't worry I understood what you just said, thanks for the upload btw."
