[excerpted from John Stossel's blog:]

I visited the Occupy Wall Street protesters this week and didn't get a warm reception. I wanted to argue with them about capitalism. Most were more interested in just screaming at me.

The protesters have a few things right. Bailouts and crony capitalism are wrong, but almost everything else they said makes little economic sense.

Tonight, I'll debate two progressives, Joe Sibilia of CSRwire and Erica Payne, founder of the Agenda Project.

Fox Business' Charles Payne will defend income inequality and Wall Street.

Josh Barro, an economist from the Manhattan Institute, will discuss some of the economic myths that protesters have repeated.

Tune in tonight at 10pm on the Fox Business Channel.

UPDATE: The show will be airing Saturday night on Fox News at 10pm, 1am, and 5am, and on Sunday at 3pm and midnight.
