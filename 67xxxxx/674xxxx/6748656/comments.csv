,EdoSensei,2011-10-17T08:35Z,"To duffhbc666,

xaja24 was too kind. I'm not one for making trashy comments in general but duffhbc666, you are a COCK!  Got no respect for other people. WHY do you think most people come here to download recent sporting events!? Most because they haven't seen it yet! If they want to just know the result they can go to any number of news sites!

I'm guessing this is the sentiment of the majority of people on here, as you are an idiot!"
,knowyourpast,2011-10-17T10:14Z,"Great quality picture. Cheers for that but how do you put up with the commentary team every match? They get on my nerves!

Got to agree - why give the result away you cock."
,popb0nsai,2011-10-17T19:56Z,"Name calling aside - this is an EXCELLENT upload!  A 10 V 10 - few tiny glitches, but for what it's worth - THANKS SHEMYAZA!!!

,bigfudge,2011-10-20T02:29Z,"as ive said before, craig joubert is the greatest referee in the world right now, and the best ive ever  seen. Pocock was almost invisible on sunday thanks to some proper refereeing. Izzy dagg was just outstanding, thanks for the upload shemyaza"
,wahlamess,2011-10-22T19:53Z,"hey shem. sorry to go off topic, but it's the currie cup semis this w/e and the finals there after... any chance at all of a look??

thanks buddy."
,Mr77FM,2011-11-24T12:03Z,"Thanks, All Blacks Rule!"
,otto321,2011-12-04T22:47Z,"can someone recognize the song played after the game? it's very catchy... ""i don't knoooooow"""
