,Banzay27,2011-12-19T23:32Z,"Not worth it. It's through and through just more content - though don't expect anything storywise other than fill-ins for the gaps in the original campaign. Which I personally never felt were there and these fill-ins are nothing but excuses for more combat. Then again, it's an action game, if you enjoyed it's action so much you haven't had enough by the end of it, then by all means - you get to drive a tank (yes, it does smash buildings in its path!)"
