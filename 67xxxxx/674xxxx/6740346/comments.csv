,rusty_koolaid,2011-10-14T22:02Z,"Is it not a forgone conclusion that we would like people to seed?
Does it really need to be posted constantly, on every single torrent?
Look, we have a great community and it grows everyday. Would it be too much to ask to cease the constant posts regarding ""Pl34se S33D!!!! I'm getting 15kb and I'm at 98%"" ?

We don't care about your personal download rate or status and you make our community look ,   like a bunch of Childish Delta Bravos.  

Yes, I seed over a fiber connection with a 2.5mb up and continue to keep the files up for at least a couple hours after but, I imagine a world where the comment section posts are actually relevant to the Torrent File and content. No one is looking to read about your connection rate.
Let's clean this P2P community up, and treat it as the dominant technology that it is.

,rusty_koolaid,2011-10-14T22:06Z,Great work as always EZ... We all really appreciate your quality and timely posts. Thank you for putting your time into our community.

,ElDigato,2011-10-15T09:56Z,You know what guys? I had my old comp running for 3 months straight seeding DBZ (0.36 mb upload average) And I got at least 70gb up there. I've done enough. Unless you feel like buying me an ISP that doesn't suck.
,Zuxiq,2011-10-15T12:01Z,"something is wrong with my Utorrent i think, i put in the torrent, and nothing happens, i press start, still nothing, trying to forcestart it, still nothing.. wierd as hell =S can someone help me please?"

,ANGRYUNIBR0W101,2011-10-15T17:58Z,"Sweet upload from eztv, I missed the episode and came on here to find it. Thanks for the UP and thanks to the seeders, i like topping out at 1.2 MBS."
,Xeginy,2011-10-15T19:50Z,"great download, thanks"
,DoaKao,2011-10-17T23:48Z,"this is how a torrent's done, nice one!"
,dlarrym1111,2011-10-19T17:33Z,"What you guys may be facing is that 2 of these seaqson 15 torrents, (the 2 newest, have the same ID number. Utorrent and all bittorrent will not allow 2 torrents with the same ID number even if the other info and title are different."
,dlarrym1111,2011-10-19T18:37Z,"I went through my download history to find the 2 that had the same ID number, but when I went back to TPB, the one duplicate was already corrected by the uploader. 
This ONLY happens when someone cuts and pastes someone else's upload and then just adds there user name to the end to make the name different.

NOTE:
THIS IS A REAL TORRENT, BUT IS NOT THE TORRENT WITH A DUPLICATE.

THIS IS the EXAMPLE:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6741735/South_park_season_15_episode_8_Last_of_the_meehecans_[WOBF]

See the 6741735 number in the torrent above, if this number is repeated in another torrent's URL, You will run into a problem where the torrent won't go into your que.
All Bit torrent software, weather it is uTorrent or Transmission or whatever, ONLY looks at that number to know one torrent form another. Even if the names are totally different and even if the movie or show isn't the same. your Bit torrent client will act as if your re-adding a torrent. This was the problem I encountered. I doubt anyones utorrent or whatever they use is messed up. I wanted to share this to help anyone else that finds this problem.AND....

Go try to download the title again. Make sure you re-enter SOUTH PARK key word again like your searching for the first time again. This will make sure you get sent to the updated List of SOUTH PARK downloads.

Hope this helps anyone that had the same symptoms I mentioned above. Cheers!

THANKS for the download [eztv]. Great quality as usual!"
