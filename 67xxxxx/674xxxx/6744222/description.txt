Well, Ashlee doesn't need introductions (if you don't know her just run a search) and so I decided to put on a package with her 3 best files (don't know if there are more). For descriptions just go to Kismet website.

Note: I believe that credits must be given where credits are due and good work should be rewarded. So, if you really liked the content, consider supporting the producers and buy an original so they can continue to produce their stuff. Some have a very good quality and are quite affordable. It's a way to show our gratitude. Take it as a try before buy.
