Early on Feb. 27, 1943, under the waning cover of dark, Berlin`s remaining Jews were rounded up for what the Reich euphemistically referred to as deportation. While most of the detainees were doomed, some 1,700 men, women and children were diverted to a former Jewish community center on Rosenstrasse. Segregated because they were either married to non-Jewish Germans or the progeny of such marriages, the prisoners huddled together while outside, their German relatives, women mostly, initiated an unprecedented protest against the Nazi terror machine. In "Rosenstrasse," the German director Margarethe von Trotta revisits this relatively obscure episode from Germany's Nazi past to dismally inept effect. Known for politically charged movies about tough women, Ms. von Trotta here foregoes the typical historical reconstruction and instead attempts to put the past and the present into conversation. Because she isn't a historian it's arguable that her allegiance to the historical record need not be as firm as her commitment to her art, which at least here appears tenuous at best. That reasoning would certainly fly better if the filmmaker didn't try to wrench an object lesson about female empowerment from the Rosenstrasse protest.
