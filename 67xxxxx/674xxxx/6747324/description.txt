The Beat Goes On is the second album by the American psychedelic rock band Vanilla Fudge, released in early 1968. There aren't any real songs on this album; rather, it's a sound collage featuring just about anything and everything to make it interesting: the voices of world leaders past and present, the band reciting pre-written mantras and reflections, and excerpts of songs (done Vanilla Fudge style) by The Beatles and Sonny Bono.

The group was at odds with their producer George Shadow Morton during this album's recording sessions, as Morton made his own concept album without significant input from the band. In the liner notes to the Sundazed Records 1990's CD reissue of the album, the band denounces it as a failed experiment on their producer's part. Vanilla Fudge's third album Renaissance, which was released quickly after The Beat Goes On, would be Morton's last collaboration with the band.

While not as successful as their debut album, The Beat Goes On was a moderate hit despite the band's reservations, peaking at no.17 on the Billboard album charts in March 1968. (wikipedia)
