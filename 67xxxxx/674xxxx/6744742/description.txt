From the Infowars web site ::

On the Friday edition of the Alex Jones Show, former State Department official Steve Piecznik returns with more commentary on the bogus Iranian terror attack. Alex also talks with Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer about the Iran op and the move toward war. Shaffer is the author of the government censored book Operation Dark Heart. 

Alex also talks with retired CIA officer Ray McGovern and renowned trends forecaster Gerald Celente about the false flag op and the move toward World War Three. Celente forecasted that there will be a major war as the economy crumbles.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
