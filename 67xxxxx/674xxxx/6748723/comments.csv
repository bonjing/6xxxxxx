,spawn666999,2011-10-17T21:17Z,"if u copy the data.zip and the data.z1 to your hard drive u can extract them with winrar/winzip (a few errors occur but they dont seem to be critical) and then u have the files.

nothing in the registry though and if u try to launch, origin wil bitch and moan about no soldier name or something and u need to register it."
,Dest123,2011-10-17T21:33Z,I guess they're weren't using origin at the nvidia lan event. Just some .bat files to launch the game. Origin also launches the bf3.exe with some extra commands. Maybe somebody should look into that?

Dude... This is DICE we're talking about here. They're making this game FOR the PC first even though it's muliplat. This game even if it doesnt live up to BF2 will be awesome.

We've all seen enough gameplay to make an informed decision. If you want to play MP Battlefield 3, BUY THE GAME. It will be worth it. It's onl $49 on Amazon. They even had it for $40 at one point.

BUY


THE 


GAME "
,Ratchoo,2011-10-22T09:30Z,"Buying the game is the worst thing you could possibly do. You see, even if you buy the game in a retail store you still have to install DRM called Origin that requires online activations.

Not only that, but if you actally read the Terms of Service before you install Origin, you'll clearly see that it says that if you agree you give them the right to scan your computer, your settings, your harddrive, and store the inforation and then share it to 3rd parties. There's a word for that: SPYWARE.

I cincerely hope that as many as possible do NOT buy the game, so EA loses money and learns their lesson. Yes, the BF series will suffer, the Swedish developers might suffer (which is where I live), but so be it. Don't buy the game and support EA, show your unhappiness with the DRM and they will have to change, seeing as they are already losing money and have been for the last few years."
,simkas,2011-10-22T10:54Z,"@Ratchoo

FYI, all that bullshit about Origin scanning your PC has been confirmed to be just a load of bullshit a long time ago. Origin is not any more of a spyware than steam is, nor is it any more of a DRM than steam is."

I per-order a physical battlefield 3, but it will take a long time for I can receive it, but I will receive the CD-KEY soon the game come out by e-mail from my friend that live in UK, so can I use that CD KEY to download the game from origin, or can I just use the legally CD-KEYS that my friend buy them to me, on an other no-cracked BTF3 copy that I will downloaded from torrent, or can I use the CD-KEYS from the physical BTF3 that my friend will send them to me via e-mail on origin to download BTF3 and go online, because I will not receive my physical BTF3 from UK until my friend come back from UK and that will take 2 month, I don't want to wait 2 month to play BTF3, thank you guys.

Sounds like a whiny, pissy kid who's pc cannot run the game. SUPPORT EA PEOPLE! Buy the game. It is worth it for the MP, not the campaign. For those that downloaded the torrent and played campaign would surely have to agree that the campaign AI was a bit iffy. Fair enuff, we all know DICE have always failed when it came to SP AI but are GENIUS when it comes to MP part. THIS IS THE REASON YOU BUY THE GAME AND SUPPORT THESE GUYS! FUCK ALL YOU HATERS... GOOD JOB DICE! Now... Back to the game :D
