You've no clue as to whether that identity is their 1st, 2nd, or 26th.... You've no idea if it's but one of several sock pups. You've no clue what you're talking about at all, in fact. For all you know, they are among the most prolific seeders currently participating on this site. Uploading is the one and only way to contribute? Really? Says who... You? lol.

Even if they aren't seeding and have never up'd a thing anywhere, you have no idea what their individual circumstances might be. Saying 'thanks' might be the most they can manage at the moment. I don't speak for EZ or anyone else, but saying 'thanks' is a hell of a lot more than many people do.

 STFU and tend to your own damn knitting, y'smarmy little priss.

Sry to rant every1... i just get sick of these little bully napoleons that run around making moral pronouncements about everyone else.

I found that while the effects for the most part were good and the acting was decent enough, the overall story-line was just too cliche for my tastes. Now I know some people will criticize me and claim it was all based on some comic but honestly, if a movie is going to be packed with that much stereotypical content then the script should be revised or it shouldn't be filmed. 

Overall it was a decent action flick and worth a one time watch if you don't expect much of it. Hope this helps!

~Cheers!"

,Fishpaw23,2011-10-25T21:53Z,"It's a movie called ""Captain America"" and the cover art is dripping with U.S. flags and images of awesome surrounding a guy dressed in red, white, and blue.  

Even if you'd never heard of the comic, why would any part of you be surprised that it's pro-America?  All I have to say is, ""Well ... DUH!""

Anyway, as far as Avengers movies goes, this one is not as good as Iron Man, but better than Thor.  It's a decently fun action flick and will tie in nicely to the release of The Avengers movie.

As for download quality, excellent all around.  Thanks, extremezone!"

Animated movies and the justice league cartoon have better fight scenes. Good acting. Maybe if I was stoned I wouldn't think the fight scenes weren't so lame. I mean really how can you be beat by cartoons? Fight scenes make or break super hero movies in my opinion. Stop putting slow moving laser guns in movies, if a future fantasy weapon is not better then a real gun don't put it in a movie."

Thanks extremezone once more. you saved my but from me brother, who couldn't wait a minute longer to watch this movie.

About the movie: I like the way how marvel creates a universe of interwoven stories. It makes you want more of this stuff. But the rating for the movie by me would be about 6/10. Nothing special, it didnt make me connect with the character motives very much. Of course they are attractive motives, war and stuff is always serious, but you cant rely on the motive itself, you need to make me believe in them. No such thing here. Sorry."
,OverlordAlexndr,2011-12-11T18:06Z,"@smaryan1990

could be codecs(most likely), but thats irrelevant, because a good player will take care of all those stuff, so->solution:

just download a solid media player, like VLC or sort. I use VLC, but I have Windows so just look around for about 15 min or so on forums for the best media player for Mac and you'll have a clue of what are the best-standing applications."
