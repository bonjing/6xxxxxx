,namshub,2011-10-25T03:38Z,"I've just come across your material for the first time, @neil1966hardy, and I am loving it. It started with my recent purchase of a Samsung Stratoshphere (my first smartphone) and searching for software to convert PDFs to smaller EPUBs.

But your collection, though eclectic, is right up my alley.

I thank you!"
