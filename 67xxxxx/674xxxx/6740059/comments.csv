,Mr_Stoned_the_bootlegger,2011-11-03T15:33Z,"Many many thanks for an excellent torrent and if FLAC format too... the real collectors really appreciate the lossless FLAC format. :-) 

btw, this torrent is the ""Studio Discography (Lossless) - FLAC"". You don't have ""Live Discography (Lossless) - FLAC"" ???

Thanks and cheers... "
