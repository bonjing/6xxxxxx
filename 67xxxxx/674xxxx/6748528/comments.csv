I felt like I had to crank the volume a little louder than normal, otherwise great download (I only give 10 to original DVDs)"
,kingknight4,2012-02-08T17:04Z,Yify quality..
,zlo78,2012-02-10T21:24Z,Cheers mate!
,joshm8733,2012-02-18T15:15Z,You only give a quality of 10 to full DVDs when a Full Size 9GB Dual Layer DVD can only be at max 480P. That makes no sense whatsoever..
,joshm8733,2012-02-18T15:18Z,"Great Movie by the way. I absolutely love it. It's one of those movies I almost downloaded in 1080, but I honestly can't tell much of the difference and I only have a stereo setup and all of those 1080P files have 7.1 audio built in, which makes the file size is that much more huge.   I love the quality and the size of YIFY's encodes."
