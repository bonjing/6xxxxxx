,elessarGObonzo,2011-10-14T18:00Z,if it comes with the DLC what do we need this for?
,Thompson93,2011-10-14T19:11Z,That the problem ... it isn't come with the dlc its seperated from the dlc and you download it from Bioware like a new bonus items.
,illiria,2011-10-15T18:11Z,"Great work, I'll include that in the repack, and will give a link to your torrent for people who want a standalone version (hope I won't forget, a lot is on my mind).

Just one quick question: somewhere on BiOWare's site I saw that there are two more items to be found within the DLC, or to be released separately. Any word on that?"
,illiria,2011-10-15T18:13Z,"P.S. Asking because trust me, updating the pack takes a LOT of time. It takes two hours to only compile that thing with good compression. So I prefer not to redo that often. :P"
,Thompson93,2011-10-15T22:04Z,"@illiria 
Thanks.
Now  i need information about the bonus items you mention.. names or specific  URL (link) of where you read it. 

If there is something i'll make sure to find it before your redo. -Trust me :)

However, i need a contact ""way"" and since i cant sent you a pm here... i hope you got a Bioware Account, well if you have go to the left of the screen 
-> Friends -> Find More Friends ->type  my name at ""Display Name"" section (is the same as here) and sent a pm.

,illiria,2011-10-15T22:52Z,"Here they are. All the, as it seems, UPCOMING items. According to blog entry where I found it, these were found by some user in BioWare Social Network. I would guess found somewhere in game resources. And according to the blog, these PROMO items are yet to be released.

I don't think I'll be remaking my repack every time some new item is released, it's too much hassle. I'll wait for something major, I think. We'll see. If there will be a bunch of items, I'll repack. But I'm not really going to redo the job and reupload every time a new ring comes out. :P

Still curious to see the upcoming items (source seems reliable)."

Hey illiria 

The best thing you can do is to delay a little bit the release until we find sth.

give me some time (1-2 days) "
,Thompson93,2011-10-16T10:52Z,"hey i just find one that is not in your list

 named:
The ""Barracks"" ?

,Hexcreed,2011-10-16T12:33Z,"Can someone upload un-cracked version, please?"
,ugzfflou,2011-10-16T15:51Z,Is there a way to get the Ring without being pre-cracked?
,Thompson93,2011-10-16T17:01Z,"Patience guys im working on something...

,Thompson93,2011-10-16T17:35Z,"@illiria
