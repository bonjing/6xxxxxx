Consumers typically face three main challenges when it comes to understanding their automobiles: the technologies underlying the car's major systems, the basics of inspection and maintenance, and the financial aspects of owning and operating an automobile. In this updated edition, The Car Care Book, 4th Edition explores these areas, using the very latest automobile technology to provide an accurate, current context for learning. The book first breaks each section of the car into systems and subsystems to help the reader digest important concepts. Coverage then progresses to include the common tools needed to perform car maintenance and minor repairs, as well as building a preventive maintenance program. Concluding with a section on financial issues, from buying and selling to insurance considerations to the benefits of leasing, this resource provides a thorough and comprehensive overview of basic automobile care.
