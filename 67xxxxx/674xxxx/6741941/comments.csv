,User897,2011-10-14T08:19Z,"There's no sample, so I have to ask, is the text and writing within the movie English or Spanish?  All the others so far are Spanish and it's pissing me off!"
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-10-14T16:04Z,"@User987:

There is only a separate Romanian subtitle. You can move/delete if you don't need it.

English audio !!!"
,User897,2011-10-14T16:38Z,"I understand that, but I need to know if things like road signs and the bomb timer display on 'Mater are English.  So far, all I've seen is Spanish."
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-10-14T20:44Z,"@User789:

You don't understand at all !! Spanish is a language made for car-spy!! 

Take it or leave it!"
,ptv83,2011-10-15T02:27Z,all the writing through the movie is in spansih.. it's a lot of .. well everything is in spanish.  it buggers up a half dozen scenes of the movie for those who haven't seen it before.. and kids who can't guess what it's supposed to say.

Thanks for the backup.  It does effect the movie and all of these uploaders need to share this information!  I have wasted far too much time and bandwidth so far, when all they have to do is let us know."

@ptv83:

Wait for an english subtitle or make one for yourself !


There is no other source outhere for these rips  !

And ...there are lots of kids who  are not understanding english at all or not well enough, 
so they need anyway a dubbed version in their native language or  a subtitle for these rips !!!

Or....a father or a mother near them to explain !!!


Cheers!
