The year 1993 was special, starting with Jack's induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Cream, and ending with an inspired fiftieth birthday concert which featured many of his old friends including Dick Heckstall-Smith, Maggie Reilly and Gary Moore.

We used to say in the sixties: never trust anyone over thirty. And I never planned to pass that great age. But I am so glad to have been around to be a part of the celebration that this record represents. And it is a celebration. Not so much of Jack Bruce the musician or survivor. I believe all the great people who took part in this event were celebrating the music - and the wonder of music is that while you may grow older, music stays forever young. Thank you so very much my wonderful friends. I know we will meet again soon - in the safest place in the world.
(Jack Bruce, 10 December 1993)
