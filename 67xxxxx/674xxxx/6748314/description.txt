Raised by her aunt Sarah (Sally Hawkins) after her parents die of
typhus, young Jane Eyre (Amelia Clarkson) is later shipped off to
a stark boarding school as the result of her perceived insolence,
and suffers greatly at the hands of the cold, unusually strict   
administration. Upon turning 18 and completing her education,    
Jane (Mia Wasikowska) finds work as a governess for Adle Varens  
(Romy Settbon Moore), the ward of Edward Fairfax Rochester       
(Michael Fassbender), master of Thornfield Hall. It doesn't take 
long for the young Adle to warm to Jane, and upon returning home 
the charming Rochester, too, falls under the spell of his modest 
yet captivating governess. On what was supposed to be the        
happiest day of Jane's life, however, a scandalous secret is     
revealed, and the emotionally shattered governess takes flight...
