Is there anything more beautiful than an â€œAâ€ in Algebra? Not to the Lial team! Marge Lial, John Hornsby, and Terry McGinnis write their textbooks and accompanying resources with one goal in mind: giving students all the tools they need to achieve success.

 

With this revision, the Lial team has further refined the presentation and exercises throughout the text. They offer several exciting new resources for students that will provide extra help when needed, regardless of the learning environment (classroom, lab, hybrid, online, etc)â€“new study skills activities in the text, an expanded video program available in MyMathLab and on the Video Resources on DVD, and more!
