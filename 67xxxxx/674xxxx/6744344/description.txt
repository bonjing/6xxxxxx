Storyline: IMF agent Ethan Hunt has been sent on a mission to retrieve
and destroy the supply of a genetically created disease called 'Chimera'.
His mission is made impossible due to the fact that he is not the only
person after samples of the disease. He must also contest with a gang
of international terrorists headed by a turned-bad former IMF agent who
has already managed to steal the cure called 'Bellerophon' and now needs
'Chimera' to complete their grand plan of infecting the whole world. In
order to infiltrate and locate the terrorist group he relies on the
help of an international thief Nyah of whom he quickly develops a love
interest. Time is not only running out for Agent Hunt to find and
destroy 'Chimera' before the terrorists get their hands on it, but he must
also find 'Bellerophon' so as to save his love interest who has already
become infected by the disease from a terrible and rapid death.

Storyline: Super-spy Ethan Hunt has retired from active duty to train
new IMF agents. But he is called back into action to confront the
toughest villain he's ever faced - Owen Davian, an international weapons
and information provider with no remorse and no conscience. Hunt assembles
his team: his old friend Luther Strickell, transportation expert Declan,
and background operative Zhen. They are to rescue one of his very own
trainees, Lindsey, who was kidnapped while on a surveillance detail of
Davian. It soon becomes evident that Davian is well-protected,
well-connected, and downright malicious. This forces Hunt to extend his
journey back into the field in order to rescue his wife, Julia, and
uncover IMF double agents in the process.
