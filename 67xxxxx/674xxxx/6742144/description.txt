MiTierra - Incredible Latin Jazz Guitar Music

I recently went to a live concert of some world class musicians from Germany. I was so stunned by their performance that I bought their CD and learned that they have another Album on the way.

Their music can not just be defined as purely Latin or Latin-Jazz since they use multiple elements from different music genres such as Flamenco, Oriental, Greek, Jazz, Latin rhythms and many more. Their sophisticated style is very unique with a lot of focus on the Guitar and a lot of detail in their percussion and I spoke to one of them and he told me that all of the artists have studied their instrument in a classical way.

I want to share the experience and therefore I bring you a couple of songs from the CD. I thought it would be unfair to leave out their website info towards those great artists:
