Is it crap, a virus, mislabeled, stamped with spam, do you hate the fact he never posts previews, or do just not like his name? "

Presumably it's because - No preview and RAR file (not separate picture files)


If it was fake, people would come back to comment.. Probably the poster just doesn't care about presentation or helping others to find what they are looking for.."
