A nice mix of the two sides of Pharoah Sanders â€“ the spiritual jazz elements first developed in his Coltrane years, and some of the more straight-styled blowing he explored in later years! The album's got a bit more of the latter than the former â€“ despite the title â€“ but it still is a beautiful demonstration of the deep, deep soul found in Sanders' tenor â€“ still a tremendously expressive instrument after all these years!
