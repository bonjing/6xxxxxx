Why Virtual Access Point?
While on business trips or attending conferences, there may not always be multiple Internet connections available for all participants to take advantage of. Using Virtual Access Point software you can share Internet access with co-workers during meetings or conferences in locations where there is just one Internet connection such as a hotel or conference centre. This will work in locations which offer Internet access connections through an Ethernet connection.

Virtual Access Point is used to share only one Internet connection between two or more computers. One of these computers acts the server role which has an ethernet cable plugged in, and it broadcasts Wi-Fi signal. Other computers with wireless adapter card, will find the Wi-Fi signal and can join in the wireless network, so can surf the Internet through the server computer\\\'s sharing.
