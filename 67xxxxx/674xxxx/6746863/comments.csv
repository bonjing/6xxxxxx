[T],burgundyranger,2011-10-16T00:49Z,"Two things:

1) Thee *IS NO HD VERSION* of this episode. Here's why, from dekabroken, the guy I get these encodes from:

""SD encode only this weekend due to Nick HD airing the episode in ""fake HD,"" upscaled and windowboxed.""

2) I will be out of town the next two Saturdays -- so the posting of episodes 20 and 21 will be delayed.

Also, I AM seeding this from the time I posted this torrent."
,dude2x187,2011-10-16T19:51Z,Thanks for the upload BR. Would you mind telling us where dekabroken posts his downloads? since you're gonna be gone for 2 weeks?? Thanks in advance.
[T],burgundyranger,2011-10-16T21:08Z,"How about this -- I won't be able to do the torrents, but I will post links to those encodes in this thread."
[T],burgundyranger,2011-10-16T21:19Z,"I think TPB is set up so that I can't use the word ""megauploxd"" in a comment (replace the 'x' with an 'a' to get the word I really mean)"
,CRO-HAN,2011-10-17T04:04Z,Oh well No HD This week. Calling All Power Rangers keep a eye out  for the HD Rerun of this episode on nick in the future.
[T],burgundyranger,2011-10-17T04:16Z,"That's just it, there won't be one. Nick has only one PR time slot each week. All other reruns are on the non-HD Nicktoons channel."
[T],burgundyranger,2011-10-23T01:48Z,"Here's the link for the HD encode (Nick got it right this week:

And here's the SD:

http://www.multiuploxd.com/7R0RKBNOPV

change the x to an a to get the right URL"
,dude2x187,2011-10-23T05:23Z,Thanks So Much BR!! 
,Sheldon131,2011-10-23T09:57Z,It doesn't work! :(
,jchen28,2011-10-24T01:44Z,burgundyranger can you please put up episode 20
[T],burgundyranger,2011-10-24T16:30Z,"Both links work *IF* you change the 'x' to an 'a' in the URL. If you just click it, it won't work.

I CAN'T post torrents for 20 OR 21 until Oct. 31 at the earliest. I'm on vacation."
,whmxtra,2011-10-25T05:53Z,"Just a heads up, I found a 720p version by sheer luck and I'm uploading it now, will seed as long as I can (although atm my torrent doesn't even show up on here lol.

It's at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6769367 if it doesn't show on the list."
,dude2x187,2011-10-28T21:30Z,BR are you going to post the link for ep21 here as well??
[T],burgundyranger,2011-10-31T16:26Z,"Here's episode 21 (again, replace the 'x' with an 'a'):

HD: http://www.multiuploxd.com/OZTIIXSUIP
