,Lenchanteurmerlin,2011-10-14T09:17Z,"Thank you Fizban, but my question was not about patchine host, I understand that.  But about all the ID numbers that I have to fill in to get a registration number and all that sort of thing."

What is User 1 Code and User 2 Code?"

,Lenchanteurmerlin,2011-10-16T15:32Z,"OK, this how to proceed.
Click register.
Take out internet.
Activate.
Then without Internet it will offer to activate offline.
That's where you see the necessary numbers that you then feed into the keygen.
Patch manually host.

Everything works fine then.

Thank you to whoever produce this stuff but he should improve his basic pedagogic skills. "
,x86melter,2011-11-02T23:26Z,"Thank you! Works perfect! To those who don't know how to use it:

1. Disable internet.
2. Install and open UltraEdit.
3. Click Register when it asks you about it.
4. Click Activate, which will send you to another box. Click Offline Activation.
5. Fill in a username and password.
6. Copy the 2 codes into the keygen. Click generate. Copy the codes it gives you into the registration box and register! 
7. Patch host file from the keygen.

That's it!"
