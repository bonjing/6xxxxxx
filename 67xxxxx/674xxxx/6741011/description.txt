'I Can Tell' boasts an all-star backing band of rock & roll stars, featuring everyone from Bill Wyman to Robbie Robertson. John Hammond leads the band through a set of Chicago blues standards, reaching deep into the catalogs of Willie Dixon, Elmore James, Howlin' Wolf, and many others. Although the performances can occasionally sound too studied, the album is by and large an unadulterated delight - the affection Hammond and his band have for the material is quite clear. The CD reissue includes four cuts from his 1970 album, 'Southern Fried', which feature Duane Allman on slide guitar.
