This is a straight DVD rip of Death Note Volume 1.

It contains episodes 1-4.

All episodes have both English and Japanese audio tracks, as well as subtitles.

I did NOT compress it during the rip, as to preserve quality.

This means it's currently too big to burn on to a regular DVD-R and will need to be compressed to do so. You may use the software of your choice, I'll leave that up to you. 

However, if you'd like to watch it on your computer, most software that plays DVDs will play these files. 

I hope you enjoy!
