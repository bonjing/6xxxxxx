Thank for creating this collection, famerv!

"Hi Nintendo DS lovers!

I am an NDS gamer and also an NDS roms collector. For long I had been troubled with how I could manage my huge NDS roms collection. I had 2 choices:
1. Collect only English roms in U region. However I would miss English games not available in U (but E or Au).
2. Collect all English roms in all regions. But I would face the difficulty of removing duplicate roms. Doing it once is even hard and takes a lot of time. But it is more painful when you add new games to your collection and you have to again check them with every old game one by one to detect the duplication.

Days ago I had an idea of making a special collection of NDS roms for English roms collectors that relies 100% on the ADVANsCEne's database. Special things in this collection are:
- It includes every single release that have English language in any region.
- All duplicate roms are removed, in this priority: U, E, Au. For example if a game have 2 versions (U and E), the E version is removed. Moreover, if there are two or more releases of the same game in the same region from different groups, only one release is chosen.
- All demos excluded.
- It is 100% compatible with NdsCRC and RToolDS. So every game will be recognized in these tools.

The important thing is that I did not collect them by the judge of my own eyes, but totally by the help of the ADVANsCEne's database."





Here is the complete list in the collection.
