,ausvirgo,2011-12-25T07:29Z,"@yuyuhakusho - Many Thanks for the upload!

@zxkb4s29 - Instead of just criticising, how's about giving links for getting the missing ROMs, or uploading a ""supplement"" torrent and giving the link to that.

As long as new games/versions keep being relased, NO upload is going to be complete for long!"
