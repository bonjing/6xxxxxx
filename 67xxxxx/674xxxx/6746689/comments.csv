Same torrent that's already doing the rounds, ring sequences pitch black. The outdoor scenes like many TS files are 5/10 but most of this CGI filled movie are night/indoor which are 3/10 at best.
When u DL if u think it's 'watchable' u need a CT scan!"
,sandisexmagnet,2011-10-17T05:21Z,why do wankers call it a TS when its a CAM? why??
,drewkrew,2011-10-20T13:19Z,"@saandisexmagnet

A TSYNC is a CAM source thats why! The only difference is a CAM uses the CAM's microphone audio and a TSYNC will have audio taken from a headphone socket in the cinema, or jacked from the projector room etc etc so basically audio from a cleaner source. 

Gee, if your gonna complain and rant on five different torrents with the same comment, at least make it a valid point! 
I could just post back and say: ""Why do wankers think TSYNCS are not CAMS too?""!"
