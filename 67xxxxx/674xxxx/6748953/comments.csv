Or is it the FULL version????"
,xxx2806,2011-10-17T09:05Z,"It is full version of pre-release (Maybe beta) ;)
The serial is valid if u block '127.0.0.1 practivate.adobe.com' with host file or through firewall or disconnect from internet while installing and using

We can expect final release after Apiral 2012"

,saif25990,2011-10-19T01:16Z,how does the keygen work? i cant seem to find the serial code in all the progs and notes provided with the download hence i can only use the 30 day trial version. any help would be much appreciated :)
,khanthep,2011-10-22T14:27Z,Very good
,Rzilla09,2011-10-22T14:57Z,Thanks m8
,harlita,2011-10-22T16:06Z,Win7 Ultimate 64x - install works great. Don't forget to patch host file (manually or using the button on the keygen).   Music is nice- I'm leaving it playing. Also for people who don't know better - antivirus will detect trojan in keygen. ignore that or disable prior to install. kthxbai.
,JacanoForever,2011-10-23T06:02Z,Thanks! :D
,lif3isfr33,2011-10-24T03:58Z,"FAKE FAKE FAKE. At least to some partially fake. Its been tampered and customized by some hacker. It still works as any Adobe product out there but, to say its official? Don't think so. Plus Adobe hasn't talked about CS6 yet. CS5.5 was the latest from Adobe. Waste of d/l I provided screen shots for those who are thinking about d/ling. Nothing wrong with dl/ its just not official so I'm not touching that.

,nigelnaturit,2011-11-24T13:18Z,"Works a dream on win7 ulitimate, though the adjusment layer icon colour look up has got ""fake"" on it, also when the picture refreshers the icons blink in sequence, like its stepping through the code (system is a quad core Q9400 clocked at 3.2 GHz with 8gb of ram), but apart from that it's great.
Just one ore thing the Keygen reports a virus as do so many I had problems d/l because of it so turned anitvirus off.

These all will work only if you patch your hosts file (C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts)

Patching is done by adding this to end of the file:
127.0.0.1 practivate.adobe.com"

,doggrell3000,2011-11-28T21:50Z,thanks scene4all and core .... ps cs6 loads and works fine .  my proplem is this .... i cannot patch my host file because each time i try to enter the host file patch and save it a message pops up and says that i am not authorized to write in the host file or alter the host file even though i am definitely the administer of this computer ..( old hp running windows 8 ) .... so i have to keep reentering a new serial number from the core keygen  every time i use the ps cs6 .... my question is : how can i get the host file to accept the new adobe phrase ? anyone know ? thanks ....
,tom982,2011-11-29T22:50Z,"@doggrell3000

1. Hold the windows key and press R
2. In the run dialogue box, type:

cmd 

and press enter
3. When command prompt opens, type this command, and then press enter:

arrtib -R -A -S -H %SYSTEMROOT%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts

Then do the same for this command:

echo ""127.0.0.1 practivate.adobe.com"" >> %SYSTEMROOT%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts

Then this command:

ipconfig /flushdns

**The spaces are essential in all of these, make sure you put them in!**

And voila, your HOSTS file is patched :) enjoy!

,tom982,2011-11-29T22:51Z,"P.S. Thanks for the up! Works like a charm - Windows 7 Ultimate x86.

,imunionjack,2012-01-01T18:07Z,"Its all working kushdee on W7 Ultimate 64bit. Ive all the normal plugins active like Redfield/ALL the Topaz including Vivacity/Red Giant/Flaming Pear/Alien Skin (Not that I use all of them but needed to check as the members on my photoshop forum use them all)
Theres some really nice refinements to this but you wont notice them till you look for them so find a good write up say the Adobe Sneak Peaks http://tv.adobe.com/show/max-2011-sneak-peeks/ and you will see the Adobe workers showing some of them.
The only problem Ive come across so far is I lose the thumbnails to the Layer Styles sometimes but closing/opening sorts it.
Its a very good pre release and at first I told my members not to bother swapping from CS5 but after a good looksee Id recommend you upgrading to this.
If you have any Ps related problems please msg me.
Happy new year.
Love and Peace

,sadjuk,2012-02-05T02:35Z,"The release is legit. Keygen may be flagged by paranoid AVs, best ignore the warnings. Generated keys do work and there was no imperative need to patch the hosts file.

,imunionjack,2012-02-14T12:11Z,Been using this now since October and not had any problems with it at all. Ive told all the members on my Photoshop site that 'IF' they were to look on this link I noticed there was a clean copy of it :) :) The only thing Im really pissed off about is all the spin and spiel Adobe leaked out about the DeBlur plugin and Ive come to the conclusion its 1 of 2 things. ! Adobe will add it to the proper full release when it comes out or 2 Adobe will sell the DeBlur plugin as an extra so they can become even wealthier or 3 It wont be installed until a later version so they can make even more dosh! Whichever option I like CS6
