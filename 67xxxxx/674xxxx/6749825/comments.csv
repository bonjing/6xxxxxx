,linaliu,2011-10-29T20:10Z,"Hi there, I am having problems loading the maps. Do I just simply copy the img files into my Garmin ? Do I need to run MAPINSTALL application, plug in GPS etc to update the new map. Please help, totally clueless about this. Thanks"

If you wants send maps to the Garmin folder of the PC, you have to patch Mapsource, search TPB for the patched exe."
