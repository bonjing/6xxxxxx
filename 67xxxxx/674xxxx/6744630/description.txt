On Tuesday\'s Mark Levin Show: NJ Governor Chris Christie has now endorsed Mitt Romney for the Republican primary - do you care? The idea that we are running out of time to pick a candidate is ludicrous. Now is the time to vet the Republican candidates so we can get a clear picture of their principles and beliefs on subjects that have a direct bearing on our lives. Yet, the Republican establishment would want you to believe that someone like Romney is the only hope. These are the same people that didn\'t want Reagan in 1976 either. Mark says he\'s tired of the media and some politicians saying we need to put aside our ideological differences during the primary process when that is exactly when we need to have them. Also, apparently the White House used Romney\'s healthcare plan as a guide for Obamacare. Finally, UFC fighter Chael Sonnen calls in to talk about his recent and future UFC fights.
