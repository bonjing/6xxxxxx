,Saitu282,2012-01-08T06:41Z,what do you do after you extract the 2.94 gb rar folder? how do you get the iso? i am unable to extract any of the rar files. which is the first?
,Saitu282,2012-01-08T11:46Z,"okay. my mistake. never using winrar agin. got the game installed, started it and all. fine. now, how can you play offline? i created a local account and all. but still asks you to login to play multiplayer. i don wanna do that. i want single player. but i must login coz theres no menu. how can i play single player offline?"
,Radscar,2012-01-25T04:50Z,@Saitu282 Games which uses windows live require you to create an offline profile. If there's an option for forced offline use that as well.
