Static Shock 1-4 (Rebirth of the Cool) plus 9-11 tribute comic from Milestone.
This is a miniseries that came out in 2001 after Milestone had basically closed up shop and after Static had become popular due to the cartoon.

From "A Comic A Day"

Static Shock: Rebirth of the Cool is essentially Static Returns in regards to his comic book roots, but when this issue was originally released, the character had received more prestige as a Saturday morning cartoon star than as a founding character of the then-defunct Milestone Universe. So, ironically, while this miniseries sought to exploit Staticâ€™s return to popularity, it also attempts to re-launch an imprint of dormant characters, a lofty goal for a mere four issues . . .

Leave it to Dwayne McDuffie to accomplish it in one.
