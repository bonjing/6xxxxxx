,198GODFATHER,2011-10-20T20:01Z,Good quality but definitely not a 1080p!!! Maybe 720p....
,nicodemvs,2011-10-25T17:08Z,"@198GODFATHER
You are incorrect. Actual picture resolution is 1920x816 (apparently without interlacing) which, due to the weird way HD resolutions are labelled, means it counts as 1080p.

To determine if a picture is 1080p, look to the horizontal resolution. If it's 1920, then it's technically a 1080p image. If it's 1280, then it's a 720p image.

All of these comments assume that we're talking about non-interlaced (progressive) images."

,911tifa,2012-01-14T19:20Z,IS IT progressive or interlaced because if it's interlaced then 720p will be better
,PikachuCLS,2012-02-21T00:02Z,"I appreciate it, though before downloading, I'd like to know if SiNNERS put watermarks on their stuff. Thanks, wouldn't want to waste time downloading things with watermarks."
