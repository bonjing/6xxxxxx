ReleaseNotes:

It's time to kick the three-chord, screaming vocals, generic melody, solo-less, "I hate my life", modern rock garbage to the dump where it belongs, and Candlebox is back to lead the charge. It is such a pleasure to finally buy a new album made by talented musicians and great writers. Every song on this disc is killer. I would have preferred a couple more of the faster songs, and overall the album probably isn't a total masterpiece like the debut or Happy Pills, but this is definitely one of the best albums that will be released this year. Any rock radio station that doesn't play something off this should be boycotted.

We rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.
HHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)
