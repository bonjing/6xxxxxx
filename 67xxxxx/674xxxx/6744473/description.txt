This is a rare game i guess, so here it is for classic strategy players loving 2d which sometimes fits better than 3d (like in warlords battlecry ii). Published by arxel tribe in 2001 and developed by wizard soft this RTS includes a good story in a heroic fantasy setting in lands where dinosaurs roam. It includes 4 campaigns, skirmish and editor. Cracks by famous teams and serial number included. Burn in a dvd, create a virtual drive using power iso, mount the image and install the game. Then use one of the cracks with its special process and play. Enjoy and don't forget to seed!
