On April 22, 1980 the Cure released their second album Seventeen Seconds. After Three Imaginary Boys, the group discusses the 80's with an album that many consider the most successful. Seventeen Seconds gives the group its first success with "A Forest", this classic to the sublime and refined fugitive bass riff. The Cure have already mastered to perfection the art of the song gloomy and bare. The look of Robert Smith - tousled hair, pale face, lipstick and pressed black suits - became their trademark, as well as the words dream and the song cold.
 Like the album cover, which is limited to an abstract task, the sound thin and minimalist at the time of Cure Seventeen Seconds is subtly suggestive. The album offers an exciting atmosphere of melancholy, short instrumentals and some pop tracks, as lively and virtuosic "Play For Today." Seventeen Seconds has a place alongside the masterpieces of the group are Pornography and Disintegration.
