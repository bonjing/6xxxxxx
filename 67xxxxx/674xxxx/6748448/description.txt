"Ghostlusters" is a heartfelt product of its time: It's the type of straightforward, shoestring-budget feature pornography that's seldom seen in today's slick adult entertainment market. Directed by the late fetish king Bruce Seven from a script by Raven Touchstone, this 1990 girl-on-girl film is a fun, light comedy starring an array of the era's most gorgeous and horny ladies, all of whom love giving pleasure to other women. Lesbian moviemakers Pamela (Victoria Paris) and Ricki (Bionca) wrestle with the ghosts of smut films past when they encounter the sexy blonde apparition (Tianna) haunting their new film studio. The voyeuristic ghost spies on the film crew and the ongoing lesbian escapades - seems like all these hot women can barely stop licking and probing one another long enough to shoot a movie! As for the sultry, flapper-era phantom, well, being a non-corporeal spirit doesn't keep her from masturbating just about anytime and everywhere, even using modern conveniences such as vibrators. This is one thoroughly modern spook! The kooky ghost finally introduces herself formally to the horny filmmakers, sparking a delicious S/M threesome involving suspension play and hot candle wax. Bionca recruits the insatiable spirit to star in her new all-girl production, and their big orgy of wild paranormal activity makes lesbian sex history! "Ghostlusters" is a sexy romp from another world.
