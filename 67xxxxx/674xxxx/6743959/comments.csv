,QuePensa,2011-10-14T17:43Z,"Thank You! Unfortuately there is no Portuguese audio, but as usual, your work was amazing!"
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-10-14T18:18Z,"I'll upload the Transformers trilogy multi in 2 hours and 2011 Transformers Dark Of The Moon has Port Audio ;-)
It's worth the effort to watch the movies in English (with subs), you'll soon speak it fluently ;-)
A couple of years ago my Eng was a joke but since I avoid dubbed Audios I improved a lot.
I know it's hard especially when we're tired but not impossible."
,hei-ja33,2011-10-14T19:49Z,thanks mkvonly!!! finsub yes 
,lostname74,2011-10-15T09:26Z,"Thank you
and extra thanks for having a lot of subs... keep up the good work :)"
,Mr.Chewie,2011-10-16T14:24Z,"
it say 18 days thats crazy

Please seed :) and thanks for the amazing UL"
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-10-16T14:44Z,"computer says ""No"" ;-)
I seeded over 60 ratio and still seeding with 8 MB/s.
A fix needs to be done on your side, close other torrents and let more connections.
Limit the upload (in your BTClient) to 80% of your upload-bandwidth.
Everybody expects to download with higher speed then they can upload, that's absurd and not fair."
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-10-16T14:49Z,"..and please stop rating my torrents with pluses, let the naughty kids enjoy giving the minuses, they amuse me really ;-)
If you liked the quality leave a message instead, if you didn't like it visit your doctor(s) ;-) thx."
,sdkyron,2011-10-17T09:14Z,"The quality is amazing, it's just very sad that you didn't include the audio tracks like you did with Thor or Transformers. It's not so much about learning english, it's more like some of us have kids :)"
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-10-17T11:58Z,"Any way the source was a remux having only English audios.
The original audio is so cool for these movies that any dub would spoil the quality.
What about the kids from countries which don't dub the movies? Trust me they enjoy the movies too and will develop intuition and guess/learn more and more words by each movie, in other words they will be somewhat smarter then the kids watching dubbed movies.
cheers"
,patbb,2011-10-17T16:41Z,"Amazing!
I was waiting for your copy because I'm sure they are perfect.
Thanks for all your work."
,sdkyron,2011-10-21T19:16Z,"From mkvonly: ""What about the kids from countries which don't dub the movies?""

Come on, we're talking about civilized peoples here, not the third world, that's just a wrong argument."
,Oreo4728,2011-10-29T01:09Z,"are you fucking serious? slowest torrent of my life, and when it's finished, first video doesn't work, second starts the video and suddenly one goes from being 2+ hours long to just over a minute and doesn't finish the opening credits, and the rest of the videos have an ad instead of a video. I waited 3 1/2 days for this, thanks a lot man, thank you SO much."
,JohnPogs,2011-11-24T03:26Z,OMG mkvonly is our NEW hero right now. Seriously Im a nitpick myself or might say I'm a videophile but mkvonly's BR rip are just way too superb than the others. I mean the size is too small as well as the bitrate but its just awesomely great. I just downloaded the LOTR Trilogy and its just mindblowing for the size. I even compare my neighborhood's original copy and this one its just so close to notice man. Now this is my new project Im still waiting to finish thats why if you are those people who are in need a star wars BR rip copy then dont think twice to download this one because it is very recommendable. Now lets seed :) Thanks mkvonly! u are the boss
,MangyCheshire,2011-12-12T03:22Z,"Hey, uh.. Oreo. I just looked at your name and the funniest thing happened. You haven't posted any torrents on TPB. Yanno, I thought.. this guy, he must be a real expert on quality since he thought he'd trash a pink skull with 15 pages of torrents behind him but I just can't seem to find where you've contributed anywhere. I suggest going to have a good cry for the death of your social life next time you think being an obvious troll on a community that rewards contribution and damn near reveres people like this that put so much effort into making content available for lazy, punk ass leeches like you."
,TyMod,2011-12-16T00:49Z,30 Weeks to go :)  WOO HOO!!!
,CHOOKA03,2011-12-30T02:14Z,"Are there hardcoded subs for the alien speaking parts please? Nothing worse than watching a movie and not understand what's being said. 
Thx"
,TyMod,2012-01-11T22:53Z,"This downloaded super, super, SUPER fast.  I was thinking with all the leechers it would take weeks but I was able to get all six movies in one night.

I have seeded for the past 2 days streight.

V-10000
A-100000 (DTS 1510Kbps, can't beat it.)

I honestly think the remastered effects are kinda neat. I have the original set on cassette and to see Star Wars like this is amazing.

Thanks man, beats me having to spend $90 bucks on movies I have paid for many times before.

btw, burnt these to standard definition DVDs and that was easily done since the vid sizes arn't over sized anyways.

So thanks a million man."
,camus76,2012-01-22T16:33Z,"I've been downloading this for 357 hours and still have 20 or something to go... what the hell is wrong with this???? Definitely not from my client/connection, because i've downloaded simultaneously other stuff with no problems and at normal speed... "
,reebeus,2012-02-01T07:52Z,"Hi, registered just so I could ask this.

First off, HUGE thanks to FatFreddy for the upload. I'll make sure to seed. My question: Does this version have the deleted scenes? Also what is changed from the 1997 SE?

Thanks."
,xDominator09x,2012-02-12T22:38Z,Go go 2 years and 34 weeks :D
,mtc700,2012-04-12T00:38Z,Good quality......but ruined by no subs for alien speaking scenes!
