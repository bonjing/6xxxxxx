,Conker415,2011-10-17T06:40Z,Is this AVI or MKV?
,achtiv1,2011-10-17T06:44Z,"fuck yes thank you sceneline,I've been waiting for this for a long time.will seed!!!"
,Conker415,2011-10-17T06:46Z,How come I can't see my comments?
,funky89,2011-10-17T07:01Z,MKV
,SprtnJg,2011-10-17T07:10Z,"Thanks for the upload, but why are the 720p uploads always in RAR format? It doesn't make the download 'faster' like some claim...

Thanks anyway and keep up the good work."
,SocialHandBird,2011-10-17T07:36Z,"If this is anything like his latest Dexter Season 6 Episode 3 torrent then this is the wrong file, password protected, and the only way to get the password is to fill out a stupid survey.

I almost wanna download it just to see if it's the same monstrosity as the Dexter torrent."
,Mr.Pink2.0,2011-10-17T08:26Z,Ty sceneline! but guys seed please!
,Jonasx,2011-10-17T08:59Z,"It's the real thing, the uploader is legit. Sceneline's torrents are always genuine.

However, there's a chunk of the file that's not being seeded which is leading to a 99.6% stop. Sigh.
"
,Jonasx,2011-10-17T09:04Z,"I take it back, some people came back and started seeding again."
,xVespAx,2011-10-17T09:10Z,"woo hoo! finally
THANK YOU : )"
,Evilution,2011-10-17T09:19Z,"SocialHandBird: Downloaded 4 sceneline releases today, this being one of them, they all work.

As a rule of thumb; Fake uploaders just upload 1 big rar. When the upload is divided into many smaller RAR-files usually it indicates a proper release. And they all have a sample-MKV that you can download and check if in doubt.

Thanks for the upload, will seed a bit longer, at 60 ratio after only 3 hours... seeing as seed/peer ratio is still only 1/9 i´ll leave it on a while longer."
,maximoz,2011-10-17T09:48Z,Fuck you and your Rar!!!
,Evilution,2011-10-17T10:04Z,"maximoz:

1 : No one is making you download it.

2 : Fuck you."
,Psycho-Sp1DeR,2011-10-17T10:15Z,more seeds plzzzz :) wanna seeeee it!!!! 
,Digee,2011-10-17T10:36Z,"Theres NO POINT in using RAR's in torrents!! NONE!!
If you want this episode of The Walking Dead, in HD, as an .mkv file then dont go with this torrent because its a gamble and you may be wasting your time downloading, but definetly wasting your time extracting and deleting uneccessary files. Go here for a good simple clean copy:

https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6749627/The_Walking_Dead_S02E01_720p_HDTV_x264-IMMERSE_%5Beztv%5D"
,Evilution,2011-10-17T10:59Z,"Digee: The torrent is valid.
There is a sample clip that you can choose do download first, unless you are retarded.
This torrent was up 2.5 hours before EZTV; i do prefer unpacked torrents, but guess what? This one works just fine, and it was up much earlier. :) It still is much better seeded than EZTV´s one.
There´s no need to unpack it to watch it, some videoplayers can read inside rar-archives and play just fine.
Shut your piehole unless you know what you´re talking about."
,SprtnJg,2011-10-17T13:30Z,"@Evilution

Which players? Because VLC can't do that, and we know what 99% of the BT community will say when a video doesn't play: GET VLC."
,PauloFran,2011-10-17T16:02Z,"Reasonable video quality. I sincerely expected more quality given the file size. 

Anyway, thanks for sharing."
