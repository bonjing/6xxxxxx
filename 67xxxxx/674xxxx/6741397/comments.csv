,Perletand,2011-10-13T20:45Z,"Dont seem to be any crack in any of the files, so waste of time so far."
,Perletand,2011-10-13T20:49Z,crap just cant find that crack
,kefdec,2011-10-13T21:24Z,"Ait ! THANKS !!!
Can someone post crack ?
I saw a skidrow crack but is possibly fake, still gonna try it out tho."
,Perletand,2011-10-13T21:30Z,.
,kefdec,2011-10-13T21:57Z,"U guys scared me into believing there was no crack :D
Its in the mounted cd fairlight folder. noobs ! :D
BTW Fairlight U ROCK ! Seriously !
thaaank you!"
,Sciguy77,2011-10-13T23:45Z,Downloaded and mounted.  I can't find the crack either.  All that shows up in the Fairlight folder is a Fairlight.nfo and a KalypsoLauncher.dll file.  Anyone found the crack yet??
,oliverklozoff,2011-10-14T00:06Z,@ Sciguy77 copy kalypsolauncher.dll from the fairlight folder to your game installation folder than block airplanetycoon2.exe in your firewall and you can access the game at the registration screen
,Sciguy77,2011-10-14T00:51Z,Thanks Oliver.  Not really an intuitive process -- I hope many more people bother to read your post!
[T],Roobb,2011-10-14T01:08Z,Thank you! :)
,brell69,2011-10-14T02:16Z,"Thanks for the torrent, works great! "
[V],.Dude.,2011-10-14T03:03Z,"Guyz,the copy the contents from the Fairlight folder,thats the crack itself."
,Yamikun,2011-10-14T15:34Z,"First of all thanks for the upload, but i have some kind of problem.

I installed the game, copied the crack and started it up normally but i get an avi chunk viewer pop up with this error ""this avi file was not prepared for sequential reading"" the moment the kalypso logo appears.... is there anything i'm supposed to do?"
,Yamikun,2011-10-14T15:45Z,Ok i figured it out... If anyone else has the avi chunk viewer problem go to kalypso media/airline tycoon 2/introextro/800 and copy the 3 video files there to  media/airline tycoon 2/introextro. this fixed it for me :D
,liger79,2011-10-14T17:04Z,Thanks for this D/L. Unfortunatly for me after the company logo's i get a black screen with mode not supported. Anyone know how to change the Screen Res settings in the files? I tried updating the config file but it didnt work.
,Laxieboy,2011-10-14T18:18Z,"This game looks fun but it is so boring. When you want to do anything, you need to press yes four times and its annoying that you have to spend seconds just to get to a new place. It is a role playing game or wtf? I could have understand it if it was 1999, but come on, its 2011 or am I missing somethin? Thx anyway for upload but I give this game a 2 out of 10."
,Marious20,2011-10-14T21:37Z,"Works gr8, but if u could get for us or any1 from here: patch 1.02 since it's released for Kalypso Launcher only. And it fixes some things.

thx anyway"
,georgeion58,2011-10-14T22:23Z,guys when i try to copy crack it tells me i dont have space since i burned it to a cd  suggestions?
,Marious20,2011-10-14T22:26Z,"1 more thing i have to ask. I have speech issue. I can't hear any1. Music and sounds and background are working but noone is talking. Not that main issue stopping me from playing but huh, would be nice to hear their voices ;D"
,lisa81uk,2011-10-15T00:09Z,"Mount
Open disc

,meandsimandmya,2011-12-01T18:30Z,"HI all,

I managed to make this work...

All I done was copy the cracked file (KalypsoLauncher.dll) in the Fairlight folder to the main game folder on my C: Drive...blocked the program from internet access and it was all good.

My only problem now....is that the game has NO MOUSE CURSOR. So its unplayable for me. Might not happen to you so download and install the game, block it from snitching on you and play away...

If anyone has any idea how I can get my mouse to show up I'd appreciate it. Done some digging around in the files and I can see a bunch of icons which should be used for the cursor, but its like the game isnt referencing them...any help?"
,meandsimandmya,2011-12-01T18:34Z,Darkmark was absolutely correct...
,Donutsaregood28,2012-01-16T06:24Z,Hey I have blocked the game from the firewall and have installed the crack but there is no video when you are picking the characters. Can anyone help. I have reintalled the game and it still happens. I have run the program as administrator and ran it compatibly mode.
,Martin567ca,2012-04-13T18:26Z,"If eny 1 has problems with playing this game just unpack again with turned off anti-virus, then stop your internet connection and play!

Worked fine for me, so i hope it does for you!"
,RegPulp,2012-04-14T23:07Z,"patch 1.1 fixed a lot of problems with the game, unfortunately getting the patch is hard, because game can only be patched using games built in launcher....
