The film is the story of three friends - Guri,   
Deep and Sher Singh - who are studying in a      
university and are staying together in the       
hostel of the same university. They do           
everything together - bunking classes, getting   
into fights with a rival group, talking and      
laughing over numerous cups of tea - and they    
even fall in love together. However, the love    
stories of all the three friends turn out to     
be complicated. Sher Singh, who is a typical     
village boy with hardly any knowledge of English,
falls in love with a girl who was born and       
brought up in Canada and who talks in English.   
Guri, who has been failing in the same class     
for the last two years, falls in love with a     
girl who has always been a class topper and      
is the most intelligent girl in class and Deep,  
a shy Hindu boy, falls in love with a girl who   
belongs to a family of hardcore desi Jatts. So   
the three boys go through the trials and         
tribulations of love and of college life and     
in the process form an everlasting friendship.   
In fact such is their friendship that they are   
gladly willing to take a bullet for each other   
when the time comes. People are certain to find  
incidents and elements from their own student    
days in the film.
