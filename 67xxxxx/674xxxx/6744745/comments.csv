So, if JClement did update Motion through the Apple Store, he just needs to send the updated Motion 5.0.1. Thanks!!!"
,JClement,2011-10-27T20:27Z,"@aryavatra Terribly sorry, I can't update Motion. Can't edit the title either =["
,mariusr22,2011-10-31T13:44Z,"This is a great torrent! Thank you verry much JC! This is a great addition to your latest torrent with the Final Cut Pro X. I'm using it and it's wworking perfectly on a Lion 10.7.2

Could you also upload the media discs with jingles, stock effects or other interesting stuff from the Final Cut Pro X package? Thanks again for the existing uploaded packages!"
