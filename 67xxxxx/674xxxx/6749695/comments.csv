â€˜PETERâ€™ â€“ A Study for a Portrait of a Serial Killer, is a feature length drama containing genuine archive that takes the audience on a unique journey into the mind of Peter Sutcliffe â€˜The Yorkshire Ripperâ€™. The 90min film starts from his formative years in Yorkshire, the largest police manhunt in history, to his on-going psychological treatment in Broadmoor Hospital. â€˜PETERâ€™ avoids the established genre clichÃ©s, of blood and gore and instead asks us to think about issues of retribution, punishment, compassion and guilt."

,winston000smith,2011-10-23T19:29Z,"Unfortunately I have to say, even as someone who is interested in the subject matter, this film is a proper snooze fest. The Bundy movies are much better.

The a/v quality is 10/10 for a file this size, so thank you v much for uploading.

@bdcc69: I'm not even going to dignify that asinine comment with a reply."
,mickmac56,2011-10-30T23:09Z,Many thanks for the upload.Peter Sutcliffe the Yorkshire Ripper case kept the UK in morbid fascination for years.This film doesn't even get close to the terror he generated.Very poor but again thanks for the upload.
