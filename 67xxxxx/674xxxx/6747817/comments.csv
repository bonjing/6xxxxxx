@j_wet

go fuck yourself for god's sake it's just a freaking torrent! if you want to upload so bad then just do it! who gives a shit if someone else is doing it too? Grow up! Even if you're like 12 years old, you're not acting your age. don't be such a troll - you have no friends. go get a cat5/6 ethernet cable (yes, that's what they're called) and go hang yourself."
