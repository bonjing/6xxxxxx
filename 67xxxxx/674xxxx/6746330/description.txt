The Readers Digest 4CD ABBA Collection 320k (musicfromrizzo)

They were once considered Sweden's greatest export (although
I always swear by Volvo when I think in those terms).

It was a nice gesture in a bid to promote cultural understanding
of the unique perspective of this land of the great Irish spirit. 

Enjoy one and all that are their fans!
