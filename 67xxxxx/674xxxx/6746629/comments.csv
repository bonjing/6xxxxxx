,loshpop,2011-12-06T00:26Z,Stupid question but hey ill ask anyway lol the ones that say dsi enhanced does that mean they only only on dsi or can they be played in a ds lite using a dstt card. Thanks in advance x
,MonkeyManCoco,2011-12-07T19:28Z,DSI enchanced games can be played with a normal DS. You just don't get to use the DSI features (which you don't need).
