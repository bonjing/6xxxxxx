,alojzijNCYDE,2011-11-03T06:44Z,"What do I do? It asks for a serial number..
Please help."
,WTFu12,2011-11-07T03:49Z,ummm i did what all the instructions said in the torrent and when i start the game i get a black screen but i can hear the sound of it starting with cutscenes and such please help with solution
,togger,2011-11-08T23:19Z,These instructions make no sense. when you attempt to install the game Steam opens and requests a password. You can't copy the crack files into the game folder until the game has been installed and you can't install the game without a serial number.
,Okaeri,2011-11-13T18:21Z,"@Togger
This download works just fine.  If you already have steam installed it will ask for a serial but there is a way around it.  After you mount the ISO file, click run instead of opening the files to view them.  It will automatically install everything that way.  When the Steam window pops up, just close it and continue on with the rest of the steps.  My friend had this same issue and we got it to work :)

Hope that helps!"
,Banzay27,2011-11-23T01:34Z,"Torrent's good, safe - although I only installed and cracked, didn't update or use any of the other files.
Game's shit, though. You may somewhat enjoy it in co-op, with friends, the more, the merrier; singleplayer, though, enjoyment was minimal - and that was already AFTER I resorted to cheats - and had endless money and munitions. I wouldn't have stuck with this till the finale without them, the guy tries to smother you with things to do, but it's just gathering crap with respawning zombies everywhere. Hate the Infected ones... they way they made them, they sprint to you, start mauling you away and they're so close to your camera view that you can never easily tell where they are if they blindside you.
Bah. Definitely not recommended."
,Velocity_1,2011-11-25T21:52Z,"I'm not sure if i had cracked this game right can someone reply to me?

I installed the game. copied from update1 in the Rar file reloaded crack. and pasted them generally into the Dead island directory. 

Did i have to put them in a specific folder or make a specific folder? or just paste them in? thanks"
,Velocity_1,2011-11-25T22:03Z,Could i get a confirmation that i have installed the game correctly? JUST TO CRACK IT. just to copy from the Reloaded crack and paste into the Dead island general directory or into a specific folder in the dead island folder? 
,Vothar,2011-12-09T01:02Z,"guys,, i cant install the game,, it always want me serial number,, dunno what to do,, any advice ??
I tried to do what Okaeri wrote,, but i dont have option to run after runing the image. "
,Y.N.W.A.,2011-12-17T15:12Z,"lolz169asder
i have to thank you man. you gave me a great lesson, i wont download such shits done in garage any more. i tried on two different pc-s and it crushed on both."
,vedger,2011-12-29T20:21Z,"ok so i mounted the .img and the installer started, picked my path Program files X86 but the file don't appear in the folder through windows explore but if i run the installer again it there. any ideas?"
,vedger,2011-12-29T20:39Z,"SO a small note, i can't seem to find the file when i install it to C:/program files(x86). it simply isn't visible, i showed all hidden files but nothing. only in the installer can i see it. any one have a thought on this? i just downloaded it to my desktop. also i was wondering can i install all the updates without the steam and the fake profile? "
,ViolentC,2011-12-31T15:45Z,"@Vedger Enable Hidden Files Visable and look here : ""C:\Users\(Your user name)\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files (x86)\Dead Island""
I don't know why it installs there and not into program files... Kinda annoying I agree"
,b2dluck,2012-01-02T04:16Z,"Anyone know how to fix EXIT: Cannot find script dll
x86_rwdi.exe? Before i delete its content "
,Thomas117,2012-01-04T09:07Z,"Spelet funkar inte det är samma spel som finns på suprbits samma problem spelet kommer in i steam och där frågar det om password.

,Notaplayer,2012-01-14T19:46Z,okeeej skiiit! var ska man fuckin lägga de från crackfoldern? hittade till rätt plats men spelet e nuked fan
,Notaplayer,2012-01-15T10:26Z,"hey guys! any1 with problems just run i compability mode for lets say win vista serv pack 2 should work, only by default it runs in 1024 display mode it works for me perfekt now so just ignore my first comment if u understood it. pz"
,Suomisisu,2012-01-30T19:22Z,So many retards in the comments... just go buy the game you idiots.
,BlazingFro,2012-02-04T21:29Z,I installed this and it runs perfectly. I only have one problem. The sound does not work. Everything else is fine though.
,andybyskov,2012-03-13T21:54Z,"Singleplayer is working perfectly, but I can't seem to get multiplayer to work. When me and my friends get to chapter 1 in the house we can not find each other under ""Game Lobby"". We are on SmartSteam and Tunngle."
,dreykon,2012-03-25T04:23Z,"For the people that doesn´t know how to install the game.
This is how to make it work:

Make a folder in your pc where you want the game to be installed, I used:

C:program filesDEAD ISLAND

After downloading the torrent, mount the iso and run the file: 
steambackup2.EXE

The installer will ask for a folder to install the game, look for the folder you have already created and select it:

C:program filesDEAD ISLAND

The game will be installed there, follow the instructions to crack it."
,dreykon,2012-03-25T04:24Z,"For the people that doesn´t know how to install the game.
This is how to make it work:"
,davimacht24,2012-04-14T08:51Z,"It works perfectly including co-op mode. 
This game is so much better in multiplayer!
Note that in coop mode players can only enter on the same or lower chapters.
You need to do the prolog first to enable multiplayer. Then just start the first quest and you are able to be found on co-op. 
Great job uploader!"
,NoCaRe,2012-05-14T20:29Z,"This torrent is the same useless crap as every other.

steambackup2 doesn't work, i can't find any iso file ... great. "
,Mauksta,2012-05-31T17:52Z,"Installed the game using the Steambackup.exe then applied the contents of the crack folder (including the out folder) but when I run the game, desktop just freezes and nothing happens. 

What have I done wrong?"
,hobo489,2012-06-01T18:46Z,Thanks so much dreykon you made my life so much easier!!
