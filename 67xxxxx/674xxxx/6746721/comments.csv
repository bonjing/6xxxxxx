,tomahawk_dts,2011-10-22T12:25Z,NOD32 (about KEYGEN.EXE in crack directory): Win32/Packed.VMProtect.AAD Trojan. What about it .dude. ?
[V],cristo,2011-10-29T09:56Z,re: tomahawk  That is a typical false positive for keygens.
,ralunger,2011-11-02T11:46Z,"please help. cannot activate. when I run the keygen.exe by following the instructions in install.txt, it says ""The parameters are incorrect.""

What am I doing wrong?"
,tomahawk_dts,2011-11-02T20:40Z,"@ cristo:  sorry pal but what idiot makes keygens that looks like trojans, heh ?"
,Konobarcek,2011-12-13T15:41Z,"@forsser and the rest of you morons: If you want the english speech, find yourself a TALK.cht from previous version ex. fritz 12 and load it in multimedia options.
@ tomahawk_dts: i don't know why the fuck are you whining about keygen if it's obvious that it isn't trojan. Disable your antivirus program during activation proces, turn it back on after and that's it.. The game and crack are great so stop criticizeing it assholes.."
,jshnaidz,2011-12-24T18:13Z,"What the fuck there isn't any install.txt like it says there is in the description, there is like 2000 files and I have no idea which to mount, they're all named the same thing. apparently, it's also in german. Fuck this torrent. "
,WolfPunk,2011-12-29T06:32Z,"Love the game-play and the amazing features, but cannot officially activate.  Error message: ""Keygen.exe is not a valid Win32 application.  Any suggestions?   @BigUglyMotha - chess isn't spoken in German or any other language. The Kibitzer is in German.  But in any lingo it would still say ""You're a dumb fuck."""
,Aizen187,2012-01-30T13:43Z,"If you play chess seriously then 4 gig for a chess playing software is pretty good. you can play only even if you can't ""officially"" activate.

great torrent. "
,a31632,2012-02-11T19:54Z,"Install goes well, but when I use the Keygen to activate my Hardware ID only shows ""XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX"" so can't enter that to get activation code. Anyone....how to resolve this?"
,MasterST,2012-02-27T22:27Z,Please upload the English variant. I know just a few words in German so ... I need English please. No one has that variant?
,biurful,2012-03-21T14:09Z,"This is how to get the keygen to open:

Right click Microsoft Security Essentials in your tray.
Go to Settings.
Go to Real-time protection.
Uncheck Turn on real-time protection.
Save changes.

Run the keygen.

When you're done turn on real-time protection again."
,PirateerG,2012-04-06T18:53Z,"You can make Fritz 13 use English texts (voice I dunno). Assuming it's in German, do the following:

- After installing, open the application
- Click on the main menu item named ""Datei"" (File)
- Right at the bottom of the sub menu there is a field labeled ""Optionen"" (Options)
- If you click on it, a dialog opens
- There is a tab called ""Sprache"" (Language)
- Use the combo box labeled ""Erste Sprache"" (First language)
- Select ""Englisch""
- Apply changes"
