Real Estate crystallize their entire attitude and approach in a single phrase off of Days: Im not OK, but I guess Iâ€™m doin fine. This feeling of pleasant entrapment permeates the bands second album from its sound down to its lyrical subjects. Working with producer Kevin McMahon, Real Estate give their music a coat of polish that makes their jangly guitars, sighing melodies, and complex harmonies glisten. Similarly, the playing here is much tighter than on Real Estate, making for a more cohesive sound that leaves less opportunity for accidental magic, such as the way Suburban Beverage sped up ever so slightly as it faded. Days manicured ennui presents one partly cloudy song after another, all with the nagging feeling that things arent quite right lingering in the background.
