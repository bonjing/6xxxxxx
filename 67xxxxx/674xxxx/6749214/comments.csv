,binged69,2011-10-17T04:25Z,"FAKE!!!!

I hope the one that posted this dies and goes to hell. "
,Ninjazz,2011-10-17T04:30Z,"How do you know its a fake???

I;ve been downloading trusted and reliable torrents from sceneline for awhile now and have never had a problem..."
,rjorekit,2011-10-17T04:33Z,"it's from sceneline, you fool... it aint fake."
,MorteEterno,2011-10-17T04:39Z,Fake? But he has a skull... :/
,stimpj,2011-10-17T05:01Z,"It's not fake, bing is just a tool who's afraid of rars the same way he's afraid of girls."

,azzyork,2011-10-17T06:09Z,"THIS TORRENT IS 100% REAL...NOT A FAKE...THX SCENELINE!!!

V:10
A:10

MUST BE PPL FROM SHOWTIME SAYING ITS A FAKE?"
,wck,2011-10-17T06:29Z,"it is real but video is hardly a 10 azzyork

This release is going to need a repack or proper. It's going to get nuked cause some scenes get really messed up."
,yavin4jc,2011-10-17T07:00Z,"Thanks for archiving this like a stupid bitch. You fucking idiot!!!!!!! THERE IS NO POINT IN ARCHIVING IT! All it does decrease seeders and add the extra and pointless step of having to extract it to watch it. Don't archive it, you cunt."
,SocialHandBird,2011-10-17T07:32Z,"This is completely bogus, it's an episode from season 5 and I had to fill out a stupid pizza survey to get the password for it.  

Here is the password so you can see for yourself it's not the right episode:  dexterr3561345134134zxcvasd

I was going to download the new Walking Dead episode but I think I'll pass.  

As they say in Workaholics: this torrent is loose butthole."
,sharkdick,2011-10-17T08:12Z,No clue what Social is talking about. RAR extracted fine without password and contained the correct episode.
,drjones75,2011-10-17T08:19Z,"Fake. SocialHandBird is 100% right, this is not S06E03... don't download, stop seeding and delete."
,stimpj,2011-10-17T08:55Z,The only thing that's fake is the bulge in your pants.
,Nior86,2011-10-17T11:15Z,"It's NOT password protected,real deal.10/10"
,pjsat,2011-10-17T12:18Z,Please ignore the negative  comments. Some do appreciate the torrents.
,balanced,2011-10-17T13:34Z,It's faker than fake.  This is the problem with RAR's you can't tell anything until the WHOLE thing is downloaded!!
,stimpj,2011-10-17T18:50Z,"^ A video file could be fake as well, dipshit. Rars don't change anything. That's why you only d/l from trusted people. Good lord, these imbeciles and their fussin over nuthin. No wonder this planet's such a pathetic mess these days...."
,balanced,2011-10-18T01:08Z,"you're lying stimj;  I can view the content of an unRARed .MKV long before it's finished.  I don't know shit about a RAR until the whole bloody thing finishes downloading.  Once again - RAR's are for usenet NOT torrents.  The appropriate method for the appropriate channel, k?  It's really not too hard to understand."
,stimpj,2011-10-18T02:14Z,"Would you like some cheese with that whine? The un-rar'd files are posted shortly after, so you can either wait or get the rar's. There is no other option you incontinent twit."
,sparkybot,2011-10-18T04:57Z,"This torrent is not a fake, but it is password protected. 
The password is: dexterr3561345134134zxcvasd

sceneline still needs to lose the skull because it signifies a reputed uploader, not some douchebag who makes you fill out a survey and jump through hoops to view the file.

So fsck you, sceneline and I hope you lose your rep. "
,sparkybot,2011-10-18T05:01Z,"NOT a fake but I still urge everyone to VOTE THE QUALITY DOWN because it is in a password protected file and that's not the way things are done here. We do not want this becoming a habit.

VOTE THIS TORRENT DOWN!
"
,chasgood,2011-10-18T07:53Z,this is season 5 and password protected. Children wasting our time and bandwidth.
,balanced,2011-10-18T12:53Z,"you're still a fsking liar, stimpdork and nice try avoiding the accusation with your incontinent wine & cheese comment."
,balanced,2011-10-18T12:56Z,"And I would also like to add that the purpose of bringing this up is to train people to NOT download RAR's so that morons who up them will get the fsking point and stop doing that.  Like I said and which you repeatedly (because you're a moron, I suppose) fail to address: just because  RARs are an appropriate medium of exchange in USENET does NOT make them the right tool for the job with torrents. "
,stimpj,2011-10-18T19:56Z,"Accusation!? lmao,you're such a fuckin moron. Rars aren't going anywhere, so get used to it girly."
,john8611,2011-10-28T18:13Z,"To the dipshit who negatived the  rar and sceneline, firstly scenline is trusted unlike you secondly you dont need all the rars to test its real ya morons, because a-theres a sample doh, and b- you can preview rared movies  bfeore there complete. google it nobs"
