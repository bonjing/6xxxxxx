,AGiX-HD,2011-10-17T10:13Z,"@jaoboifurroi132: No, the game itself is already cracked. You just need to install the latest update (v. 1.7.0.3) and the 5 DLCs."

(""im running into the xlive.dll error while installing the patch too. i tried the guy above's link and it says i need to run it first and i cant without it"".)

So the problem is:
when you run ""Games for Windows LIVE Disabler.exe"" from the link above, it looks for 
Fallout.ini
&
FalloutPrefs.ini
in the folder
...My Documents\My Games\Fallout3

So take the ""Fallout_default.ini"" file from your installed game folder and copy it to that folder above.
Rename this file to ""Fallout.ini"".

Run ""FalloutLauncher.exe""
(not the ""Fallout3.exe""!)
It should allow you to choose options, then it creates ""FalloutPrefs.ini"" file in that folder.

Then ""Games for Windows LIVE Disabler.exe"" should work. Press ""Disable"".

Check your processes that there's no patch or Fallout leftovers running in the background (or kill them).

Then the patch should work, and Fallout will start.
Hope it'll work. Happy new year! :)"

,orange7,2012-01-05T06:21Z,"Great torrent! Thank you very much! There is no virus, its just the crack.

After a bit I figured out that you have to drag the files out of the folders in the DLC location and put them into data, not the folders themselves but the data inside them.

4. Copy contents of the folders located in 'Fallout 3 DLC' to 'C:Program FilesBethesda SoftworksFallout 3Data' (or wherever you installed it)

,jesusnightly,2012-03-27T10:28Z,"What files are you looking for 'wolverine-taicho', the DLC's  or the C:/Program files...
If the files aren't in the C:/Program files, try going to the start menu or the link on your desktop and right click>open file location. This should take you straight there, depending on your settings. If it takes you to a bunch of links, then Fallout should be there, so just repeat. If your looking for the DLC's, they may be hidden, if your on windows 7, or they didn't download properly. If they're hidden, you can check by clicking on the 'Organise' tab in the top left hand corner, just below the arrows. Then go to Folder and Search options, click on the 'View' tab up the top, and then go down to the 'Advanced settings:' to find a chech box with 'show hidden files, folders, and drives'. If they don't appear after that, then they may not have downloaded, and the only thing you can do is try to re-download the torrent. If there still not there, then try a differant torrent.

As for the 5360 error, the solution may seem odd, but it works. Download this link: http://www.xbox.com/en-AU/LIVE/PC/DownloadClient

,jesusnightly,2012-04-01T00:11Z,"I have my Fallout 3 working. Here is everything I did. I'm not sure wich one solved it.

Updated my Direct X to the latest version. Easy enough here: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=35

Downloaded a codec pack for video support. This should also help if your game crashes before it evan starts. Click the big download button on the left: 
http://cccp-project.net/

I also put the program in compatability mode for Windows XP (Service Pack 3)

Finaly, I did this:
Go to My Documents (or Documents for Windows Vista and 7)>My Games>Fallout 3.
There should be a file named Fallout. It's a .ini file. This comes up as Configuration settings for Windows 7. Open this with notepad. 

The very first line should be [General], If you can't see this, Push Ctrl F, wich will bring up a search window, and type [General]
Directly under this ( [General] ), copy and paste this: iNumHWThreads=2

Then, in the same file, search for, or find: bUseThreadedAI=0
Simply replace the 0 with a 1, or paste this in it's place: bUseThreadedAI=1

I don't know if it was all these things combined or just one of them, but I haven't had a crash since, exept on Mothership Zeta, where I try to listen to the Captive Recordings and it Craches. Other than that I was able to play through the entire DLC without a crash. Hope this helps some of you."
,Boxedhead,2012-04-02T22:33Z,"FOR PEOPLE WHO CANT LAUNCH DLC!
All you need to do to get the DLC working is,
Take one of the DLC's from the Fallout DLC folder, copy the files inside that folder, and put it into: Programs Files Bethesda Softwork Fallout 3 Data
Launch the Fallout3launcher, Select Data files, and the DLC file. DONE!"

,norchron,2012-04-10T18:51Z,"You guys aren't going to fucking believe this. 
But I just tried switching my windows theme from 'Aero' to 'Basic'.

And it WORKED!

I don't know how that works.
But to do it, 
Right click on the desktop.
Goto Personalize
Scroll all the way down through the available themes
Choose 'Basic'.

Done"

,Valklek,2012-04-23T02:51Z,"@mrpetursv Hey mate.
1. Open your Fallout 3 launcher.
2. Click Data Files.
3. Make sure that all DLC included in the game have their boxes checked.
4. Start the game.
5. Enjoy!
Hope this helped!"

,skulldragon,2012-05-04T06:20Z,"Works great (on XP and on a machine which has 4 cored CPU), no viruses.

I just don't get it, why do you need to mess around with some GFLW? I sure didn't.
The patcher requires xlive.dll to be present inside the game's folder, but luckily that can be found anywhere via Googleing."

Thanks to the uploader for sharing this awesome game."
,Xandror,2012-05-10T13:51Z,"""The ordinal 5360 could not be located in the dynamic link library xlive.dll"". So doesn't work with the directions (as usual).

So par for the course for a Reloaded release in other words, recommend getting this from... anywhere else. Might actually work."

,samljer,2012-05-11T23:01Z,"Unique problem here nobody else seems to be having.

game runs ""or launcher, i have to do it manually""
but then it just sits there, nothing happens anywhere.

in task manager ill see it running

fallout3.exe *32
falloutlauncher.exe *32

if i try again, more and more appear in the list
i have to END TASK to close them, but
nothing even shows up; i cant even get it to show the launcher screen, nothing at all.


Windows7 x64
16GB DDR 1866
i7 - 3770k @ 3.5 (stock) with HT on
GeForce GTX 680 MSi (stock)
2TB SATA3

i dont think anything else would affect the game;
ive tried about every fix for every other issue.
nothing works.

id say avoid this if your on the new Z77 platform."

,Pinophyta,2012-05-17T07:50Z,"Good torrent. Make sure you play with the image mounted or get a crack. Make sure you copy the .esm and .bsa files to the Data folder so you can activate the DLCs. Copying the entire folders there wont do anything, copy the files inside them like I said. Cheers! "
,Pinophyta,2012-05-17T08:41Z,"For people who get the xlive.dll bullshit thingy:
1 Install the game as instructed in the read me file of this torrent.
2 Download this: http://fallout3.nexusmods.com/mods/1086
It disables Games for Widows live.
3 Try and use it. If you get the error fallout ini not found:
Go to your Fallout folder, where you installed it and copy one of the configuration files(medium,high or low either will do) to the folder where your save games will be(for me it was in My Documents/My Games;) 
4 Rename the file you just copied to ""FALLOUT""
5 Run the thing you downloaded at step 2. It should work now. Disable G4WL with it. And close it.
6 Delete the fake FALLOUT.ini file you made. (if you don't your game will crash)
7 Play the game!
I hope this helps guys. "

One more thing! The program will also say FalloutPref.ini not found. Right click and make a text document in the same save folder. Rename the text document to FalloutPref.ini. The program should run fine."
