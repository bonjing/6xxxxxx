Solid Base
Greatest Hits (2003)




Producers Jonas Eriksson and Mattias Eliasson teamed up with singer Isabelle Heitman (born in Oslo, Norway) with a backround in ethnic and classical music after attending classes in Gottenburg and Stockholm and DJ/rapper Thomas Nordin to assemble an Euro-pop duo. Solid Base debuted in 1994 with the release of "Together,". Their debut album called Finally followed in 1996. However, their first smash "Come'N'Get Me," was featured two years later on their second full-lenght record entitled The Take Off. Originally released in 1999 Express became Solid Base's first international success, including the Japanese chart-topping single "Once You Pop (You Can't Stop),".
