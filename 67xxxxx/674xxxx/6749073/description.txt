Hello everyone!

This was my personal notepad of this thread while reading threw the entire thing,Twice. All the writing in RED is my personal comments,descriptions and questions for posters.

I copied every post I thought was beneficial to my own personal knowledge of this technique and I also copied some posts specifically for the side by siders. This started off as a reference for me personally but as I went along, I decided to post it.

Dont want to read the whole thread? Have alot of questions? Download this PDF and read it BEFORE posting

Thanks to everyone involved!
