,ahsankamal,2012-02-05T17:49Z,"what does mean quality +0 / -0 (0), what is the aspect ration for this torrent"
,Bernd93,2012-05-01T20:05Z,Am I doing something wrong or are there no subtitles?
,Bernd93,2012-05-03T00:05Z,"^never mind that. 
Turns out only key parts of the dothriaki tongue are subtitled. "
,aleneen,2012-05-06T21:58Z,@ahsankamal the quality header is based on user votes. It's not really meaningful unless it's really in extremes.
