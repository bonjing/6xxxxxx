On a lighter note, it's interesting to watch trickdaddy comment and TRY to think like a lunatic does by following him. If you try to argue with him, you're just going to damage your brain. His brand of liberalism truly is a mental disorder; don't fight it... just admire it... from a distance!

And as for the ""no torrents"" list, TD is right about one thing... I DO like those people better. Nothing wrong with that! :-)

The louder the liberals scream, the bigger the landslide is gonna be... I'm looking forward to it."
