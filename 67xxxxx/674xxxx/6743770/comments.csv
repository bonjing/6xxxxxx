17 out of 43 scanners say it is infected with a trojan. But most scanners see trainers as trojans. If you want to be absolutely sure, then disable internet before using this trainer. I tested this trainer yesterday myself and it works flawlessly..."

This one IS from GameCopyWorld.com"
,Cman333,2011-10-20T07:52Z,"Thanks for sharing this.... I'm downloading now. But yeah I agree, most anti virus software say these trainers and cracks are viruses. I've used plenty with no issues yet. *knock on wood* Thanks again"
