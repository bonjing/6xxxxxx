,bird098,2012-04-03T05:15Z,"Just wondering, but if this a Staind Discography then why is Aaron Lewis' solo EP included? I mean, if it's supposed to be an Aaron Lewis discography then it makes sense but then you should include his other appearances featured by bands like Cold, Sevendust, etc.

And there is a track missing from Staind (2011). The Wannabe (Remix) featuring Snoop Dogg is a bonus track on the Japanese version whereas track 04 is the Staind-only version of Wannabe. So besides mislabeling and omitting track 04, it's a decent torrent. "
,BossBadger,2012-04-16T10:28Z,^ wtf? lol the torrent is perfect
,BossBadger,2012-04-16T10:30Z,I don't know what that dude means about that track but the album is fine and it's the way it's supposed to be... and the aaron lewis ep was probably just a bonus.. why not add it
