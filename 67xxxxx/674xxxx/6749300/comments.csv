,Osanda91,2011-10-17T06:47Z,Plz seed all u guys..the speed is really slow.
,BalisongBrad,2011-10-17T07:08Z,"Thanks EZ for yet another great torrent!

I've got a question. Probably a really stupid question. I'm sure that this is normally common knowledge but I was wondering if eztv stood for Extreme Zone TV? Cause Extreme Zone is always the leader of movie uploads, and EZTV is easily the leader of Television uploads. Plus the obvious, EZ = (E)xtreme (Z)one ?
Sorry if I'm wrong. Both of you are great! Hard to pick a favorite! Could someone educated please fill me in?"
,outpatient730,2011-10-17T07:25Z,"People aren't seeding cause piratebay is and has been heavily tracked for a while now..you stream and seed, your ISP is traceable and causes you to receive warnings and fines. If you don't know this, now you know! N#@$@"
,Kstolen23,2011-10-17T09:27Z,"@PrincePwn: 

You clicked the link, didn't you?"
,davidvb,2011-10-17T10:08Z,"@outpatient730

Spread your propaganda/scare tactic bullshit elsewhere. The worst that will happen is you'll get a letter. I have been downloading for years and have yet to receive 1 warning and no ISP's do not ""fine"" you, jackass lol...

,Allinuse,2011-10-17T18:44Z,"@ outpatient730

If this is true, it obviously only applies for people in the land of the fat, the home of oppression. I don't think the rest of the world needs to worry."

,soregrin,2011-10-19T02:38Z,Video stream is corrupt at running time 20m58s.. I downloaded the episode more than once so I'm pretty sure it's not an issue on my download...
,illsleepwhenimdead,2011-10-19T09:10Z,you people can't start bitching about seeding oner hour after the file has been uploaded. for fuck sakes. maybe after 24-48 hours you can start bitching but 1-10 hours after is comedy.
,Riclmnopp,2011-10-22T03:01Z,"They mention my home town, Grants Pass Oregon, in this episode. It's a small town so we get excited over small things like that. Also the Video and audio are perfect. Thank you eztv. "
