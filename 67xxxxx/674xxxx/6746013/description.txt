Ms. Sandi Patty - Best of Gospel - selected songs (musicfromrizzo)

This gal was a great inspiration to me many years ago now, when I often took
long walks listening to her sing "It is well with my soul" as I thought
of a most dear friend named Janet I left behind at the Church in Edmonton
I had only just learned that her husband had died in a traffic mishap

Sandi patty is the best in Gospel for the songs selected here in my own
view, while she does showtunes as well, she is sometimes a bit shy with
her spirit in letting it soar. No evidence of that in these songs here though,
which are the opposite and as I say, altogether an inspiration from the best
gals in what is Christian ministry persuasion o the planet thus far! I 
have great personal hopes that a secular Europe will do even better in teaching
spirituality for a humanistic movement that will represent all that we are in
the near future. Amen
