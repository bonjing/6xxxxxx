After a successful heart transplant saves her life, Caroline (Kirsten Price) is reluctant to date, fearing her former health problems will scare away potential suitors. Her sister is determined to get her back into social circles and while on a weekend camping trip, Caroline has a chance encounter with John (Rocco Reed). Although the two share an instant connection, initially neither one is ready to be more than friends. Eventually, just as they're ready to move to the next level, a devastating secret from John's past comes to light and threatens the budding romance. Will these two lovers find a way to overcome all they have endured and find a new beginning together, or can a painful past truly tempt the fate of love?
