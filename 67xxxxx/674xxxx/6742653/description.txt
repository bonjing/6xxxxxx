Beyonce
Greatest Hits (2009)









One of the most recognizable characters in modern-day R&B;, BeyoncÃ© first rose to fame as the siren-voiced centerpiece of Destiny's Child before embarking on a multi-platinum solo career in 2001. Booming record sales, Grammy awards, movie roles, and a romance with rapper/CEO Jay-Z combined to heighten her profile in the 2000s, making the singer a virtual mainstay in the entertainment world. While some media outlets derisively championed Paris Hilton as "the next Marilyn Monroe," BeyoncÃ© was a much better contender for the role, her glittering pop culture persona only matched by her success onscreen and on record.
