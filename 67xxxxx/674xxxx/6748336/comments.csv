Unless I'm doing something wrong.. point it out."
,eZanto,2011-11-04T00:56Z,"You could have told us you first needed to install the base game and after that apply the expansion.. I was really clueless about this.. thanks for the game though, and I apologize for misunderstanding."

I noticed I forgot to put that point in, But gamers should know what expansion means. But am amazed that you do not even know what expansion means. An expansion in game terms means you need the original game installed as well. Now there is stand alone expansions meaning you do not need the main game. But not in this game.

Since it says Expansion. The first point comes into play. Now if you say I did not know. Then you are clueless buffoon at computer games and it totally amazes me that you even had the mental capacity to get on here."

This is an expansion to the original game. You have to install the original game first which you can find here:

Expansions of games can be of two types. This is the type of expansion that requires the original to be installed on your PC. Another type of expansion is called ""Stand-Alone expansion"" which doesn't require the original game to be installed. Did u get it?
