And now, thanks to EZTV, I'm able to continue my 720p collection of the TWD series.

Keep it up!"

,Itsumishi,2011-10-19T13:21Z,"A:10 V:10 95% of the time. 

Unfortunately the 5% that the video fucked up was enough to make my TV stop playing the file. Had to revert to the laptop which played it ok even with the crazy digital artifacts streaking across the screen."
,Thor-csf,2011-10-21T08:45Z,"As Itsumishi said, this release is buggy at some parts. I also had problems playing it on my LG LED TV; the video freezed and restarted from the beginning when it reached these buggy parts. On the first two freezes I could just skip it and continue watching, but the end was impossible, kept freezing at many scenes; had to stop watching on the TV and watch the rest on the PC. :/

I had already experienced this problem before, though, with the first episode of Falling Skies. Was impossible to watch on the TV.

Hope it doens't happen again on the next episodes."
,Dope.,2011-10-21T13:50Z,I muxed this into an MP4 container so it would play on my Samsung TV and it played fine. If it is buggy it must be a problem with the container (MKV) because the video and audio streams worked fine for me.
,NeVeN213,2011-10-22T14:21Z,fiiiiiiiinaaaaaaalyyyyyyy!
,chernye,2011-10-24T04:29Z,when is the ep.2 coming? ty
,tofushoyu,2011-11-03T20:12Z,"Thanks again, EZTV!"
,craddle,2011-12-21T12:36Z,"The reason why the audio blows is because everyone keeps compressing the audio down too much while converting.

""384 Kbps""

That is way too low.
