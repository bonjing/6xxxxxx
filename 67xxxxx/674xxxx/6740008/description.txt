CHINATOWN

A landmark movie in the film noir tradition, Roman Polanski's Chinatown
stands as a true screen classic.

Jack Nicholson is private eye Jake Gittes, living off the murky moral climate
of sunbaked, pre-war Southern California. Hired by a beautiful socialite
(Faye Dunaway) to investigate her husband's extra-marital affair, Gittes is
swept into a maelstrom of double dealing and deadly deceits, uncovering a web
of personal and political scandals that come crashing together for one,
unforgettable night in... Chinatown.

Co-starring film legend John Huston and featuring an Academy Award-winning
script by Robert Towne, Chinatown captures a lost era in a masterfully
woven movie that remains a timeless gem.

THE TWO JAKES

Jack Nicholson returns as private eye Jake Gittes in this atmospheric
Chinatown follow-up that's hit upon "the elusive sequel formula
for somehow enhancing a great original" (Mike Clark, USA Today).

Much has changed since we last saw Jake. The war has come and gone;
1948 Los Angeles teems with optimism and fast bucks. But there's one thing
Jake knows hasn't changed: "Nine times out of ten, if you follow the money
you will get to the truth." And that's the trail he follows when a routine
case of marital hanky panky explodes into a murder that's tied to a grab
for oil -- and to Jake's own past.
