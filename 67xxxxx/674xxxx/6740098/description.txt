Here is the lovely Ms. Faith Hill, Queen of Country equally along
Ms. Leann Rimes in my books - with her 2007 CD - "The Hits"

Ive replaced the "Breathe" track with a remastered version (they've only
published two such tracks for her where we get them). Also our "There
you'll be" may sound just a bit nicer as we got one of those elsewhere too.

There's a lovely bonus in her singing of "Somewhere over the rainbow"
(she should do much more in showtunes equally I would think! wow!)

Also a duet with Reba is in as an xtra for you.

Enjoy this sweetheart of country music
