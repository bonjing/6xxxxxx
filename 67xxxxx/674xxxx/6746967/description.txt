                HEAVY METAL MAGAZINE COVER COLLECTION 1977-2011


This is the complete Heavy Metal Magazine Cover Collection starting from the first 1977â€™s first issue to the latest, November 2011 and last yearâ€™s issue as well. The collection will include the special issues too. The files are organized by volume and issue number, month and year. Included is a cbr file so the gallery can be viewed in eComic format. Also I added CD Display, an essential tool to view cbr files. This collection is a must have to any avid Heavy Metal Magazine collector. Enjoy!
