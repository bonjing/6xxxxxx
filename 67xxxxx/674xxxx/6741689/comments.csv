,Rayor,2011-11-17T07:19Z,"Video is upside down for me, and I came to the same page as Sicrea after doing some Googling. It looks like they're on to whatever keygen method is being used here."
,CCRLH85,2011-11-23T20:21Z,"I used this keygen and for the time being, I'm not having any issues."

,Rayor,2012-01-08T14:57Z,"@314r
I've tried that and I still can't get it to function properly."
,julietta2,2012-01-11T17:08Z,Wrong serial number or USER ID.What to write as e mail?I wrote anything like u adviced and used your serial number from key file.It can not be installed.
,Krepo,2012-01-15T23:23Z,"Works like a charm!
The instructions might be a bit simplified for some.
The first line in the keygen (Heritage by default) is the user ID you have to use WITH that specific code. If you change it, the code will change accordingly. You can replace ""Heritage"" with anything you want in the keygen, then copy the user ID you entered AND code to the setup. :)
Also you can just put Heritage as the user ID and copy the code."
,CCRLH85,2012-02-04T04:52Z,I just wanted to come back and update you all on my situation.  I've been using this key for over two months now and I'm not having any trouble at all.  It's all good here ^_^
,tangoseal,2012-02-08T23:07Z,Many thanks Scene4all!!!
,r0ssxx,2012-03-16T03:14Z,Here is a simple solution for the upside down problem. Reinstall coreavc but this time when you run the keygen be sure to add an email address not just a name. It can be a fake email for instance if you used John as you username use John@john.org ect...
,dannejessi,2012-03-28T10:11Z,I cant get the sound to work... anyone knows whats wrong?

,MTSPL,2012-04-14T18:10Z,It's sad. I tried everything and it still doesn't work. Not working torrents should be removed.
