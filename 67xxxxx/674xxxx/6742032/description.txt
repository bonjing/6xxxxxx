Note: Recommend you to use VLC player. Default audio is Japanese, Choose audio track-2 to change to english(i.e. VLC Player), English audio is really bad, as the source I had used had a really bad english audio. I will suggest using Japanese audio with subtitles. Subtitles can be enabled or disabled. Check sample to be sure. Enjoy!
