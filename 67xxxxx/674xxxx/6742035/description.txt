The recorded legacy of Elvis Presley continues to be discovered by new generations that never saw him or heard him perform live. It's hard to appreciate that he started so much of what we take for granted now in popular music. Until 1956, the teenagers of suburban America, and the rest of the world, had to endure ditties by Rosemary Clooney and Perry Como but everything was about to be tossed upside down. On January 28 on a cold night in New York, Elvis took America by storm as he appeared on CBS-TV's Stage Show hosted by Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey. On February 4 for his second appearance he sang a song that literally changed the world of popular music "Heartbreak Hotel". Its unique sound and style literally blew everything before it away while at the same time inducing the blueprint for everything that was to come; by April, it would be #1 on Billboard. This incredible step-change in musical history resonated around the world and while liberating millions of young adolescent teenagers it also inspired many successful artists of today to pick a guitar or sing - everyone wanted to be like Elvis. The pure spontaneity of these seminal recordings shows through even today; "Heartbreak Hotel", Don't Be Cruel", "Hound Dog", "Blue Suede Shoes" and "My Baby Left Me" are some of the greatest rock 'n' roll records ever made. Elvis' unprecedented level of achievement is still the benchmark by which artistic success is measured today and YOUNG MAN WITH THE BIG BEAT is testament to the phenomenon and cultural icon that is Elvis Presley.
