Information
------------------------------

The team travel to Florida to dissect the ocean's largest reptile: the leatherback turtle. They uncover the evolutionary mystery of how turtles developed shells to protect themselves from some of the sharpest-toothed predators on the planet. The leatherback carcass is a two-metre long male, which died after its flipper was sliced off by a motorboat propeller. Veterinary scientist Mark Evans and comparative anatomist Joy Reidenberg join the post-mortem to explore the inner workings of this ancient mariner. As the shell is opened up, the team discovers a bizarre digestive system that processes deadly jellyfish, a double-barrelled organ sitting where the brain should be, and a remarkable organ that enables the male to mate with the female underwater.
