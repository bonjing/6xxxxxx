The Digital Photography Book, Volume 3

Product Description:

Scott Kelby, author of The Digital Photography Book, volume 1 (the worldâ€™s best-selling digital photography book of all time), is back with a follow-up to his volume 2 smash best seller, with an entirely new book that picks up right where he left off. Itâ€™s even more of that â€œAh haâ€”so thatâ€™s how they do it,â€ straight-to-the-point, skip-the-techno-jargon stuff you can really use today to make your shots even better.

This book truly has a brilliant premise, and hereâ€™s how Scott describes it: â€œIf you and I were out on a shoot and you asked me, â€˜Hey Scott, I want the light for this portrait to look really soft and flattering. How far back should I put this softbox?â€™ I wouldnâ€™t give you a lecture about lighting ratios, or flash modifiers. In real life, Iâ€™d just turn to you and say, â€˜Move it in as close to your subject as you possibly can, without it actually showing up in the shot.â€™ Well, thatâ€™s what this book is all about: you and I out shooting where I answer questions, give you advice, and share the secrets Iâ€™ve learned, just like I would with a friendâ€”without all the technical explanations and techie photo speak.â€

Each page covers a single concept on how to make your photography better. Every time you turn the page, youâ€™ll learn another pro setting, tool, or trick to transform your work from snapshots into gallery prints. If youâ€™re tired of taking shots that look â€œokay,â€ and if youâ€™re tired of looking in photography magazines and thinking, â€œWhy donâ€™t my shots look like that?â€ then this is the book for you.

This isnâ€™t a book of theoryâ€”full of confusing jargon and detailed concepts. This is a book on which button to push, which setting to use, and when to use it. With nearly 200 more of the most closely guarded photographic â€œtricks of the trade,â€ this book gets you shooting dramatically better-looking, sharper, more colorful, more professional-looking photos every time.
