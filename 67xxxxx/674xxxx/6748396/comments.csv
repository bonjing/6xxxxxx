,dumas1000,2011-10-16T22:56Z,"Just put the 'atiogllxx.dll' in your Rage folder and I can confirm that this fix works without having to update the driver if you have a ATI Radeon graphics chip. It solves that immidiate ""rage stopped working"" back to desktop crash at least.  I couldn't update my driver, possibly because I have a mobility chip and the official hotfix might not be compatable with mobility chips, although I cannot confirm that myself. Anyway, this fix is a god send. Thanks."

Thx paxju"
,dumas1000,2011-10-17T05:37Z,"I also have no texture issues. The funny thing is, those texture issues with PC version of Rage that everyone cries about are also in the 360 version. At least, when you play the 360 version off of the disc, you get awful texture bugs. Maybe if you install 360 Rage onto your harddrive you won't get them. I don't know. But the standard 360 version as texturing popping in and out of focus at close distances. The textures are almost flickering.It's not some kind of PC bug. "
,slittel,2011-10-17T07:05Z,"is there also a fix for nvidia cards?

,paxju,2011-10-17T07:40Z,"slittel

About nvidia i cant tell u bcos iam usin ati hd 6970
