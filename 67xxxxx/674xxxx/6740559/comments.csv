cheers"

,lisapower,2011-10-14T23:38Z,"yes, you're right. With the Game is something strange, will try a few times more, to see how it works. "
,creative_expansion,2011-10-14T23:42Z,"y is this listed as under 2 gb n when i installed it it was just under 4 gb? i hate that, it is legit but it was choppy n freezing, i didn't understand the point of the game, i went in the first map n walked around  couldn't find netting to do? uninstalled"
,blueface,2011-10-15T00:38Z,"alright i got it, turns out your not supposed to right click to REALLY attack, just get in a fight and click, no right click needed"
,lisapower,2011-10-15T22:09Z,"Thanks so much for this Game, it's incredible!! After i played a bit with it, i like it every minute more. Any Idea why not all Maps are working? thx."
,Shunnabunich,2011-10-16T20:58Z,"@creative_expansion: What you downloaded is an alpha version of the game, which gets weekly updates sent out to those who pre-ordered it. It isn't even complete in terms of engine features, let alone game content, so to expect a fully-playable game would be premature. You can, however, place AI characters on the map after you load it, and fight with them."
,lisapower,2011-10-17T01:11Z,Can the future Updates done from inside the Game?
