              NOTES


         - Our releases are always virus-free. If you think you found
           something  suspicious, it's  a  problem  of  your security
           software. All those  antivirus systems  will  never be too
           smart, so don't complain.  And always remember that we are
           not responsible for modified releases.

         - We aren't stealing releases. We respect hard work of other
           people and always  indicate  original authors of releases.
           We have permissions to use their files.

         - We are doing all this for fun  and  knowledge only. Always
           remember to support the developers if you like the product
           and its quality.

Changelog:

Xotic Update 1.4 Released

Updates to Xotic have been released. The updates will be applied automatically when your Steam client is restarted. The major changes include:

   - Fix for a bug that would overwrite detailed stat information on the Leaderboards (no worries, this bug did not affect the actual score)

   - The map screen will state whether you've earned a perfect chain on each level

   - Fix for a bug that would remove the hard hologram battery in the Tutorial if replaying the level without picking it up the first time through

   - Fix crash if attempting to modify keyboard mappings

   - Prevented exploits from score camping with Spiderlings

We are hard at work on new levels and features for Xotic. Stay tuned!
