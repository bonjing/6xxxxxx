Josh Baker (Roberts) meets a beautiful woman, Cheryl (Janine Turner), on the street one afternoon, only to see her faint and be carted off to the hospital in an ambulance. When Baker tries to find Cheryl at the hospital, he realizes she was never admitted. With the help of an unconvinced New York City police lieutenant (James Earl Jones), Baker attempts to expose trafficking conspiracy without implicating himself in Cheryl's disappearance.

The Ambulance has a sort of freewheeling, madcap vibe about it, and, despite some stretches of inactivity, the movie is funny and thrilling. The ambulance becomes quite the villain, smashing through walls, careening down narrow alleys and stalking Baker throughout Manhattan. I half expected it to turn up reflected in the bathroom mirror. Its ridiculous presence at nearly every turn is both hilarious and unnerving.

While Cohenâ€™s dialogue is occasionally a tad tepid, his plotting is unbelievably tight. He introduces characters in the natural flow of the story, never worrying late additions may be hostile to the audience.

The film has a bunch of fantastic performances but the two most important are Eric Roberts (as the lead) and Megan Gallagher (as his reluctant sidekick). Roberts maintains energy and enthusiasm throughoutâ€”every moment heâ€™s on screen, heâ€™s captivating. Even with a terrible haircut.

Half Gallagherâ€™s performance is unspoken, just her expressions changing. She has great chemistry with Roberts.

Red Buttons has a nice partâ€”excellent chemistry between him and Roberts. Itâ€™s too bad there wasnâ€™t a sequel, given he gets along with Gallagher well too.

James Earl Jones also has a good part. He has a lot of fun. The next supporting tier is strong too. Janine Turner, Eric Braeden, Richard Bright, all good. Stan Lee has a nice cameo for realismâ€™s sake (Roberts works at Marvel Comics).
