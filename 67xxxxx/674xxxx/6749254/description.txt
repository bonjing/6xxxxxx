Tantra is an ancient philosophy that originated in India. A tantric
massage is supposed to stimulate intense feelings of lust. Sensual
touching as a ritual is a new experience for beginners and a relaxing
affair for advanced students. The receiver is stimulated with hands,
oils, feathers and other aids.

This movie demonstrates step-by-step how to properly use tantric
massage techniques on women.

Produced in collaboration with the Tantra Centre Berlin.

Similar to TAO-MASSAGE by the same producers this movie is geared
towards an audience that is interested in new spiritual experiences.
Although the introduction into the world of Tantra is not
comprehensive, it is nevertheless well-rounded and offers plenty of
basic massage techniques guaranteed to open a world of pleasure for
your female partner. One technique that isn't covered by this movie is
Yoni massage (massage of the female private parts). If you're
interested in this kind of massage, check out YONI & LINGAM MASSAGE by
the same label.
