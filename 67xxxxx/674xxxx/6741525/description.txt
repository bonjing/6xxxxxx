An audacious hidden-camera series with Chris Hollins. An acting rogue tradesman tries to rip people off in their own homes using well-known con tricks to show us all how easy it can be to be taken in. Call-centre manager Drew is set up by his brother for a visit from our acting rogue electrician. Roger uses a joke-shop gadget to spark him into thinking the plug sockets pose a health and safety risk, which he will fix on the spot for a hefty fee. Roger also hopes to fool south Londoner Kevin that he has a gas leak in his cellar, with the aid of stink bombs and duct tape. Which of these consumers will be taken in by his con tricks? Plus a north London pensioner reveals how she stood firm against a dodgy driveway installer who tried to rip her off to the tune of 15,000 pounds.
