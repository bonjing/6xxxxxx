,taukky1982,2011-10-17T00:11Z,Is this a different source to the others?
,sandisexmagnet,2011-10-17T05:19Z,why do wankers call it a TS when its a CAM? why??
[V],wolfinvi,2011-10-17T09:39Z,its ts ok m8 not cam
[V],wolfinvi,2011-10-17T09:41Z,@taukky m8 not different source but many improvements have been made for eg. its in sync and even has much more brightness & bitrate too
,timisketzp,2011-10-17T10:03Z,Thanks very watchable.
[V],wolfinvi,2011-10-17T10:05Z,"Video Source: Zhivaja.stal.2011.D.TS....thanks

,Dalsekanu,2011-10-18T02:47Z,"@sandisexmagnet a TS is a cam, just with direct line audio... If you can hear the audience, then yes it is mislabeled."
,Javahead,2011-10-18T20:29Z,"@Dalsekanu, thank you for s'plaining to the kids. Hopeing for good news, the movie is great, but man!, 1.4G for a cam!, I hope it's not a waste of bitrate."
,some-young-guy,2011-10-19T23:49Z,& he didn't include a sample so ya gotta find out if it's decent the hard way.
,5amjr,2011-10-20T17:58Z,"Fantastic Quality??? U need ur fuckin eyes tested!
It looks basically the same as the others, too bright in daytime and pitch black at night.
Its obviously a new movie so we have to expect shitty cams for months. A few years ago the R5's/screeners camealong alot faster but now it takes fuckin ages for a watchable version m8ys!"
,Timrulez,2011-10-20T19:33Z,"5amjr YOU GO FUCKING MAKE A GOOD TORRENT THEN YOU FKING GO TO THE CINEMA AND RECORD ONE WITH good quallity f'uck off..
You did a good job wolf..
I don't like bad quallity but i'm too excited to watch the film anyway so thanks"
,flexibel84,2011-10-22T09:51Z,This movie would have been even more cool if the robot`s was like a skeleton design.. like a Terminator robot or something with the badass evil look ready to kill:)
