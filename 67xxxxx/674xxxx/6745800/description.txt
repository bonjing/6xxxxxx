  This time Jools is joined in what one writer recently called the      
  'oval of excellence', but we'll call the studio, by veteran British   
  rock singer, songwriter and cultural innovator Peter Gabriel,         
  reinventing his back catalogue classics like Solsbury Hill with the   
  striking arrangements of the 46-piece New Blood Orchestra as          
  featured on Gabriel's latest album New Blood.                         
                                                                        
  Making their Later... debut are Southend on Sea's The Horrors, whose  
  acclaimed third album Skying is a blend of 80s cinematic rock and     
  insurgent 21st-century energy.                                        
                                                                        
  On the eve of their biggest ever UK tour, the sharpsuited,            
  folk-driven Noah & The Whale play songs from one of this year's       
  success stories, their second album Last Night on Earth.              
                                                                        
  Online sensation Lana Del Rey, a torch singer for this century who    
  describes herself as 'Lolita got lost in the hood', debuts on TV      
  with her single Video Games, which already has a million hits on      
  YouTube.                                                              
                                                                        
  Plus, there's also the witty, sleepy hip-hop poetry of Ghostpoet,     
  who performs tunes from his Mercury-nominated debut album Peanut      
  Butter Blues and Melancholy Jam.                                      
                                                                        
  Enjoy!
