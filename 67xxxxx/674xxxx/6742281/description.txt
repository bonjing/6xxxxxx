Although a bit dated, the facts set forth in this documentary are truly valid. They have been documented from a number of sources ranging from lay comment to expert testimony verified by video footage of the day's events. Although there are now a number of more recent documentaries that expose the myths set forth in the 911 Commission Report even further, this is a must see. As is stated in the beginning of the film, denial is a common response so I suggest viewing with an open mind. Other documentaries on the subject include: Loose Change (also 2nd Edition and Final Cut) 911 Mysteries (Part 1, Demolition) Other parts pending.
