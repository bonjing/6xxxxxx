                Fugue.
                Comedy featuring Scotland's string-vested,
                beer-guzzling sage. The recession is biting hard and
                Mary and Ella find the bottom has fallen out of the
                cleaning business. Meanwhile, the benefit office also
                threatens to let Rab and Jamesie go. The
                entrepreneurial spirit isn't quite dead, however,
                even in Govan. Mary and Ella decide to put their
                singing talents to good use by forming a new girl
                band called The Scrubbers. Their first gig at the
                local pub is a hit, but success goes to their heads.
                Meanwhile Rab and Jamesie set themselves up as Hunks
                for Hire, sexy male cleaners for bored housewives.
