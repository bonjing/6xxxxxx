"Listen"

the drama stars Emmy and Golden 
Globe-winner and television icon 
Kelsey Grammer headlining his first 
dramatic series. The premiere 
episode also marks the television 
directorial debut of acclaimed 
filmmaker Gus Van Sant. Over the 
course of its eight-episode first 
season, "Boss" follows Chicago 
Mayor Tom Kane (Grammer), who holds 
sway over just about everything in 
his city. When faced with a 
terrible secret that threatens to 
topple his power, his true 
character is revealed: it's not 
power that drives Tom Kane, but his 
fear of losing it.
