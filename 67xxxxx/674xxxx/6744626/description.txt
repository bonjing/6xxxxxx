On Monday's Mark Levin Show: The DNC and the Obama Administration are pushing the Wall Street protestors and supporting them. They believe that this will give them some sort of political advantage and are using this as their campaign. But Mark says that this will not be beneficial for the Democrats because the protestors are rejecting capitalism and ultimately individual liberty and the American people are getting tired of it. The Obama administration has been encouraging this with their rhetoric of class envy and social unrest. Also, Mark talks about a new story saying that President Obama is isolated from the rest of his staff and Mark asks what is it that Obama is really doing any way?
