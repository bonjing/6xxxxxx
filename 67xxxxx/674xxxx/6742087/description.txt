This was the T00NG0D Anaglyph Print, that was like a 952 MB file.  The first thing that I did was Upscale this Print to 720p so that the viewing experience would be clearer than what it was. T00NG0D's Print was GREAT, I was just trying to build on what was already there, if ya know what I mean. My Software that I work with only enables me to add a 2 channel Stereo Soundtrack.  T00NG0D had a 5.1 Dolbly Digital Soundtrack.  So, I stripped that off and saved it.  I Muted my Print and added theirs later, because it was flawless.  But, it required syncing, which was a "little" tricky.  But, I did it.  

After my upscaling, the Print itself was pretty much flawless, so-to-speak, if I do say so myself.  But, I did tweak it a little bit more, like always, by running it through a Brighness Filter.  I did this because when viewing 3-D prints, we have to add glasses, and that darkens the print, when viewing it.  I figured that by adding some brightness to it, that it would enhance the viewing experience.  Personally, I like it.  Please note: It takes Red and Blue glasses to view this print (Or Red and Cyan, if ya wanna be technical about it LOL).

Also, as always, I placed Chapter Marks in place.

After Downloading this file, simply use your DVD file burning software (i.e. Nero Burning ROM) to burn to a DVD to view this on any player.

Thanks to T00NG0D for supplying the initial source for me to work with.  I believe in giving Credit where Credit is due.  That's good Karma.  

ENJOY!
