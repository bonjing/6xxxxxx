Paul never properly understood 'Jesus' at all, and we get a very distorted account of Jesus, from him.  Every religion has failed to bring it's original teachings to the masses, in that they are always distorted right at their source - even with Buddha, his followers did not undertand his material.  But if you use your reason and logic, some kind of truth can be found - but you have to go some strange kind of sources, eg. Talmud Jmmanuel, and Billy Meier.  While there is some really wild stuff there, there is also lots of common sense material as well - that religions are all cons at what they do, and are always political in nature, and lacking in true spirituality."
