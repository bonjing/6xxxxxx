Yes, some of you might feel assured to know that this Scots film has English subtitles.

A tortured prison story based on the diaries of a troubled inmate, Larry Winters, who was incarcerated in 1964 and died in prison 13 years later at the age of 34. More than telling a story, I felt like the film painted a picture of confusion in the mind of an unstable youth stuck in an environment alternately hostile and sometimes seeming downright benevolent (or was that only in his mind?). Hardly a typical behind bars film, it breaks some barriers in story telling, and throws some imagery your way that may be indelible.

No extras whatsoever.
