Series One:
Name:	Colvil And Soames - (1996) [BBC Radio]


Here are series one of Christopher Lee's talky, convoluted mystery series featuring the overweight, old-school spy Henry Colvil (Christopher Benjamin) and his young partner Mrs.Soames (Amanda Redman), assisted in both cases by Henry's pal DCI Guscott (Dudley Sutton).  I enjoyed the series, more for the journey than the destination.

128/44/js.  sound quality excellent.
