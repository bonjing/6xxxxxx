,tingo,2011-10-19T13:40Z,"Trouble with the sound and video...

If your playing through ps3 or media player like popcorn hour a100 then there is no sound and no picture after a couple of minutes.

The same if for the house 08 02 and fringe 04 01 episode from LOL "

thanks"
,ElvaDo,2011-10-26T10:38Z,Hey i think your the one who put fringe 4 epi 5 on here with a stupid pass. protection. that dont work please. what the fuck is that put it in a rar file and do not relink to a fishing site that spreads stupid shit. So No Thnxs EZTV.
,Xeginy,2011-10-27T19:16Z,"great download, thanks

@elvado: I downloaded S4.E5 from eztv too, and there was no password protection or other bullshit on there; eztv has got a really good reputation for clean uploads. Maybe you downloaded it from somewhere else?"
,Chaos420,2011-10-28T03:19Z,You guys obviously mean S04E04 because Episode 5 doesn't even air until 10/28.  I don't understand how someone can download a torrent and not be bright enough to know what one he downloaded and who the bitch at. 
,dogshark,2011-10-29T10:37Z,"Anyone got S04E05 up yet? If so could someone post a link to it? I can't seem to find it anywhere...


Also a BIG thank you to the eztv crew and all the seeders. "
