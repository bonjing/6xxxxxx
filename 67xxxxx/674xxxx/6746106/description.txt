 A space ship gets lost and is forced to make an         
 emergency landing on an unknown planet. The planet      
 looks much like earth, only with no trace of            
 civilization. Soon the crew discovers that there are    
 dinosaurs on the planet, and blood-thirsty buggers at   
 that. The crew hopes to be found and rescued, but they  
 have to struggle to survive until then.

  Sorry for the late proper, but I downloaded this movie when  
  it was initially pred, b/c it reminded me of watching        
  dinosaur movies as a kid...so I wanted to watch it for the   
  nostalgia, heh.                                              
  So anyway the rip by EXViD was unfortunately flawed. They    
  overcropped the source video so much that the video no       
  longer had a good A/R, the used stereo for mono in the       
  audio, and they encoded to 25fps, when the video should      
  have been 24fps. Enjoy this proper if you love old school    
  bad acting dinosaur movies :)
