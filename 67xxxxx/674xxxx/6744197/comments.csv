,tescoc,2011-10-23T14:45Z,"""Originally purchased from iTunes Japan then converted to mp3 (CBR)""

what does this mean - transcoding back to wav and converting to mp3? wouldn't this ruin the sound? sorry if i'm wrong"
[T],theLEAK,2011-10-23T16:01Z,"@tescoc

Original file was from iTunes Japan in the format of m4a. It was then converted to mp3. 

There's a difference between upconverted and converted.

Upconverted (can be called  transcoding) is the direct digital-to-digital data conversion of one encoding to another usually from the same format. For example, if someones leaks an album in mp3 format and is 256 kbps originally, someone can upconvert it to 320 kbps.

Converting = Encoding something in a different format from the original.


@Rowe169

Green skull is delivered. :D"
,tescoc,2011-10-23T18:00Z,"@theLEAK

surely if your original m4a is at 256kbps then transcoding up to 320kbps mp3 is pointless as what has been 'lost' in the original compression cannot be regained? would it be better to convert to 256kps mp3 - and thats not considering if there are losses when converting from m4a to mp3

im just curious so i hope you dont think im being too arsey :)"
[T],theLEAK,2011-10-23T18:02Z,"@SoftWarez

Purchased from account in iTunes JP"
[T],theLEAK,2011-10-23T18:07Z,"@tescoc

Again, it's not transcoding, it's converting. 
It's about quality and and bit rate that matters. If people like this and it gains seeders as proven to this torrent."
