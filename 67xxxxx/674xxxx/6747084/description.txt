Gary Lineker presents highlights from the Premier League, with Alan Hansen and Alan Shearer offering expert analysis of all the action. Anfield played host to one of the biggest games in the calendar as Liverpool took on Manchester United, with Kenny Dalglish\'s men looking to repeat their Dirk Kuyt-inspired victory in 2010\'s corresponding fixture. Big-spending Manchester City hosted Aston Villa, who had not won a Premier League game at Eastlands since April 2007. Mario Balotelli scored a hat-trick for Roberto Mancini\'s side in a 4-0 home win in this fixture in 2010. Everton travelled to Chelsea, where David Moyes\' side had secured five draws in their last five Premier League visits. Other games saw promoted clubs Norwich and Swansea in action at Carrow Road, Blackburn away at QPR, Stoke host Fulham, and Wigan and Bolton meet in a north-west derby.
