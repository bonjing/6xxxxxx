expect a high upload speed, I'm seeding with 1mb is not very fast but I can download as 
well,I'll update soon to 3mb
I have an XBOX 360 Slim, use Verbatim and Ridata media and burn at 2.4x.
To file in multiple parts with Winrar and .Sfv always use Azureus

Do not forget to seed to 1.1 ratio"

So I guess I will just seed for as long as i feel like it, the math be damned.  But I will upload, for sure

lol... thanks for the upload, mate.  Cheers!
