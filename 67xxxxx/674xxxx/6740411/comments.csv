,tyler91690,2011-10-13T12:05Z,"right!? wtf PaNaX93... you didn't get enough of that hott man ass in the first episode? There will be more bro trust me! Nah j/k this show is the shit though, thanks VTV. Finally we get a good horror TV show. WTF are you complaining?"
,lizardomanson,2011-10-13T13:28Z,"I think the first episode was good,  the only think i didn't liked was the the girl with down syndrome, i felt it was disrespectful for people with the condition, but then again, is just my opinion."

,dlarrym1111,2011-10-14T06:32Z,"LOVE this show. I liked both episodes. (the opening pilot and this last one). This series has major potential. I really like this show. Time will tell. I thought HAPPY TOWN on ABC with actor Sam Neil was going to take off. It was just after LOST had had its final episode. ABC was needing a new direction to go and I was obviously wrong, but I liked that show as well. It didn't even get through the first season. It had its plug pulled by the 6th episode. The 7th and 8th were already filmed but never aired. ABC posted them for free watching at their web site.

MAYBE a series with LOST potential?

As for  comment about the actress with down syndrome. 
1st) It might be a very good makeup job on an actress without the syndrome. . . 
 2ndly) I think it is GREAT if an actress that really has downs syndrome plays the role, as it shows how anyone can overcome any hurdle.
LASTLY) Why shouldn't someone with down syndrome be able to earn a living as an actress and live the good life? 

lizardomanson's comment is by far more condescending and negative towards that actress or others with downs syndrome. His comment suggests that a person with downs syndrome is only good for being""taken care of"" instead of the reality which is that downs syndrome doesn't have to be a disability. If she can overcome such health problems, earn a living as an actress along with her colleges then it can give hope to others to try and prevail. 

It is by far MUCH more respectful to have a person WITH downs syndrome play the part rather then give the part and the money thus earned to a person in make up.

GREAT quality as far as VIDEO and AUDIO 10/10.  THANKS, great upload VTV"
,epicfrog,2011-10-14T08:07Z,"as far as people talking about a lack of horror shows... hello? reminder that The Walking Dead starts again really soon, can't wait for it"
,holyfool,2011-10-15T12:28Z,"thnx. vTv

- hopefully this show will improve."
,scott_ehm,2011-10-17T07:39Z,Check out the Danish horror series 'Riget' for 2 great actors with Downs. 
,y3n007,2011-10-19T07:35Z,"I think this show was pretty freaky, I liked it, I hope they do not ruin it with a bad story as they usually do, and about the girl with the dawn syndrome, I am OK with it it makes it that much creappier.....thanks for the upload VTV....."
,icewolf72,2011-11-09T21:07Z,"Only problem with this show, it's hard to keep up with, the first episode I saw was Halloween Part 2, just browsing through channels and stopped by and ended up staying put on FX"
