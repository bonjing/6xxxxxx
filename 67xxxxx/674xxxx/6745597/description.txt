This is 500+ books that are available elsewhere in pdf.  I converted them to .mobi using calibre, which means some have weird formatting issues.  Mostly readable.

The criteria used to select these books were having won a huge/nebula on the sci-fi top 100 list on sffjazz, or being part of a series where one of the books in the series is on the aforementioned lists.  also a few miscellaneous items of note.  Very few if any truly low quality content in this torrent, I originally made this collection to replace my physical collection :)

If you know of a place to get better mobi or epub conversions of some of these books let me know in the comments.
