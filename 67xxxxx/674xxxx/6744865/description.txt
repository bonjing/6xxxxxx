1492 The Lie is a progressive/electro/ambient music project started by Joshua Aldrich. He started producing music in 2008 in Japan, with zero prior experience, and has finally released The Three Kings EP after years of experimenting with sound and genres. The Three Kings EP should prove that 1492 The Lie will only get better with time. Enjoy the freeness.
