  Four seasons into The Gruen Transfer and what have we learned? That   
  most of us can be bought or sold. And that sometimes, it actually     
  feels good. Were all coerced and serenaded by advertising, an        
  industry devoted to changing our minds and our behaviour.             
                                                                        
  But advertising is not the only industry that wants to get inside     
  our heads and move the furniture around. Which brings us to spin,     
  branding, and image control. Along with advertising, they form the    
  nervous system of 21st century life. Theyre the levers pulled        
  behind most news stories, the silent partners in public debates.      
                                                                        
  Gruen thinks its time to look at these dark arts as well. Because    
  everyone is on the sell. Tyrants. Sports stars. Actors. Criminals.    
  Politicians. Deities. Charities. Entire nations. Theyre all trying   
  to persuade us to think, buy or do things that we werent thinking,   
  buying or doing yesterday.                                            
                                                                        
  Gruen Planet, our latest show -in advertising they call it a brand    
  extension- will run an x ray across the world each week, unpicking    
  the stories that affect us all. How do you protect an unstable        
  government when a backbencher goes feral? Does Tiger cut it anymore   
  as a business? How has the Arab uprising been turned into Western     
  profit? What was the Dalai Lama doing on Masterchef? Who do you turn  
  to when your family name is your brand and its become toxic?         
                                                                        
  Each week, host Wil Anderson will be joined by regulars Todd Sampson  
  and Russel Howcroft, along with some of Australias smartest          
  communications experts. They will take us inside the persuasion       
  business and explain why the world appears, not as it really is, but  
  as others want us to see it. Why everything is spin, branding,        
  advertising and image control.
