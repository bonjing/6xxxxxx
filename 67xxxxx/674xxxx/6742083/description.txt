This is a somewhat modern era romantic song that certainly does hit the notes
in romantic appeal even for conservative types like me who don't listen at
all to raunchy music. I think this could appeal to a broad audience and
there should be some takers out there amongst those who would prefer to seed a 
single song rather than an entire Bon Jovi CD perhaps. this is a flac converted
mp3 file at full stereo 320k Its Nice easy listening genre style too I think 
somewhat

Enjoy and take good care, folks!
