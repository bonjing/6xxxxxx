The Master of air puppets is back !! Joe Bryant and his crew in Season 3 of Ice Pilots NWT ! :) 
Again I'm sorry, maybe/for some controversial quality (webrip .FLV). But, It wouldn't be better till some decent DVD rip after the end of this season-hope so!  Dig it & enjoy!
Haters - stay the fck away, or I'll bite!

,ccsbush,2011-10-14T13:33Z,Thank you!!
,IcedCoffeeMate,2011-10-14T21:49Z,"Thanks man, a 200 MB rip is better than nothing when you don't have cable/satellite. Keep em coming! and any word on a decent season 2 rip? might actually have to buy it one of these days"
[V],mirogster,2011-10-15T00:08Z,"Nope :( There's only Season 1 - 3 DVD Set available = decent rip source, so far :(
It sucks, I know and as usual, BLAME CANADA ;P"
,krissmeister,2011-10-17T12:11Z,Fantastic! Thanks so much mirogster! Been waiting for this :)
,tellme2,2011-10-20T00:31Z,Why don't up upload this to a webhosting site. I can't even get the torrent to start at all because no one is seeding at all.
,fuzzy30,2011-10-20T17:18Z,"can someone upload episode 2 from last night, please!!!"
,flajjaren,2011-10-20T18:38Z,Mirogster - thank you!
[V],mirogster,2011-10-20T20:56Z,"@tellme2 Cuz simply, I really hate webhosting sites.  Btw. there's 29 seeders right now, what do you expect? Thousands seeders with that awesome, but 'niche' tv series?
Dude, relax and seed, it's only 200 mb file after all.

...Note to myself: don't feed trolls... "
,dzlrules,2011-10-20T23:31Z,"The quality isn't bad. Certainly watchable. Full screen gets a little blurred in some shots but it's fine IMO. If folks need blueray quality - let them eat cake. :)

Thanks"
,brigzy,2011-10-24T12:41Z,"WHY FLV FILES?  Most of us watch these files on our TV's in the comfort of our TV room... not at the computer, that means every file that isn't Divx or avi needs to be converted, flv is a weird way to do it but thx anyway. I will convert. "
,brigzy,2011-10-25T14:56Z,"I converted the flv files to Divx to watch on the Plasma screen and the sound sync was about 15 seconds out, bloody hopeless.... I deleted episode 2 and 3."
,scooter1182,2011-10-27T15:17Z,Thanks mirogster for taking the time to do this
[V],mirogster,2011-10-30T23:38Z,@brigzy Maybe it's time for buying decent mediaplayer?
,SimPirate,2011-11-27T16:39Z,"Thank you very much. I can't watch it on TV because I live in the US, and I can't watch it on the website because it is Geo-Blocked. Thank you for giving me my favorite show! "
