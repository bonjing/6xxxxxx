,SectorVector,2012-01-01T19:29Z,"I read an article about a journalist named Rajkumar Keswani who rang alarm bells atleast 2 years before the incident, to no avail. Its a shame that even after 27 years, people are still demanding for compensation; the UCIL site still has 8000 tonnes of toxic waste which DCC/govt won't clean up. Lawyers+Diplomats+politicians is a lethal mix. Nothing gets done. C'est la vie. Note: I have not watched the documentary yet."
