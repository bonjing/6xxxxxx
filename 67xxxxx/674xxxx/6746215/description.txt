Seconds From Disaster: Bhopal Nightmare
At around midnight on 3rd December 1984 began the worst nightmare for Bhopal. The night of terror and death. A cloud of deadly gases exploded from the pesticide plant that belonged to Union Carbide India, a subsidiary of the US-based Union Carbide Company because of an exothermic reaction due to the entry of water to the tank containing 42 tons of methyl isocyanate releasing large amount of toxic gases into the atmosphere. The gases flooded into the homes of sleeping people of Bhopal, causing great panic as people woke up with a burning sensation in their lungs, suffocation, cough, burning eyes and vomiting, breathlessness, stomach pains and vomiting.
