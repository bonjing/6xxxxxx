,the_hacker_b,2011-10-15T08:07Z,Fuck this game i love it!
,dumas1000,2011-10-15T21:51Z,I would suspect that this game doesn't have the Dx11 and that it would be difficult to add it yourself because Crysis 2 updates require the original .EXE file and the .EXE here has already been pre-altered. I could be wrong though.
,vlora60,2011-10-21T14:22Z,this really works!thanks man!
,susantha82,2011-10-21T19:31Z,thanks man.

,1victor602,2011-12-04T22:19Z,"just installed (Took FOREVER)
everything seemed good at first but as soon as i started playing. the keyboard controls would freeze up. I didnt see any crack folder or serials in the iso. (Multiplayer requires serial) (Not provided) Game seems to run smooth graphics phenominal. Only issue i had was the controls. Its not my cpu cuz i just got SKYRIM and it works like a champ.
I Would not suggest anyone to download this. i will uninstal then find a better one.

Oh..... when instalation was in progress, my computer was acting weird and VERY slow. even when it finished i had to restart my computer.

NO VIRUS or THREAT DETECTED.

if anyone has similar issues lemme know"

,1victor602,2011-12-04T22:23Z,"No VIRUS or Threat Detected. There is omething wrong with this game. 

Works great at first. but as soon as i started playing. the keyboard controls would freeze up. or would take at least 5 seconds to respond.
Installation took FOREVER, had to restart my cpu cuz during installation cpu became very slow/mouse unresponsive.
DO NOT DOWNLOAD"

,R4ptor,2012-01-11T11:43Z,"Stop bitching pls. Yea, it takes some time to install but it's totally worth it. Game is amazing. Definitely better than BF 3 or MW3 "
,dtox525,2012-01-27T17:51Z,when i try install it gets half way through then automaticly uninstalls anyone knows whats happening
,blekman,2012-03-12T16:07Z,"Forget about this one folks, you can't patch it to 1.9 in order to use multiplayer."
,spazowacky,2012-03-14T00:32Z,"This definately works fine for win7x64 but when trying to apply the 1.9 patch/hires textures and then a 1.9 crack (tried several cracks, same deal) would get no sound so if your wanting to run this in it's full dx11 glory your probably best going for one of the bigger torrents."
,ovnoglavi,2012-03-22T22:04Z,"My god people... Why do you bitch about installing so much??? It takes forever cause this is a repack. In fact this one is the best repack out there... Black box are the best scene group considering game repacks! Every repack I ever downloaded that had black box signature, worked like a charm. This one too! 

It takes a lot of time to instal cause it has to extract a lot of data, but it pays of at the end...

Check out their other releases and you wont be sorry, believe me!!!

Thanx a lot zingooo for this upload and a big thanx to my fellow seeders!!! Keep up the good work guys!"
