The world was shocked with a series of environmental disasters, and mankind is on the verge
of extinction. Aliens have returned, determined to wipe people off the face of the earth and
started at the same time with one of the most iconic cities of the earth. New York streets
flooded with alien invaders, and the wave of the walking nightmares gradually engulfing
the city and its inhabitants. Urban communication systems are destroyed, the buildings are
in ruins. This New York City youâ€™ve ever seen. Neither law enforcement organizations, nor
the U.S. military machine can not cope with the invaders, and all who could not escape in
time, are already dead. To survive in this chaos, you need the technology, about which
neither the earthâ€™s soldiers also have no idea. One person will inherit something that
