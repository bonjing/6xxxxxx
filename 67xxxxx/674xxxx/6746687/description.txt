For your digital backup convenience, I have for you a collection of both Audio and eBooks in PDF format of Angie Sageâ€™s Septimus Heap series. Books one through five are included in this upload.

I was going to include a summary of each book here. However, I decided not to spoil it for any readers. Instead below you will find links to Wikipedia for each book I've included as well as one for the entire series.  

Book 1 Magyk:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magyk
Book 2 Flyte:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyte
Book 3 Physik: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physik
Book 4 Queste: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queste
Book 5 Syren:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syren(book)
Entire Series: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septimus_Heap

Once you've confirmed the legitimacy of this upload, do me a favor.

Look forward to the next two books being added to this collection, once they are released.

+ Seed + Comment + Enjoy
