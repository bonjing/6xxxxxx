   Yoni massage (massage of a woman's vagina) and Lingam massage (massage of a
   penis) are a respectful and observant way of touching a person's private
   parts. The massages allow emotions to run rampant: well-being, lust and
   ecstasy. The rituals and techniques are explained in detail and are fairly
   easy to understand for beginners.

   If you've experienced a tantric massage before, you know that a Yoni/Lingam
   massage at the end leads to a very emotional release. This kind of intimate
   touching can also be experienced without prior Tantra massage and that's
   exactly what the movie focuses on. It singles out the ritual of intimate
   touching. A very informative movie aimed at couples who might want to try
   some of these techniques at home on a rainy Sunday afternoon...
   
   Yoni
   Yoni is the Sanskrit word for the vagina that is loosely translated as
   "sacred space" or "Sacred Temple." In Tantra, the Yoni is seen from a
   perspective of love and respect. The Yoni Massage is also used as a form of
   "safe sex" and is an excellent activity to build trust and intimacy. The
   goal of the Yoni massage is not solely to achieve orgasm; the goal can be
   to simply pleasure and massage the Yoni. Both receiver and giver can relax,
   and not worry about achieving any particular goal. When orgasm does occur
   it is usually more expanded, intense and satisfying. Pleasure your
   Lover...and Yourself.

   Lingam
   The Sanskrit word for the male sexual organ is Lingam and is loosely
   translated as "Wand of Light." In Tantra or Sacred Sexuality, the Lingam is
   respectfully viewed and honored, as a channel to creative energy and
   pleasure. Orgasm is not the goal of the Lingam massage,although it can be a
   pleasant and welcome side effect. The goal is to massage the Lingam, also
   including testicles and Sacred Spot (prostate) externally, allowing the man
   to surrender to a form of ecstacy he may not be accustomed to. The Lingam
   Massage allows the man to experience unique pleasure and absorb erotic
   energy.
