,kensiko,2011-10-17T01:00Z,"Ok it seems the tracker was not saved within the torrent, so it's working now."
,kensiko,2011-10-17T01:11Z,"Well, I get many clients (leechers) and no transfer.

For anyone trying to download, can you test by adding this tracker ?

,kensiko,2011-10-17T01:35Z,"I'm really sorry guys, I see you all on DHT and it doesn't upload. I have open ports in my router, I even tried DMZ and still not working. I can't edit the torrent and can't upload it again. I'm out of idea."
,kensiko,2011-10-17T01:48Z,"Ok I think I understand now.

It's working :)"
