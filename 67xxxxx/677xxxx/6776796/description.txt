Welcome to the most stunning scenery ever
made for Heathrow Airport! Heathrow is the
latest creation of the next generation of
products from UK2000 Scenery and is simply
the best yet!

Heathrow Airport is the busiest international airport in the
world. With over Half a Million polygons, 250MB of graphics
data, it really is Xtreme scenery!. But dont let the size put
you off, the FPS (frame per second is faster than the older
and less detailed Heathrow Pro). On a modern PC the FS9
version can achive over 100fps, and even with 200AI you get
30fps.FSX is of cause a slower sim, as such it will be slower
but still far beter than any other Heathrow version.
