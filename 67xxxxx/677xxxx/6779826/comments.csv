,54andgone,2011-10-29T05:55Z,Dear idxque thin is not a forum for points of view or criticizing the movie or auther ! It is to commit on quailty of upload and to give thanks to those who work hard to give it to us for free.
,kaabee,2011-10-29T06:16Z,"Excellent quality downloads. (And idxque - It appears that unless something is written in crayon, it's over your head. - now, go smell up the cities with all of your ""occupy"" comrades)"
,Bynx,2011-10-29T10:35Z,"Idxcue, in a language you will understand.....you are a fucking dimwitted asshole.

Scenebalance, thanks for the upload."
,redactedwv,2011-10-30T20:05Z,"Well said, @ idxcue.

As for your detractors, downloading this silly, superficial, laissez faire tripe for free on a sharing site built on a collectivist model, well.... their glaring, neon hypocrisy speaks for itself.

Kinda like the hypocrisy of Rand herself, who spent a lifetime espousing an small, greedy, short-sighted & intellectually untenable point of view, only to end up soaking Medicare under n assumed name in her later years. After all, she reasoned, if she didn't have some financial support from the state, the expenses of the for-profit medical 'care' system would have crippled her financially. The assumed name was intended to protect her reputation, so that future dim-witted creeps would still buy her books, and her acolytes (like Greenspan, who shares no small degree of responsibility for the current state of the world market) wouldn't have to answer uncomfortable questions about her credibility, or the credibility of her ideas.

""Atlas Shrugged""... Yeah, Ayn.... He wasn't the only one."

This will be downloaded for the iPOD ... but thanx for passing judgement."
,kartowkxyt,2012-01-06T07:14Z,"Crazy movie (as crazy as that Rand woman) but fun to watch. It gives a boner to yuppies who think they are the salt of the earth and without them all would collapse. I can already see the second part. The John Galt Atlantis geniuses finally succeed and dictate conditions to the oppressing federal government when the whole economy collapses and create a golden era of unbridled capitalism where anybody can make as much money as they want and to hell the rest of the population. As if it wasnt that way now and in the last two centuries, but hell, they feel threatened by government limitations. Rand=greed without restrictions, that just wont work, the whole idea is ridiculous but lets have fun watching those yuppies wet dreams."
