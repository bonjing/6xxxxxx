Every Mac user has noticed it; over time, your system slows down. This is particularly true in these days of constant security updates, as replacing operating system components not only increases file fragmentation, but also creates a more insidious problemâ€”over time, the operating system itself ends up scattered all over your disk.

This, of course, doesnâ€™t show up as fragmentationâ€”after all, the files themselves are probably contiguousâ€”but nevertheless, it takes your machine longer to start up, it takes programs longer to start, and it takes longer to get your work done.

iDefrag solves these problems and more, by defragmenting and optimizing your Macâ€™s filesystem.
