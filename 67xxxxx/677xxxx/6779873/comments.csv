,jj441,2011-10-29T11:33Z,shit quality. dont bother unless your desperate
,rcr29budcar,2011-10-29T12:47Z,"Really? A shit quality copy? I guess if your looking for a bluray quality copy, then yes, its a shit copy.  The truth is that its by no means bluray quality, but its definately not a shit quality copy. If your like me, and you missed this episode, then this is a good copy to watch.  Not HD, but not bad."
,rcr29budcar,2011-10-29T12:48Z,"Oh, and thanks to the uploader. Considering this is the only copy up on TPB right now, its pretty good."
,ROU-KillingTime,2011-10-29T14:40Z,Quite a few audio dropouts & hiccups for me with this file - anyone else have that problem?
,fureimu2k,2011-10-29T15:16Z,"Qulity is really a great shit. Looks like there is some temporal smooth filter added, whole picture is blurred terribly. Really horrible quality."
,fureimu2k,2011-10-29T15:17Z,"yes, audio dropouts too"
,countkurt,2011-10-29T15:22Z,"I also find both the audio and visual quality substandard on this one...
But thank you for the UL never-the-less!"
,Erik_O,2011-10-29T15:29Z,"unfortunately this is unwatchable quality, but thanks for trying."
