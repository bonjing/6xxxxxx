[T],verifire,2011-10-27T23:37Z,"Hi, neon! ;D
Thanks for this. Seedboxing it for ya'.. There.

I've got a problem, and I have to turn to you, but have to do it in a comment. Sorry about that.

Thing is: I can't access the suprbay anymore, password lost with machine-crash, all I found was one that didn't work [might be because of the 'new' https?], and my name is taken [of course], but my mail address isn't listed as is, so I can't get a new password. Problem..

Heard it before? :D
Can you do something about it?
I'd owe you one [more.. ;-) ].

V."
[V],neon,2011-10-28T03:04Z,"HeHe...yes from you ive heard it before :)  

best thing to do is get off this comments if we are dealing with passwords...email etc

so join.... aha-share.com .... so we can talk via private message.. leave out the - after aha or type it into google"
