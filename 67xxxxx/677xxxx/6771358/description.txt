Stockholm, Sweden 1997
Date: 97-06-14
Venue: Stockholm Stadion

Recording: AUD
Quality: 8(-)
Menu: YES
Extras: None
Comments: 2-cam mix, left and right. A bit shaky and a few heads but generally pretty good. (The shot of Paul flying over the audience rocks!!) Missing the very first part of 100,000 years, right before the first verse. Audio isn't very good, distant and totally lacking bass, but it's a stadium show so one can't expect much.
