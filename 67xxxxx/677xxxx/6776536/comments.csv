[V],RR-NE,2011-10-28T06:10Z,One other thing... how do you seed so quickly?
[V],phatwarez,2011-10-28T19:20Z,"Get the GUI for mp4box, else you'll have to type everything out like eac3to. Seeding is fast because ""Made Possible by Your Donations."" you guys donate."

bye-week. "
,timotheophany,2011-10-28T22:31Z,Man this was a painful game to watch. I switched to listening on the radio halfway through because I had to leave where I was. Now I get to suffer through seeing the 2nd half!
,hine2009,2011-10-28T22:49Z,"Thanks Phat... I was afraid to look through the schedules, cos I did not want to see a result before the game. It is possible to go for quite a while in Sweden without getting the result when you don't want it..hehe
Once again, you'r tha MAN!"
,Sirdowski,2011-11-01T23:00Z,How can i donate to you??? I will generously donate every week you put a Ravens game. I'm dying to get that Cards game. YOU ARE THE MAN
