,heddle,2011-10-28T20:22Z,"False Positive on the Hack Tool. Everything seems to work great, except that After Effects is CS4 version. I really need 5.5 so I can transfer projects from work to home. Is that a mistake?"
,heddle,2011-10-29T03:43Z,"The list of programs is not quite accurate, here is what I got:

AE CS4
Premeire 4
Photoshop 5
InDesign 5
FireWorks 5
Flash 5.5
Flash Catalyst 5
Flash Builder 4
DreamWeaver 5
Device Central 5
Contribute 5
Audition 5.5
Acrobat X pro

@jedksytaho - I'm not sure you need serials with this portable version. I do not have to put any serial number in to work.

,gorgang,2011-11-03T01:02Z,"Hi,

Thanks for the hard work. Most come up fine. However, several of the programs would not load:

Illustrator CS5.5 (asks for adobe file manager)
Flash Catalyst CS5 (asks for java runtime)
Premiere CS5 (nothing, no logo)
Device Central CS5.5 (nothing)

Any reason? Thanks"
,bkwinnie,2011-11-06T19:05Z,"@dilinwe Portable soft is that one which you can put on your pendrive, hdd etc. Just anywhere. See good pic by PApps.Com:

@heddle yes, the list is wrong, i'm sorry. thanks

@gorang wtf? java RE? f it asks, you can just install it. normally, it doesnt require jre/.net/other stuff. o_O

for all: if you want to replace some programs with yours, you can do it. the structure is pretty simple:
ROOT:/progs/xx/xx.exe
where xx is 2letter shortcode, as on icon of that program.
(ac-Acrobat, dc-DevCentral)"

,rhett_hdx,2011-11-27T21:09Z,+1 Splendiferous. This has to be the best implementation of CS5* I have seen. I love the idea of portability.

,rei_bay,2011-12-04T11:29Z,"Thanks bkinnie it's working great.

Only thing is if you try to click Update from menu it says ""Adobe Application Manger, required to update your product, is missing or damaged."" So is that mean that this version is not able to get any update? ( I am trying to update the FlashPlayer and AIR version...)
