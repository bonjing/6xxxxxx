With her abstract beats, unique voice and hypnotizing lyrics, the female singer, musician and producer Tone is renowned for her both forceful and frail expressions in experimental electronica.
On her debut album she shows her great versatility ranging from uplifting vigorous outlets of energy to obscure, melancholic moods. An album released in a new audiovisual format â€“ with an invitation to copy and share freely at no charge!

Musically, Tone creates a remarkable audiovisual realm where her light and spellbinding voice adds to a bedrock of crunchy break beats, abstract compositional structures and catchy melodies. Not being a typical songwriter in terms of clinging to the usage of the traditional structure of verses and choruses, Tone relies on improvisation and creative exploration in the creation of her unpredictable musical landscapes - while adding daunting, yet compelling lyrics - and thereby drawing listeners into her musical and atmospheric universe of
thoughts, sounds and a myriad of emotional expressions.
