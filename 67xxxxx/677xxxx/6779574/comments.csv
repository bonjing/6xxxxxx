,Arkanum22,2011-11-04T17:22Z,"Hello, Im an english speaking guy who is just starting to DL this game. If your english speaking and gonna try this game pleae hit me up on www.kat.ph (JesusHatesYou) or IGN.com/Gamesradar.com (Crowbar_Abortion)."
,Viktor.Z,2011-11-08T20:35Z,"I used the NewTeraLauncher.exe and the game patched for me. You're saying ""Enter your login server and click the big button at the bottom right"". Where should i do that? Well i registered on http://newteraonline.com/en, then i tried to type the login in the launcher in the top right corner, but some error in korean poped up. They i hit the big button at the bottom right, but another error in koren popped up. What i'm doing wrong?"
,Viktor.Z,2011-11-08T21:02Z,"Ok, now i figured it out. I used CUTera_SmartLaunch.exe instead of NewTeraLauncher.exe and rusian launcher has poped up. Then i managed to run the game using your guide. But in the server list i see many servers to choose from. So i choosed the first one but the game crashed. I think there should be only one server right? I think i should not have to patch the game with the korean launcher before becouse i think im connecting to oficial server like that"
,Viktor.Z,2011-11-08T21:40Z,"Ok, so now i unpacked the game again ran it without patching it. And now only one server called NewTera appeared. But when i double click it, nothing happens. No crash, no game running, just nothing happens. Maybe the server is dead somehow. But it says it's ""ON"". Now i really don't get it"
,Viktor.Z,2011-11-08T21:58Z,"Ok, i give up. The server is either dead or it doesn't work"
,zieku87,2011-11-13T23:08Z,I'm downloading this now. Has anyone been able to get the client to function?

,cpcmso,2012-02-10T17:41Z,"Hey Oni_Khan!

I'm reeeeeeeaaaaaally keen to try out this game, but I have a question: Where are you from? Have you tried it out? Is it working?

Ok, I suppose that was 3 questions XP

Seriously though, I'm english, the game is Korean and the server is Russian.. am I right?

Is there a crack available for english translation if this torrent works?
