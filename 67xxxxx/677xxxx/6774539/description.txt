Shadow Cabinet, spun out of the Shadow War crossover in all the Milestone titles including Static (and featured recently in Justice League before the relaunch).

The Shadow Cabinet is a secret organization of superhuman beings acting to protect the world by neutralizing potential threats while they are still relatively harmless - "to save humanity from itself, no matter what that requires". The covert nature and dubious morality of many of these clandestine missions led to their being described as "the JLA as run by the CIA".
