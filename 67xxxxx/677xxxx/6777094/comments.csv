,Flamagio,2011-10-28T15:46Z,"I think the show is as good as ever. Losing Steven Carrell was sad, but it gives the other actors a chance to shine. Rainn Wilson is a stand out for me, great in Super. And Ed Helms in The Hangover's."

Seriously though, terrible episode. Just not funny at all. This show is really running out of steam :( Can't believe there aren't any better scriptwriters available!"

I completely agree with st0gey. This was THE worst episode of The Office ever. It was even worse than all the English ones. The script writers have put the words of michael scott in andy, if you notice, and although he is doing an ok job at that there is just something lacking."
