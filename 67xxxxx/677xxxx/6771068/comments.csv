,RipMin2,2011-10-31T16:31Z,"Download status update:  From the one seed it is now 63% distributed/downloaded after 6 days, so I'm guessing it should be fully distributed in another 4 more days."
,RipMin2,2011-11-01T05:32Z,"re: franciscoomega1  
For 2D quality and 6.1 surround, this may satisfy...

,Sub20hz,2011-11-01T05:38Z,a file this large why not put in DTS audio instead of AC3.  Seems strange that it isnt in DTS...
,JOEY3D,2011-11-01T18:36Z,Sub20hz samsung 3dtvs cant handle dts that is why it is ac3 and the file size is large so not to loose too much quality as most 3d blurays are 40gb give or take plus there is other stuff on the disks hope this helps
,coreydbh,2011-12-12T13:15Z,Thanks for all your efforts uploading all the movies you do Joey
