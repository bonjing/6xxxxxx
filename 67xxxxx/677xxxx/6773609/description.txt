Wednesday's Opie and Anthony Show from SiriusXM.

Special episode today. Rich Vos, Bob Kelly, Colin Quinn, and Keith Robinson in studio with Jim Norton to announce that our good friend Patrice O'Neal has had a stroke (not a joke). Pretty much of a downer... so no obnoxious Sam and the shit hour today.  

If you would like to send Patrice a few words of encouragement, you can email it to:

LoveForPatrice@gmail.com.  :(


Get well soon, @BigMammaProds!!!!
