[V],globeplus,2011-10-26T14:12Z,"To royhere : Happy Diwali for you too from Portugal and today here we are getting an extra wind strenght that makes my umbrella turning and damage 2 sticks i guess , but the best part was that when i was walking on the street with normality i found a new lady umbrella almost completly ripped of sticks on the ground and i saw another people with great difficulties to control the umbrella because the wind , amazing ... well the conclusion it is very simple and this in a day without too much rain : what can damage the umbrellas it is not the rain independtly how heavy can be but the wind that can turn the umbrellas very quiclky ununexpedtly ... brillant conclusion !!!

Good day to you and happy movie to all of you ."
