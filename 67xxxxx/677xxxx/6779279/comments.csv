Thanks alot Khannies it worked 100% charm. M very keen in checking before installing or applying this kind of downloads, i double checked your Windows 7 on Virtual PC by microsoft, and it worked fine and activated to 100% Genuine. I made a DVD from your Iso and labeld it Khannies Windows 7 Ultimate. I m sorry for your good torrents has no good comments, its sad. BTW, Thanks again for a very nice upload. Luv you Khannies for making my PC looks great without spending a buck :)"
,engutkaa,2011-11-04T10:17Z,"@DhenzJai:
I dont know what you did, whether you made bootable dvd wid nero burner or not. Anyhow i found solution to ur problem through Googling,
""
insert your OS CD
go to DOS window and type in your OS drive (usualy C:/
type in bootrec /FixMbr
then type in bootrec /fixboot
then type in bootrec /rebuildbcd
then type in exit
restart your computer

it will work 100% only if you prompt at the same order ""

And about the upload, Its very fine, and u can check my above comment. :) Good LUck Fnd."

,TerikB,2011-11-14T22:17Z,"This guy deserves a skull (:
I'm now running Windows 7 on this machine.
One thing that was weird though, is that I burnt the iso onto a DVD, and booted with that drive, but the OS just booted up as Windows XP. I then opened up Daemon Tools and mounted the image that was on the disc, and the install started and finished without problems. Is this normal? I just assumed the install would start right from boot up. "

,jimmyrich40,2011-11-16T09:50Z,"@ricebow:
He doesn't upload 64bit cuz he has 32 bit pc, he told in this another torrent.
He says that he never upload a thing that is 100% checked by him prsonly so that's the reason he dont wana upload 64 bit cuz he can't check it. 
________________________________________
And if you have a question still , then email him @

khansinternational@yahoo.com  cuz his account has been removed and ip address has been banned from TPB, he is discouraged by this action, u can check the Quality +64/-215(-151),
before a week or half, this was 62+ only and -ve was just 0, i dont know why TPB users or TPB is playing game with him :(  its sad, 
Also if you have a question that why i m taking his side?
Reason is that, i have his windows 7 unattended version from khannies and i didnt seen a legit windows from others as i got from him. He has also good torrents beside this, like windows xp sp3 ,windows 7 enterprise ,office 2010, eset nod32 4 with valid key and know body has done that yet even cracks dont work. .I found this windows to be worth for me, thanx alot khannies my bro.
And also u can contact him via his site www.alquran.kk5.org   .
Luv u khannies"

can i use this image to update my already installed windows 7 Ultimate, I would like to keep my programs.
Thanks"
,khannies3,2011-12-18T23:17Z,"@hbabeyeh ;; you can't keep you like update windows but if you install it in other drive so you can use both windows or if you want to keep one window only so you will loose your old windows programmes i mean you can use it but you can get that date and that you can find it in c drive where you will install windows ultimate with the name of old window other way no chance i mean no install programme you can use but yes data you can find from there
