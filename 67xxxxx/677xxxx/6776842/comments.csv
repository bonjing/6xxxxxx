,dumas1000,2011-10-28T06:47Z,"Here's a game, just like Rage, that is too complicated for most systems, including systems that can essentially play every other game, to run properly. I bought the retail version of this game and with a i7 processor, 6GB of RAM, and a 5870HD chip, I cannot run this game. I recieve an immidiate Battlefield 3 stopped working crash. The same thing happened with Rage. Then someone on Pirate's bay released a crash fix for Rage, which consisted of one .dll file. I put that file in my Rage folder and now Rage runs 100 percent for me, pirated. Ironically, I bought the Retail version of Rage too. And couldn't run it without that one file fix. Anyway, I'm saying that people having issues probably ought not blame the pirates. This game is not well optimized. Lots of people complaining with Extremezone upload. It's the game itself, not the pirated copy."
,dumas1000,2011-10-28T06:50Z,"I'm going to download BlackBox and report back if I can get the pirated version to work, even though the retail version doesn't. That is what happened for me with Rage. If it happens again with BF3, that's just sad. Sad that pirated copies work better then retail games. We shall see."

,CookieMunzta,2011-10-28T15:57Z,"Dumas: AMD cards had an issue with stuttering and crashing in RAGE.
I've not heard any similar issues regarding BF3.

Also, is that a laptop running the GPU externally?"
