Was just wondering if Season 6 was close to comming out?"
,Pixels1080,2011-12-08T19:07Z,"@Minato9

,Pixels1080,2011-12-12T20:35Z,"@ saintmonster 

LOL , I Dont Dubb the series i record them when they are live .
since Dubbed season 6 Eps are not aired yet it will take time tell they finish it up which may take over a year :I
Check Naruto Wiki for more info on the Dubbed Eps ."
,Teddikilla,2011-12-18T19:33Z,"I thought that the english dub for shippuden was only upto like 101 or 102. 112? How do you get the dubs before they are released? Anyway, good job, thanks alot (: "
,Minato9,2011-12-21T04:18Z,"It may be because the second Naruto Shippuden Movie was released a few weeks ago. And also the new video game is coming out, i guess they dont have much time for the tv series :("
,Ballchinian,2011-12-28T23:45Z,"I gotta say, this torrent is pretty pro"
,Minato9,2012-01-12T07:26Z,Have any of the episodes from Season 6 been aired yet? Like the The Serpent's Pupil? (first episode) If so can you upload those episodes! I cant wait for new Naruto :(
