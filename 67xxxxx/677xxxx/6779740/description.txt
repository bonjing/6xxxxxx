http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1984241/
Subtitles: NL, EN, NL FD
Date: 2011.10

Director: Johan Heldenbergh, Kenneth Taylor

Genres: Drama

Plot:
What started as a crazy wager between friends, ended up as a full movie, created and acted by
the whole population of the friendly Flemish village of Schellebelle. The renowned actor
Heldenbergh (who lives in that village) wrote the scenario and directed, together with the
mayor K. Taylor, who happens to be a professional director. The movie tells the story of the
farming family Van de Velde, in the aftermath of the First World War. The farmer and his son,
who have fought in the trenches of the Yser, are still missing in 1919, and the mother has died,
so the eldest daughter Coralie runs the farm now on her own. She has welcomed 25 orphans during
the war, but the Child Welfare Commission wants to put them in an orphanage. And some local
notables with a sneaky plan want to take possession of the farm. But Coralie and the orphans
fight back...
