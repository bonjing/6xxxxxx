,Godsboy5,2011-11-18T02:30Z,"lkadar,

Thank You! Thank You! Thank You!

Yes, I know you *borrowed* the main upload from ""thethingy"", but you are the very first one who made the install so EASY!

For those who don't know how to load it, lkadar's *read me* file (included in the download) explains it somewhat!

1. Read the read me!
2. Click on ""Adobe Acrobat X (10.1) Pro"" icon to extract the files.
3. Open the folder to where it was extracted.
4. Open the ""Software"" folder.
5. Click on the ""setup"" icon

It automatically put in the key, so that step wasn't needed.

6. After it is installed, go back to the original folder, and click on the ""disable_activation"" icon!

From there you have a FULLY functional copy of Adobe Acrobat 10.1 Pro, and it is also completely safe to update it!!!

Again, THANK YOU!
