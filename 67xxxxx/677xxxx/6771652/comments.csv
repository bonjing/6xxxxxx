,User897,2011-10-26T03:15Z,The timing is unfortunate for Alexandre.  He should have waited until after the Blu-ray travesty for more angry interviews!

,jswalski,2011-11-28T08:55Z,"If you want to download this movie because you're bored, don't. It is absolute garbage, 2 hours of Star Wars fans complaining about what Lucas does with his movies."
,johanneswiberg,2012-04-18T19:35Z,"@jswalski: I'm downloading it despite your comment. Why? Because you wrote ""two hours"" when it's only 92 minutes. Makes me thing you might be hyperbolizing with regards to the content and quality as well as length. You're probably more of a troll than a critic."
