This show, as anyone who has done it knows, does not compress for 
shit. So, to maintain a halfway manageable size for a throw away 
daily talk, we had to reduce crf to 22. (18 and 19 were well over 
2gb.)

PROPER notes- other release is missing the 5th segment at 31:57. Also
instances of bad deinterlacing resulting in choppy and jerky playback.
Here it is at the 60fps it was filmed in, for a much smoother playback
and added depth.
