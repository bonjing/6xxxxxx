,digmax,2011-11-21T21:50Z,"Any fix for the ""side by side configuration"" error. The launcher.exe doesn't exist but launcher.css is there, If you try to change it to launcher.exe it say its not compatible with this version of windows. (Running 64-bit Win7)"
,jasamcar,2011-11-27T23:08Z,"I got a problem starting the game... Actually this torrent is fail... Doesn't WORK!!

Fix or delete this torrent please..."
,banib1,2011-12-05T21:44Z,"For those of you having the dreaded ""side by side configuration"" error, here is how you fix it.

go to google and type in the following to download:

microsoft visual 2005 c++ redistributable x86
microsoft visual 2005 sp1 c++ redistributable x86
microsoft visual 2008 c++ redistributable x86
microsoft visual 2008 sp1 c++ redistributable x86
microsoft visual 2008 ALT c++ redistributable x86
microsoft visual 2010 c++ redistributable x86
microsoft visual 2010 sp1 c++ redistributable x86

if your on a 64-bit system, ALSO get the 64bit versions:
microsoft visual 2005 c++ redistributable x64
microsoft visual 2005 sp1 c++ redistributable x64
microsoft visual 2008 c++ redistributable x64
microsoft visual 2008 sp1 c++ redistributable x64
microsoft visual 2008 ALT c++ redistributable x64
microsoft visual 2010 c++ redistributable x64
microsoft visual 2010 sp1 c++ redistributable x64

FIRST, UNNISTALL ANY AND ALL MICROSOFT VISUAL c++ REDISTRIBUTABLE USING THE CONTROL PANEL.
Then install them in the order i listed. 
Then run windows update. Install all of the updates. 
restart and BAM! problem solved! 
I found this method after many hours of searching and trying it out myself.
No one had the answer, most posts just kept saying its in the FAQ, which it is not.
Working for me and many others :)"
,n1nja198585,2011-12-06T23:19Z,where can i find vcrest. 2008 ALT??????
,n1nja198585,2011-12-07T12:56Z,"@ banib1
i de- n reinstalled all vcred. but still not working!!
i read it uses vcred. 2005....I'm tired of lookin for the right vcr setup....that sux!!!!!!!!!!

Q:there's written start the game by clicking the launcher.exe - i can only see a launcheroffline_en.html?? do u guys have a launcher i don't have?"
,banib1,2011-12-07T13:48Z,"@ n1nja198585

yes it sux but install all of them and windows update is needed. like I sead it worked for me and some other guys i propose this solution.

I am big fan of Cities XL 2011 but this one is NOT worth of the trouble. Seriously when you play it some of the maps, buildings and things are missing. I think this is not the real Cities XL 2012 but upgraded version of 2011 (there is even a splash screen which says 2011xD )
- If you have unlimited internet skip this torrent and download from extremezone or .Dude !
- my net is limited and I regret I downloaded from here, so much trouble for nothing.

,n1nja198585,2012-01-03T15:56Z,"i know some time went by, but for anyone still havin the 'side by side error' by starting  this game, here's the solution: 1st: YOU DONT HAVE TO DEINSTALL THE VCR-PACKAGES!!!!!!! search for EVENTVIEWER in the searchbar, then click on WINDOWS-PROTOCOLS, ->APPLICATIONS, then search for you SIDE-BY-SIDE error->click it->the window below will show you, what version of vc is missing. GOOGLE the version-number , download  install and THERE YOU GO!"
