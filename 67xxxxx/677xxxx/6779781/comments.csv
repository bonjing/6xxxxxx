,redactedwv,2011-10-29T10:19Z,"^ exactly, Hypomanic... lol :)

And speaking of... The cuddly Ms. Rand spent her later years grifting medicare under an assumed name. 

Her reasoning?

If she had to pay those massive medical bills herself, she'd go broke! 

Mmmm... Hypocrisy, steamy and delicious.

,ramikaz,2011-10-29T11:57Z,Ayn Rand was a racist ho and is waaaaay overrated.
,SuperWurm,2011-10-29T13:25Z,"Thanks a lot! I waited for months for this torrent! I was willing to pay a ticket in the local cinema, but for an unknow reason the theaters in mi country don't wanna show this movie. As far as I know the pic is only shown in US cinema's.
I can't wait to check the movie. I read the book years ago and loved it. I don't understand the controversy. I think that the message is very positive. All around me people complain about regulations and politicions. Well that's where the book is about.
All evil comes from goverment, isn't it? Arn't it the politicions who want to shut down the piratebay, because the record companies pay them to do so?
That's where the book about.

It's sad that those right wing religious lunatics from the teabaggers walk away with this book and the movie. As far as I know miss Rand was a radical atheist who didn't suport the Republicans because of the combination of christianity with capitalism. Rand called it in an interview something like pure evil or something like that.

People call her radical, but you have to if you want to make a point against all the people who don't have the guts to think any further."
,redactedwv,2011-10-29T23:48Z,"I imagine your heart is in the right place, SuperWurm, but this line of thinking...

""I think that the message is very positive. All around me people complain about regulations and politicions. Well that's where the book is about. All evil comes from goverment, isn't it?

 ...is so thoroughly convoluted and wrong that i wouldn't even know where to begin a critique. Not every regulation is created equal. In the world we've inherited, 'regulations' (broadly speaking) are what differentiates capitalism from outright feudalism.

Geez.... Just wrote another two paragraphs and they barely scratched the surface. Deleted 'em. 

Reread the book (even people that think the book is swell think this movie is shit.... they removed scads of characters, and reworked the whole story). Reread the book and look into what Rand actually espoused. She, essentially, predicated her vision of the world on the idea that each individual should be flat-out sociopathic in their pursuit of personal enrichment. The strong thrive and survive, the weak starve and die. Social Darwinism.

 If that gels with your worldview (my guess is, that it does not), then Rand is the author for you (though you would have to ditch tpb, as it's philosophy is totally at odds with modern conservative 'thought'). To paraphrase the dude from Princess Bride, 'I do not think this book means what you think it means'.

To quote John Kenneth Galbraith, ""The modern conservative is engaged in one of man's oldest exercises in moral philosophy; that is, the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness.""

^ Rand in a nutshell.


Not trying to be an asshole, and i hope nothing i said offended you, SW. If it offended true Rand acolytes.... Well, one can only hope.

,mule.ear,2011-10-30T20:26Z,"Decent quality audio/video.  TY TvTeam. 

As far as the critique of the movie itself, I haven't seen too many movies that were true to the book, though Lord of the Rings did a pretty good job. 'Atlas' is quite long and fairly complex. My expectations were low, so I got more than I expected.

redactedwv is funny. While I took the book as an exaggerated metaphor, redacted seems to have read it far more literally. He/she sounds like one of the less pleasantly portrayed characters in the book. Maybe that's where the disdain originates. Rest easy, redacted, your moral superiority is clear."
,Torpor,2011-11-01T09:46Z,"@redactedwv - Reminded me again that Princess Bride is an underrated movie with a whole bunch of good stuff, clever dialogues and excellent cast. For those that haven't seen this movie, I recommend it highly. Ah, btw thnx to TvTeam for this one! Sounds intr. enough, so I'll probably need to read the book too, heh."
