                           DESCRiPTiON 

 The Cold War race for nuclear supremacy throughout the 1950s and 1960s, when  
 the US and the Soviet Union locked horns in a battle to build the most        
 powerful atomic bomb. First-hand testimony and modern forensic investigation  
 explores what happened when America's Castle Bravo went out of control,       
 vaporising three small islands in the Pacific testing ground of Bikini Atoll  
 and spreading severe radioactive fallout to nearby inhabited islands, and     
 reveals the story of the Soviets' Tsar bomb, which was six times more powerful
 than Bravo.                                                                   
                                 Enjoy!
