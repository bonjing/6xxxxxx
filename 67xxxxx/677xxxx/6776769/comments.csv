,asc11,2011-10-28T02:07Z,"To the folks who have completed downloading this, or who are doing so, or who are thinking of doing it: AFAIK, unless you can find the missing .rar file elsewhere, all the rest that you can get from this torrent will get you ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE.
If anybody disputes this, let me know, and I may learn something."

,Captain699,2011-10-28T05:10Z,Gees all I posted was missing a rar file. hey nobody is perfect. Give the guy a break if he makes a mistake every so often. He has always been good to me - and others.
,sarsapil,2011-10-28T05:46Z,"Well, let's see if he corrects what he uploaded since I and many others wasted time on something that doesn't work..."
