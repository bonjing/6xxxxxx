    The UK has a fantastically diverse range of produce,       
    yet it seems to be widely ignored in favour of cheaper    
    or more exotic foreign imports. Some of our heritage     
    varieties are genuinely in danger of being lost forever   
    unless they are used once more for cooking and eating.     
    Each episode of the Great British Food Revival sees       
    chefs and foodies champion a different piece of British  
    produce and demonstrate how it can be used in the         
    kitchen.                                                   
                                                              
    Michelin-starred chef and host of Masterchef - The       
    Professionals Michel Roux Jr gets passionate about our    
    heritage pears. Concerned that eighty per cent of the      
    pears we eat are imported, Michel wants to find out       
    what can be done to persuade people to buy British. He   
    also inspires us all to cook with homegrown pears as he   
    prepares a delicious selection of dishes including a       
    fabulous pear souffl.                                    
                                                             
    Veteran food campaigner Clarissa Dickson Wright takes     
    up the plight of British garlic, often not even            
    recognised as being a British-grown ingredient.           
    Clarissa takes us to one of only a handful of garlic     
    farms to discover the amazing taste and range of garlic   
    that is grown in the UK. She digs back through her         
    history books to prove that garlic has a long and         
    illustrious heritage in Britain and to prove her point,  
    she cooks a recipe straight from the medieval court of    
    Richard II.
