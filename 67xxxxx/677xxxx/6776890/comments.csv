Note: There was no changelog so not sure what was fixed."
,Hewash,2011-11-08T15:56Z,"These 2 releases never worked well at all :

 - 1 - THETA 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6776890/Renegade.Ops.v1.0r4.multi6.cracked.READ.NFO-THETA_[ALEX]   *GAME*

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6776895/Renegade.Ops.v1.0r6.update.cracked-THETA_[ALEX]            *UPDATE*

 - 2 - SKIDROW

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6774909/Renegade_Ops-SKIDROW   *GAME*


http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6781743/Renegade.Ops.Update.1-SKIDROW_[ALEX]   *UPDATE*

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6779649/Renegade_Ops-SKIDROW_(fix_only)     *FIX*



and they had allot of false positive viruses report that made me paranoid

I tried to freeze my system with deepfreeze 'n work without protection on them

and YEt .. at Best chances I could play only in the menue of the game then lags freezes comes and mostly crashed 'n black-screens

No matter what I do 'n how I do it.

On my opinion ? avoid those links 'n torrents or try it 'n tell me how it worked nice 'n almost flawless for you


------------------

Yet here is a Good release I found : 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6778621/Renegade_Ops-SKIDROW(fixed)tim225

I installed it 'n copied the content 

I the start, there was no report from my antivirus like the others 

But the game didn't work nice or even not working at all 

so I had to bring an updated patch from Leecherslair called 

Renegade.Ops.Update.2-SKIDROW

and recopied the cracks AND it was amazing flawless game, I played 2 hrs and reached lvl 3

The only time the game lagged was at a mission where u hunt down a fleeing chopper

I believe the lag was caused by the AI's pathing  .. not the crack or anything :)

PS:  update your Direct X with the latest dlls from Microsoft
