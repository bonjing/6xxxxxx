READNFO: This release have a CAM AUDiO
NOTE: Ok, so audio was missing 1st minute of the footage, so the video cut was made here.
And also 3 small cuts during the movie.
Cam was missing ~90 secs in the end, that part was also cut out
[it`s not the VERY end, but just before, so the main conclusion of the movie is still saved!].
Take it or leave it.
