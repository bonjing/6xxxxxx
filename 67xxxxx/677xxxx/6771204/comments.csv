,SuperWurm,2011-10-26T18:57Z,"i hope the trailer isn't one where they added the best parts of the movie together, cause it looks like this could be a very funny movie"
,bc778,2011-10-26T19:50Z,thanks
,kermit321,2011-10-26T19:54Z,The video is awesome but the audio is garbage. But I've been waiting for this one so ill just deal with it. Thanks subha.
,SuperWurm,2011-10-26T22:48Z,"well, just watched it and can say that the trailer is better than the movie!
To make the trailer they just added the best parts of the movie together. The movie is not realy funny. It's like ""Your highnes"" with the same so called comedian. He reminds me of a guy who tells a joke. And afterwards everybody stares at him, so he starts to explain the joke. The same with Danny McBride.
And this Aziz Ansari in combination with Eisenberg wasn't that brilliant. 
I give this movie a 5 because there are worser pictures.

oh, and there's a part missing in the end and the sound is not real good"
