,Dabaz96,2011-10-27T22:00Z,"Amazing quality. If anything, it looks a little dark but I'm more than certain thats the film and not your fault :)"
,thewayisshut,2011-10-28T16:12Z,"I've been downloading this for 49 hours and i've only got 48% complete.  I made the HUGE mistake of upgrading my uTorrent 1.8.5 to 3.0 ....i'll have to install the old version again after this is done downloading (in a few days apparently).  I usually download at 1mpbs - 1.4mbps but this thing is going so slow at like .01mbps right now.  Jurassic Park Trilogy 1080p Blu Ray is going a little faster, but older torrents work fine.  Very frustrating"

,tester852,2011-10-30T18:47Z,"Download speeds are extremely low - only 17% completed after 3 days. I'm sure quality is going to be superb, but if you're not ready to wait a week or so to get the movie - look somewhere else."

,Mercury8215,2011-11-10T06:20Z,"The video is corrupted in a large number of places.  Perhaps my copy got corrupted in download, but I'm not going to download another copy to find out.  I don't recommend this download."
,ironymon,2011-11-10T07:42Z,"wow stupid people, just because your download speed got slower and it happens that you updated your torrent doesn't mean anything, the people don't seed thats all, and you may even get better speed and security using latest torrent software version, what you said made no sense."
,MitsEvX,2011-11-16T19:46Z,Great quality BOZX :) Don't mind those whiners!
,mdh99,2011-12-04T01:15Z,Great quality. Downloaded quick enough. Ignore the stupid people.
,mdh99,2011-12-04T01:18Z,"@rock53.. LOL....

First up, how can the ORIGINAL DIGITAL audio stream be anything other then 10/10!!

Second, if your TV is setup correctly the contrast is fine."
