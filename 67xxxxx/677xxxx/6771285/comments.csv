,burn429,2011-10-26T01:11Z,TRY READING THE INFO it clearly says cam audio
,toughstr,2011-10-26T04:10Z,"Audio 5 / Video 9, pretty like cam audio."
,trecaz,2011-10-26T05:03Z,"missing minutes before end of movie and camera blocked in a few scenes
a - 7
v - 6 (decent where visible and not just cut out at highpoint of movie really..perhaps 2 critical minutes)"

The video is good quality.  The audio has the distinct theater sound (hollow, slight echo) but it is very clear and nothing missing.  There are not sync problems.  Worth the DL unless you are looking for perfect quality."
,zdude555,2011-10-26T16:43Z,Wait for at least LINE audio. This one sucks.

Great video quality for a cam. Audio wasn't great but was tolerable."
