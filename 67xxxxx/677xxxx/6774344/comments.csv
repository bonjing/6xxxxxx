Probably a bad rip, and that's why author stopped seeding it."

,varilthes,2011-10-29T20:54Z,Guys its 2011 how many years of TPB before you get the most basic but important Fact of downloading from TPB; An Up Loader with no skull usually uploads crap and one who is freaking  Anonymous is just a waste of Bandwidth! Plain and Simple.
,awesomealbert,2011-10-30T02:09Z,"will this work with the 15 bucks guitar to usb cable on ebay, or you have to buy the 30 bucks, realtone cable?"
,HawkguyTK,2011-10-31T05:24Z,First off this copy does work and 2nd I belive you have to have the Realtone cable to play this. I ordered a cheap Chinese USB to 1/4 inch guitar cable off ebay which probably won't show up for at least 2 weeks but my buddy bought the Realtone cable which is different because of a small in-line box which you might have to have in order to play the game. If anyone knows of this working without the Realtone cable than please post. Thanx

,SirRudolph,2011-12-13T11:53Z,PC version is out.
,andrew_ryan_2003,2011-12-13T19:46Z,"WTF?! I can't find the PC version anywhere and it was supposed to come out today. I mean I'll wait for a good release or the scene release if they choose to do it, but I don't even think it came out yet. I think it got delayed.... AGAIN! So does anyone know if they're IS a release date. Ubisoft should stop being gay and just give an offical release date, even if that means that they have to delay it at least give us an idea of what's up.... sorry for the trolololol"
,SirRudolph,2011-12-13T20:28Z,"PC version is definitely out. Just not cracked yet I guess. Check walmart.com, its available for order. If youre like me you probably have been checking every few hours here since midnight right? xD"

I've even called Ubisoft and they're all like well sir, we dont know the official release date cause they dont supply us with that information. WHO'S THEY? can you send me a link confirming it came out today cause i've gotten everything from today (Dec. 13 2011) to July of 2013!"
,Morosy,2011-12-14T07:50Z,Sites with it for pre order have it showing as 5/31/2012 (Amazon/Wal-Mart/K-Mart and such).
,SirRudolph,2011-12-14T12:16Z,"Thought I posted a comment, musta blocked me cause the links.
I noticed all the sites you could order were preordering, for the date of May 31, 2012. 
Quite sad."
,noneshere,2011-12-15T22:56Z,"I got the game for xbox 360, but its locked to us only, and pc was moved to may, so if som of you guys can get into their servers and get out the alpha/beta tests for pc i'd send you a cake(for real a 50 $ cake)"
