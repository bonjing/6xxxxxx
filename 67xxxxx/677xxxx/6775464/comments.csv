Further to my previous request I would like you to consider a movie from the same director, named ""Black Cat, White Cat'... also an 8.0 IMDb rating... worth a 1080p BluRay ? Much obliged if you could find it in your heart to consider my requests!"
,soska88,2011-10-27T17:30Z,"thank you, you are amazing."

[this one.... ""Margin Call 2011 RC 720p BluRay x264-FUSiON"" ... must be your 720 source wich by the title and by the sound quality it's an RC=Region C !! ]

Thanks for the effort, but I'll wait for the real BluRay .mkv [Region A or Region B] !!

Cheers anyway for your effort !!

[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-10-28T08:55Z,"I'll check also that one. Thanks.

If there is  a real BluRay [RA or RB] I apologize to you.


But there also is a ""BluRay"" rip     

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6770887/Margin.Call.2011.BluRay.1080p.x264.DTS-LTT 

which is by the sound  quality an RC Rip !!!

That's what happens when the source is not clarified.

Cheers.

,englishdeafcunt,2012-02-23T12:42Z,"Hey YIFI, may I ask what is the source for the subtitles in your uploads? Are they directly ripped from the BD's? I'm deaf and rely on the latter version of english subtitles that displays text for off-screen sounds that are important. These version of subtitles seem to piss off non deaf people though. :s"
