                A Sacred Trust.
                Barnaby and Jones enter the cloistered and
                old-fashioned world of Midsomer Priory after a nun is
                found strangled. Jones visits the local pub, where he
                learns that a woman was seen acting strangely on the
                day of the murder, and that teenagers in the area
                sneak into the priory grounds for romantic liaisons.
                Later, the nuns discover that a valuable silver altar
                set has vanished, then the chaplain is found
                murdered. Can Barnaby and Jones work out the
                connection between the holy orders, the missing
                silver and some African art and uncover the killer?
