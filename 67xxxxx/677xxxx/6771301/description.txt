                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Documentary exploring the murder of Meredith Kercher in Italy four years ago, 
 a crime for which American Amanda Knox and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito
 were recently acquitted, while a third person, Rudy Guede, remains behind     
 bars. The programme reviews the evidence that convicted Knox and Sollecito,   
 features interviews with a forensic scientist and a criminologist, and asks   
 what the acquittal meant for those who have walked free, the Italian justice  
 system and for Meredith's family.
                                              
                                 Enjoy!
