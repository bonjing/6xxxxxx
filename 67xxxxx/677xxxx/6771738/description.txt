On Tuesdayâ€™s Mark Levin show: Mark says that heâ€™s excited for Rick Perryâ€™s tax plan and explains it in detail. All the GOP candidates have great points and are coming up with good proposals. The only people with real ideas about actually helping this economy work for the people are Republicans. Also, Mark says Obama is very lazy and doesnâ€™t work hard. Thereâ€™s not 1 proposal that he has come up with that will create jobs. Finally, Joe Biden complains to the Senate press gallery after his encounter with Jason Mattera, who asked him about his rape reference to describe GOP opposition to Obamaâ€™s jobs bill.
