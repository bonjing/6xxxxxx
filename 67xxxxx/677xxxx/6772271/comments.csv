thanks devs"
,solitaire,2011-10-26T18:08Z,"Thanks for the update!

I was wondering if I needed to patch with v1.0r7 first then v1.0r8 or does this update already include all of them?"
[T],alexisthebest,2011-10-26T20:42Z,"@solitaire
From what i understand, it contains all the updates."

,ZtorkX86,2011-10-30T08:38Z,Works flawlessly. 2 new traps and 2 new magic powers. :)
,utneflyte,2011-10-31T05:18Z,"If you get any errors after applying the patch, like fmod_event.dll or generic error)... 

Make sure you click the ""Browse"" when running the patch, as the default game location shown is wrong.  Well in my install it left out the ""Robot Entertainment"" folder part.

Works good, thanks to uploader group."
