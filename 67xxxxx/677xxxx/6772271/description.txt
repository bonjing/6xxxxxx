- Floor Scorcher: Burn entire waves of complacent enemies with this pop-up flaming surprise.


Changes:

- Fixed a bug for posting to leaderboards
- Fixed a bug for posting to total orc count
- Fixed a bug on the button not going to the nightmare leaderboards
- Fixed a startup issue on machines with multiple video cards. This should help many people with the "Failed to Initialize" issues.

- Fix for the fireball achievement.
- Switch to a hardware cursor to help people with slower machines.
