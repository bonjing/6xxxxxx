,kow626,2011-10-29T20:38Z,how about unrar'ed for future releases?
,ninline,2011-11-19T05:31Z,enough with the whining about rar's.  it takes just a few seconds to extract the show on any computer made after the year 2000.  why do people that leech always find something to complain about when people find the time to give them something for free?  Thanks sceneline for the up.
