This is an ISO image of a CD to repair Windows 2000 registry damage. It is made from stuff that's widely available, but it took me a few tries to get it right. I hope that this will be useful to someone. It MAY also work on Windows XP or 2003. Vista/"7" are not likely to be helped with this.

Procedure to use:

1. Download ISO image with your favorite BitTorrent client.
2. Burn as an IMAGE (not a file!) with a CD burning program. CDRTFE is a great free one.
3. Boot from CD (you may have to press a key at startup or change the BIOS to allow this)
4. Press "R" to repair, then select the Windows installation to repair. You MUST enter a number; simply pressing "Enter" will reboot.
5. Comment on whether or not this worked for you.

I am a technician, and I was hoping to find a pre-built copy of this somewhere, but I couldn't. I hope that I can save someone else the trouble I had to go to.

Here's how I made this, for those who care:
