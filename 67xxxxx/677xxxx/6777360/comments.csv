This is great. What program did you use for ripping from svtplay? Ive been using one but it doesnt work no more. I could really use it."

This torrent is in better format and the text is in the middle rather than in the bottom. Though there still parts in Swedish without subtitles."
,Babyslayer,2012-04-25T20:32Z,*the text is down in the middle rather than on the side.
