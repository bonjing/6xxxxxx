  Wil Anderson is joined by Todd Sampson (Leo Burnett), Russel          
  Howcroft (Y&R Group), Lauren Miller Cilento (Harry M Miller Group)    
  and Stuart Gregor (Liquid Ideas).                                     
                                                                        
  Its that time of the year again. The Melbourne Spring Racing         
  Carnival, the annual PR and clotheshorse race that stops the nation.  
  What does Joan Collins, Sarah Jessica Parker, Dame Nellie Melba,      
  Carson Kressley, Jean Shrimpton and Snoop Dog all have in common?     
  Theyve all have been on the celebrity guest list at Flemington. How  
  much do companies pay for their attendance? What are the              
  responsibilities of a good tent guest? And the question of            
  everyones lips, will Leo, Shane and Liz turn up this season?         
                                                                        
  On the Spin Cycle this week, we look at the marriage of death and     
  publicity.                                                            
                                                                        
  From the World of Advertising and image control, The Renovators will  
  look at Hungry Jacks: new burgers, new slogan, new healthier          
  repositioning. From next year, in NSW it will be mandatory to         
  include kilojoule counts on fast food menus. Last week, Hungry Jacks  
  got in early, the first chain to roll out the changes. Whats the     
  value of that in PR terms? Is it possible to sell the Ultimate        
  Double Whopper, voted the unhealthiest fast food in Australia,        
  alongside plastic cups of raw vegetables?                             
                                                                        
  And on The Pitch, returning to the racing theme, a campaign to        
  convince Australians to ignore the Melbourne Cup.                    
                                                                        
  Braincells Vs sense.
