When someone ups a torrent in rars, it means they don't care if you seed. Nobody expects you to keep two copies just so you can seed. 

So feel free to leech and run. That's the whole purpose of a rar'ed torrent."

Actually, it's so the torrent is downloaded faster. Instead of 10,000 people trying to get one file, it's split into many files to free some of the load. Damn people shouldn't post comments unless they know what they're talking about."
