,djdam,2011-10-29T20:50Z,This runs on 3.41 aswell (cool)
,samlovesu,2011-10-29T23:22Z,"Can someone confirm this works fine with cfw 3.55?
I heard the game freezes if Drake's journal is opened.
Anyway... lots of thanks for the upload ...

... NOW SEED GUYS =}"
,arnes_king,2011-10-30T00:03Z,"@samlovesu 

Yeah it freezes on the journal with this fix, the game update fixes the freeze but then it won't be playable on 3.55 anymore, just wait for a fix for the freeze for 3.55"
,Lan_Long,2011-10-30T07:29Z,"@djdam.. how you install it and played in 3.41..
or maybe your joking:)"

,supahgl00,2011-10-30T21:50Z,"FOR THOSE WANTING TO PLAY ON 3.55!
ive been doing quite alot of digging into this, and while the eboot fix for 3.55/3.41 works in a sense... the game is still impossible to finish... let me explain...when the 3.55/3.41 eboot is applied, the game crashes every time the journal is opened... the fix for this is an official game patch to 1.01 that automatically launches on trying to play. DO NOT INSTALL THAT PATCH. if installed, the game will be unplayable.... however, even with the eboot fix installed for 3.55 or 3.41 respectively, reports are that when you reach level 9, the game freezes at a doorway... So some guy called nu9000 uploaded a workaround savegame to get past the level 9 crash, only to find that the game crashes again on level 11... There is no workaround as yet to get past level 11, so the game is impossible to finish... but if you just wish to have a try, get this torrent, then google the following for the fixes (TPB doesnt like links):
""uncharted 3 eboot fix"" for the eboot for 3.41/3.55, it should be on the ps3hax site

then google: ""nu9000 level 9 fix"" for the savegame workaround at level 9. It will be the first page that google returns, and the link is in the 172nd comment.
i will say again, you will not be able to get past level 11 until a fix for the 1.01 patch is released (if it ever will be)"

The link posted above me is the fix for the freezing journal. From what I've read it makes the game perfectly operational."
