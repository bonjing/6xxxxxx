The Trouble Boys were the brainchild of world-renowned songwriter/singer, session player and ex-Rockpile and Pretenders guitarist Billy Bremner, Ducks Deluxe and Tyla Gang frontman and writer, Sean Tyla and the saxophonist and founder of Sweden's premier rock and roll band, The Refreshments - Micke Finell. They knew they needed Sweden's No.1 power house rhythm section, Nordic drumming legend, Ingemar Dunker and ex-Roxette bass maestro, Tommy Cassemar to make the outfit swing like a donkey's doo-dah. They made the calls and the game was on.

This isn't a fanciful, 'one-off' diversion but a driven, full-blown, long-term venture to which all members are totally committed, despite the demands of other projects they are already involved in. The evidence is clearly defined in their live performances and in the grooves of their debut album, 'Bad Trouble'. With such a veritable haul of silver and gold studio albums, and tours of the world between them, the Trouble Boys are a class act by any standards and a whole lot of trouble when it come to rocking your socks off! Get checked out by your doctor before you go to see them. They are loud and nasty and they rock like a crab boat in a force ten gale - they are the Trouble Boys. (troubleboys.se)
