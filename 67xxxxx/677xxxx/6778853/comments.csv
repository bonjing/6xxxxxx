,banukaknight,2011-11-01T10:35Z,"thanks for the rip.. 
great Q
1+ 4 the effort...

(personal idea... it would hv been cute if u used 400mb & did a 720 x 304 resolution rip... but this is good enough i think :))

hope for the best in future...

P.S.
would u be interested in producing a DVDSCR rip of Ra.One movie... ? (under 500mb...)"
[V],AliBaloch,2011-11-01T11:33Z,@banukaknight i was already try DDR rip but i was not satisfy from out put rip coz DDR Rip was not gud as much as we expect so i will w8 for DvDRip n surely i will do in small size when out...

I had to convert it from Mkv to avi for a cd I don't have a DVD burner so u can understand the hassle I have fitting a 2 hour movie onto a single CD-R. I use other software similar to yours. looks good on the Tv considering how small the file is. couldn't of hoped for anything better. thanks again again keep up the  great work.

My avg. internet speed is 12kbps, so you could understand with how much difficulty I would have downloaded this movie.
