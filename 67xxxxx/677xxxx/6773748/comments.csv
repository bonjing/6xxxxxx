[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-26T21:37Z,"Batman's biggest power over criminals is Fear. This comic plays with the notion of what would happen if that fear was removed. However, This comic seems to be quite a mess and more like a Red Lantern Comic with blood flying everywhere and barely any story. I did enjoy seeing the bat family getting involved. Is it really too much to ask DC to focus on story and character and not just bright color and action - Im asking too much arent I?"
