This is not the Full game install, this is the file you need to avoid the FFXI update within the game.


Instructions:

step 1: download or install FFXI and playonline viewer from my other torrent or from your own disc.
step 2: download this torrent.
step 3: extract files 
step 4: go to your FFXI folder under playonline in your program files paste new folder in where the old one is. Computer will ask you to replace all the files click yes.
step 5: when finished replacing open playonline viewer and check files both FFXI and playonline.
step 6: start game and update normally (update should now be 3-4 minutes)



Thank you and enjoy
