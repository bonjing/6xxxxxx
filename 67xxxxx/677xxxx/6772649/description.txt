Restore the memory of a magical kingdom in this exciting twist on solitaire from the creators of Charm Tale. Armed with only a deck of cards, itâ€™s up to you to bring the fantasy land back to life. Arrange classic playing cards on the board following one simple rule: place cards next to another one with a value of one less or one greater, regardless of the suit. Itâ€™s easy to learn and play, but saving the day is another matter altogether.
