It is difficult to do justice to this wonderful and well-written book in a few paragraphs. Ambitious in scope, it attempts to provide an insight into all the main societies that existed in the Western hemisphere, prior to the European invasion, and the major academic debates surrounding them. Remarkably enough, it succeeds in this mammoth task, as it unfolds a vast and vivid panorama of cultures and civilizations before the reader. From the disciplined and productive planned economy of the Incas, to the lush, thriving, garden cities of the Mayas, from the blazing forests of North America to the terraformed jungles of the Amazon, Mann depicts and describes a world teeming with human energy and expertise. Which makes its sudden death and swift destruction by Christian settlers and European diseases, all the more painful to behold.



The book commences by challenging the conventional views regarding the New World as a land sparsely populated by primitives, or not inhabited at all, (what the historian William Appleman Williams termed 'The Myth of Empty Continents'.) Mann demonstrates not only why these assumptions are erroneous, but also how they were made in the first place, thus reinforcing the strength of his critique of 'Holmberg's Mistake.'



Mann goes on to consider the most tragic aspect of the Western hemisphere's history - the extensive devastation and, in some cases, wholesale annihilation, of its main communities by diseases and colonists from Europe. Mann's contribution here is primarily to provide an idea of the scale of the catastrophe: the massive mortality rates from smallpox and other maladies, and the critical damage they inflicted on the social and political structures of the vulnerable populations. Weakened by disease and internal schisms, these nations fell prey to the Occidental invaders. The rest is history.



From the death of civilizations, the focus shifts to their birth and lifetime. Mann skilfully surveys the archaeological controversies raging over the first human inhabitants of the Western hemisphere, and the tendentious theories about how men first arrived there. He proceeds to carefully analyse the maize-based cultures of Central and South America, then turns his attention from the agricultural base to the cultural superstructure. The varied achievements of the Olmecs, Mixtecs, and Mayas are elucidated, and then followed by a descriptive narrative of the various Peruvian and other South American societies. The latter are much less renowned than the former, and the book does well to highlight their aims and accomplishments.



The penultimate section of Mann's work is perhaps the most controversial, and certainly the most astonishing. Mann demonstrates that much of the environment of the Western hemisphere (notably in North America and the Amazon rainforest) had actually been shaped, moulded and formed by human agency - and that the decimation of the people in charge of the land, led to the transformation of the landscape into the pristine forests which were mistaken by Europeans as a primordial wilderness, untouched by man. As Mann convincingly argues, this wilderness was actually artificial - a consequence of the massive depopulation of the societies which had previously kept the countryside under control. Such a view contradicts not only the colonial perspective, but also the beliefs of many environmentalists - hence its controversial nature.



Mann ends his masterpiece on a positive note, by linking the liberal and democratic ideals of today to their antecedents in the practice of native American societies, (as did Jerry Mander, in his 'In The Absence of the Sacred.') Though not without its merits, such an analysis inadvertently connects the New World's natives with corrupt American democracy, and its concomitant attributes of decadence and disorder - hardly a compliment. Perhaps a more fitting tribute to the ancient peoples, wo "

Not a problem, I'm just happy that the book was suggested because it's right up my alley.  And thanks for posting the review on the sugar barons torrent. "
