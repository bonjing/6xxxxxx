,callie_222,2011-10-28T12:11Z,"thx - but why do you zip those files?

Now i have to DL all but need only a third - stupid"
,tgrh,2011-10-31T01:53Z,"I apologize for any inconvenience with it being a zip. I'm not around a high-speed internet connection too often so getting the torrent off the ground to seed would take me even longer if I hadn't zipped it. This way it was able to upload fast and I was able to seed more than I would have otherwise.

Enjoy

I apologize again for the inconvenience "

I guess callie_222 needs to suck it up and quit complaining about downloading free ebooks...talk about stupid! callie_222 should buy all the ebooks that he/she wants from the collection you uploaded....maybe then he/she wouldn't whine about it so much...maybe..."
,Phoovercat,2012-01-27T01:31Z,"Great selection - exactly the bunch of series I am making my way through!  And agreed - if you are getting something for free, be a little more grateful!  Thank you!"
,Degru,2012-05-31T01:39Z,"I have a huge collection of about 4GB of ebooks, but I've gotten in trouble for seeding with my ISP in the past. Will it help to compress it into a RAR?"
