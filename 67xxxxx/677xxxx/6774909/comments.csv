The game was super easy to install for me. "
,AnonymousBasterd,2011-10-29T06:49Z,Confirmed! The Setup was infected or a Nasty Virus was embedded to the Setup.exe which simultaneously opens with taskmgr.exe that will ask admin permission which installs one of the most sophisticated virus Rootkit.ZeroAccess. It'll infect your TCP/IP and disables your firewall. BE WARNED! Just don't let the taskmgr.exe have the admin rights -- Choose NO.

           MODS PLEASE REMOVE THIS TORRENT"
,RonDelgen,2011-10-30T05:26Z,"I'm not sure if it's a virus per say, but it does install something that if you say Yes to when it runs TaskMngr, it turns off the firewall then does something that makes all your google results redirect to some random sites.

,g0dsize,2011-10-30T19:38Z,"@ohos -- my own antivirus didn't detect it when scanning the setup.exe.  That does not mean there isn't a virus in the setup.  My AV picked it up when it was installing consvr.dll to the windows\system32 folder.  After aborting the install on my gaming PC, I installed it on a test PC, and again both my spyware app and AV didn't pick it up until setup.exe installed consvr.dll to windows\system32.  Upon rebooting, I could no longer connect to the network with the test PC and the firewall was disabled.  At that point I began getting nonstop warnings from my AV and spyware apps that the PC was infected, and subsequent efforts to remove the virus failed.  

This is definitely not a false positive."

,RonDelgen,2011-10-30T23:27Z,"If it matters this is the first piratebay download I've had that was actually infected. Wasn't too hard to remove, but can still be a pain.

,Nobody1979,2011-10-30T23:38Z,"Well I dont know why people write some of these comments, or have had virus issues installing this but i can confirm it is clean via mse (Microsoft Security Essentials) fully updated, both the files in the torrent, what is installed to the Sega folder after the game is installed via the iso, and also once the cracks are applied. I also took the liberty of playing the game, which works great if you have a dx10 graphics card, and then performing a custom scan on Windows/System32....surprise surprise....no virus.
  For the record I had nothing that popped up asking for permission to taskmanager or anything else, the only pop up I got was asking me whether i let the game have access to the internet; and as this is not a release i am going to play online i declined. The game booted up fine, and is great fun. Once again Extremezone, a perfect upload. If you noobs cant come up with a thankyou or something constructive with backup evidence of these ""viruses"".....Fuck off. To everyone else enjoy the game. "

THIS TORRENT IS CLEAN - no doubt so do not take those comments as trustfull as people who rote dem are NOT trusted members of ThePirateBay .

My only problem so far is not being able to configure the pad (similar to PS2 gamepad) as it seems only the Xcube one works on it , - mine doesn't so worthless to play this with keyboard .

I wanted to give it a try for my son of 9 which is more appropriate when yuh are this age .

Would the people with above comments aged of 9 ? not sure i'll doubt 'bout dat.

TORRENT s clean , PS1/2 pad not working and no change possible to configure dem.

+ as well I HAD this black screen problem when i first ran the gam , i ve downloaded the DXGI.DLL and it worked straight away . to copy/paste into instal folder at the same place where yuh copy/paste the crack and steam dll .

It's not actually in the installer exe itself but in the setup bins which where the Setup installer extracts the files to be installed. Didn't I say in my previous post the VIRUS (Rootkit.ZeroAccess) is ONE OF THE MOST SOPHISTICATED VIRUS that is good at hiding and sneaking on your system. It infects your DRIVERS! Disables your Anti-Virus and Firewall, Infects & messes up your TCP/IP and blocks Anti-Virus/Malware Sites."

,AnonymousBasterd,2011-11-02T14:08Z,More worse is why does it infect your TCP/IP and disables your firewall? Well obviously to download more malware/virus to heavily infect your system. The most vulnerable ones are with 32-bit systems.

It adapts to what kind of system you have. Since the Uber Noob Nobody1979 can't even read what kind of 'other' virus was found on the screenshots obviously from the ""TRAINERS"", ""CRACKS"" and ""KEYGENS"" (OBVIOUSLY, The so called False Positive Malwares). *Sigh, I can't believe I'm wasting my time with this noob.

and they had allot of false positive viruses report that made me paranoid

I tried to freeze my system with deepfreeze 'n work without protection on them

and YEt .. at Best chances I could play only in the menue of the game then lags freezes comes and mostly crashed 'n black-screens

No matter what I do 'n how I do it.

On my opinion ? avoid those links 'n torrents or try it 'n tell me how it worked nice 'n almost flawless for you


------------------

Yet here is a Good release I found : 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6778621/Renegade_Ops-SKIDROW(fixed)tim225

I installed it 'n copied the content 

I the start, there was no report from my antivirus like the others 

But the game didn't work nice or even not working at all 

so I had to bring an updated patch from Leecherslair called 

Renegade.Ops.Update.2-SKIDROW

and recopied the cracks AND it was amazing flawless game, I played 2 hrs and reached lvl 3

The only time the game lagged was at a mission where u hunt down a fleeing chopper

I believe the lag was caused by the AI's pathing  .. not the crack or anything :)
