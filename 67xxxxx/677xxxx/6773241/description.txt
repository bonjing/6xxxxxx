Habemus Papam_[We Have a Pope](EngSubs,DVDrip)2011
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1456472

I made this rip with Italian sound and burned-in English subtitles for people who are curious about the film and do not want to download over 4 Gigabytes.

Italian comedy about the election of a Pope. Premiered at The Cannes Film Festival last May, to much critical acclaim. The film is still playing in the cinemas in many countries, and it's rare that we get a proper DVD uploaded this early.

Widescreen, DVDrip XviD 2-pass 720x384, good stereo sound AC3.
Synch tested, runs well in both my standalone DivX players.
