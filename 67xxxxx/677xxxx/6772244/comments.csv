,Ricky-k,2012-02-08T17:40Z,"Just downloaded this torrent yesterday, and immediately received the letter below from ""Osama Hussain"".  Based on the name, this may be a joke (why not ""Saddam Bin Laden"" or ""Adolf Stalin"").  Or, this might be a flagged torrent...  Maybe I just need to take better precautions...
