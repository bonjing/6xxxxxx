I've downloaded your ""Battlefield 3.Multi 9.FULL DVD.UNLOCKED Direct Play"" torrent. Initially there was some problem as the Key Mapping was not visible and things. So I downloaded the extra files, like language files, missing files and update...... But the problem is that the Audio lags like hell..... It makes the game unplayable. I checked it out in the Battlefield Forums and lots of the guys who brought the game has the same problem too. 

My request to you is that as soon as the EA and Dice guys release the updates containing the fix for this dang problem, could you plz make sure that the update is available for us, here in piratebay too??? 

Thank you for your great work and keep on going! Meanwhile I am leaving my Sys specs. plz tell me what can I do to fix this problem. I have all my drivers upto date and everything is fine at most I think.....

Worked for me 100% on (win 7 32bit , nvidia 9500 GT 1 Giga , 2 Giga RAM and CPU 3 GH Dual Core )


Battlefield 3 Double Sound Echo Fix By Dr Ali Aliraqi


Before you begin and load your mission (on Game Menu)

Press Alt + Tab then Task Manager then rigth click on BF3.exe then Set Affinity

after that unselect CPU 1 ( Select only CPU 0 )

you will notice that  double sound or sound echo disapear ...

But you will notice also that game will become slower (because only one CPU of dual core CPU worked) so you needed to reduce resolution ...


Note :Few Seconds after loading and beginning your mission you can reselect CPU 1 with CPU 0 and game will become faster ...

But But But double sound or echo reapear when new loading regain (loading regain when you kill or begin next mission etc ... ) ...


So Conclusion : Dual Core CPU is main cause of double sound or echo ...


So we are waiting  computer supporter that make patch or installer or anything for : ( battlefield 3 begin with single core CPU and converted to dual core 
CPU automatically few seconds after loading complete and when new loading reapear it converted to single core CPU automatically and it converted to dual core
CPU automatically few seconds after loading complete )   

It is so difficult but we are needing that ...

,shoppy22,2011-10-31T17:27Z,okay!the problem of the sound lag happens almost to all duo core processors!higher processers dont face this lag.dual core and core 2 duo need fixes!just returned from a friends plc after watching the game on ultra settings..i feel like a bitch!:(
,dashingguyof2k,2011-11-01T17:25Z,"hehe couldn't control so ended the game few minutes ago on medium n sometimes auto settings but at 800x600 resolution and sometime just one above it on the 1024 something. It didn't voice lagged just like 1-2 times while playing game thru out. I used the best performance settings in my computer and used a free software after like 60-70% game completion 'game booster 3' it helped abit .. Still highly appritiate gt220 my card gave its best n didnt disappointed me totally, saved like alotta bucks to buy a better graphic card later, else i could have bought a graphic card lower than gtx560, but now ill go for it in coming time lol"
,shoppy22,2011-11-01T20:38Z,"@dashingguyof2k

m following ur footsteps!!:P me too lowered the resolution to least and then applied ultra settings!!roflmao!!:D almost no sound lag!me too planning for a gtx560 :)"
,raghuveerdayatri,2011-11-01T20:40Z,guys i am facing sound echo problem when i fire it resounds several times...i guess its directx problem..because black box provided directx 9 but game requires directx 10...so guys can anyone plz say me where and how to download directx 10..my os is windows 7 ultimate 32bit...any help plz
,apple016,2011-11-02T11:30Z,"@dashingguyof2k 
i have duo core 2 e7500 2.93 mhz 4 gb ramm msi cyclone 2 550ti  and running this game on ultra with no lagg or any issue .so may be(but im sure dunno abt other)and i think that only buying new gpu will solve ur problem.becoz my frnd also have same card as u do and he is also facing same problem.so mate good luck"

,dashingguyof2k,2011-11-02T17:48Z,"@ raghuveerdayatri do this to check ur directx version : Go to the Windows START Menu. 
Select RUN or Command Prompt. 
Type dxdiag and click OK.
n u would see u mite already have directx 11 installed, its ur graphic card problem dude many are already talking about it read other comments too damit!!

@shoppy22 gr8 job bro, i ended the game mins ago i posted that previous post. Now waitin for batman arkham city now lets see if i would manage to buy gtx560 and play on it or again the same way as we played bf3 ;)

@apple016 i am also certain that its the graphic card i should only change for now so gatherin few bucks to straight away buy gtx560 nutthin lower than that and very much later when needed will upgrade my cpu n motherboard :) cheers!"
,shoppy22,2011-11-02T20:55Z,"@dashingguyof2k

i dont think MW3 or ARKHAM CITY r going to cause so much trouble..dfntly wont get the best settings in the two but surely there will be far better results than BF3! cheers!:)"
