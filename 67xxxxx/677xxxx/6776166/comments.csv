,novalite,2011-10-29T18:50Z,"Is this just update?
Cuz i extracted files but cant find it ingame"
,zzw1983,2011-10-29T23:13Z,novalite: It would be best if you install the complete pack first then upgrade it with this. You're not seeing anything in game cause you don't have scenarios for it? If you have the Glasgow Airport rail link route you should have some scenarios.

,novalite,2011-10-30T12:16Z,"Thnx for the response m8.
