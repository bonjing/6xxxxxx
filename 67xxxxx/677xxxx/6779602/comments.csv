If you need SMALL files and dont care anything about the way it sounds, why not 8kbs??

,audiobookman,2011-10-30T12:02Z,"download and listen to the quailty before making comments, the original files are 32kbs - you gain nothing from upping the bitrate other than larger file size.
i can easly make these files into 1.5gb monsters to download and people would say make it smaller.
the quality is tested over many years by myself and a small group on a private forum - this technique worked the best and gave excellent files sizes to boot.
for crying out loud its spoken word, not music!! 
i now remember why i stopped sharing my files here"
