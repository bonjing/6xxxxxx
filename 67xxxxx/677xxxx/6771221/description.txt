Video Thumbnails Maker allows you to make thumbnails (caps, previews, screen-lists) and screenshots of video files. The utility can be used for home-video cataloging and for network video sharing support. 

Video Thumbnails Maker is coming with its own Viewer! The main advantage of the Viewer is the ability to start the related video-file right from the Viewer! The process is automatic in activated version. In usual version you can set the link between the picture and the video-file manually within the Viewer. 

Changelog 

- [MD5] tag in "Comment" section now calculates MD5 hash string for entire video-file (slow for big files!). 
- A few cosmetic changes. 
- Fixed a bug when VTM fails to cancel downloading of the latest version of the program. 
- Fixed a bug when VTM fails to process certain "Specific time" values.
