Description: 
It\'s the largest and most ambitious habitat recreation 
project ever known: to bring back to life one of the world\'s 
greatest marshlands. And it\'s happening in Iraq. 
Considered to be the original Garden of Eden the marshes 
were once Iraq\'s wildlife jewel where man and nature 
thrived for 5000 years. But in the 1990s Saddam Hussein 
drained these gigantic wetlands and turned them into a 
desert destroying a home to thousands of people and 
millions of birds. Donning his body armour filmmaker 
David Johnson travels to the Mesopotamian Marshes to 
follow the work of Azzam Alwash the visionary Iraqi 
engineer at the centre of this extraordinary scheme to 
re-flood hundreds of miles of desert and bring back life to 
the sands. This is a view of Iraq the world never sees a 
world of huge reed beds and vast flocks of birds that fill 
the sky. But nothing ever quite goes to plan in Iraq.
