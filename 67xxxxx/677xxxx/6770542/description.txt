History Documentary hosted by Jeremy Linton-Mann, published by WingCo Pictures in 2005 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Soon after the advent of powered flight in 1903, the new flying machines were adapted to take to the air from sheltered waters. Then followed a golden era during which flying boats were employed for short distance military and commercial purposes, and then for the new fast carriage of mail and passengers between Sydney's Rose Bay and Southampton, England.

Then, after 50 years of sterling service, international flying boats disappeared the world over, superceded by more economical and pressurised landplanes.

'From Sea To Sky' covers the period from pilots in the open with leather helmets and goggles, to the flying boat squadrons of WW2, and up to the end of the era with the completion of the Lord Howe Island Sandringham service. Many significant archive scenes are showcased, and very colourful insights are provided by aircrews, groundcrews and passengers.
