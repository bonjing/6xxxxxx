,faely,2011-10-29T20:57Z,and both movies are different too
,Chadly,2011-10-29T23:55Z,"RUMDIARY.TK is not HD, just a cam. does work tho :) Straight stream from site no downloading, for any who dont mind watching on a comp screen. It is watchable...."
,skyr35,2011-10-30T01:53Z,you guys are fucking weak i got a gaming quad core with  a 60 inch flat screen 3d up conversion and true 7.1 sourround sound  pc monitor u idiots !
,skyr35,2011-10-30T01:55Z,get your shit right no body should be watching on a pc monitor   come on go spend the money believe me it is worth it
,av5498,2011-10-30T04:36Z,"@skyr35 some of us have lives that don't require ridiculously overpriced and soon to be outdated technology just to enjoy a movie. My xbox 360, hdtv, and 2005 vista laptop do the same thing minus the headache of 3d..."
,AgentClaret,2011-10-30T15:56Z,Skyr35 is an idiot. He probably got his whole rig just to watch internet porn.
,kimo_egy,2011-10-30T18:08Z,"As compared to DVDrip A/V is 5/5
As compared to CAMs A/V is 7/8"
,kimo_egy,2011-10-30T18:28Z,the Dark scenes are not that good

,CHULINSNACKY,2011-11-08T05:05Z,If the picture is dark you can always fix it with the vlc. It looked good to me after fixing the video. Good luck everyone and thank you very much Bone and great job. Can't complain when its free and Bone takes his time to get movies ready for us to watch. :)
,DreaD151,2011-11-08T16:13Z,"I am a huge fan of Hunter too  majestika and it is sad that he killed his self what a waste of talent and a Figure of our time that impacted our culture like no one else did....... johnny depp is a killer actor thanks bone for the torr. it is dark but i will deal with it $100,000 dollar flat screen or not its better than payin g $13 and having a cop interupt the movie ten times hollering and waving a flashlight ........"
,DreaD151,2011-11-08T16:36Z,okay  here is a good one ...... a movie called Popcorn it came out in the eighties i think  it was a cool horror flick lets see somebody make a good xvid outta this one and see how good the quality ends up being  I think betamax or vhs is the only source for this bad boy .... it would prove whos editing skills where the best to have a good copy of this on pb........only in xvid though no mp4 or matroska bull shit
,HydroLion,2011-11-10T02:46Z,anyone know the resolution on this??

,Yokohama50,2011-12-03T01:44Z,lame ass CAM watchers coming together to suck eachothers dicks in internet...fuck you assholes
,SomeRandomName,2012-01-12T23:33Z,"@skyr35 stfu, even if a piece of shit like you could get a wife, shes banging someone else right now, your going to die alone. enjoy"
,DrNcan,2012-01-14T01:45Z,"sky35, i got a sweet set up too. but i realise society is not fair and we live in a class system. so kindly fuck off and quit rubbing it in to other peoples faces of how you were born in a first world nation in middle to upper class."
,volwave,2012-01-14T19:44Z,Have you record that with a mobile phone camera? What the hell I was disappointed.
