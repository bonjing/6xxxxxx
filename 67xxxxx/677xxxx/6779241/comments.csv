Anyone knows a solution to this? Kinda hard to google it, my Chinese isn't that good."

,deltix1,2011-10-31T20:10Z,"For those who had problems installing it correctly on win7 x64.
Run the setup as administrator, and later change the trine2.exe properties and start as admin, save the settings and you should be ok to run the beta version."
