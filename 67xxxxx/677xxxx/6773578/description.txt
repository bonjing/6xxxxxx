this the new updated version of Nero 11 HD Platinum-Multilangual v 11.0.10800.
this is still the ESD retail version as only downloadable anyway.
I don't have any changelog about this new version.
Guess it should resolve few problems or bugs and fix some of them aswell anyway.
As most of you uses this last one as patched,cracked or else,this is your only 
chance to get this new one by the fact you cannot update your old version
to this new one with a blacklisted key aswell anyway :s
Unfortunately i don't have better serials for you now :(
This serial has been too used even for register something else like Nero 11 HD Platinum,And then,the problem will still be the same : Kwik Media will not work anymore.
again due to this over used serial anyway.
So you just have to decide if you want to update or not,that's all !
You are not forced to update and i don't force you to do it aswell.
however fortunately all other programs should still work,of course !
if you will update to this new version,please,don't forget to repatch
with iOTA application afterwards.
We need a serious solid cracker like VDown & BetaMaster to bypass this damn patent activation and get more serials ;
What about them ? still alive ?
Btw,i'm still looking for another new better patch and new serials also.
But it is still quite hard to get better anyway :/

Enjoy
