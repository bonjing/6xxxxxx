[T],Tyr3ll,2011-11-01T07:08Z,"@pcarolan :
you are not and i don't judge anyway.
GRAB IT FROM HERE :

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6734214/Nero.Platinum.HD.v11.0.15500.patch.only-iOTA.rar

(includes serial for installation and after all,use the patch as ""admin"" anyway""
STAY OFFLINE since starting installation and after rebooting till finishing to install nero and even patching this last one.
gl,if you need more help,let me know.
HAVE A NICE DAY AND REGARDS"

,Arachne,2011-11-07T22:02Z,This worked like a charm.  Thanks so much.  SEEDING!  :-)
,pirbay1958,2011-11-22T08:21Z,"SERIAL IS INVALID

Thanks to uploader for effort but does not work. The installer loads heaps of Windows (system) folders PRIOR to commencing Nero.The Nero installer asks for serial and returns invalid for both serial numbers tried (downloaded with ""patch"" and other displayed at Patch download page in comments).The install fails leaving you with uneccessary Windows junk installed. This was performed on fresh (now not so fresh) Win7 install and all offline. THE KEYS ARE NOT WORKING FOR INSTALL."
,pirbay1958,2011-11-22T13:20Z,"APOLOGIES,DISREGARD LAST POST

Serial Does work.I re-downloaded and now works (perhaps original dload got corrupted?)"
