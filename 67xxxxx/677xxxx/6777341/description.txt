So this has been my project for the last few weeks. I've noticed that at times, watching A Very Potter Musical is difficult to do, because sometimes you can't really hear what the person is saying, or it might get covered by the audience noises, etc.  So what I did was I decided to make English subtitles for people who have the same problem as me and want to hear exactly what each character is saying. I've checked my subs like 5-6 times each and I can assure you they are as accurate as possible. There aren't any misheard lines, spelling errors, or grammatical errors as far as I know.

This file contains the musical split up in all the same parts that they were originally in on youtube, including act 1 and 2. It's not one combined video (I had trouble enough trying to get them as high quality as possible). The quality is pretty much the same as how you would watch it on youtube, which is the best they can be at the moment. I used Aegisub to create the text. Subs are in Arial white font at the bottom.

You can see for yourself how they look like. I've uploaded them all onto youtube.
My youtube channel is VeryPotterSubtitles. All the parts are over there.
Hopefully you'll enjoy them. This is my first torrent ever.
