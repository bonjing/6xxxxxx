[T],thetorrentlord,2011-10-28T17:33Z,Thanks for all your uploads. Always nice to welcome new 720p uploaders here. Per some of the comments you have received  in your earlier posts I used to use Demonoid but they tended to not do 720p so I haven't been there in quite a while. IMHO i prefer here for all my torrents unless it can't be found here. Even on my uploads the hit and run so you just accept it as the norm for public sites. Just like the people who complain and have never uploaded any thing. Hope you continue to upload here. I know I for one would be thankful.
[T],thetorrentlord,2011-10-28T22:55Z,Finally got around to checking and the quality is excellent.  These appear to be Blu-Ray rips. If so you should take credit for that and indicate that fact in your title and in your info. Once again thanks for all the work and for sharing here at the best torrent site on the planet. If you have any personal requests please post them on my latest post.
,cat3333,2011-10-31T23:15Z,"Thanks!  I don't know about the BRay source as I just downloaded them myself... (but pretty sure they are).  Glad you like the quality... I was pretty fussy about that when I chose to download them as it is one of my FAV shows and I wanted a GOOD QUALITY copy of all the episodes/ seasons.  I only had trouble finding top shelf copies on seasons 6,7, and 8... which I now have almost all of season 8 in 720p... and have ""good"" copies (not the 350MB size ones in other words) of the others for those seasons.   Still looking though (found 480p for season 6) have not downloaded it yet though.... want 720p... lol  If you have any episodes in 720p for those couple seasons....  that would be great....
Enjoy! (you should try some private sites... no H&R... well mostly...lol ... AND WOW FAST!!!!!)"
