The Scream was reissued in the UK 27 October 2005 (28 October in the USA) as part of Universal's Deluxe Edition series. The new edition featured a remastered version of the album on the first disc, while the second disc contained demo and live tracks together with the singles from that period.

A first single disc edition was edited in 2006 with a noticeable digital distortion: so, a flawless remastered version was reissued in 2007.
