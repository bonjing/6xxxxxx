,titan.reign,2011-10-28T06:40Z,"It's real, the filename is what windows media center split the skit names with, I just copied/pasted the name. No skull just wanted to pust something I knew would be appreciated. I think alot of people are going to ask why it's in 4:3. If they do I'll upload another one in 720x480. 1000 Peers and 60 seeds in an hour. Booyah!"

,scothuman,2011-10-28T20:15Z,"@titan:  I do give you a lot of credit, as you got the episode up first.  So I don't mean this to be a dick, but just so other people know:

I DL'd this copy and eztv's SDTV version.  Almost the first 30 secs. are cut off from the beginning on this copy, and the video quality is much worse despite file size being 2x as much.

eztv's is 4:3 as well -- did this air in that aspect ratio?"
,titan.reign,2011-10-29T02:13Z,"@scothuman - Nothing wrong with constructive criticism. I see the file size is like half this on eztv's. I'll grab theirs and see what bitrates, codec and resolution they used. If I do any more uploads I'll make sure they're closer to something along those lines. I'm looking into why my media center has been missing the first few secs too. Its not like I get a lot of epic programming to share tho. Just basic cable which delivers a new show like once a week, then plays it over and over... As for the 4:3 I think it depends on the tuner card/device that is doing the capturing."
