Do you remember watching with amazement when those cartoon heroes constructed machines to catch someone or start something?

Well, the answer is here! Build monkey or mouse-powered machines, use lasers and fireworks, start fires using a bowling ball and flint, throw things with anti-gravity platforms or a jack-in-the-box or crack open an aquarium with a cat, mouse, alligator, cannon, cheese and more!
