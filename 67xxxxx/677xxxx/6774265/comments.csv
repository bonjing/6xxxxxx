I like this upload much, all themes are great but except the one which is black art i think,it is very dark and sharp so i dont like it. And also the Windows setup was untouching, it was going next next automatically which is great too. Its giving me the 30 days trail activation, you have given the crack but it think it is a virus cuz its only one file, so i didnt run it,plz tell me how  to activate it.. plz plz plz tel me is it or not a legit crack???"

Wsalam! Thanx for your comment. The crack is totally legit and is virus free. It works, you just have to double click it and the a registry will prompt , you will Click Yes and then Ok. Thats all. "
,engutkaa,2011-10-28T18:32Z,"and one question more, when windows installation is finished, it shows two users 1 is Khannies and 2 is Owner. I want simple login and want to automatically login. Bcoz when i leave Pc on and expect that it will turn on automatically but it stops on welcome screen and want me to click on a user , then after that windows run. :(

,khannies3,2011-12-20T23:29Z,"@Tha_14: sorry for late answer well i dont know why such things come in your way during installing sometime it happens and it causes many reasons like you didnt burn your cd proper or either you are using cd with low quality like from china so it could happen 
but dont worry you can burn it again with good quality cd
