Eighty percent of "Deeper" was recorded in September of 2009. But when JJ's song "Your Hands," from her 2008 album, "Painted Red," started gaining radio spins in October 2009, the release of "Deeper" was delayed.

In August of 2010 several songs from "Deeper" were re-tracked in a more polished style for a record that came to be known as "When I'm With You." JJ always had plans to eventually release the songs in their original form.

"Deeper" features five acoustic versions of songs from "When I'm With You," four unreleased tracks from the original 2009 recording session and three new songs that were recorded in May of 2011. The record focuses on JJ's vocals more than any of her previous projects.
