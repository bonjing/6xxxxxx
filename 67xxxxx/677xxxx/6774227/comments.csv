,awitham0,2012-02-19T22:04Z,"Thank you for this fantastic torrent. I was so happy when I finally found this. I was astounded that this great show had no other decent(HD) torrents. I love this show but getting it onto my pc has been a pain. XBOX died so that was a no go. I'd really appreciate it if you could also upload the 2nd and third season in HD. 

Once again, THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!"
,bro1010,2012-02-20T03:24Z,If you could upload Season 2 & 3 in HD that would be greatly appreciated it!
,Vicar in a Tutu,2012-03-21T18:40Z,"Yes, PLEEEEASE upload S02+3 in HD!

I have S01-S04 as DVDRip's (by DEiMOS and SPRiNTER) but would like 720p/1080p versions where possible. Also, if your iTunes S01 is better quality (MKV? higher bitrate?) than the XviD AVI's I have, then please upload those too. I have no problem with helping to seed.

Thanks!"

Use JDownloader to download the YouTube episodes when they become available."
