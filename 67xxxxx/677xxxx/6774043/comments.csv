,BoonesFerry,2011-10-27T04:36Z,Thank you. 
,spevman,2011-10-27T06:58Z,"You might try Pazera MP4 to AVI converter.  Its free and works well.

Also, this file is only 13 frames per second, so while the picture is clear, the video is jumpy/jerky.  You should try to use at least 13 frames per second when you convert for a smoother playback. I suspect the previous file you talk about that was deleted had a higher fps count as it was 63 MB bigger at 405 MB.  That file likely would have played better.  "
,spevman,2011-10-27T06:59Z,"By the way, what conversion method are you currently using?"
,jart92,2011-10-28T03:04Z,"It is a protected file when I get it (from iTunes) so I am using something called DRMBuster which pretty much seems to re-record the playback of it from QuickTime which is why it is so jerky and such. Pazera won't work for protected files, so I need some way of cracking it, but that is higher quality."
,spevman,2011-10-28T07:05Z,"Got it. I've used that program on some MP3's, but never for videos.  The individual picture quality of each frame seems fine, you just need a higher frame rate...most shows are broadcast at 30fps, so if the frame rate of the file is too much lower than that, the video starts to look jerky.

Also, an AVI file encoded with either XviD or DivX codec would be more universally playable on more devices.  (the DivX video with original picture size should do it)  I don't see a setting in the program to select the frame rate, but most likely that is controlled by the selection made for the video compression quality (use good or high setting)

Thanks though...as I don't get Logo, I have to wait till Fridays when its on their website and your encode let me watch it 3 days earlier.

I have ripped the individual FLV video segments of shows from TV websites before and joined/converted them to the proper size and bitrate file, but it is such a pain!

Thanks again!"
,spevman,2011-10-28T12:14Z,"OK, first off, mucho props to jart92 for his original post of this from his iTunes converted encode.  This file is ripped from the LOGO website and I converted the individual FLV video pieces to the proper video and audio bit-rate and combined them into one standard sized 350 MB AVI video file encoded with the XviD codec.  Call this effort a labor of love...ENJOY!!
