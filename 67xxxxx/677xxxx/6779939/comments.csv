,olaflsenc,2011-10-29T07:50Z,"Thanks for the upload, but I noticed many audio hiccups with this copy. Did anyone else?"
,ROU-KillingTime,2011-10-29T14:38Z,"Yeah, audio sync issues & dropouts for me too.

Having said that, {C_P} usually uploads good files, it's rare to get one with problems - so thanks for all the great work!"
[V],{C_P},2011-10-29T18:29Z,"Thank for the info about the audio.
Sadly thats from the station that air it, noting we can do about it. :(
If we ever get a better one we are going to release that on.

Have a nice dag."
,Boero,2011-10-29T23:19Z,"Thanks for the upload, {C_P}.
I guess it was fitting that the audio problems coincided with this episode. Those darned robo bears were never the easiest to understand, as evidenced by the Thundercats' reaction to them."
,shaban96,2011-10-30T13:30Z,wheres the 720 p version
,sapper71,2011-10-30T15:50Z,Shame about the audio but thanks anyway it is watchable 
,Daniccus,2011-10-30T17:04Z,"this happened once with childrens hospital, it was a glitch on the channel, not the torrent"
,abirn,2011-10-30T17:05Z,why has noone else released this? there was a delay with the clone wars beig uploaded aswell? whatts goin on
,toner2010,2011-10-30T19:24Z,"Yes, were is the HD version? Was there anything wrong with the original broadcast this week?"
,Revrant,2011-10-30T20:30Z,"This is the only up on the whole fucking web, so now I'm seeing it trickle down everywhere, I guess we just won 't get a good quality Berbils, no one else is releasing it."
,moo2u,2011-10-31T03:56Z,"Daniccus:
This aired just fine. There may've been an issue with the capper's hardware or the capper's television service provider, but it's not CN's fault. The Childrens Hospital issue (that I assume you're referring to, since I know of no other CH audio issue) was an issue with the copy of the episode that CN had. (There were issues with the surround sound channels being mixed up or something.)"
