[V],GunningHawk90,2011-10-27T20:08Z,Compiling and collecting them is not an easy task. You deserve credit. Thanks :)
[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-27T23:34Z,"I have collected this set too and never even dreamed of trying to seed it - yowsa.

You crazay CM"
,CorpusM,2011-10-27T23:40Z,Just felt like giving back to a community that I've taken from so often. Even if it is just organizing and compiling stuff I've downloaded from other people.
[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-28T02:54Z,"Thats how we all started, soon enough you'll have a skull and be giving advice to the next new guy, just look at GH. Dont know where you came from, but keep it up :)"
,spazlord,2011-11-02T22:56Z,"While i like the ""skull guys"" and all the work they do. It is a great thing to compile them into sets for those of us who would like to see the whole event but are missing issues.
Hats off to you my friend and i have saved you on my list to check in on."
,L4nt3rn,2012-02-01T02:20Z,"so are these in like any particular ""reading order""?"
,CorpusM,2012-02-02T07:52Z,"Should be in numerical order. If not read them in this order:
Green Lantern Rebirth
Lantern Corps Recharge
Green Lantern 1-20
Lantern Corps 1-13
Sinestro Corps War
Green Lantern 26-present
Lantern Corps 20-present
Blackest Night
Brightest Day
War of the Green Lanterns

Then continue on with the New 52."
