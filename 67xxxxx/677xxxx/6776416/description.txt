The Multivariable portion of the Soo Tan Calculus textbook tackles complex concepts with a strong visual approach. Utilizing a clear, concise writing style, and use of relevant, real world examples, Soo Tan introduces abstract mathematical concepts with his intuitive style that brings abstract multivariable concepts to life. The Multivariable text provides a great deal of visual help by introducing unique videos that assist students in drawing complex calculus artwork by hand. In keeping with this emphasis on conceptual understanding, each exercise set begins with concept questions and each end-of-chapter review section includes fill-in-the-blank questions which are useful for mastering the definitions and theorems in each chapter. Additionally, many questions asking for the interpretation of graphical, numerical, and algebraic results are included among both the examples and the exercise sets.
