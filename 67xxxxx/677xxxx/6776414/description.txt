Do you, as me, enjoy Muse?
Do you, as me, enjoy Instrumental Music?
Do you, as me, want to have ALL of Muse\'s albums as Instrumentals?

Guess what? You got it!


From the uploader that brought you the \"Origin of Symmetry\" Instrumental album, now you have \"Showbiz\"!

Showbiz, as you might recall, is the first album our favorite Brit Rock band made public, and it\'s been pretty around 12 years since that! Wow!
So, to celebrate (?) I\'ve uploaded the whole Album, WITHOUT VOICE!

That\'s right! No voice! Just the marvelous background music and instrumentals which decorate this epic Album.
With this, you can finally say that Pirate Bay has officially obtained ALL MUSE albums without voice, but they are mostly scattered around. So, most possibly you\'ll soon find nice torrent containing ALL Albums and a bonus: Neutral Star Collision WITHOUT VOICE. That\'s just epic, on itself, isn\'t it?

Special thanksto MuseInstrumentals @ Youtube for ripping and hosting this album originally.


Enjoy! \\ o w o /
