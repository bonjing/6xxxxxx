         A rainy day keeps the gang indoors, which leads to them       
         pulling out a demented board game of their own creation       
         that causes an overly-serious competition between the two     
          teams of Dee and Dennis against Mac, Charlie and Frank.

         FX right after all this time, maybe you should just stop      
          doing it. ASAP's release has bad IVTC 11:03-15:30.
