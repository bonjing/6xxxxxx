IMANDIX Cover is a tool for DVD and CD cover designers 
to display or present their covers. After loading the 
cover bitmap, the program generates a 3D preview of the 
cover with just one click, which can be saved as .jpg 
or other popular formats.

IMANDIX Cover is a software that automatically converts 
your cover bitmap into a 3D preview of what it would look 
like in a real case.

You simply load your cover bitmap file and the software 
generates a 3D illustration of it. You can use these 
illustrations at your web site or prints or just to see 
how the cover case looks like with your own cover bitmap.

You can create virtual product shots of these media:
# All DVD cover sizes (Thin box, Amaray, ... to the big cases that hold 10 discs)
# Blu-ray cases (12.5 and 15 mm spine width)
# CD cases (Slim case, Jewel case, Jewel case with clear edge)
# Discs (standard and full face label)
# Nearly all Digipaks (from 4 mm to 15 mm spine width)
# Paul Champagne designer boxes (all sizes, cases that hold Blu-rays coming soon)
# Custom cases (Poster, magazine, paperback)
# Custom boxes (like software boxes or packages)
