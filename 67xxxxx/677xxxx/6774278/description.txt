[b]Thx Hive

CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D


Source: P2P/Unknown
thx to whoever is the real encoder of it

Encode:
well that was loads of work, couple of hours again.
had both avis, both had terrible identical video pixelation problems and both are oos through the whole movie.
firstly i had to resync the complete movie, was easy at the beginning got worse in darker scenes and near the
end it needed a lot of cuts, but finally everything is in sync now.
to the video, as mentioned above a pixelation cluster, terrible, who wants that, took a new approach on this
and found a way to clean the video completely of the pixelation, looked totally repaired afterwards, just
slightly less sharp, only made slight modification afterwards, didnt wanted to get pixels again. 
looks like a standard dvdrip now, just with stereo audio.
anyway since its now sync you can really enjoy the movie.
got nice
enjoy
