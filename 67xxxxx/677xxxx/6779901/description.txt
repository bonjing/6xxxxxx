Cyclops #1 - 6 [Archaia]

2054. Douglas Pistoia is looking for work, but only a private security firm, Multicorps Security, has offered him a job. Soon after he signs up, the UN decides to outsource its peacekeeping missions, and Multicorps wins the first bid, propelling Douglas into a war that is not his own, a highly sophisticated war broadcast worldwide by the soldiers themselves, thanks to the micro-cameras in their helmets. They are called the Cyclops. Douglas plays the game, and slowly emerges as both a unit leader and a media celebrity. But how far will he go in exploring the boundaries between war and peacekeeping, news and entertainment?

***NOTE*** Firstly no this has NOTHING to do with MARVEL's X-Men character! Secondly, this is an 8 issue series, but I have been waiting for over 2 months for someone to scan the already released final issues. So, Ive finally given up, meaning they'll pop up tomorrow Lol and Ill link here when/if they ever do.***NOTE***
