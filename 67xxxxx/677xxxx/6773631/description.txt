Okage: Shadow King was a PS2 game released in North America in 2001 (a.k.a. Boku to Maou in Japan). Quirky, one of the first RPGs for PS2. Highly rendered graphics, darned funny dialogue that pokes fun at nearly every RPG cliche imaginable.

WHAT\'S INCLUDED. This is the official 4.1 MB PDF of the original game manual. Distilled with Acrobat Distiller 4.0 and confirmed compatible with Readers 4 and up to today\'s version. Accurate, the manual was assembled page by page from high-resolution scans of the printed manual. Abandoned by S0ny earlier this year, the manual had been freely downloadable up until now. So here it is again, unaltered.

Both printed and PDF manuals, as well as the in-game descriptions, contain a pair of notable errors. Alarm Charm items actually cure the Sandman curse and Big Boss\'s Charm items cure the Evil Eye curse. Both items work correctly in-game, they just read like they shouldn\'t work.
