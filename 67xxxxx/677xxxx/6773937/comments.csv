,chris4smd,2011-10-26T23:30Z,another goodie! Many thanx
,vasudeva,2011-10-27T08:21Z,"Thanks a lot. I just see ChattChitto and download (that is if I am looking for that app/movie). No need to even scan it.

One question: Winzip recently has been bundling winzip courier. I think the keys for winzip pro do not work for winzip courier. Or are the keys the same for winzip pro and courier. At least till 15.5.9579 (or whatever after 9510) were not.

Thanks a lot for the download anyway.  "
,bry68,2011-10-27T09:04Z,another solid u/l thx chattchitto
[V],ChattChitto,2011-10-27T09:20Z,"This is WinZip Pro v16.0. Nothing to do with Courier :)
As you can see on there Product page, its completely two different Products.
If they decided to offer you its installation along with WinZip PRO, That's there Marketing plan of the product."
