Hopefully, many of you Doctor Who fans will find this a nice little package - all UK Gold's Doctor Who @ 40 broadcast vids that I could find, culled from various sources such as eDonkey and YouTube.  I've never seen these bundled as one package.

These are not of the best quality, largely due to the sources I was limited to.  If any of you have better ones for any of these files, please share, and I will upgrade this package accordingly.

Also, if I've missed any, please let me know in the comments and I will add them to the package.
