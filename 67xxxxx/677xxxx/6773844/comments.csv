Set in a post-apocalyptic near future, SPACEMAN tells the story of Orson â a hulking, lonely loser who spends his days collecting scrap metal and dreaming of the startrekking life he was promised.

That is, until he finds himself at the center of a celebrity child kidnapping case. Seeing his chance to be a hero, Orson takes matters into his own hands...but will his actions only cause more heartbreak?


Anyone read this yet? Review?"
