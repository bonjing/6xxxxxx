Dude listen, I had the same problem..Her`s what I did, man. Installed everything, rolled over all updates and patches there are. Final update was 1.14c version or similar. latest one. Then  I run airiso keygen, paiste new challenge (new compared to one before updating) and paisted new response. I use fruity loops for this one. Then I had to reload the plugin.

Hope that helped man.

cheers!"

2- replace your .component file in your audio units folder (vst for win users)
3- update patch, libraries and software
4- open instrument in your host and use the keygen to register
5- close the instrument and re-open it without having to close the host.
6- everything should work fine
7- have fun and make some killer tunes"

,acidspill,2012-04-18T21:52Z,"100% working verified by me: NOOB Instructions:

1 - Download torrent 
2 - Install ISO files starting with disc 1 either 32 or 64 bit or if your too stupid to know install both of them then continue to install until all 5 discs are installed 
*Set the VST path to your Music Makers vst plugin folder mine is: 
C:Program Files (x86)Image-LineFL Studio 10PluginsVST
(ISO files were mounted with Daeman Tools Lite in my case)
3 - By default the first disc installed Steam with Trillian sub-folder in: 
C:Program FilesSpectrasonicsSTEAM 
*Make sure all the rest of the discs are set to that path location 
4 - Than do the updates included in disc 1 in this order, A being first
A - Trilian_Software_Update_Win_1_1_4c
B - Trilian_Soundsource_Library_Update_1_0_1
C - Trilian_Patch_Library_Update_1_0_3a
5 - Open up your music maker in my case fruity loops and scan for new plugins. Open Trillian plugin. It will ask for authentication. 
6 - Do not highlight and copy click the provided copy button
7 - Open up the keygen provided in disc one of the torrent paste code and click generate
8 don't highlight and copy the generated key click the copy button, paste in required slot in Trillian plugin
9 - Restart plugin 

Believe that maybe you can problem solve the next install yourself. have fun"
,tumyeto,2012-05-05T10:41Z,I'm getting a error that steam doesn't exist once i try and install the first disc

,mrtwill,2012-05-22T22:56Z,"Hey for mac users that are having problems activating this torrent i followed @blankton instructions but then i had to download and update with v1.4.1d and use their keygen to get it to work.

Hope this helps!

Thank you for this torrent!!!"
,tafichi,2012-05-26T11:21Z,"Thank God I successfully downloaded this torrent.
I'm using Trilian now and it is the best module for basses,there is a million of different bass sound,any type of bass you need is there.
I will seed this torrent at least for the next 2 or 3 months.
If you have any problems with installation,follow blankton's instructions in the comment,or follow mine(for windows users):
1.Install all the 5 Discs(they all have to be installed to a STEAM directory,if you used STEAM based plugins before,like Omnisphere,you will need to install Trilian in the steam folder you installed omnisphere in)
2.Insert the .dll folder into wherever you do when you install new plugins into your workstation(in fl studio copy Trilian.dll into Image-Line/Fl Studio/Plugins/VST)
3.Install the updates located in Disc 1 folder
4.Open Trilian in your music program (fl studio,ableton,etc.) and copy the challenge code
5.Open the keygen in disc 1 folder,paste the challenge code there,press generate,copy the new code keygen gave you,paste to Trilian,press continue
6.Close Trilian and open it again
7.It should be working fine,if not,write a comment about your problem and I will help you
-peace"
