,zlennyk,2011-10-27T06:05Z,so tried something new with this upload...I kept the scanner tags on them. Give me some feedback on if you are for or against this. Hope you seed the crap out of this one. and make sure and leave feedback and say thanks or else...

,brega10,2011-10-28T03:07Z,"You're taking the time to compile them, you label them however the hell you want.  :-)

Know that your time and efforts are appreciated!

And I like this format... you posting all the #1's, #2's, etc."

,zlennyk,2011-10-30T05:54Z,"come on people, put some comments on this torrent, don't let them win. every time you fail to comment, they win..."
