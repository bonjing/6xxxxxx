Repack Notes:
=============

Sorry for the ~censored~, something went horrible wrong. Here's the repack.


Game information:
=================

For the first time ever, the world of the NCIS TV show comes to  your  home
console and PC. Experience four original NCIS  episodes  created  with  the
writers of the show, and travel across the USA  and  around  the  world  to
solve complex murder,  espionage  and  terrorist  cases  as  your  favorite
characters from the hit TV drama.

An all-new NCIS story arc written with the writers  of  the  show.  From  a
Casino in Atlantic City, USA, to a luxury hotel in Dubai, UAE, work as  the
NCIS team to save the  day.  Discover  exciting  connections  between  four
original cases as you crack each one, and work towards solving the  overall
investigation.

Bond with your favorite NCIS characters and get first-hand experience  with
the  group's  humor,  personality  quirks,  and  defining  characteristics.
Interact with the characters  through  layers  of  storyline  and  dialogue
designed to make you an integral part of the cast's compelling dynamic.

As in the show, use your guts and the cutting edge of technology  to  solve
cases. Engage in varied mini-games and activities: search crime scenes  for
clues and collect evidence; use  the  latest  forensic  tools  and  perform
autopsies; conduct dramatic suspect interrogations; put  your  reflexes  to
the tests in tense action sequences. Finally piece the clues together using
your wits to deduct the truth.
