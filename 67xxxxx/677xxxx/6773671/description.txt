"Not Quite The Black Keys" MP3

Ok, This is NOT an album by The Black Keys, It's something I put together containing Various Artists, some you may have heard of some not. The Idea is 'suggest' Bands that some may not know that have a similar sound to The Black Keys. Something that Fans of TBK may enjoy.

Don't like it? Don't download it... think my ideas are rubbish? I Don't care, It's free so stop whining like a baby. 

I Hope you find it interesting.
