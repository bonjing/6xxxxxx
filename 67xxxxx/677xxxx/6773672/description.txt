                                =====================



Itâ€™s a voyage of exploration like no other â€“ to Titan, Saturnâ€™s largest moon and thought to resemble our own early Earth.

For a small team of British scientists this would be the culmination of a lifetimeâ€™s endeavor â€“ the flight alone, some 2 billion miles, would take a full seven years.

This is the story of the space probe they built, the sacrifices they made and their hopes for the landing. Would their ambitions survive the descent into the unknown on Titanâ€™s surface?

The Hugyens probe was the most distant vessel to land anywhere in our solar system. Stunning images and data were sent back from Titan, Saturn\'s largest moon. The scientific instruments aboard the probe helped to paint a picture of an exotic new world, with methane seas, volcanoes and cliffs of ice. 

The first-ever pictures from Titan adorned the front pages of newspapers around the world, but the inside story of this extraordinary mission remains largely untold. Featuring never-before-seen footage and exclusive interviews, this is the incredible story of the small team of scientists who were the first to \'touch the surface\' of this mysterious moon.
