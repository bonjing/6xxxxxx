,jinbei49,2011-11-01T10:00Z,"now i've wait for ur cars 2 torrent without 'alien' language background,,thanks,,keep the quality,, thanks ;)"
,bordo84,2011-11-01T13:59Z,exactly jinbei49...RUSHING...i compared it with release from vice and this release is really in low quality in some scenes like pixels moving in backgrounds when characters are talking...
,bordo84,2011-11-01T14:05Z,and i also better wait for more quality release than this so please take your time and encode because i like your releases otherwise too
[T],IceBane,2011-11-02T00:48Z,"Thanks for your input jinbei49 & bordo84

I Appreciate the feedback. i will try to better but even now i am still learning somethings.

Some Movies (Found Video Type Movies) i don't denoise much, as to maintain the feel of that type of movie. there have been others that i had to encode 2 or 3 times as it did not come out right. 
I am also in the process of building a newer computer but it is taking some time. Hopefully that will help."
,jinbei49,2011-11-02T16:33Z,"somehow u r really good with animation movies encode coz i really love ur kung fu panda 2 torrent,,they r very clear video and sound,,thanks 4 that,,hope u can do the same 4 others,,"
,captaincancerstix,2011-11-03T15:41Z,Excellent Quality Thanks
,bordo84,2011-11-04T21:44Z,for example thor is beautiful release from you...i also like your releases because you never change sharpness and other things like many of groups do.. and i hope you will never do that... most of groups change sharpness because of buzz in image that is in original bluray also...they think as they remove it it´s ok and buzz is away but it´s not ok because then are all character´s faces like retouched i hope you know what i mean simply it´s all blurred
,bordo84,2011-11-04T22:07Z,anyway could you rip silent hill movie? i would love to see it in your beautiful rip
,bordo84,2011-11-07T17:59Z,why all groups denoise it anyway?? i don´t understand that.. then it looks maybe like a picture but NOT like blu-ray and it´s totally trivial now i´m watching original blu-ray of The Pacific and it´s a big difference
