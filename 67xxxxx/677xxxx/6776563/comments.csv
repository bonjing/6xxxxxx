,sharky3k,2011-10-27T21:57Z,Sorry about the double-upload.  Had a problem with the trackers on the first one.
,WillKane,2011-10-27T22:06Z,"I have set up a poster here (and on demonoid), who is very reliable - with my Rush podcasts and morning updates. 

I enjoy Rush too much not to contribute in some way."
[M],Agricola,2011-10-27T22:33Z,i have deleted the other one for you :)
[T],Nicodemus75,2011-10-27T23:47Z,"Podcast is up.  For obvious reasons, if someone (like sharky) posts a radio rip, it will almost always beat the podcast.  I have no problem continuing to provide the podcasts while a radio rip goes up.

RESIST WE MUCH!"
,sharky3k,2011-10-28T05:16Z,Thanks Nico.  I'd rather someone was uploading the podcast since it takes me time to edit the radio capture and I often can't get to it until late in the evening.
,fizdude,2011-10-31T23:15Z,Thank you very much to both of you Sharky and Nico!!!
