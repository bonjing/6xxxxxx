â€œ Shelly Manne's 1959 quintet (with trumpeter Joe Gordon, tenor saxophonist Richie Kamuca, pianist Victor Feldman, bassist Monty Budwig, and the drummer/leader) was not his most important, but it was a hard-swinging unit well versed in bebop. Their three days at the Black Hawk (a popular San Francisco jazz club during this era) was almost completely documented, originally on four LPs and now expanded to five CDs. As with the first three sets, the fourth volume adds an alternate take (of "Cabu") to the original program ("Cabu," "Just Squeeze Me," "Nightingale," and a full-length version of their theme, "A Gem from Tiffany"). The lengthy solos are consistently excellent, making this entire series recommended to straight-ahead jazz fans. ~ AllMusic â€ 

If Volume 3 of Shelly Manne's "At The Blackhawk" albums is the most relaxed and laidback of the recordings, then Volume 4 is the most fiery and groovin'. The CD opens with the hard-swingin' "Cabu" followed by the simmering, sentimental "Just Squeeze Me," which contains one of Victor Feldman's greatest piano solos. Don't let the title of "Nightingale" fool you, this song is "A Night In Tunisia" like thriller. Of course the album concludes with the band's theme (as it does on Volumes 1 & 2), and a first rate alternate version of "Cabu." As with the other volumes, the band, sound, and ambiance all come together to paint a classic picture of great West Coast jazz. ~ Michael B. Richman
