Description: 
Edward Burra was one of the most elusive British artists 
of the 20th century. Long underrated, his reputation has 
been rehabilitated, with the first major retrospective of his 
work for 25 years taking place in 2011 and 
record-breaking prices being paid for his work at 
auction. In this documentary, art critic Andrew 
Graham-Dixon tells the remarkable story of his life. It 
follows Burra from his native town of Rye to the jazz clubs 
of prohibition-era New York, to the war-torn landscapes of 
the Spanish Civil WaR and Back to England during the 
Blitz. It shows how Burra's increasingly disturbing and 
surreal work deepened and matured as he experienced at 
first hand some of the most tragic events of the century. 
Through letters and interviews with those who knew him, 
it paints an entertaining portrait of a true English 
eccentric
