 TuneUp Utilities can make your Windows operating system    
 faster, more comfortable and more secure with just a few   
 mouse clicks. And all operations performed on the operating
 system are completely safe, because all changes are        
 monitored by TuneUp Rescue Center and can be undone at any 
 time. All TuneUp Utilities modules can be accessed through 
 a common interface that is divided into six categories.    
 The software helps both beginners and experts to make      
 Windows meet their needs in a way that is better, easier   
 and safer. All important system options are explained in an
 easy way and can be turned on or off at the click of your  
 mouse. TuneUp Utilities will then make the necessary       
 changes in the registry or boot files automatically. We    
 place a high value on system stability, so that Windows    
 won't stop working reliably. And most changes that you make
 can be undone in TuneUp Rescue Center - easily and safely. 
                                                            
 TuneUp Utilities automatically runs important maintenance  
 tasks for you, makes you aware of any problems and offers  
 simple solutions. This ensures performance is always at its
 best. A slow and untidy computer is now a thing of the past
 for you. You can also use TuneUp Utilities to customize the
 appearance of your Windows system - to make working on your
 computer more enjoyable.                                   
                                                            
 With TuneUp Utilities you will quickly make your Windows   
 system faster and more convenient to use- and ensure that  
 it stays like this for the long term. This makes TuneUp    
 Utilities the perfect program for everyone: for those who  
 would rather leave the computer maintenance to a reliable  
 partner as well as for those who would rather do everything
 themselves.                                                
                                                            
 The TuneUp Turbo Mode provides an immediate performance    
 boost whenever you need it. When you use your computer in  
 the TuneUp Turbo Mode, an analysis is performed to see     
 which tasks, programs and functions are currently running  
 in the background that are not strictly necessary. These   
 programs are stopped or slowed down, allowing the          
 additional processing power gained to be used exclusively  
 by the Programs you are actually running.
