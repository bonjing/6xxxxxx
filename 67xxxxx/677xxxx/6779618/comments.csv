re: ""prick other ppl can upload the same torrent does not mean it is your one you prick ""......

....actually it does mean it's mine. Literally. I made that compilation and I also made the artwork. You removed my name from the tags but left the catalog number ending in 88. 

So hey man, don't get so hostile. I'm flattered that you chose my work to steal, That means it must be worth something, lol. Cheers!"
