Hey Guys!
I debated as to if I should even post this week because if you can believe it, the entire week is an "Encore Broadcast". I am not sure about tonight (the 28th) but Tuesday - Thursday are repeats. Enjoy what you can while you can and please seed. I have a strange feeling that Mike won't be around too much longer. In radio that is!
