Today you are going to call in and explain why you like the book, ie., me.  Now, today I thought we would do something different.  I want you to call in and explain why you liked Abuse of Power and why, and if you are a man or woman.

Next, I am going to have you call in and read your favorite passage of Abuse of Power and tell me why you liked that part the best.  Did it speak to you?

Tomorrow, I am going to do something completely different.  I am going to read passages from my new book, Abuse of Power. 
How about I read a sex scene from the greatest book of it's kind, Abuse of Power.  Then let me spend 90 minutes explaining just how and why I wrote it and why I just might be the greatest man to ever suck air.

Let me just read some reviews of Abuse of Power I just wro...er.. read."
