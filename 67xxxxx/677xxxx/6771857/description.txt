It is a scientific fact that peoples gestures give away their true intentions. 
Yet most of us don't know how to read body languages and don't realize how our 
own physical movements speak to others. Now the world's foremost experts on 
the subject share their techniques for reading body language signals to achieve 
success in every area of life.

Drawing upon more than thirty years in the field, as well as cutting-edge research 
from evolutionary biology, psychology, and medical technologies that demonstrate 
what happens in the brain, the authors examine each component of body language and 
give you the basic vocabulary to read attitudes and emotions through behavior.
