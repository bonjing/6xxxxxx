Fuck I m dying to play the game but nothing is going straight even SKIDROW did the same.

@blaze69 Thanx a lot for info!! Appreciate it "
,s3nr1,2011-10-28T02:04Z,"Thanks much better than the garbage DOS batch file installs most wannabe 'rippers' put out, hell they rarely even inject the right or any registry entries(for updates, etc). And many of them are untested and requires ""fixes"" because they're stupidly deleted too many things or reencode movies/music wrong just for the sake of making it smaller than the other guys. BB releases are professionally done, installer and all and they have been flawless so far. They're as small as anyone can possibly make them."
,mttigga,2011-10-28T08:56Z,all u guzzzz fuck u simply say its working or not......?

,asd08,2011-10-29T16:11Z,"Only one method working 100% (till now) for Battlefield 3 Double Sound Echo Fix

Worked for me 100% on (win 7 32bit , nvidia 9500 GT 1 Giga , 2 Giga RAM and CPU 3 GH Dual Core )


Battlefield 3 Double Sound Echo Fix By Dr Ali Aliraqi


Before you begin and load your mission (on Game Menu)

Press Alt + Tab then Task Manager then rigth click on BF3.exe then Set Affinity

after that unselect CPU 1 ( Select only CPU 0 )

you will notice that  double sound or sound echo disapear ...

But you will notice also that game will become slower (because only one CPU of dual core CPU worked) so you needed to reduce resolution ...


Note :Few Seconds after loading and beginning your mission you can reselect CPU 1 with CPU 0 and game will become faster ...

But But But double sound or echo reapear when new loading regain (loading regain when you kill or begin next mission etc ... ) ...


So Conclusion : Dual Core CPU is main cause of double sound or echo ...


So we are waiting  computer supporter that make patch or installer or anything for : ( battlefield 3 begin with single core CPU and converted to dual core 
CPU automatically few seconds after loading complete and when new loading reapear it converted to single core CPU automatically and it converted to dual core
CPU automatically few seconds after loading complete )   

It is so difficult but we are needing that ...
