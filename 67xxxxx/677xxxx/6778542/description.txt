â€˜When Iâ€™m With Youâ€™ is the fourth release from Christian artist JJ Heller. The songs that make up her new release deal with relationships, both earthly (person-to-person) and spiritual (person-to-God). Stylistically Hellerâ€™s music falls into a singer songwriter meets acoustic folk rock style with her beautifully sounding vocals driving the music. The songs alternate between melodic with flowing strings to mid-tempo with an almost pop edge to them at times.
