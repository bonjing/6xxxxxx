They say the best way to watch a movie is in its original version. The problem comes when you don't understand the original language and that makes it a bit harder.

Well, this is why subtitles were invented for, and subtitle editors too, like Subtitle Processor.

Subtitle Processor is probably one of the most complete subtitle editors you can find nowadays.

Not only does Subtitle Processor enable you to edit subtitles by cutting and joining sentences, correcting typos, removing extra spaces and other tools, but also helps you synchronize the text and the video image with great precision...



Enjoy and Seed!!
