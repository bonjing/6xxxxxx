,Kal-El7,2011-10-29T21:42Z,"Life is beautiful! Love these issues you faithfully put at every week! Thanks for making my pass-time fun, man. You are top dawg. "
,Kal-El7,2011-10-29T21:46Z,"Also, love the way you're naming the folders: DC New 52 Week ***.  It helps in the way I can categorically find them easily on my Samsung Galaxy S phone, which is how I'm reading ALL of these comics! ""COMIC Rack"" is the software I use both on PC & cell phone. CDisplayEX is also good on desktop, but their cellphone counterpart isn't as good as Comic Rack. Anyway, keep 'em comin', bud. :) Also, so I really, really plan on reading these for LIFE, week-after-week. Would you really be able to support us for the next many years supplying these issues as you've so generously have been? Do you accept donations? You've helped me save money. 

Thanks forever, man! =) "
