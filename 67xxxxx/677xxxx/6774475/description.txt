       DISconnected' tells the story of four young people in living in   
        different cities who know each other through a live streaming site.
        Isaiah is a big presence on the site, but has trouble relating to
        his girlfriend Nikki when they're together. Lisa's attraction to
        her boyfriend Jack -- who she met online -- heats up as she makes
        plans to meet up with him. Maria's constant texting of her
        boyfriend John ignites a break-up feud that extends to their friends
        and profiles. Tom refuses to reveal his identity when he posts
        his music online, but antagonizes others from the safety of his
        bedroom laptop. All of them are dealing with digital drama that
        complicates their loves, friendships and lives. One night, it all
        spins out of control.
        
        
                                 
                                                  
      
            
                                                     
                                                 
                                                                      

      We know who we are, where we came from, and why we're here. Do you?
