The film starts with Bodhidharma (Suriya), a Pallava prince, who is an expert at all big things. Be it medicine or martial arts or genetics, he is the best. One day, he is sent to China by the gurumatha. Initially the people in China treated him as an inferior. Later when he cured an unknown disease and fought against some people who ill treated villagers there, the people of China began to respect him very much. He taught them how to cure many diseases, taught them martial arts, and the skill of hypnotising people. However after few years,when he expressed his desire to leave, the people poisoned and buried him near the temple, believing that their place would be disease free if he's buried there . Later in the modern day China, Dong Lee (Johnny Tri Nguyen) is given the task of starting the biowar against India which is called the operation red. Dong Lee starts this operation by injecting a virus into a street dog. This disease was the one which occurred during the time of Bodhidharma in China. Meanwhile Shuba Srinivasan (Shruti Haasan) researched that Bodhidharma can be brought back if his sample of DNA is matched with another sample of DNA whom she finds it out as Aravind (Suriya) a descendant of Bodhidharma. Shuba tries to give life to Bodhi Dharman to end the menace of Dong Lee. But Dong Lee, who is capable of doing anything, does all impossible bad things, mastered in 'Nokku Varmam'(Hypnotism), a martial art which was actually taught to the Chinese by Bodhi Dharma.
