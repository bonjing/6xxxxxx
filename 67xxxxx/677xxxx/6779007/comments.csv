,vibs999,2011-10-29T10:34Z,"Yess downloaded, cam print, watchable and both audio & video are okay. Only that the print gets stuck looooots of times inbetween. that is very annoying. Instead if you can wait then pls wait for a better quality one. Anyway thank you nrsadri for uploading so fast the newest one. Good attempt. :-)"
