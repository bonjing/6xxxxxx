,Night_89,2011-11-27T16:30Z,audio of 1st season sucks
,bikers123,2012-01-12T07:50Z,"Season 1's audio is weird. The background music can only be heard on left channel and dialogue+music on right channel.
I fixed it by changing the audio channel from dolby surround to right.
Works fine.
Thanks!!!
Also, I see only 5-6 people seeding indefinitely.
Others who finish downloading, for some reason don't seed. Please don't be that person."
