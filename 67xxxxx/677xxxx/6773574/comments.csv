[T],wowcabbage,2011-10-26T18:40Z,"Thats cool man it happens, i did it enough times. As far as i can tell the recent torrents page is the quickest to index. My uploads are showing up there since i got my skull."
[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-26T18:47Z,LOL - so since this is up here twice - hows this run look? Is this just an avengers prequel?
[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-26T18:48Z,"PS: Before uploading, I click on all your names, it will show up there a few minutes before it registers on recent uploads - time consuming (few secs) but works"
