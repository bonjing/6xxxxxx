,Verifire_temporary,2011-11-06T15:11Z,"@Everone: My account; verifire, has been compromised in some way. I can not access it. No password works, neither here or on suprbay, and upon hitting 'retrieve password', I'm told that verifiremail@gmail.com isn't registered!

But I know it is, because 'neon' helped me get it in there in the first place since my older webmail at 'start.no' was discontinued..

Very strange, and no support from TPB crew either. I guess they have their reasons, but I don't know why.

Until I [hopefully] get my account-access back, I obviously won't be making uploads under my verifire-nick.

I might be making some under this name, and will in that case leave my email-address in the bottom of the description like before.

Love,
V."

,Verifire_temporary,2011-11-09T08:53Z,"Yeah.. Continued..
I'm;
http://thepiratebay.org/user/Verifire_temporary/ now it seems. Perhaps it'll be permanent. At least as long as I'm able to do this at all.

New uploads will be done there, and I've just made one more..

I'm starting migrating to another site shortly, if God wants me to.
He may not. I'll know when I know.
Loads of work, though, but I'll try my best.

Still online, but how long? No idea.

@EVERYONE: If you want to have some of my uploads, or any other's uploads that makes sense and helps in some way on this journey toward eternity's dead-line;
MAKE HARDCOPIES!
Time is ticking by the nano-second, and it'll soon be up. WWW2 is here already, just try going to a online bank or something. Google WWW2. It's just a matter of TIME before it replaces WWW. Believe it.
Take to heart these words. You might be very glad one day if you did, and regret if you don't.

In love,
V.
