,Stalin7,2011-10-29T00:23Z,Is this closed beta or offical release?
,wizzy09,2011-10-29T00:34Z,is this the beta buggy version who was wrongly uploaded to steam?
,Casseius,2011-10-29T00:39Z,lets see
[V],Murlok,2011-10-29T00:48Z,xywdx thx for trust one of the olders uploader at Tpb :D
,71460,2011-10-29T01:01Z,Thanks Murlok! This game looks good.
,Stalin7,2011-10-29T01:26Z,hey murlok is this the beta or the offical release?
,Wintermist,2011-10-29T01:42Z,I've soo been looking forward to this game. I can't afford to buy it this month but will the next. I just hope this is not the buggy version.
,LikeNp,2011-10-29T01:50Z,It's good version ?
,Casseius,2011-10-29T02:03Z,"Its Beta, FInal version not even released.

,BigD145,2011-10-29T02:26Z,This is likely the Beta since that's all Skidrow has done so far.
,LikeNp,2011-10-29T02:28Z,low speed :(
,Wintermist,2011-10-29T03:48Z,I bought it from Gamersgate instead. I will jsut have to be broke for a month lol
,roberto2003al,2011-10-29T04:53Z,Virus! DO NOT INSTALL! This has Virus!
,soska88,2011-10-29T05:24Z,Can someone please answer - is this the steam wrong beta version or the retail?
,NanoEntity,2011-10-29T06:02Z,"Dont waste time downloading, so many bugs with the game, also its confusing..."
,lolm8lolm8,2011-10-29T06:16Z,"NanoEntities comment about the game being buggy and confusing + this is the only version on here makes me think that it is the beta version

Regardless i'm going to download it now and will report back in a few hours when it's done with the version number :)"
,Necroclysm,2011-10-29T06:39Z,"This is the beta version.  The correct version of the game still has not been released due to some screwup between the company and Steam.
The beta version ended up on Steam instead of retail, so it was ""cracked"" again and uploaded.

Wait for a verified correct retail version release.




(Yes, I have tested this one)"
,lolm8lolm8,2011-10-29T07:10Z,Thanks Necroclysm
,klord2010,2011-10-29T07:23Z,"I can't decide who to blame. lol

1. Kerberos - send beta version
2. Paradox - publish beta version
3. Steam - sell beta version
4. SKIDROW - crack beta version
5. Murlok - upload beta version
6. Me and You - download beta version"
,P3trix,2011-10-29T08:06Z,"this is bullshit.
cant even install the shit.
waste of time"
[V],Murlok,2011-10-29T08:24Z,klord2010  lol
,Wintermist,2011-10-29T10:26Z,I bought this. Even after they supposedly fixed it with a patch it's still not worth trying to play. We all reckon it's still a beta version.
,bakaonna,2011-10-29T11:40Z,"Remember Sword of the Stars I. This will most likely be buggy and awkward for the first two patches, but afterwards it will ROCK :)"
,Niarro,2011-10-29T14:36Z,This is definitely the beta version peoples. Don't bother downloading it yet.
[V],Murlok,2011-10-29T15:18Z,"I got it going and np If like to wait for new version do it.If somebody will crack and upload it? We got this now and working. Choice are yours!


SAVE OUR CHILDREN !"
,Rhine86,2011-10-29T16:18Z,"@bakaonna So it's a typical Paradox release then? :P I suppose that explains their name, its a paradox that a company can release increasingly buggier games yet somehow most are instantly classic"
,LikeNp,2011-10-29T16:22Z,"seems like not uploaders fault that we got this version, just developers dont finished game yet, looks like we nead to w8 few weaks."

Hmmm. I know they do have listed other known issues they are working on. What's the one you're getting? In the forums, a lot were having issues solved by reinstalling C++2010 and VB4 (in the SOTS main install folder)"
,Kaiserjoe,2011-11-01T06:31Z,"Nah, not the one from today. Don't see a torrent for todays update and I can't find a patch on the net.....although I'm blonde and prone to being stupid at times."

I've found what's causing our errors:) It's enought to log off and shut down steam client. Apparently the game can cope with lack of steam but cannot cope with him being unresponsive."
