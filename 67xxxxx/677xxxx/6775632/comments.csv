[V],neon,2011-10-27T14:23Z,"@walters,the hangover 2 is not out on bluray yet,it would have taken less than a minute for you to find that out,do some homework before you comment"
,willemco,2011-10-27T17:28Z,"Can I get you to upload the movie 'UNDERGROUND' It has an 8.1 IMDb rating and I believe you would do many of your fans a big favour! Cheers!
Further to my previous request I would like you to consider a movie from the same director, named ""Black Cat, White Cat'... also an 8.0 IMDb rating... worth a 1080p BluRay ? Much obliged if you could find it in your heart to consider my requests!"
,tony419,2011-10-27T18:27Z,"@neon Thank you for that. People can be so oblivious.

@walters147 and @willemco Before you post a request, look for a link to the blu ray version of the movie on piratebay, as well as the imdb info, then post. Then maybe yify might upload them. Put a bit of effort, since you aint paying for the movies, please!

@yify Thank you, as always."
,willemco,2011-10-27T22:45Z,"to Tony419: If you would have taken the trouble READING my request before making a comment, you would have seen THAT I DID EXACTLY WHAT YOU SUGGESTED!"
,willemco,2011-10-27T23:24Z,"tony 419:
What I didn't read was my OWN request, but you have to believe me when I say that my original text included the link to IMDb... for one or another reason the ink was deleted..."

,tony419,2011-10-28T13:11Z,"@walters147
