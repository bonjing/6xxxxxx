  Zainub Khan has been found guilty by         
  Pakistan's Courts and is to be hanged. Her   
  last wish is to tell her story before the    
  media, and after approval, she relates how   
  her family was compelled to leave Delhi      
  during 1948 and re-locate to Lahore. This    
  is where her father, Hakim Sayed Hashmutallah
  Khan, married Suraiya, and hoping to sire a  
  son, instead ended up with 7 daughters. The  
  8th child turned out to be a hermaphrodite   
  and Hashmutullah wanted it dead but Suraiya  
  insisted that she will not let anyone know   
  so as not to shame her husband. They named   
  the child Saifullah, and hired a tutor to    
  teach him at home. After a failed marriage,  
  Zainub returns home, notices that the tutor  
  was molesting her brother and asks him to    
  leave. With dwindling income from his father,
