Review by Steve Loewy (AMG)
This studio session is distinguished by excellent, mostly Italian jazz tunes, and a very attractive group of players not usually associated with the trumpeter. The compatible flute of Nicola Stilo wonderfully complements Baker's dry, unemotional sound, while the addition of a third horn, Diane Varvra's soprano sax, adds body to the sound. A very strong rhythm section of pianist Michel Grailler, bassist Riccardo dal FrÃ , and drummer Leo Mitchell rounds out a tight, well-groomed collective. Baker is in fine form, but he skips the vocals. Bruno Martino's "Estate" is hauntingly rendered, while J.J. Johnson's "Lament" is given an attractive reading. This amounts to a very accessible, enjoyable set of tunes - one that may not win any awards, but should reward those who appreciate the delicate and lovely nature of Chet Baker's art.
