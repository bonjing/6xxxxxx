,distropia,2011-10-29T00:45Z,"Don't waste time downloading this. It is completely impossible this is the game (it doesn't fit on 6.12Mb). It should be like 200-300mb, so this is fake."
,Taz1982,2011-10-29T02:24Z,"@distropia how about you go fuck your self, dumbass, you install the game and download the rest of the data through the game like a Gameloft game, you smart as twat, fuck off unless you no what you are talking about. Douche bag"
,kayarulez,2011-10-29T07:29Z,LoLZz Distropia you will need to download the additional file through wifi once you install this gamee...

,lttwinkie,2011-10-30T21:43Z,thanks
,Taz1982,2011-10-30T23:27Z,"If you are using older generation non Tegra 2 Android phone like HTC Desire HD, Samsung Galaxy S, ShadowGun might not able to load properly. In order to play ShadowGun, you need to turn on â€˜Reduce texture qualityâ€™ and â€˜Reduce texture sizeâ€™ in Chainfire3D. This will help to reduce memory usage and improve performance on older Android phone. Guess what? These help to fix force close issue on Samsung Galaxy S2 when trying to loading another level after finished level 1. But the graphics quality will be reduced, right? No worry, just turn off those after you manage to go pass the loading."
,iconiafun,2011-10-31T08:00Z,"I can't save game, so it seems to be like demo.  I can play as far as I want, but as soon as I quit and go back I have to start over.  Same for the torrent of Samurai II."
,Taz1982,2011-10-31T10:46Z,@iconiafun thats weird mate i can just leave the game and it saves my progress
