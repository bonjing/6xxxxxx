,powpowpowlll,2011-10-31T03:15Z,"Just out of curiosity... are Seasons 1 and 2 the DVDRips and Season 3 the HDTV?

Love your series torrents! Thanks!"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-11-01T01:24Z,"Yes, I use DVD's where possible but for shows still being shown then I have to use HDTV rips as the DVD isn't out yet. Assuming they make a season 4, season 3 next time will be replaced with DVDRip."
