Happy whatever-you-celebrate, FxG team, from the 'sadly loyal' masses [one of 'em anyway]... Hope all is well ;)"
,arni1204,2012-01-10T12:32Z,"Jst  like Axxo  ...SADLY the Days of FXG_TEAM are alsoover..!! :( :( 
The new leaders are SaM , YIFY ,  subha1561 and of course extremezone and many more..
I was a fxg fan bt... sorry folks"
,libertaswv,2012-01-22T22:43Z,"@ arni1204: I've accused people of Chicken Little-ing FxG's downtime in the past, but this time it feels a little more permanent to me as well. They've gone months before, but i'm not sure they've ever been gone THIS many months. You might well be right.

Ain't it fuckin' cool, though, that the MPAA (etc) bastards never got FxG or Axxo? God i bet they wanted them so bad they were dreaming about it, lol. 

Tough shit, y'bastards :)

So... If they're really gone (in this incarnation, at least), then it's sad. I'll miss FxG even more than Axxo, to be honest... They started out as #2 in a lot of people's minds - and they tried harder, imo. Can't think of another up'r of anything that ALWAYS included subs, for example (not to mention that they continued for several years after scrutiny had tripled, at least. Long after Axxo went to ground).

Anyway (didn't mean to ramble on this much).... I'll miss 'em - but knowing that they left the party while it was still safe for them, and that the powers that be won't be fucking getting them - makes their departure as happy as it is sad, y'know?.

Thanks for everything, FxG Team. Your YEARS (almost a decade that i know of) of work and community contribution are sincerely appreciated, and will be remembered for many years to come. 

F'n Legends."

how should a pirate exit then? with a big fanfare? 

silent exit is the best exit for pirates.
