  Zainub Khan has been found guilty by          
  Pakistan's Courts and is to be hanged. Her    
  last wish is to tell her story before the     
  media, and after approval, she relates how    
  her family was compelled to leave Delhi       
  during 1948 and re-locate to Lahore. This     
  is where her father, Hakim Sayed Hashmutallah 
  Khan, married Suraiya, and hoping to sire a   
  son, instead ended up with 7 daughters. The   
  8th child turned out to be a hermaphrodite    
  and Hashmutullah wanted it dead but Suraiya   
  insisted that she will not let anyone know    
  so as not to shame her husband. They named    
  the child Saifullah, and hired a tutor to     
  teach him at home. After a failed marriage,   
  Zainub returns home, notices that the tutor   
  was molesting her brother and asks him to     
  leave. With dwindling income from his father,
