Go to Upload Torrent and there you are."

,FleshC4,2011-11-04T01:57Z,"Audio: ...meh, it's listenable.
Video: I don't like it. It's often blurry and feels like its recorded from a TV screen. Which is probably the case :p
If you wanna watch it for the story, go for it. It's not THAT bad, you can see what's going on, just not too clearly."
