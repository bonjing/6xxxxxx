[/b][/color] Paul is a young man who is haunted by apocalyptic dreams that neither his therapist or best friend, Mac, can provide answers for.
Worse still, Paul is starting to see the Fades ??? the spirits of the dead ??? all around him.

They're everywhere but they can't be seen, smelt, heard or touched by living beings.
But now an embittered and vengeful Fade has found a way to break the barrier between the dead and the living and Paul, Mac and their friends and family are all right in the eye of the storm.
