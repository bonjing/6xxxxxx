Auralux is an abstract, essentialized, and simplified real-time strategy game.

You have only one type of unit to command and only one type of order to give those units. You and your opponents start the game with equal resources. Quick reflexes will get you nowhere. The only path to victory is through clever strategy.

Auralux features a slow, floating feel and gorgeous minimalistic graphics. The entire world pulses to the rhythm of ambient music, and the players actions evoke sounds that smoothly coalesce into melody.

This game is meant to provide a relaxing, cerebral experience. Every action has its reaction, and every option has its costs. Auralux is a game in which your choices matter. 

Have fun, everyone!
