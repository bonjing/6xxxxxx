Your incompetence in getting the game to run correctly does not make it a bad file, believe it or not you will have the EXACT same problem with any other NTSC-U version of the game, it is not a bad dump. You will only have different results if you download PAL, which I doubt you will get to work at all on an NTSC-U Wii.

There are several individuals who have gotten this to work flawlessly (including me). I was able to play this on USB Loader GX without any problems, didn't have to change a thing or use any special settings.

If you read this entire thread you will find a solution that works for you, if you happen to not be so lucky:

,sjdiekf,2011-10-26T06:11Z,"i did not mean to offend your file or yourself in anyway so take a chill pill... first off I am a programmer and am not stupid when it comes to file conversions/transfers/usage. I have over 100 games for my wii which i have had chipped first, and eventually softmodded in order to play games from my HDD, tried various settings so you may be right maybe I am unlucky but until now nothing I have tried I have been successful with.

In that case, use this guide to install the cIOS d2x v6 base 56 in slot 249. It will most likely work for you if you try different loaders afterward.

http://www.wiihacks.com/other-faq-guides-tutorials/88654-d2x-cios-installation-guide.html

You were not offensive, I like to hear feedback and perhaps I was a little hasty. My goal is to help others get any Wii game working properly (NTSC-U), and all torrents labeled ""wiiGM"" work flawlessly unless limitations are otherwise noted."
,xlos_crudos4x,2011-10-26T08:27Z,IDK what these people are talking about. Works perfectly
,0xalis,2011-10-26T15:53Z,"Wtf... I never said it was a bad dump, I was just asking what ios you used because I couldn't get it to work on my 
D2x 249... but now that you said that's what you use, I  guess I have some work to do when I go home."
,jkyriac,2011-10-26T18:02Z,"i must admit, i was reaaaally disappointed, when i got that freeze problem. Ultimately i got it to work with configurable usb loader. Thank you for this awesome upload, and wbfs is great. Faster to download and just as great."
,sjdiekf,2011-10-26T21:32Z,"so I fixed it. I tried the D2x but I couldnt get it to work. Every time I tried the install, it just kept corrupting my usb loader... so i installed my original CIOS that i had, and deleted my usb loader completely, and reinstalled it with the usb loader GX from the website, and it worked. I am assuming that it is due to an out of date usb loader.  hopefully this helps other. I take back the ""it doesn't work"" comment. it works flawlessly once the usb loader was updated"
,0xalis,2011-10-27T01:35Z,"Ok SO, I finally got it to work. I'm still using d2x 249 on config usb loader, but the problem was I was playing from SD card. For some reason, this game would not work playing from SD card. What I had to do was put my sd card in a USB reader, and use a second SD card to run the loader and then load this as a USB drive.
So, if you plan on using an SD card... don't keep your hopes up.
Thanks for awesome upload Hobbit"
,Robstar360,2011-10-27T02:29Z,"Here is a surefire way to get it to work, very simple. Simply download and install as a WAD the latest Neogamma Channel (Release 9 Beta 47), then use the Wii Download Manager to convert the WBFS file to an ISO and burn to a blank DVD-R. Works great no freezes. Enjoy the game everybody =)"
,nuttybuddy,2011-10-27T07:13Z,I have read all of the comments and loaded the ios wad pack. I have followed the d2x instructions and i still get a black screen when I use ios 249 or 250 and it freezes after the title screen when I use ios 222 or 223. What else can I do? All of my other usb games work fine.
,nuttybuddy,2011-10-27T07:42Z,Just needed the newest version of USB Loader GX. Thanks for the great game upload HobbitGamez.
,rehevkor,2011-10-27T17:04Z,Froze at the main menu. Updated USB Loader GX and it worked. Cheers.
,Feefsbaked,2011-10-27T19:10Z,"Well. This is in WBFS file format you say? I do not understand why, but my Wii backup fusion will not even recognize this file, so i can add it to my HDD (which is formatted in WBFS format) WBFS manager wont even recognize it. OP should have just uploaded it as an ISO and saved everbody alot of grief.."

it just doesnt work, its a crap torrent."
[V],HobbitGamez,2011-10-31T19:16Z,"@zomgbilly

First of all, there is no such loader as ""cfg usb loader gx."" There is configurable usb loader, and there is usb loader gx.

Second of all, update your system menu to 4.3 like a smart person before 4.4 comes out this December and you lose the chance.

Third of all, update USB loader GX and install the cIOS d2x v6 base 56 in slot 249. If you can manage to do this (which I sincerely doubt) you might be able to get past the first boss stage.

It is important to note that your inability to get past the first boss stage without it freezing does not preponderate the fact that everyone else eventually got it working with a little effort. What I'm ultimately saying is, it's your fault, not mine, and you won't find success with another north american version downloaded elsewhere. So suck it up and get it working for yourself, and for everyone's sake stop complaining about your own ineptitude."
[V],HobbitGamez,2011-10-31T19:24Z,"@zomgbilly

I also forgot to add that because your Wii is PAL (European), I can't claim that this game will work with it anyway. There is only a chance that it will work, but if it doesn't in the end you are out of luck.

The PAL version is set to be released November 25th, so I guess you'll have to wait until then."

First of all I have the newest version of USBloader 2.3 using CIOS 222
I have 4.3 for Wii menu.
I have applied the error 002 fix for the load.

Basically I load the game just fine. When I get to the menu and hit 2 to continue. I hear a tone and about 3 seconds of music loops continuously. This is where it freezes.

If anyone else has had this error and fixed it please let me know how. Thanks."

,gusi78a,2011-11-23T04:11Z,I thought it was fake or didnt work because it was less than 4.00 gb and it wasnt tranfering the first time on wii backup manager. If it doesnt work the first time close wii backup manager then open it up again. Then it should tranfer :D im going to see if it works now

Later did some research and found that, I need to uncheck force English language setting in usb loader gx and set English language in wii setting. Unfortunately mine is a Japanese import wii, and don't have English language change option menu. Is there any other way to play this game? I would really appreciate any help. Thx."
