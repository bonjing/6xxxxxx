In recent times, a number of business leaders have forgotten the fundamental rules of business strategy. Consequently they have led their companies to collapse, provoking an economic and financial crisis. Obsessed with short-term returns, they have overlooked the fact that the real purpose of corporate strategy is not only to make quick profit but more importantly to create an organization that will endure. There is much to learn from the experience of established firms that have existed for a hundred years and more. They provide the material for this clear and concise book, which presents ten lessons that detail the main elements of corporate strategy. Recognizing that each firm is unique, the book resists the temptation of quick fixes, instead offering lessons to be pondered and used on a case-by-case basis.
