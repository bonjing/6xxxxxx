I couldn't find this anywhere on the web so I bought it on Amazon...

It's a pretty amazing 2 CD set with some of the best jazz instrumentals by the great quintet Carla Bley / Michael Mantler / Larry Coryell / Tony Williams and Steve Swallow. Coryell's solos are just insane...

If you are a fan of Zappa's work, this will certainly appeal to you.






You're very welcome
