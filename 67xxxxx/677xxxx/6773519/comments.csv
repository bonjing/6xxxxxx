[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-26T23:28Z,"Well, from a guy who just got into the Ultimate universe - start at the beginning, it all builds on itself. So even if you just start this volume at #1 your be a little lost"
,Calel1234,2011-10-28T07:52Z,Thanks for the head's up. But that kind of makes me definitely not want to start with Ultimates. I don't want to hunt down each comic and learn a whole new universe (although that's what I did with DC comics).
