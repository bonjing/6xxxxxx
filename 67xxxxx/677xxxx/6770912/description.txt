Your Uninstaller! Pro 7.4.2011.10

===============================================================================

Overview:

You've probably encountered some stubborn programs that just won't uninstall 
at all or uninstall completely, right? And, more often than not, when you use 
the Windows Add/Remove Program utility, there are remnants or "artifacts" of 
the program left behind in the system registry and on your hard drive that 
are no longer needed. These useless items will bog your PC down and, over time, 
it will get slower and slower lugging around this useless baggage - unexpected 
errors and frequent crashes may also occur because of this!

What's the problem?

Let's say you frequently install trial versions of programs to check them out. 
And let's also say that, after giving them a shot, you don't like them and 
decide to uninstall them. Unfortunately, you find it impossible to uninstall 
some of them - they remain on the Windows installed programs list even they 
are "supposedly" gone. These improperly uninstalled programs can also be the 
cause of errors because many junk files and registry keys/values were left 
behind on your PC. These 'junk artifacts' can - and do - cause system problems 
and slow down Windows substantially.

Here's the solution!

Your Uninstaller! will solve these problems. It removes any installed program 
and clears all the left-behind traces - no more 'junk artifacts' remaining. 
Whenever you uninstall a program, Your Uninstaller! removes it completely! 
There's absolutely nothing left behind.

"PCs inevitably accrue a mass of unwanted and unused files that eat up system 
resources and reduce system stability. Uninstalling these items can be an 
arduous task, but Your Uninstaller Pro simplifies the process considerably..."
