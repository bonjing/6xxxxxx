There hasn't even been a release of either version of this game on torrentleech. I know I have my browser reloading every minute, so I can get it right away. P.S. The way things are going it doesn't seem like there will be a version release for this game today, which I hope isn't the case."

,ChadBargo,2011-10-26T02:04Z,@chrisssj2 your 360 has aids from playing all of those mother f@cking gay games
,Master3055,2011-10-26T06:42Z,"@chrisssj2

3524 un hexed equals 13604, thats the dash update u gotta get, i had the same prob except i had error 351f in the second set of numbers which equals 13599 and i updated with the 13599 dash and it went back to normal. Once u get the screen up all ur backups wont work because updating would have flashed ur drive back to stock so u gotta flash it again to LT2.0"
