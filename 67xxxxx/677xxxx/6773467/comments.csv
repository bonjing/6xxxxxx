,ChadBargo,2011-10-26T20:59Z,"download this and run it through a program called x360hacktool , i will convert pal into region free games"
,ChadBargo,2011-10-26T21:00Z,"sorry, its called x360gamehack , version 6.3 is what i use"
,chronic2011,2011-10-26T21:09Z,No one needs this dude bring out a region free or ntsc one. This exact torrent has been out since 2 days ago and TPB just gets it. Most ppl already have it we all need ntsc.
,chronic2011,2011-10-26T21:11Z,And wuts the point of changing the region? Not all pal are in english you know? This could be in a foreign language no point
[V],boobsman,2011-10-27T00:13Z,"I upload on multiple torrent sites not just TPB if this has already been uploaded great don't download! This is the only version about at the moment, NO REGION FREE, NO NTSC!!! "
,chronic2011,2011-10-27T00:50Z,"To everyone, xbox360iso.com has the NTSC one"
,Zenman1976,2011-10-27T01:40Z,"Surely using anything like x360gamehack to change the region setting of the ISO would be recognised as a modification.

By all means correct me if I am wrong. "

,Damian1373,2012-03-01T09:56Z,"Hello, could someone please answer something for me. When I downloaded this game I was sure that I had LT1.9 so when I put the disc in and clicked update, it failed. Now everytime I turn my xbox on, it stays on that screen and asks for the update, so I cannot play any games anymore. Turns out I don't have LT1.9.. Now if I am to update to LT1.9 and then put the disc back in, will it update and fix the problem. Any help will be extremely greatful. Thank you"
