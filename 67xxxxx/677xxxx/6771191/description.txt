Review:
I use this over other similar software because:
- HostsMan can Optimize your "hosts" file for better, faster, consumption by your PC. It can find duplicates, edit, remove comments, swap localhost address, etc.
- You can even add your own favorite update list and HostsMan will check, update, optimize, then merge into your "hosts" file. It has a few default list built in.
- It comes with an optional "Server".
- Anything related to the "hosts" file: HostsMan can handle... unlike other similar software that only edit.

Not familiar with the benefits of using the "hosts" file?
