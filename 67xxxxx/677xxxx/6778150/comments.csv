Why would you suddenly stop uploading it in a timely manner? Could you please upload it soom - like you used to do - before I inadvertantly find out who won before I have a chance to watch the show? Why wait a week to upload it all of a sudden? Why do such a thing now, of all times, when it's the finale??? I don't understand! So could you please, pretty-please-I'm-begging-you please upload it? It's the last episode of the season! So please upload it. Please? Please! Please?!? "
