,xenoFLASH,2011-10-29T09:27Z,"fuck scenebalance; never dl anything from him. I gots mine, no thanks to you."
,canoli99,2011-10-29T09:32Z,"I had hoped most people who were watching Bill Maher were pretty good people. Enlightened, fair-minded, decent. 

Turns out a lot of them are miserable fks who would need promotions to become A-holes. 

Seriously how pathetic ... Imagine knowing these punks in real life? I guarantee nobody wants to. 

They don't deserve Bill Maher. ha!

,BoonesFerry,2011-10-29T09:36Z,"UGH! This torrent has been out for more than an hour, there are 730 peers, 15 seeders, and downloading at only 2 kB/s. On comparable torrents I usually download at 1.5 MB/s. This is ridiculous. Where is eztv or one of the others that are capable of actually seeding their torrents until they take off? Scenebalance has been a big disappointment lately. "
