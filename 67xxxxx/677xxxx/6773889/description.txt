UNDERSTANDING PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCH, Ninth Edition, takes an example-based approach to the fundamentals of research methodology. Organized by topicâ€”such as research in human factors, learning, thinking, and problem solvingâ€”the text helps you connect the concepts of sound methodology with their practical applications. Because the authors use dozens of carefully selected real-world examples, you can see for yourself the issues and problems that can occur in conducting research. More importantly, you can develop a sense of how to anticipate and adjust for problems in your own research.
