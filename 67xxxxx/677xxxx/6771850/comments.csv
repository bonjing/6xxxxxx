,timleft,2011-10-26T07:02Z,is anyone else having a problem connecting to this torrent?
,BoonesFerry,2011-10-26T07:59Z,"Yup 600 downloaders and no seeders. 
Very odd for a TvTeam torrent. 

I'm going to try one of the 720 versions that have more seeds...double the file size but then the show is less than 30 minutes so the file size is reasonable, only 300mb. "
,yamba24,2011-10-26T13:46Z,what the fuck is going on?
,ourhero,2011-10-26T17:12Z,"Yea I downloaded to 99.9% super quick, now its sitting there infinitely at ~1.5 KB/s. Dammit. "
,coyotedogg,2011-10-26T17:38Z,What is up with this torrent...stuck on 95.9%....are there any others with avi files...all i can find are mkv files...is there a good free player for mkv out there?
