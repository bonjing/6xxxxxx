,callofdutyfreak55,2011-10-26T04:35Z,why did you delete my comment? is it really a trojan?
,EonsWrath,2011-10-26T06:12Z,it says that because it's like the description says: Antivirus will never be too smart.
,EonsWrath,2011-10-26T06:20Z,"Can't start game. Something about FMOD not working and that i should reinstall, thoughts?"
[T],alexisthebest,2011-10-26T08:35Z,"@callofdutyfreak55
it's a false positive. And i do not have the power to delete comments nor did your comment go away.

@EonsWrath
there's a new update that i should be uploading, wait for that and see if that helps. If not i guess fresh install."

You might be missing things such as Visual C++ and .Net Framework.
