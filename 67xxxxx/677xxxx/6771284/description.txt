Included DLCs:
- Knight of the Order costume
- Orc Slayer costume

- Artifacts of Power + War Mage's Toolbox: Expand your Orcs Must Die! arsenal with two new weapons and two new traps. With the Artifacts of Power in your spellbook, youâ€™ll be demolishing levels, beating your friends on the leaderboards, and most importantly, killing a bunch of orcs deader than dead. Only the best tools for the last surviving War Mage!
- New upgrades: Spend skulls on new upgrades for Shock Zapper and Floor Scorcher.
- Alchemistâ€™s Satchel: Drop a series deadly acid bombs and skeletonize multiple groups of Orcs at once.
- Shock Zapper: Zap fliers and ground units equally dead with this oversized pest remover.
- Vampiric Gauntlets: Drain the enemyâ€™s health while healing you at the same time.
- Floor Scorcher: Burn entire waves of complacent enemies with this pop-up flaming surprise.


Changes:
- Added minimum processor check warning dialog on startup. The game will still run, but we'll let you know on install if you might be encountering problems because of your machine being below spec.
- Added keyboard locale override from user.cfg - read below for user.cfg details
- Added full-screen window mode support in user.cfg - read below for user.cfg details
- Fixed a bug for posting to leaderboards
- Fixed a bug for posting to total orc count
- Fixed a bug on the button not going to the nightmare leaderboards
- Fixed a startup issue on machines with multiple video cards. This should help many people with the "Failed to Initialize" issues.

Instructions for using "user.cfg" to customize Orcs Must Die!
- Navigate to D:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\orcs must die!\data\startup\ and create a text file called user.cfg
- Edit user.cfg and add options from the list below to change your settings:

    window
    - This will force the game to run in Windowed Mode. Currently we donâ€™t have a way to move the window around/reposition it. We did this mainly as an option for people that want to run windowed mode but full screen.

    KeyboardLayout="AZERTY"
    KeyboardLayout=â€QWERTYâ€
    KeyboardLayout=â€QWERTZâ€
    - Use one of these to override the locale selection that the game is using to pick your keyboard layout. Setting this will force the game to use the layout that you specify in user.cfg
