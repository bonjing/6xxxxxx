ur comment""@atik0786: I never said people shouldn't upload upscales. I just wanted to know why you uploaded an upscale.""
this sounds decent.the first time u asked me was
""why the hell did you upload an upscale?""

so the word hell made me a lil mad..but if u want to know it, then the reason is that i just encoded it for some timepass..n the output quality was gr8..so hence i uploaded it..
n about asking the questions thing..u can ask me a million questions..i'll ans them 2 u calmly..but yes u should know the words that u use while saying or asking something..so i just had the problem with that..nothing personal bro..so im sorry myself..but i dont like such words..so please forgive me"
