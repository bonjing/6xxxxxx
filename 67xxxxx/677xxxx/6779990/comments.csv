,deeteedub,2011-10-29T07:23Z,How can this be 720p if it's only 300 MB?
[T],insane86,2011-10-29T07:31Z,please look at the sample!!
,Evilution,2011-10-29T07:49Z,"The screenshot with colors looks like a badly compressed DVD scaled up. no thanks, waiting for a 720p release that actually looks like one.
Quality on this is good enough for watching on mobile phones maybe."
,jokerok92,2011-10-29T08:03Z,Where is the sample?
[T],insane86,2011-10-29T08:16Z,SAMPLE IS IN THE TORRENT FILE!!!!!!!
,deeteedub,2011-10-29T08:17Z,You ARE NOT going to get a 1280 x 720 resolution for a one hour show in a 300 MB file.  It's not possible.  I don't care what video format you use!
,a321a,2011-10-29T08:27Z,891 Kbps for 720p tv show? Are you kidding me? People were using higher bitrates ten years ago for cam rips.
[T],insane86,2011-10-29T08:54Z,"see the sample and after looking at the sample, i let you to talk. Before that SHUT THE FUCK UP. Sample is 2MB and 720p."
