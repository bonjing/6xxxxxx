Five books, published in Spain in the 1990s. 


DiseÃ±os Orbitales published about a dozen books beginning in 1990. Ediciones Zinco published about a half-dozen beginning in 1995.


I found two of these (1001, 1003) on individual torrents; the other three through direct downloads. I'm still looking for the rest.


From DiseÃ±os Orbitales:
1001: La Zarpa del Zorro
1003: Las CrÃ³nicas de la CompaÃ±Ã­a Viuda Negra
1007: BattleTech: Manual de Referencia TÃ©cnica 3025
1010: Los Demonios de Kell


And from Ediciones Zinco:
013: Manual TÃ©cnico 3050
