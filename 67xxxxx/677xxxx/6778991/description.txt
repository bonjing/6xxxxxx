PES PATCH v2.0 and v2.0.1 (Patch Fix)

(Both Separate Installations)




I have downloaded this from www.pes-patch.com/

This worked for me doing the following so would like to help others...




1. Before Installing Delete the folder â€œkitserverâ€ from the PES 2012 main 

   directory if you have installed a Kitserver before.

 

2. In the folder "PESEdit.com 2012 Patch 2.0" Install the Patch using "install.exe"
 
   (Make sure to choose the directory you installed PES 2012)



3. In the folder "PESEdit.com 2012 v2.0.1 (Patch Fix)" Install the Patch Fix 

   using "install.exe"
 
   (Make sure to choose the directory you installed PES 2012)

 

4. Start the game via "pes2012.exe" (Run as Administrator)




PLEASE NOTE:


The Kitserver should automatically attach itself


To Check this go to 

C:\Program Files\KONAMI\Pro Evolution Soccer 2012\kitserver


Open manager.exe. as Administrator
