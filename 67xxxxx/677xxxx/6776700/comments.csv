Coalition Fight Music (CFM) is the worldâ€™s most successful independent band. After years of heartbreak chasing potential Record deals, the two acts/lifelong friends The Relles (Dolla Bill & Unlabeld aka Nasty Nate) and Statecyde (Tony Savo) decided to partner together and â€œsignâ€ themselves.

Dubbed by many in the fight media as â€œThe Kings of Fight Musicâ€ the band/company formally established the genre of â€œFight Musicâ€ (made specifically for Action/Combat Sports) and revolutionized the sports industry by allocating a portion of record sales/digital download revenues to athletes as a form of sponsorship.

Much like a Professional Mixed Martial Artist combines different forms of combat to win a fight; CFM combines Rock/Rap/Dance/Pop and R&B to produce cutting edge/next level family friendly entertainment. Coalition Fight Music have been featured on BBC, SKY TV, TIME/WARNER, ESPN, USA Today, Tapout/MMA WorldWide, Wartime TV, Mauro Ranalloâ€™s â€œThe Fight Showâ€ on Sirius Satellite Radio and Sports Illustrated. The band recently contributed two songs to E3â€²s 2011 â€œFight Game of the Yearâ€ Supremacy MMA (Xbox360 & PS3) in stores now!"
