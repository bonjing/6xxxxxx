,Sirius22,2011-10-29T06:31Z,"Nevermind, it must be fake. The real SpaceChem torrent is only ~72mB"
,Sutsuga,2011-10-29T20:21Z,it's bigger because it has linux and mac version...
,OmniNegro,2011-10-30T01:09Z,"I am sorry, but Raring it is a bad idea. Windows users have no need or even desire for the Linux or MacOS versions.

If they were not Rared, people could pick and choose. And people would not have to unrar to find the MD5 checksum to verify that it is not tainted with malware.

You could possibly salvage this by simply posting the checksums in the comments here, but people will always favor the smaller version specific to their OS.

I understand you want the other versions hosted too, but you have to leave that alone. You cannot force a change, but you can allow it to happen.

Good luck with the torrent. I purchased the game with the last Humble Bundle. So I have no need of it."
