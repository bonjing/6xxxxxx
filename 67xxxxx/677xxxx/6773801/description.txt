The A-List Dallas S01E03 Revenge and Karma's a Bitch

UPDATE:
      I know there are a lot of you out there who probably don't get LOGO or don't have a TV (like myself), but really want to watch this show.  Soooooo I ended up getting a season pass for this show and I will be uploading episode one later today so keep an eye out for that.


       Right now my method of conversion (from a protected m4v) is less than ideal to say the least so if you have any suggestions that are quick AND/OR better quality then let me know in the comments or in an email (M8R-1cm8i21 AT mailinator DOT com).  I would really appreciate any help, because I am new at this.  So I should be posting new episodes every Tuesday night PST (granted that an episode was aired that week, obviously).  Sorry I was really late on uploading the last few episodes, but it should be pretty consistent from now on (Tuesday night PST as I mentioned), I'm not going to make any exact promises on the specific time since my schedule is hectic.

PS:
    Haha. I love how you can totally see my desktop at the beginning of this (ugh this is why I need a better conversion method).
