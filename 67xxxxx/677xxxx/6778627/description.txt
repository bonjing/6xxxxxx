A moving testament to one of the literary world's most celebrated marriages: that of the greatest playwright of our age, Harold Pinter, and the beautiful and famous prize-winning biographer Antonia Fraser.

In this exquisite memoir, Antonia Fraser recounts the life she shared with the internationally renowned dramatist. In essence, it is a love story and a marvelously insightful account of their years together, beginning with their initial meeting when Fraser was the wife of a member of Parliament and mother of six, and Pinter was married to a distinguished actress. Over the years, they experienced much joy, a shared devotion to their work, crises and laughter, and, in the end, great courage and love as Pinter battled the illness to which he eventually sucÂ­cumbed on Christmas Eve 2008.

Must You Go? is based on Fraserâ€™s recollections and on the diaries she has kept since October 1968. She shares Pinterâ€™s own revelations about his past, as well as observations by his friends. Fraserâ€™s diariesâ€”written by a biographer living with a creative artist and observing the process firsthandâ€”also proÂ­vide a unique insight into his writing.

Harold Pinter and Antonia Fraser lived together from August 1975 until his death thirty-three years later. â€œO! call back yesterday, bid time return,â€ cries one of the courtiers to Richard II. This is Antonia Fraserâ€™s uniquely compelling way of doing so.
