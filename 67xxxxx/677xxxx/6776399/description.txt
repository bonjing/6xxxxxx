Owen Bishop's First Course starts with the basics of electricity and component types, introducing students to practical work almost straight away. No prior knowledge of electronics is required.

The approach is student-centred with self-test features to check understanding, including numerous activities suitable for practicals, homework and other assignments. Multiple choice questions are incorporated throughout the text in order to aid student learning. Key facts, formulae and definitions are highlighted to aid revision, and theory is backed up by numerous examples within the book. Each chapter ends with a set of problems that includes exam-style questions, for which numerical answers are provided at the end of the book.

This text is ideal for a wide range of introductory courses in electronics, technology, physics and engineering. The coverage has been carefully matched to the latest UK syllabuses including GCSE Electronics, GCSE Design & Technology, Engineering GCSE and Edexcel's BTEC First in Engineering, resulting in a text that meets the needs of students on all Level 2 electronics units and courses.

Owen Bishop's talent for introducing the world of electronics has long been a proven fact with his textbooks, professional introductions and popular circuit construction guides being chosen by thousands of students, lecturers and electronics enthusiasts.
