    The experts examine how scientists are fighting for our    
    survival by battling the world's big killer diseases.     
                                                             
    Biologist Aarathi Prasad joins virus hunters in the       
    jungles of Africa, Robert Winston sees first-hand how      
    the surgeons of the future could be robots, capable of    
    operating round the clock, and Richard Dawkins           
    investigates the way brain disorders might one day be     
    treated using laser light and genetically modified         
    brain cells.                                              
                                                             
    Anatomist Joy Reidenberg discovers two possible           
    solutions to the killer disease malaria and - most         
    extraordinarily of all - Aarathi Prasad meets a woman     
    whose life has been saved by a revolutionary new cancer  
    treatment, in which every patient gets an individually    
    tailored cocktail of drugs.                                
                                                              
    From the jungles of Cameroon to the quads of Oxford,     
    the programme celebrates the work of scientists           
    striving to extend and save our lives.
