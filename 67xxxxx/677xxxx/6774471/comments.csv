,nicodemvs,2011-10-27T15:02Z,"Video freezes from 46:45 to 52:25, audio continues during this period.
Also, the audio is messed up in the first 30 seconds or so (before the titles)."
,Simnos,2011-10-27T18:33Z,"Sweet, now this is something I will defineitely enjoy. Thanks!"
,chandlerboy,2011-10-27T18:35Z,"POOR upload. Video freezes for a large period of time. Ruining the last third of the programme.

Please re-upload properly."

[T],eXPer1ence,2011-11-02T01:05Z,"Thanks to eztv for providing this incredible programme.

If you are in any doubt about downloading this, DO download it! 

I thought ""oh just another wildlife programme"" but my dad had some clips on catchup and it looked amazing so I grabbed the full programme and OMG, one of the best programmes I have ever seen. 

People knock the BBC including me for their bias media but this is simply the planet Earth as you have never been able to see it before, the BBC is miles ahead of anyone when it comes to making wildlife programmes, even the US doesn't put out anything like the same in depth programme as the BBC with wildlife.

David Attenborough should have Sir in front of his name for doing this. Watching the end of this episode you will see and realize the risks taken to make the programme. 

10/10"
,chandlerboy,2011-11-04T05:35Z,"Annoying irresponsible comment above.

Yes, Download this programme, DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS PARTICULAR FILE as it is faulty, corrupt as is clearly stated by most of the previous comments.

What's the point of having people with a pink skull comment if they're not going to do it in a correctly informative way?"
[T],eXPer1ence,2011-11-04T20:55Z,Maybe because I watched the entire video and at no point saw anything wrong with the video or audio?
[T],eXPer1ence,2011-11-04T20:57Z,"Also I never asked for the pink skull and still don't know why I have it, or care."
[T],eXPer1ence,2011-11-04T20:58Z,"Alright I got thebox.bz version sorry, I must have watched that one thinking it was this one :("
[T],eXPer1ence,2011-11-04T20:58Z,"I got the box .bz one and thought it was this one, sorry."
,souljah99,2011-11-16T22:40Z,I read that America chose not to buy the final episode for their discovery Channel for political reasons as it is about Climate Change!! SMH
,DrCrazyAPE,2011-12-31T20:01Z,"Stunning really, Thanks a lot !!!"
,JQronaldo,2012-03-29T23:45Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD! 

Video freezes about 46 minutes in, leaves behind only audio. I know it's called ""Frozen Planet"" but that wasn't supposed to include a ""Frozen"" video!! "
