,beastess,2011-10-28T22:03Z,"No! Please keep in splitting the tracks -I am so thankful that you do.  That way, we can know the name and keep the stuff we really like.  Thank you inspiron, you already know you are the love of my life. "
[T],-inspiron-,2011-10-28T23:02Z,"Hey guys, here's the update:

I will not continue splitting tracks because many requests came concerning leaving it in one file, 
HAHAHAHAHAH, just kidding, will not stop splitting them :P scared right:P? i will keep them coming, if you want the uncut ASOT, search for it, the split version is hard to get and that's what i provide, plus albums and requests :D

Thanks for the support guys and hope you like it :D, cheers"
