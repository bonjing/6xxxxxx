Designed to give readers the "building blocks" of electricity concepts, the sequence of topics and practical applications in this book will provide a solid foundation in electron theory and movement, direct-current series circuits, parallel circuits, series-parallel circuits, voltage line drops, rotating machinery fundamentals, and more! Electricity 1: Devices, Circuits and Materials, 9th Edition follows the same user-friendly approach that made previous editions so effective, while incorporating updates based on the 2008 National Electrical Code. Featuring current industry terminology, photographs of commonly used electrical equipment, and sample problems with solutions, this is an ideal choice for a first course in basic electricity, house wiring, or commercial installations.
