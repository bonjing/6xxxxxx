  SimCity Societies
  
  Featuring an all-new, revolutionary feature set, SimCity Societies allows 
  you to create your own kinds of cities and shape their cultures and 
  environments. Make your cities green or polluted, contemporary or 
  futuristic, rural or urban. Create an artistic society or a police state, 
  an industrial city or a spiritual community?or any society you want!
  
  
  SimCity Destinations

  SimCity Societies Destinations enhances the SimCity Societies experience by
  providing all the tools you need to create an entire city or town based on 
  attractions and amenities that visitors enjoy. With an enhanced map 
  generator, players can identify each city?s opportunity for diversion and 
  the city can capitalise on that draw. From sprawling theme parks and 
  tropical beach resorts to country hiking trails, players can control more 
  than 100 new buildings to create their customised destination.
