,-R3ap3R-,2011-10-27T01:56Z,"Pointless rip unless you cant bebothered to download a bigger file..... 


The quality of this rip just looks like a DVD rip Upscaled!!! Why would you do this.... ? 


All 720P bluray rips should be atleast 2GB "
,lol69lol,2011-10-27T02:02Z,"^ wow I feel so sorry for you,you must be retarded... its MP4 man."
,lol69lol,2011-10-27T02:06Z,"here is a we bit of a comparison:

DVDRip (1.4gb) http://www.hotimg.com/direct/uqsxQvk.jpg

720p BrRip YIFY (1GB) http://i.imgur.com/6AyS5.png

I dont know about you but I know what one I think is better"
,ramashu,2011-10-27T03:16Z,"@-R3ap3R- : I dont agree with you..  any bluray 720p rip need not be in 2GB size or more... at less size like this also you get very good quality... I play YIFY rips in my 36"" LCD TV & the picture looks so perfect with no pixel breaks what so ever... It is certainly a Blu-ray quality & no match to DVDrips...

+1"
,albokid89,2011-10-27T03:38Z,"ayo thats whats goodie FXG might be doing more movies but their quality is trash in front of YIFY keep it up brother! +1 Thank you!

,-R3ap3R-,2011-10-27T12:38Z,"When your watching this on a SensEye Technology LED 60inch screen you can see every pixel... So for me it was pointless downloading. 

Waiting for FASM release as he even produced 1080p files between 2.2gb to 3gb and they look amazing. 
"
,dmaurya,2011-10-27T14:56Z,"#albokid89 
I did the search mate but I'd posted the comment earlier."
,tony419,2011-10-27T18:34Z,"@-R3ap3R- Why tell us the type of screen you watching this on? Can't you just quietly wait for the download that suits you, why mention the TV specs, you vain human? "
,Symn,2011-10-27T19:55Z,"yeaaahh make a special torrent of this in 1080, just  for R3ap3R and his super-TV. The most spoiled son of a bitch in the world."
,impinoy,2011-10-27T23:50Z,audio format? is this 2 or 6 channels? thank you yify

,hemingway60,2011-10-28T13:59Z,"Great quality as always! I just have one question, is there any way to reduce the size of the black lines on top and bottom. They're REALLY annoying on my 16:9 screen.
Thanks YIFY"

,Goddly82,2011-11-04T00:27Z,"lol..   if you ever tried to rip a movie and compress it you can talk, but if you havent dont comment about file size and quality.. You sound like a moron.. a 1080p needs to be a bigger size from a quality standpoint and 2gb 1080p yify rip would be BEAST.."

LONG LIVE YIFY! "
,Rehman5000,2012-04-05T04:51Z,"Really awesome work YIFY!

Just wondering though, would you be able to crunch all your potters to fit into 4.69GB? So that it may be written onto a data dvd? Looking all that you were capable of, I think that should be possible, but I don't know...

It would be really really cool!

Thanks again!"
