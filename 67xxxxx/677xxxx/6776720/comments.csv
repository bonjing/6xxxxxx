,black_shadow_1981,2011-10-28T00:27Z,"hi thanks for the upload is this game the new XGD3 disc format?

i ask because im still waiting for my new drive to turn up "
,masi50,2011-10-28T13:08Z,seed pls!!!
,treetall,2011-10-28T13:45Z,"Thanks for the upload, but I can't find the image file in it... am I missing something or do I need to process this file through some programs to get that little file?"
,Camari,2011-10-28T13:55Z,"Agreed no image file here either, abgx says its not a recognized iso "
,LoneStrider21,2011-10-28T14:08Z,Mine won't connect to anybody what do I do.
,noalcoholjuzsoda,2011-10-28T14:42Z,do you need the new firmware update for this to play?
,black_shadow_1981,2011-10-28T15:49Z,"use winrar to uncompressed the file then you should get a useable iso file and .dvd file 

im still trying to find out if this is the new XGD3 format? 

t i dont have the new drive yet, once i know i will be able to download and burn (if its XGD2 and not 3)"
,black_shadow_1981,2011-10-28T15:50Z,you need the new dash and LT2.0 (im not sure about the format as noone seems to be saying)
,black_shadow_1981,2011-10-28T15:54Z,"if abgx isnt working with the iso it could be because its the new disc format

abgx that works with XGD3 isnt out yet but they are working on it!!!

 games made with the new LT MAX burners software will be safe because its a 1:1 copy 

ITS NEVER 100% SAFE TO PLAY BACKUPS ONLINE "
,CrazyHand,2011-10-28T16:34Z,"Burned twice and it still doesn't work, got a open tray message both times.
 The RAR files don't even include a .dvd file."
,m3ll0nh34d,2011-10-28T18:53Z,"I'm gonna say fake. The archive inside the rars is named ""rrod-xmd.iso"" which is X-Men: Destiny released by RRoD. "
,Camari,2011-10-28T21:57Z,"its not the new format guys, if it was it would be about 8 gibs, the problem is abgx wont recognize it and no .dvd file  "
,m3ll0nh34d,2011-10-29T00:05Z,"It actually is the new format, XGD3 as Xmen was when it was released and that is the reason abgx360 doesn't recognize it yet.

The .dvd file really doesn't matter its a 2 line text file, if you can't create one then your knowledge of xbox backups is truly limited. "
,xeusoi16,2011-10-29T00:19Z,"works great, thx"
,Psycho42,2011-10-29T00:20Z,"Yeah this is definitely fake. Not the right size for an XGD3, otherwise it would be 8.13gb. So I thought maybe it was the old format, but if it was it would have gone through ABGX but it isn't recognized by it. Unfortunately fake...."
,pcdaley21,2011-10-29T00:53Z,"No .dvd file...
m3ll0nh34d - create one and upload it then smart arse!"
,ohrightpl8s,2011-10-29T01:39Z,"very fast, good deff."
,m3ll0nh34d,2011-10-29T08:11Z,"pcdaley21: I'm not going to create a dvd file for this as it is a fake. It's X-men: Destiny - RRoD. Again this is a fake torrent but if you still want to download and burn it, creating a dvd file really super simple. 

Just create a text file and put 2 lines in it...

For XGD3 Games:
LayerBreak=2133520
NAME.iso

For regular XGD2 Games:
LayerBreak=1913760
NAME.iso

Replace NAME with the title of your iso and save as NAME.dvd. That's it. Of course older XGD2 games can be run through abgx360 and it can create the same file for you. Or you can set the LayerBreak manually in your burning software."
,mattron89622,2011-10-29T19:06Z,Downloaded and created .dvd with specified layer break for xgd2 and got open tray error on LT+2.0 I would say this is fake although I might try and burn it again with the layer break for xgd3 and see if that works.....doubtful but if it does I'll repost
,vaporizebt,2011-10-30T06:43Z,"Por favor, sube m%-#% !s"
,Krock0,2011-10-30T10:06Z,"So is this fake ? Right ?
Someone to confirm please ."
,Cpt.North,2011-10-30T10:11Z,"Burned it with XGD3 layerbreak and tried it with LT 2.0, and it didnt work.. I was 99% sure it was a fake, as its not on abgx.net yet.. It is a 100% fake, dont waste your time downloading or burning it.. The game will be ripped today or tomorrow.."
,bwaanaa,2011-10-30T11:54Z,"Fake, "
,bwaanaa,2011-10-30T11:55Z,Confirmed fake
,SimStim,2011-10-30T15:38Z,"yup fake..

,DarthPawn,2011-10-30T17:31Z,"I guess it is fake, just woke up after letting in DL last night. I use on JTAG, and xbox image browser says ""Unable to determine disc type"" "
,aomorphed,2011-10-31T02:22Z,"FAKE

Tried both layer breaks
DO NOT WASTE YOUR BANDWIDTH AND DUAL LAYER DISCS AND YOUR TIME DOES NOT WORK"

,LucasChagas,2011-11-01T22:45Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!! THE REAL GAME WILL RELEASE 1/11/2011 DO NOT TRY TO DOWNLOAD THIS GAME  BEFORE IT
,Sivos,2011-11-01T22:45Z,Chances are it won't be released until the 4th.  That's when it comes out in EU so most of the crackers will post it around then.
,vaikou15,2011-11-02T03:14Z,"i said , it works =)"
,saequa253,2011-11-02T21:17Z,mine just finished and it is working fine.  seeding now...relax
,mikethegreat4,2011-11-03T21:18Z,"Tried to burn it twice and it's not working... I wrote the .dvd file 
For XGD3 Games:
LayerBreak=2133520
NAME.iso

This isn't working for this game.The burn works 100%, but my xbox doesn't recognize the disc, and is flashed to 2.0. Any suggestions? I did this with goldeneye and it worked so not sure what's going on wrong."
,SuperGeekNo1,2011-11-14T13:10Z,yeah its fake any xgd3 game is now 8 gig minimum
