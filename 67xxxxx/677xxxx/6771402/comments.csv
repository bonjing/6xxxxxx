,afr126,2012-02-17T03:27Z,"The first movie stutters every 10 seconds, but the rest are fine. Now i have to find a good 1080p copy of the first one."
,Ferrari5180,2012-03-04T22:25Z,"I downloaded only the first movie so far, and it does not stutter at all. You should have a good CPU/GPU to handle the compression and quality though. The quality is grainy, but from my close examination of other uploads, it seems to be a source problem. The only complaints I have is that two words during the entire movie are missing their appropriate volume.

1) When Robert Muldoon and Ellie Sattler find Ian Malcolm under the fallen down bathroom after the T-rex knocks it down. Muldoon says ""Malcolm"" but the voice does not come out.

2) At the end, when they are getting onto the chopper, Ellie Saddler says something, but no volume comes with it, but you can see that she say's something.

Again, it seems to be a source problem among the BluRay edition of the Jurassic Park. On a last note, this is the best 1080p download and compression with the most amount of seeders. I approve this torrent."

I don't own Jurassic Park underwear, t-shirts, mugs, lunch boxes, bedsheets, and my room isn't plastered with JP posters... so I'll pass."
