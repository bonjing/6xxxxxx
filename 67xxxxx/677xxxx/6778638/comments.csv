,.Leto.,2011-10-29T01:58Z,"Fine copy for such a small filesize BUT really, really bad movie. Seriously, I had to stop it after 45 minutes, I couldn't take it anymore. It wasn't going anywhere, no charm whatsoever, just plain boring.
No wonder this movie bombed at the box-office."

,JapesMacF,2012-01-12T10:53Z,"ashen77 wrote that he wonders what diff it makes where someone is from...referencing the UK. Well, because nearly everyone in the UK has a leftist world view, where as only 50% or less do in the US. If you are unaware what dogmas, faith, beliefs and world view make up what is called secular Leftism, than you are ignorant. And BTW, pretending that they have no agenda is the main trick of being a leftist, and I can prove it. A Christian university admits freely that they want to create better Christian citizens. An average liberal arts Uni will *never* admit that they want to create better secular leftists, but they do.  CS Lewis wrote that one of the most powerful tricks of the devil is to convince people that he doesn't exist. It reminds me of this...lol :)"
