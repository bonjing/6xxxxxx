,chandlerboy,2011-10-27T14:02Z,RARing a file for a torrent is completely retarded. Congrats on wasting everyone's time.
,ahorwood,2011-10-27T19:29Z,"chandlerboy what an ungrateful cock. Are you too ineffective to unrar a few files?

Thanks sceneline."
,Hdavila,2011-10-28T00:54Z,"V10/A10 like all of scenline's work

Thank you"
,slackgit,2011-10-28T02:06Z,x264 is always better than an xvid encode. Thanks to the encoder.
,Murdster,2011-10-31T10:36Z,"Thanks for uploading.

Chandlerboy, you are a fucking retard."
,Captain-Frazzle,2011-11-02T22:50Z,"hey guys. forgive me for being a complete retard, but what do i do with all these files once iv downloaded them?"
,roguegrafix,2011-11-03T08:23Z,"Captain: In the folder that you have downloaded, scroll down until the end and find the last .rar file. Then using winzip or some other zip file program extract that last files contents (""Extract Here"" is often the option--right clicking on the file often brings up the extraction options). The file will unzip all the others and give you a .avi file or whatever which you can watch with VLC or other program. Good luck. (PS: I don't think it really matters what file you extract/unzip -- they will all combine to give you a watchable movie)."
,Captain-Frazzle,2011-11-03T14:57Z,Cheers roguegrafix!!
,RainbowX1,2011-11-04T23:31Z,"Why is there a weird screeching sound at the very beginning? It goes away after a little bit but its still weird, anyone else experiencing that?"
,welshlass78,2011-11-10T19:51Z,"This one works fab.. after extracting(its not rocket science)!
10/10
Cheers"
,mrrxp,2011-11-14T18:57Z,"This is really amazing stuff! And yeah, got the screeching sound also. Scary shit."
,friend55,2011-12-04T07:41Z,Rar????  Fuck that non-sense.
,electropop_guy,2011-12-11T11:36Z,"It's not about whether or not we're capable of un-raring it (duh!) it's the fact that we have to keep two copies of everything we download - or not seed (""Please Seed back"" - yeah, right!)  Plus that fact the if there's several episodes inside and we only need one of them we have to download the whole thing to be able to extract it. So...it's inconvenient, it discourages seeding, it wastes everybody's time, in a word... RETARDED!!! (or RARTARDED if you prefer)"
