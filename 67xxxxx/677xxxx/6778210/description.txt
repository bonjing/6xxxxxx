Description: 
In February 2011, David Cameron announced a welfare 
reform bill he described as the most fundamental, ambitious 
and radical since the benefit system began. The cost of 
benefit, he said, had gone up by nearly 60 billion pounds 
in the last decade. Critics say that the welfare state is in 
crisis.And yet at the same time, there's resounding support 
among the British public for welfare. In an Ipsos MORI poll 
commissioned for this programme, 92 per cent of adults 
agreed with the statement that it is important to have a 
benefits system to provide a safety net for anyone that 
needs it.John Humphrys travels the country to talk to the 
people with the most to lose: people on incapacity benefit; 
the long-term unemployed; people on housing benefit; 
lone parents. Are they prepared for the harsher future 
ahead? He returns to the area where he was born - 
Splott in Cardiff - to show how attitudes to work and 
welfare have changed in his lifetime. When he was 
growing up, a man who didn't work was regarded as a 
pariah; today, one in four of the working-age population in 
Splott is on some form of benefit. John also visits America,
where 15 years ago they embarked on what has been 
called a 'welfare revolution'. Is this more punitive model 
where the UK heading? He looks at specific reforms the 
Government has in mind or has begun already.
Humphrys concludes that the public don't like what they 
see as a growing sense of entitlement among some 
groups claiming benefits, and politicians respond to the 
public mood. He argues that there is strong consensus 
across political divides, and that reform would edge the 
UK back towards the original Beveridge vision of welfare.
