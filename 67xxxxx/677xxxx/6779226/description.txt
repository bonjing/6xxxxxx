Here it is - the classic 80s TV show "The Greatest American Hero" in all its original glory!  These are not the DVD rips - these were recorded off of actual broadcasts in syndication years after the series ended, and thus, THEY INCLUDE ALL THE ORIGINAL MUSIC, like 'Rocketman', 'Help Me, Rhonda', and the others!  No music rights problem bullshit here - this is how TGAH was meant to be viewed!!!

IMHO, you should STILL BUY THE DVDs, as you get much better quality, you show your support for what was once a great show, and plus it's just the right thing to do.  Some shows, ah!  But this one - PLEASE SUPPORT IT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE!!  It got shafted while on the air, shafted in syndication, and now the rumored big-screen movie has been delayed for years!
