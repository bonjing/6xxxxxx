,zero1zero,2011-11-03T02:58Z,Do you need to uninstall the previous version before updating or can you just install this over it?
[V],scene4all,2011-11-04T03:45Z,"You don't need to uninstall the previous version, Just exit IDM that's running and install idman607.exe, then you just need to run the patch/keygen and click Patch Server Check, once its done patching u don't need to register (that's only if you registered the previous version)."
,zero1zero,2011-11-05T03:54Z,ahh too late I got impatient and just uninstalled and reinstalled the newer version.  It made me restart the computer too so that was annoying.  I'll remember this for next time.  Thanks for the upload!
