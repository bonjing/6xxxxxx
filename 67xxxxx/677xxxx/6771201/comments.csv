,tony4561,2011-10-29T01:15Z,"I almost forgot.  If you could get ""Worm"" by Mark Bowden it would be appreciated.   There are a few torrents that claim to have it but they're password protected and require signing up on a bunch of porn sites to get the password.

Even if you can't, many thanks for your fine work."
