                Fight.
                Comedy featuring Scotland's string-vested,
                beer-guzzling sage. When the drop-in centre where Rab
                holds his self-help group meetings becomes a victim
                of council cuts, the bandaged philosopher decides to
                fight back. However after an encounter with the local
                Council leader proves pointless and his impassioned
                but foul-mouthed appeal on local radio fails to raise
                any support, he feels it's time for a grand public
                gesture. He decides to burn himself at the stake.
