    Greengrocer turned Masterchef host Gregg Wallace           
    reminisces about his love of rhubarb and can't            
    understand why sales and production have plummeted. He   
    heads to Yorkshire, the home of forced rhubarb, to meet   
    plucky growers who continue with their traditional         
    labour-intensive methods and who have triumphed in the    
    face of adversity. In the Revival kitchen, Gregg aims    
    to prove that rhubarb has far more to offer than just     
    the filling for good old-fashioned crumble.                
                                                              
    Meanwhile, Ainsley Harriott wants us to remember the     
    taste of a fresh pea straight from the pod. There is no   
    doubt that peas are popular but over ninety percent of     
    those we grow are frozen. Ainsley argues that we're       
    missing out on one our homegrown treats if we don't eat  
    them fresh when they're in season. Even HRH Prince        
    Charles is rooting for the fresh pea, as Ainsley           
    discovers when he visits the kitchen garden at            
    Highgrove House.
