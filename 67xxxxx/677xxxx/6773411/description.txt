Noted anthropologist Helen Jackson, a professor from U.C. Berkeley, and her intern travel to the Catskill Mountains of New York State. Recent finds of a rumored ancient native culture was all it took to for the University to send their best to investigate. The legends tell of a native people who worshiped Ravens as their gods. Tribal Shamans ruled the people with fear, magic and domination over all the females of the tribe. A find like this would be historic for the University's Social Sciences.

After uncovering some very strange and large avian bones as well as other artifacts, Dr. Jackson is positive she has found a lost native culture. A local guide arrives to take her team deeper into the foreboding wilderness of the Catskill Mountains to what is believed to be the actual burial site for the tribal shamans.

At the cliffs and caves of the burial site, it doesn't take long before a nightmare of biblical proportions is unleashed on the team from Berkeley. The tribal shamans spirits still guard this sacred site, awaiting the return of their tribe. When the three beautiful women stumble upon and desecrate their most holy of ground they must be punished.
