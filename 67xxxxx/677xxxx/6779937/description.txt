[+]  GAME INFO  [+]  
   
The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D tells the epic story of Hyrule and Link, Zelda, and Ganondorf in remarkable depth and gives context to the many tales of their struggles. Every graphic texture and character model has been built from the ground up to create the most dynamic and vivid vision of Zeldaâ€™s kingdom yet. While the greatest care has been taken to preserve the classic game play and story, a number of new features make this the definitive version of this extraordinary game. This is Hyrule as youâ€™ve always imagined it.
