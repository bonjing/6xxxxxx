JAPANLAND is a journey into the soul of Japan. For 12 months, author, filmmaker and adventurer Karin Muller (Hitchhiking Vietnam) traveled from one end of the country to the other, living among the people and exploring both Japanâ€™s ancient cultural heritage and its modern ways. Muller integrated herself into areas of society rarely seen by foreigners and discovered a land and people full of complex, and often contradictory, character traits.
