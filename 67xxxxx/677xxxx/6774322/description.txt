Ok, here we go.  This is still a work in progress, I have thrown this up as soon as I got home because I know many will be waiting.  I HAVE NOT yet had a chance to listen to this all the way through, but it APPEARS to be commercial free.  It is also broken into a total of 6 segments, I believe because the OP on usenet is ripping it from radio or webradio or something.

I would like some feedback ASAP about the torrent and I can tweak and even re-format as time goes on.

Since this is NOT the official podcast, it does not simply integrate into itunes like the other posting did.  I need some help with converting the tagging on these mp3 files to integrate them into itunes which would be really nice for me (and others). Please comment below if you can help with re-tagging so itunes puts these into proper podcast format.

I want to thank iChatter for his posts from the official podcast over the past while.

See my comments below on this torrent for some thoughts on copyright notices, etc.

RESIST WE MUCH!
