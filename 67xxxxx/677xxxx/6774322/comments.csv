[T],Nicodemus75,2011-10-27T03:41Z,"With respect to DMCA notifications:

This is a problem which is going to grow and grow (at least in the short term) and lead to more problems.  I have been using a VPN for sometime, that was included in my Giganews service (VyprVPN). Recently, Giganews suspended my account because they received a DMCA notice about a torrent I was seeding while on their VPN (I know - ironic).  After a little reading, I discovered that Giganews has a policy to terminate accounts after receiving 2 DMCA notices for that account.

I promptly went looking for another VPN and now use CryptoCloud (after much research) because THEY DO NOT LOG ANYTHING!

While it is true that in North America (so far), ISPs do not do much about filesharing infringement, there have been many, well-publicized lawsuits from the RIAA and MPAA against individual users.  The time to think about VPN is NOW! ISPs, and other providers who log can retain this information and eventually could be compelled by law to turn over the information to law enforcement/attorneys for copyright holders.

I am CERTAIN that iChatter's DMCA notice originated from someone representing Rush and/or his network.  Probably from lawyers who specifically sell plans to copyright holders and then troll the internet and torrents to send out DMCA notices to ISPs.  Only copyright holders or their agents can legitimately inform ISP of infringement in the form of DMCA notices.

If you want more info or help, let me know.

Again, the issue is NOT whether or not your ISP may discontinue service (although smaller ISPs, proxies, VPNs, etc. may well do so) but the exposure to potential legal action you need to be concerned about."
,jrodson69,2011-10-27T04:02Z,So where is this available daily on usenet? I'd much rather get it there...anonymous and a lot faster too. I've been scouring but all the postings are from September at the latest. Just a hint would be appreciated. Thanks.

,Reagan80,2011-10-27T04:08Z,"In Canada legislation is before their parliament to change the law  to a three strikes and you are banned from the internet type of scheme.

iChatter is a Canadian, and has PLENTY to worry about. 

Canada has been a great safe haven for torrents. Not for much longer. Expect to see the flow of shares from the North to drop, when C-11 passes.

A ""notice-and-notice"" system where copyright holders will inform internet providers of possible piracy from their customers. The ISP would then be required to notify the customer that he or she was violating the law. The violator's personal information could then be released to the copyright holder with a court order.
ISPs and search engines would be immune from the copyright violations of their users.
A differentiation of commercial copyright violation versus individual violation. Individuals found violating copyright law could be liable for penalties between $100 and $5,000,"

If you use any usenet search or indexing sites or apps you should be able to find them no problem."

@Reagan80: I read the material from the URL you gave... and my personal POV is that it's BS and another way for government to intrude into our lives. Having said that, I notice that whenever a government US or Canada) wants to 'make nice' with its citizenry, they always use 'creates jobs' somewhere into the blurb. Conversely when a government wants to scare people and create sheeple they always add the words 'global warming' or 'climate change'

I have no idea on how to do the conversions, but if you need some software to help you I can always buy the software for you and then e-mail it to you. Whatever. I'd like to help out whatever way I can. Let me know thru Demonoid............."
,jrodson69,2011-10-27T06:39Z,"It is possible the copyright holder made the complaint against the previous uploader(s). Don't forget he was posting Rush 24/7 material which is not available to the general public. It costs, either a monthly or yearly fee. I used to record the daily show off a big talker and do the conversion myself but it got too tedious and time-consuming, removing ads especially (I can't stand the advertising). Personally I think I'm going to just purchase a year of Rush 24/7 and be done with it. I would like to listen through Stitcher Radio and similar programs which can tap in to the paid stream with just a username and password...anytime, anywhere. No downloads, no conversion, no BS. I think I can cut out a few latte's to pay the $50. Rush is our last real hope, a beacon of truth and freedom in a sea of lies and con artists selling this great Republic down the river. "
