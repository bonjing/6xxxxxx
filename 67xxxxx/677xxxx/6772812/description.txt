Tommy Tronic â€“ a delightful new platformer for the PC. Utilizing a full 3D engine this action platformer adds a visually pleasing extra dimension to the current 2D platform genre. Interplay is proud to present this first incarnation of the wonderful world of Tommy Tronic. Whether young or old, Tommy Tronic will engage you and keep you curious as to just what will be around the next corner!

Set in a sprawling, haunted woodland, the player is taken across 12 levels of child-like imagination and mayhem. Where else will huge angry Carrots chase you? Or mutated Tomatoes upset the food chain? Use power-ups and weapons wisely to progress and keep a keen eye out for secret areas and bonus rooms. With luck, not only will Tommy be reunited with his four-legged chum, you will also give a cruel bully whatâ€™s coming to him too!
