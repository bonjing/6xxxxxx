Today @ 1pm EST my ISP notified me of a copyright complaint concerning my sharing the Rush 24/7 podcast. 

I use this provider for my business, and it is the only reliable high speed provider locally. 

I have to end my uploads here. Sorry.
I wonder if this happened to jwhitt62?

The Mark Levin podcast is available at 10:15 EST for free on iTunes and @
