,thunderbum,2011-10-26T22:08Z,"Damn. Damn Damn!!!

iChatter - I want to thank you so much for all you did for us - for providing the Mark & Jim programs but (for me at least) especially the Limbaugh podcasts. I looked forward to the end of the day when I could have some sanity in the form of Limbaugh podcasts.

I am grateful to you, jwhitt62 and the other super people who jumped into the breach when jwhitt went 'off the air' and could no longer provide us with podcasts.

Thank you all.

Having said that, is there anyone who can do catch his live program - commercials and all - and up them here? (I think I am going to go through withdrawal!!!)

I'm going to go out on a limb and surmise that the person who 'ratted you out' was one of the liberal trolls who have catastrophic fits around anyone conservative... it's like they're clinically insane - and to prove how intolerant they are they'll do their best to have conservative hosts and programs taken off the air.

Anyone else notice 'trickdaddy' has been suspiciously absent since October 14th? I guess he figured since we won't give him the attention he reckons he deserves, he'll get back at us all by snitching on you.

I can't 'prove' it of course, but it's just a gut feeling based on knowing how liberals operate: what they don't like, they'll ban, take off the air, and cause such a ruckus that people like Ann Coulter or Geet Wilders, or Benjamin Netenyahu aren't able to speak when they're invited speakers on tours, or on campus somewhere.

Thanks again iChatter - much appreciated - all the best with you and your family, and Jwhitt62 thanks again for all you've done too!

,iChatter,2011-10-26T22:21Z,"I asked if it was the copyright holder, they refused to say.

I believe it was trickdaddy."
,hostcord,2011-10-26T22:27Z,"Really sorry to hear that! I really enjoyed the uploads, thank you very much for all the work you put in! :)"
,dmechanic,2011-10-26T22:46Z,"Sad to see this happen, thanks iChatter.
As far as Jwhitt... I think he had some good anonymity going on and he just stopped because iChatter was doing fine after his vacation."
,FritzKatz,2011-10-26T22:53Z,"iChatter: Thanks for all you've done.

I wonder if the Rush production team could have put a ""watermark"" to uniquely identify individual podcasts so they could identify which member was uploading the show? Perhaps in the MP3-id fields?"
,UncleBeer,2011-10-26T22:58Z,Dang.  Thanks though.  :^(
,AthePG2,2011-10-26T23:35Z,"I appreciate what you've done for us, iChat.  I hope someone else can up it soon.  I'm already paying for one podcast."
,fizdude,2011-10-26T23:58Z,"Bastards!! What a disappointment.  I too have come to rely on your uploads and very much looked forward to them at the end of every day.  We're all going to miss all you've done for us. Thank you very much for all your time, hard work and efforts. Fingers crossed that another kind hearted good samaritan will come along and continue spreading the word."
[T],Nicodemus75,2011-10-27T01:16Z,"I will come up with a solution when I get home. The shows are posted on Usenet every day but in a different, less convenient format. I will look at it tonight, and see if it will work for us. Barring this, I will provide another solution.

RESIST WE MUCH!"
,theqool,2011-10-27T01:29Z,"If Nicodemus75 isn't able to get it from Usenet, I can record streams straight from radio. If someone else can cut out commercials, or people are fine with commercials, I can start that tomorrow. 

We'll miss you and your wonderful work iChatter"

I guess he figured since we won't give him the attention he reckons he deserves, he'll get back at us all by snitching on you."" said thunderbum...WRONG AS USUAL!!! The reason that I have not said anything since Oct. 14 is because I gave iChatter such a beat down that he changed his username(formerly WillNGrace)...The site is called piratesbay not scarybay...How did they notify you? Let me guess you got an email from your ISP? Well I get them all the time...Let me guess they wrote something like...""copyrighted work is a violation"" and they ""may result in the suspension or termination of your Service account.""...Blah blah blah...Well I keep getting this messages and I simply delete them from my inbox...If my ISP wants to shutdown my account no problem I can switch to another provider but from what i've read nothing is doing it because that would start a FATAL trend...Because if they shutdown my account then they have to shutdown over a million user who use torrents...If that happens then somebody has to explain to the shareholders why they lost so many customers in the last quarter...END"
,trickdaddy0024,2011-10-27T02:44Z,no one* correction
,trickdaddy0024,2011-10-27T02:53Z,If you want to blame someone...Blame Rush Limbaugh's crew...From what I understand your ISP will never terminate you account especially if you are a paying customer...They cant even release your personally information if Limbaugh and his crew request it...If you have a wireless connection you can always claim someone else may have been using your network...I dont hate the podcast I actually download it from time to time to get a good laugh...So iChatter if you want to stop uploading the podcast you are acting very cowardly...If you dont want to upload them yourself you can always send them to another user who isnt scared to death of meaning less emails...END
