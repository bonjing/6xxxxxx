Those who associate themselves with Ernest Holmesâ€™s work are called Religious Scientists, and to them this is their â€œtextbookâ€
It is a tremendous boon to have both the 1926 and the 1938 versions of The Science of Mind in one complete edition and available to current and future students and explorers of this life transforming spiritual philosophy. The more familiar 1938 edition, what many affectionately call â€œthe textbook,â€ has been a deeply loved and cherished agent of awakening and learning for people around the world for the past seventy-two years.
As we walk our own paths of realization and transformation we see how he awakened and changed, all the while seeking to give words to the great spiritual revelations that filled him and then make them relevant and practicable for daily spiritual living. How fortunate we are to be recipients and inheritors of this great work.
