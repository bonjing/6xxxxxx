The correct explanation is aeroelastic flutter, an intricate fluid-structure interaction that has nothing to do with resonance (no external alternating force to excite the system)."

Like i told you in your last comment on duplicates.If it doesn't show up on the search function,i will upload it.

I can't search every page looking to see if a book has been uploaded.

Maybe you should complain to admin to improve their search function"
[V],bigbluesea,2011-10-26T14:06Z,Try using the 'Tag Function' your books might show up when i do a search 
[T],dynstab2,2011-10-26T23:29Z,"Ooooooh... That explains it all: You simply don't search the index using the Search Torrents tool... No wonder you can't find uploads older than a few days. Judging by the number of uploads you make each day I thought I was dealing with a VIP, not a newbie... (at index searching)  ;-)

The torrent title of each of my book uploads usually contains the first author and keywords from the title, a somewhat standard practice. Using the torrent described at the top of this page as an example, the following strings (or any combination thereof) will instantly produce a hit to said torrent: ""kelly"", ""mechanical vibrations"", ""theory applications"". So if you were to upload this book (i.e. duplicate my torrent), you could use the same keywords (they are on the cover of the book) and search the index for a previous upload. That simple.

Oh yes, you copy the strings in the Pirate Search window found at the top of every TPB page, check the box tagged Other (the section where books are normally indexed) and press Enter. Et voilĂÂ ! But you knew this, right?  ;-)"

All right you two slackasses, stop moaning and get back to uploading us more books ;-)"
,fatetard,2011-10-27T12:01Z,(kidding of course)  THANKS for the great release! :-)

Yes,i do all the searches.Like i said it doesn't always show up so, stop being a smart ass.

Your the kind of person who thinks everything on the web works perfectly without flaws.Maybe you can explain why some of your books show up but not others Hmmmm..........could it be that search functions\index's don't always do what they are designed to do.......pretty much like every thing else in the world.

I don't need to duplicate your uploads and steal your spotlight.I can't believe your actually making a big deal out of it.Some uploaders have uploaded the exact same book i did shortly after i did and i don't care ,it's no big deal .

It a good thing you don't upload Movies or you would spend your Entire day leaving duplicate remarks on the comments section.

Or,maybe i should upload movies since we all get our files from the same sources (and pay for them)and don't cry about duplicate releases because were not newbies when it comes to files and sharing"
,indiaman,2011-10-27T15:26Z,"What do I see here ? My two dearest uploaders fighting over a petty matter of who uploaded it first.I agree with fatetard although I may not put it as bluntly.Does it matter who uploaded it first.Just remember one thing,whenever we read your uploads we say a little prayer for you -and I mean both of you."

Your taking this duplicate thing way too personal and being very immature about it and it's staring to show.

Im not taking sides but,BBS has gone out of his way to explain the matter and he has a point search functions here on TPB or anywhere else don't always do what they are supposed to do.

It's no big deal.A lot of uploaders duplicate knowing very well they are duplicating.This,i feel,is not the case here.

You both have great torrents and i am sure all who download from you guys appreciates it.All we want is awesome books from awesome uploaders"
