Just noticed when listening to them with headphones that the left channel is louder than the right, think it might be because the encoder was set to dual stereo. I could try re-encoding in joint stereo if you guys like, the file should be a bit smaller, or just UL the full CD images, but that will take weeks for me to seed. "
