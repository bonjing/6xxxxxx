First of all, I really appreciate you putting these out for everyone.  My son is 7 years old and he loves this kind of stuff.  Specially Richard Rich productions...

Is there a way that I can download this from you some other way.   The speed is so slow on Pirate Bay. This means a lot to me, please let me know.  thank you so much.

Would you be able to upload this please?"
