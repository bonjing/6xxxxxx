softwares for nokia series 60 handsets...symbian softwares in .sis and .jar formats....

some key-gens are in .exe format so you have to run it in windows and enter the keys in your softwares...

and i don't take any responsibilities if the softwares don't run in your cellphone ....

but i can tell you how to remove certificate errors...

ENJOY
