	The story is a prequel to the video game Assassin's Creed II. It centres around the father of the game's
	main character Ezio Auditore de Firenze. Giovanni is an assassin living during the Renaissance in 15th
	century Italy. At this dawn of a new era, a conspiracy is being plotted by one corrupt family to overthrow
	the powerful Medici family and destroy a unified Italy. As an assassin, Giovanni must face this threat
	and bring justice. The story introduces the situation before Assassin's Creed II, and the enemies of both characters.
