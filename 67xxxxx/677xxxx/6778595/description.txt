As the vampire craze hits Beavis and Butt-Head's high school
the two try to join the broody undead to score chicks. But when
they confuse a hirsute homeless man for a werewolf, it's a case
of once bitten, twice infected with Hep-C
Beavis is no wuss, but get him near onions and he can't keep a
tear from falling. Too bad for Beavis, because when Butt-Head
catches him crying, he'll never hear the end of it!

Notes: the offical MTV site is calling this season 9

We know who we are, where we came from, and why we're here. Do you?
