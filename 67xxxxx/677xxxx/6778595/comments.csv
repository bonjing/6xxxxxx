,Argh.Smurff,2011-10-29T03:34Z,eetv? hmm tryin to copy EZTV?
,ptv83,2011-10-29T04:32Z,eetv .. eztv ettv  lol 
,ptv83,2011-10-29T04:48Z,"eetv .. eztv ettv  lol  the tag says extratorrent

so ettv=extra torrent television .... not like eztv appears in the tag.

what the fuck is wrong with leechers , banging on uploaders because they upped the same torrent as another uploader (which may be because the first uploader has shit seed ratio, or poor connections)  .. then leechers bash on guys who have a similar name even though they're uploading stuff that (in this case) eztv is NOT uploading at all AND isn't fake.

there's only so many iterations of acronyms & initialisms availible, they'll be similarities.. so get a life.. fuck!

not like it's extremezone purposely mislabelling torrents as better quality or more well known content for more downloads is order to fullfill some narcissistic need for some wierd sexual gratification in being egotised by his trickery.

not like this is some fake crap put up by the 'AA's to track downloaders

not like it's a fake trojen / worm file put up to provide phishers with identiity theft information.... 

.. get a life."
,cptnahab,2011-10-29T08:56Z,"eh, it's a fair to be suspicious of a new uploader with a name similar to a trusted uploader.  

There has been enough BS trying to pass itself off as a well known group, while uploading shit full of trojans and the like.  Not saying this is (currently downloading one of their upload, I'll update once I've finished and checked it out).

Just saying, nothing wrong with a little caution.  (And starting a new group with a name very, very similar to a well known group may not be the best idea.)"
,cptnahab,2011-10-29T09:14Z,"And the survey says.... Everything came up good and clean (on the Sanctuary episode I downloaded from ettv).

I still suggest going with a more unique name, though."

eztv uploaded this very torrent 7 hours before this one went up,its exactly the same http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6777334/Beavis_and_Butt-Head_S09E01_PDTV_XviD-SYS_[eztv]"
[V],catflap,2011-10-30T02:58Z,"you and others clearly have no clue how this works.

eztv, vtv and others put their own names on other
groups' files. eztv, vtv, etc. DO NOT release their
own files. they grab scene releases directly from the
scene groups via newsgroups AND THEN THEY PUT
THEIR OWN TAGS ON THEM.

so if ettv wants to do the same, that's not any
different than what eztv, vtv, etc. do."
,ptv83,2011-10-31T18:26Z,@sell-out click ettv's user name and tell me how many other torrents uploaded are also upped by eztv ?  the answer:barely any.
