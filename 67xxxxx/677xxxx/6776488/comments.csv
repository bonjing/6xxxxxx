i made and tested all of them on Win7 Ultimate 64bit SP1.

The unpacking into a temporary folder doesn't need any admin rights, but AIDA itself needs to run as admin. If you deny, it just won't start up.

Try unpacking the edition you want with winrar or 7zip and start AIDA manually. Again, if you deny admin access, it just won't start up."

I've tested Extreme Engineer & Business editions (haven't tried the ""standard"" Extreme edition) on Win2K, WinXP, Win2k3 and Win7x64; works well on all platforms.

As you say though, on Win2k3 and Win7 you need to manually unpack the relevant installation file (7-Zip works well), then run AIDA as administrator."
