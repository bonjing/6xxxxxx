 Physical fitness comprises two related concepts: general fitness (a state of health and well-being) and specific fitness (a task-oriented definition based on the ability to perform specific aspects of sports or occupations). Physical fitness is generally achieved through exercise and is considered a measure of the body's ability to function efficiently and effectively in work and leisure activities, to be healthy, to resist hypokinetic diseases, and to meet emergency situations. This new and important book gathers the latest research from around the globe in the study of physical fitness with a focus on such topics as promoting physical fitness and sports for individuals with developmental disabilities; the effects of chronic low back pain on physical fitness; and, using mental tricks to enhance physical fitness and the unique issues of physical activity during pregnancy........
