Wherever you stand (Jobs was a demon or an angel), there is no debate that this man had a PROFOUND impact on the current world. Put your stupid personal opinions aside for 5 minutes and just read his story. I bet there is something there that will profit you. There is nothing like the biography of a real imapactor to make you think!"

,bongowolf2,2011-12-01T10:30Z,"DEAL WITH IT. Jobs could be a worldclass asshole, a pig in the way he treated his employees. A monster. BUT... he was brilliant and changed culture. 

However that didn't give him the right to act like such a fucking shit... sometimes. 

rambam1776  --- it would have been my fondest wish that you had worked under Jobs, and were the target of one of his shrieking, screaming, bugnut lunatic, humiliating tirades when he lost his temper. I reallllllly wish you could have had that directed right into your little face, in front of a dozen or more co-workers. THEN I'd like to hear your tune . . . "

,cactusX,2012-04-20T02:48Z,"A valuable contribution to PB.

Steve Jobs will forever be remembered. I watched a few old youtube videos of him when he was younger and he was as much the genius then as he was before he passed.

A truly brilliant man. Genius!"
,MAXieOne,2012-05-15T17:47Z,Jobs was driven by demons?
