,Ianp,2011-10-28T05:58Z,"Too many leechers on Pirate Bay. This was going to take forever, so I went to TorrentDay and got it in 17mins.   Not knocking Pirate Bay, but TorrentDay is Great and less leechers, more share!"
,amplifyd,2011-10-28T06:30Z,I heard torrentday had a huge gay membership.

,mommystv,2011-10-28T14:10Z,"this may sound like a stupid question-what exactly is a leecher? I know I have a little over 100 torrents that I seed whenever I'm downloading (which is often) and the day after im finished. I just was curious to how you are considered a leecher? Thanks eztv-you and vtv are the only ones I trust! You've helped a Mommy of a 3 year old watch her shows, it doesn't matter we have 5 tv's I'm forced to watch with him:)"

,perfectlol,2011-10-28T21:59Z,@mommystv a leecher is someone who just downloads the file then stops seeding and sometimes barely shares even while downloading

,Dufox,2011-10-30T04:32Z,"http://forum.utorrent.com/viewtopic.php?id=15992

went from downloading at 20k to 500k
only downside is if you set it at max bandwidth u cant surf the web.
slow speeds does not mean its the torrents fault"
