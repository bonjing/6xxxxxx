Most people believe zombies are a recent phenomenon that grew out of comic books, movies and TV. 
The truth is very different. This two-hour special explores the real story of zombies beginning 
at the dawn of civilization and continuing right through to today. The first written reference 
to zombies can be found in the Epic of Gilgamesh, mankind's oldest work of literature. A look at 
both the old and new testaments of The Bible reveal numerous stories of the undead. We'll detail 
how Europe's Black Plague became one of the most prolific periods for myths and legends about 
zombies. Find out why Viking legends believed zombies were nearly indestructible except by 
decapitation or immolation. Examine other zombie legends from around the world, including secret 
stories of China's Terra Cotta Warriors and the voodoo rituals of Haiti. See how modern science 
added a whole new twist on zombies beginning with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.
