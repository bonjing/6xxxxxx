How is this story arch??"
,CorpusM,2011-10-27T23:37Z,It worked out better than it sounded on paper. the tie-ins didn't feel forced and actually tied the story together really well if you read them all. The writers seem like they all had a blast writing it. Definitely worth a look over at least. Especially the Venom stuff. Love what they're doing with him lately.

It's a pity that they keep forcing these ""Events"" on the reader, both Marvel and DC. Even worse, the endings are always such a let down. 
I liked Flashpoint up to the six page ""conclusion"" that was nothing of the sort. 
Fear Itself was okay-ish, until the end where it seemed that instead of a conclusion they just wanted to boost sales on some new series nobody would've been interested in otherwise.
The last Event I enjoyed was ""Final Crisis"", but that was mainly due to Morrisson's writing and the ""Batman"" angle (and the fact that I didn't look for too much sense in it all). 
""Siege"" was okay, but I think Bendis's strengths lie in ongoing series, it's like he's trying too hard with the big Events (like Secret Invasion, the last issue was absolutely terrible).

My main Problem with Spider-Man is Dan Slott. I think he writes probably the worst Spider Man I have ever read. Everything seems forced, his failing attempts at humor, especially. Slott's Spider Man feels like the Tobey MacGuire movies. And that's not a good thing. 

Ah, maybe I'll give this a shot when I'm bored.

Thanks anyway."
