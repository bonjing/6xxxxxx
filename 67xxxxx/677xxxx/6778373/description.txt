Pear OS Linux - Think Totally Different

Pear OS Linux is a French distribution. It was created by David Tavares, Deux-SÃ¨vres (79), France.
The purpose of Pear OS is to create an operating system (64 bit) based on linux (ubuntu mini remix) and propose a simple but powerful interface.

Pear OS is free (thanks to your donations) and we hope you enjoy it.

It is operating out of the box, with a complete multimedia experienceand is extremely easy to use.
Users are encouraged to send their comments to the project so that their ideas can be used to improve Pear OS.
Based on Ubuntu (debian), it provides an impressive repository.
It is safe and reliable. Pear OS requires very little maintenance (noderÃ©gressions, no antivirus, no anti-spyware ... etc.).
