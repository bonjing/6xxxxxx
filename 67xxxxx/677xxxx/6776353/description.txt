Lupin the Third, grandson of the "gentleman thief," Arsene Lupin, traveles the world in search of challenging loot to steal, along with his companions: The sharpshooter Daisuke Jigen, the swordsman Ishikawa Goemon XIII, and the deadly beauty Fujiko Mine. Chasing them to the ends of the earth is the redoubtable ICPO officer Inspector Koichi (The Ol' Man) Zenigata. Whether it's a billion dollars' ransom meant to save the city of Pisa, Italy, a solid gold van, or the mask of Tutankamen, Lupin will go after it!-IMDb
