Storyline:

The plot of this movie, like smoke itself, drifts and swirls ethereally. Characters and subplots are deftly woven into a 
tapestry of stories and pictures which only slowly emerges to our view. This film tries to convince us that reality doesn't 
matter so much as aesthetic satisfaction. In Auggie's New York smoke shop, day by day passes, seemingly unchanging until 
he teaches us to notice the little details of life. Paul Benjamin, a disheartened and broken writer, has a brush with 
death that is pivotal and sets up an unlikely series of events that afford him a novel glimpse into the life on the street 
which he saw, but did not truly perceive, every day. Finally, it's Auggie's turn to spin a tale....

*I don't take requests because I don't have time and everyone will fill the comment section with them instead of commenting about quality and other tehnical specs of the movies or say thanks.Thank you for understanding!
*For best performance I suggest you use KMPlayer(find it with google) for playback
*These movies were made especially for PC and they don't play on a PS3.If you want to re-encode for PS3 or test for other devices be my guests.
*I'll ask everybody to stop with the "it doesn't work","it's out of sync" comments because I tested the movies before I uploaded them and they work fine.
