Unlike most engineering maths texts, this book does not assume a firm grasp of GCSE maths, and unlike low-level general maths texts, the content is tailored specifically to the needs of engineers. The result is a unique book written for engineering students that takes a starting point below GCSE level. Basic Engineering Mathematics is therefore ideal for students of a wide range of abilities, especially for those who find the theoretical side of mathematics difficult.

Now in its fifth edition, Basic Engineering Mathematics is an established textbook, with the previous edition selling nearly 7500 copies. All students that require a fundamental knowledge of mathematics for engineering will find this book essential reading. The content has been designed primarily to meet the needs of students studying Level 2 courses, including GCSE Engineering, the Diploma, and the BTEC First specifications. Level 3 students will also find this text to be a useful resource for getting to grips with essential mathematics concepts, because the compulsory topics in BTEC National and A Level Engineering courses are also addressed.

. Numerous worked examples supported by 600 worked problems and 1050 further problems within exercises included throughout the text. Additionally, there are 15 assignments included at regular intervals.
. Free instructor's manual available for download, which includes solutions to assignments.
