Sharing is a tendency so deeply ingrained in human nature that corporate interests are unlikely to ever override them. 
All bitstrings belong to the public domain and sharing knowledge and information empowers people with an inferior socioeconomic perspective. Filesharing by means of bittorrent turns the internet into the ultimate virtual library with an important social function to make information more accessible and raise the general level of education globally."
