[T],MovieNight,2011-10-27T20:42Z,Is this official? Tip: try the Hey You Compilation from Dutch treat. Quite similar but much better.
,rendeff,2011-10-27T21:29Z,this are not the official records. The records are to loud!!!!!!!! 
,320hunter,2011-10-27T23:33Z,@ MovieNight and  rendeff what is it in the above description of the information about the torrent you do not understand?!
,jd59,2011-10-28T22:02Z,Its a pre-release dont get released until 7th nov.
,320hunter,2011-10-28T23:44Z,"@ Jd59! So you say it, but believe it is with or without the accent ....."
,immerseyoursoulinlove,2011-10-31T17:19Z,"Again, 320hunter as we know him... this sucks. So no surprises. I don't understand the reason this fucko keeps posting these shitty files that are re-arranged by himself. No one wants to hear your ""remixes"" retard. I recommend all you guys not to fuckin' download this, or any of his torrents. Same shit every time... the bends of rh, the wall of pf, foo fighters, nevermind of nirvana... just ignore."

Will seed & it's only been released here for not long.Just before the stupid season starts!

What about distributors, store employee, reviewers and so on... Do you seriously think that really no-one is able to have access to a cd, before you the average Joe buys it in the store? "
