Ahoy there, mateys!  Another British TV show brought to you courtesy of TheJollyRodgerer.

Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased), Series 1 and 2, in all their AVI glory.  I originally pursued downloading these because I heard that Tom Baker played a character named Wyvern.  And indeed he does.  But for those of us for whom Doctor #4 is THEIR doctor, there's just not enough of him to go round, I'm afraid.

Still in all, a good series - paranormal + detective + mystery + comedy... plus Tom Baker, of course. :)
