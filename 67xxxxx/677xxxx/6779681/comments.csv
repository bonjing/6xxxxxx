,ut_bhai,2011-10-30T18:24Z,"BRRip???? r u sane?? that means blue ray 

this seems to be dvdRIP... blue ray is usually 4gb to 8 gb (approx) "
,sukdink9999,2011-10-30T20:16Z,"BRrip just means it's ripped from a blu-ray it has never had anything to do with HD quality or not, if you want HD look for 720 or 1080p releases.

Thanks BONE"
,dydog2,2011-10-30T21:20Z,You're the man .BONE.!!!!!

,scottsasse,2011-11-02T21:48Z,"The visuals and plot seems to be kind of like Melancholia. Will give it a shot anyway, THANKS  .BONE.!!   .......@dhcmaroc, you are fucking retarded."
,scottsasse,2011-11-03T23:52Z,"Just watched and I am kind of wishing I could get back the last 90min. of my life. Quality for a 700MB is not bad but a little dark in some scenes and audio is good too but again a little hard to understand the dialogue in a few spots. Overall, V=7, A=7, M=2  .............................THANKS again .BONE.:)"
,arildus,2011-11-05T11:53Z,This movie is pure crap
,noob_STFU,2011-11-09T17:15Z,"You cannot please everybody all the time. If you don't like the movie, chances are someone else liked it. So, STFU if u hated it and rather comment on the quality."
,noob_STFU,2011-11-09T17:16Z,"O and BONE, you a legend mate. Keep it up!"
,yoashmo,2011-11-11T19:43Z,"oh fuck bone youre the greatest.

,Yokohama50,2011-11-12T14:15Z,"A/V - Good
Movie - Really if movies are going to be holding so much shit like this or even more then they have to encode it to .crp file or something.. because there is a limit of how much shit can you put in one avi movie and it reaching its roof!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

,arildus,2011-11-18T23:26Z,Driiiitfilm!!
,Halizar,2011-11-23T17:17Z,might be a good feel good movie but i hate when they start with a good sci fi mood and turn it into a chick flick.
,fauxphony,2011-12-05T11:18Z,"This movie starts off with a good thought then they obviously had to make peen and vageen meet so thats where it took a move in the wrong direction.  Could have been better had it lacked the f*cking romance...

Thanks to the uploader.  I appreciate your work and time."
,miketheman001,2011-12-06T08:10Z,This is an amature movie. thought it was going to be good but the opposite. wouldnt bother wasting space for this lol

,DrkPrncss,2012-03-24T07:44Z,Awesome upload! THANKS!
,smegwales,2012-04-01T16:50Z,"loved the film actually, was xpecting a scifi film, but one has to think about this one for a chance and the acting is spot on. you need a brain to enjoy it basically"
,miguelleem,2012-04-12T03:38Z,"AV excellent and many thanks for the upload. I know this is not supposed to be a critics forum but this film is terrible however clever/stupid you are (if you incline towards the latter then forget it completely). Another earth is an interesting concept and I wasn't looking for spaceships or the politics of deciding who gets saved, or even the doppelganger idea which I think is what we have here, but after the deep disappointment of Tree Of Life (come on trolls, kill him) then this is just another cinematic wank too far.
