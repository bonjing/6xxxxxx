"Perception of Light"

Rock band from Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine.
Sensation is the pure quality by itself. When you're looking at it through the prism of the space your sensations become emotions. When emotions emotions are being broken by the edges of the powerful light of reality they gain a form of the perception.

Band was formed in 2006 as the acoustic folk-project. Then, in 2007 we decided to make our music heavier and "Perception of Light" was transformed into present concept. The number of the musicians joined to the group, and thus the cast of "Perception of Light" is formed
