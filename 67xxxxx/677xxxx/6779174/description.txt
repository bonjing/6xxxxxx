To fight crime it is surely useful to have a criminal mind, and JG Reeder is such a good detective exactly for this reason. Inspired by the slovenly police officer with a phenomenal sixth sense, created by British crime writer Edgar Wallace, THE MIND OF MR JG REEDER is the TV adaptation of the popular character's adventures.
