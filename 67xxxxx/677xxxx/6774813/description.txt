Duvidha - aka- In two minds

A Mani Kaul rare classic and a collectors item.


Kaulâ€™s most acclaimed film Duvidha(1973) opens with a rather flat, Godardian image of a woman in a red saree standing in front of a white wall, staring determinedly into the camera, as high-pitched Rajasthani ethnic vocals grace the audio. Like the frozen image of Truffautâ€™s juvenile delinquent, it suggests a predicament addressed to the audience. Based on a folk tale, Duvidha speaks of a love that is beyond time and space. The presence of the ghost, which falls in love with the new bride, is not an exotic delicacy served to us but a given. And so is the â€˜storyâ€™, which is read out verbatim to us by the narrator, freeing the film from the burden of storytelling, so to speak, instead allowing it to experiment with the imagery. Employing a number of photographs, freeze frames, jump cuts and replays, which illustrate the filmâ€™s central notion of temporal and geographical dislocation (and save on the budget) and manipulating time like an accordion player, Kaul weaves a narrative where the past, the present and the future are always in conversation. (The ghost is simply referred to as â€˜Bhootâ€™ (ghost), which is, of course, the word for â€˜pastâ€™ as well). The predicament of the title, then, involves a choice between the spiritual and the material, the brideâ€™s past and future, her childhood and adulthood, her freedom and honour and her love and security. Bewitchingly shot like a Dovzhenko film (and composed like CÃ©zanneâ€˜s still lifes), and impressively designed, with a simple yet striking interplay of red and white, Duvidha builds on both Kaulâ€™s feminist leanings and highly personalized aesthetic.
