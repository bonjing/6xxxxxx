This is an old australian animated movie which aired on sbs during the late 90's.  The animation is a bit sketchy but the story is epic, encompassing topics like god, the devil, human evolution and the meaning of life.
I didn't rip this I am only posing someone elses hard work, but this is a rare and hard to get title so i urge anyone who enjoys this torrent to please seed.
Below is the imdb rant about the movie..

Plot Summary for
Go to Hell! (1997)

Based on the premise that "God" is actually an alien called G.D., who wiped out the dinosaurs and populated the Earth with apes from his own planet (who eventually evolve into us). "The Devil" is actually his son, "little Red", who disagrees with what he is doing and pops up throughout history trying to upset G.D.'s plans.
