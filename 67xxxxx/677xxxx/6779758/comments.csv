,chrisstuve,2011-10-29T06:37Z,Thank you for this upload and all the others you have shared in the past.  I would not be able to see HD versions of these shows if it weren't for you.

I like these shows, but the other groups run with a lot higher quality than you. how come? otherwise, thanks to you too. I dont mean to be a troll, just trying to give some constructive criticism."
