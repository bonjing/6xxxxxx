,kostas9000000,2011-10-29T10:12Z,what is Logopack ?
,runealdo2,2011-10-29T11:01Z,"""Football Manager 2012 will require Steam activation to play, Sega has revealed.

The management simulator will require users to install the Steam client and register the game online before it can be played.

However, after that initial process, Football Manager 2012 is free to play offline going forward.

Sega cited piracy as the reason behind the move, saying that if 25% of users who illegally download the game actually purchase it, its sales would be double."""

,FatFreddy13,2011-10-29T14:43Z,"@kostas9000000 | Ok. Every football club has a club logo, it's same for competitions and nations (flag). So, when you put all logos at the same place, in one pack, that's logopack (logo pack)."

,FatFreddy13,2011-10-29T20:46Z,"@philpic | This logopack is fantastic! I wouldn't upload it here if it's lame. I was searching this a few days, but when I finally found it, I have to share it to all of you here..."
,philpic,2011-10-29T21:21Z,"u found 1 for football manager 11 

if so ill have that 1 straight away as ive never updated that 1 

i almost went and bought the game but after reading up on it, it looks pointless, and due 2 the fact i no cd drive on here it feels pointless as i dont think SI will let me download a copy everytime i play with the install files 

ill only support low budget devs who reward loyalty 2 its customers, this view has come after i bought that football manager live and only got 2 months playing time for the 40 quid i spent, they wanted a subscription fee 2 continue playing which i feel is a waste cos there was only like 40 diff ppl on it when i was playing 

sorry for ranting but i feel SI need 2 know this and i know that they will have ppl looking thou here and other sites like this 

LONG LIVE PIRATE BAY   MAY U STICK IT 2 THE AUTHORITIES WHO TRY STOPPING YA FROM DOIN WAT U DO BEST 

cheers danny ( if i may call u that :P   )  will download now as im confident there will b a crack 4 this game"
,philpic,2011-10-29T21:29Z,"sorry for double post

if its on now i very much apoligise for double posting, its something i h8 doing  "
,FatFreddy13,2011-10-29T21:39Z,"@philpic | I don't understand you. It's logopack, it's legal, those(logopacks) have also SI supported forums and sites like sortitoutsi, fm-base, fmscout (it's just a add-on)... I really don't know what's the problem? xD"
,FatFreddy13,2011-10-29T21:43Z,"@philpic | My apologize, after i read a few time, finally i understand what you want to say... i don't know so good english... ( and i repeat again, it's just a game add-on...) :D"
,philpic,2011-10-29T22:13Z,"no probs mate   

i didnt know it was an add on 

and no need 2 apoligize dude    u done a good thing

,kidzo21,2011-11-04T20:16Z,"copy the files in the zip to this location: C:\Documents and Settings\UserName\My Documents\Sports Interactive\Football Manager 2012\logos

the logo folder should NOT be in the graphics folder :)

in game go to preferences-->display and sound and check :always reload skin on confirm"
,gtafun,2011-12-21T04:20Z,"i can't find my folder ""logos"" or ""graphics"" any where!! can anybody tell me why? thanks"
,Jaffa1978,2012-01-24T22:56Z,"To Install go to> username/documents/Sports Interactive/football manager 2012/graphics/logo's

If you dont have a graphics folder then create one & place it in username/documents/Sports Interactive/football manager 2012.

Then create a logo's folder & place this in the graphics folder.This is where to extract all your logo's to.

Its the same with players,if downloading facepacks create folder called players & put your facepacks in here!!"
,Jaffa1978,2012-01-24T22:59Z,"Cheerz fir this Freddy,any1 upload a good mega facepack that ISNT cut-out!! cut-out looks utter shit,also if any1 comes across ad-board pack pls share with TPB ;)"
