,KeEp_It_REezy,2011-11-01T09:10Z,"believe the hype. VLC is the shit, plays all my files properly. 

On a side note I thought this flick was a total gem. The setting of two humans switching bodies has been a plot of many a hollywood movie, but never like this; gritty, raunchy, get stoned and watch it hilarious laugh your ass off stuff. Superb cast with a banging chick for the women's lead role.
