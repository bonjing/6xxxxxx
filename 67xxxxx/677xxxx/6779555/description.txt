P2P group ALI213 released the BETA of the game Trine 2 for PC. Thereâ€™s a crack included so itâ€™s fully playable. If you canâ€™t wait for this game you should give the BETA a try, else wait for the full game to be released in December. Enjoy!


Description

Trine 2 looks to have the same hook as its predecessor, but with some enhanced features. Along with some graphical updates (the game looks downright beautiful) and online coop, the characters are getting some new powers. The wizard can now pick up and manipulate enemies as if he was a Force-wielding Jedi, while the thief will have the ability to slow down time. Not much more is known about abilities outside of this, but I'm also told that the levels are being designed to require the specialties of all the classes, increasing the importance of their powers.

Physics-based puzzles with fire, water, gravity and magic
Accessible for both casual and hardcore gamers
