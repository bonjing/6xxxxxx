,jarhead2012,2011-10-25T12:39Z,"thx man i saw your comment on the reloaded crack hope it works, too bad i already got the launguage pack ;/"
,easy11,2011-10-25T12:40Z,its is full now 
,legojohn,2011-10-25T12:55Z,"So I managed to do all the things to upgrade from the russian clonedvd, but now it keeps crashing with either faulty ""dxgi.dll"" or ""ntdll.dll"" right in the intro or a few seconds in the menu."
,SilenceMurderer,2011-10-25T13:07Z,"@Steve30x
No, i don't think so.

@jarhead2012
Then you can skip the language files.
In Bittorrent you have to click on: Battelfield 3 Fixx -> Files -> (RMB) English.Lang -> don't download.

@legojohn
Did you followed all the steps of the instruction right? If so, perhaps you can better start all over and extract the dvd's + these files in a new map."
,legojohn,2011-10-25T13:30Z,"I reinstalled it 3 times now, same errors every time."

,mycurse92,2011-10-25T13:52Z,I love how crack is already up... tnx slice for the fix!
,SilenceMurderer,2011-10-25T14:11Z,"@legojohn
Wich version did you download? 

@Shadowx61
Since the text of the instructions is pretty long you can better download it, and set the other files on 'don't download'.
Here's how you do it in bittorrent:
on: Battelfield 3 Fixx -> Files -> (RMB) English.Lang -> don't download.
Do this for all the files you don't need.

If you have the CloneDVD or any other 'older' version you've must done something wrong and you should try it all over again in a new map.

@aggelosss5
That's strange, the game shouldn't connect to EA at all. What version of the game do you have?

@Tushu
What version do you have?

You can try to end all other unnecessary processes and run in administrator.

Ok, your pc will not have any problem running the game and you also have the right version of the game.

You can also try 'running as administrator' or restart your pc after installing.

With 'new map' I meant 'new folder', an empty folder. You can extract/install the CloneDVD and these files anywhere on your hard drive. Make sure you follow all the instructions properly.
