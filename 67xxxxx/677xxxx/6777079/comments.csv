,dingo8baby,2011-10-29T11:16Z,"if the downloaders are lazy because they don't like rar files, what does that make the uploader?"
,Setrah,2011-10-29T14:27Z,"Actually, the problem with RARs is that many people (like me), as soon as download finishes, unpack the archive and delete the RARs so that they don't take up much space. As a results, less people seed. If I download a single file, I can seed it for months not caring much about it; my ratios are above 300 sometimes. But with a bunch of rars, I only seed for as much time as it takes me to unpack the rars."
,Ask_me,2011-11-02T18:13Z,Rar's not a problem.................I don't seed anyways...
