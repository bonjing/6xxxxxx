,GeorgeWest,2011-10-26T04:09Z,"I will not get near any material that makes ""Jewish"" look like a nationality. That is the root of all the disinformation. For example: ""God gave the land to the Jews"". Nope! Even if you buy that event as true, then he gave it to the Hebrews at a time when all Jews were Hebrews and all Hebrews were Jews. Hebrews were very dark, almost black. The Jews in control of Israel today are Caucasian Ashkenazi from central Asia. In 740AD they merely adopted the religion of the indigenous Hebrews and, by fraudulent identity theft, laid claim to the land and spread the disinformation that THEY were there in biblical times.  I'm calling BS on that because there were no whites there in biblical times. Also, Tay-Sachs Disease is not found anywhere in the genetics of the region because it is strictly an Ashkenazi gene. If they were there when god promised the land, that gene would be everywhere after about 80-100 generations.  The public has cleverly been fooled into believing that Tay-Sachs is a Jewish disease. This would be the first ever genetic disorder based in religion. This and many other clever tactics have been deployed to keep anyone from making distinctions between Jewish, Israeli, and Hebrew. This author starts off right away with the concept of ""Arab-Jewish"". You can have ""Israeli-Arab"" or ""Jewish-Muslim"". See how they get you mind wrong at the foundational level? Don't get fooled. If you become Roman Catholic, are you now a Roman? If 50,000 Chinese become Jewish tomorrow, do they have a claim on Israel? Why not? That's what the Ashkenazi did."

,GeorgeWest,2011-10-27T03:26Z,"Its reassuring that you don't dispute a single allegation. ""Get over yourself"", which is rather meaningless, is one step away from ""anti-Semite"". That's usually the final card played for anyone that doesn't like to hear the truth but can't credibly oppose it."
,beowoulfe,2011-10-27T12:49Z,"I'm sorry, GeorgeWest, I just really don't care what you think.  All that ranting...........Get over yourself."
,reflexes,2011-10-27T16:10Z,"even if u cared, what it would have changed? u would still be the same non-entity going with ideas held en-mass by the crowd who need even more mediocre tv anchorpersons for guidance..

and thanks to the other commentators for the info about ""God gave the land to the Jews"" side. now cant give Australia to the aborigines, the Americas to the red Indians and even india to the Dravidian.. 

jews are damn lucky to get some land on that flimsy ground.lol"
,beowoulfe,2011-10-28T01:00Z,"Yeah, well................whatever.  Both of you are nuts."
,logan-xart,2011-11-03T22:51Z,"...another zionist propaganda book...all based on make-believe, lies and outright obfuscations...

...no white wanna-be jews have claim to Palestine...

...they should take their khazarian asses back to russia, poland and germany...

...no such thing as hebrews...they were wiped out thousands of years ago...

...anyone claiming to be a jew is just a fraud and a shyster..."
,nothing000001,2011-11-11T00:50Z,"How in the hell did the U.N. create a country (Israel) based on a religion (Judaism). Nations have their basis on common tribal roots, not on common religious beliefs. Can the Buddhists demand a country be created based on their common religion? Fk no! No one can, except the jews. What a scam that was."
,Roboooh,2012-01-17T00:34Z,"All you lunatics realize the Jews have archaeological history in Israel dating back some three thousand years give or take a few centuries? 

Its frightening to think about how many people here think the Protocols of the Elder of Zion were really by Jewish conspirators."
