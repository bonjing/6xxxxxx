,iViolence,2011-11-06T03:14Z,Don't like the way it's arranged. Still great list!
,bil_gr7,2011-11-07T21:35Z,WARNING: there are 5 Biebers in this torrent. Stay away from that shit.
,WhiteDEVILX,2011-11-15T02:37Z,Thanks.
,bigtaterman,2011-11-16T23:43Z,"@bil_gr7 
Just because there a few songs that you don't like on here doesn't mean you can't download the rest.  I'm tired of people telling other people what to do just because there is an artist that they do not personally like on the torrent.  Download what you like and let anyone else download what they like."
,DrNcan,2011-11-26T15:33Z,"@bigtaterman his warning is justified, 5 bieber song means the whole torrent is corrupt with bad music"

,morphine25,2012-06-03T13:23Z,"Am I the last human around that doesn't consider this garbage music? Clicks and pops, musicians that don't even write their own music. People used to pour their hearts into their music, now a hit song can be made in minutes by putting 4 words together and repeating them. I will never join you!!!"
