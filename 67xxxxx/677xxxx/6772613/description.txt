Bernard Cornwell Collection of action packed historical fiction including ALL the Sharpe novels, Saxon, Warlord, Grail Quest and Starbuck books.

Including two standalone novels
Azincourt and Stonehenge

I have tried to make these books look as good as I can. I have added covers, metadata and made sure all the chapters work within the TOC.
Two of the books I could not find decent covers so I made my own.. these are Sharpe's Christmas and Sharpe's Skirmish. I have made these available in the past, but I have added a couple of extra books and fixed a couple of small problems.

I hope you enjoy
