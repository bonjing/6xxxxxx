Availlable commands and options:
-- CTRL + M     All mission access
-- TAB  + Q     Change player model (to heavy)  - RECOMMENDED because the CJ\\\'s sounds are changed to heavys...
-- Aim at someone with your weapon (right mouse button) and write \\\"RAP\\\", then you can change his weapon with mouse scrolling (this can be used to make the Sniper, pyro and spy carry their weapons as in TF2)

--- Known bugs and problems: ---
# When quiting the game might crash (which is not big deal, because you are quiting ;d).
# When you play with Heavy, don\\\'t try to change his clothes in clothes shops. It will f*ck the player model.
# I recommend not starting a new game. If you wanna play the missions use \\\"CTRL + M\\\" for choosing any mission.
# Most sounds of heavy, sniper, pyro and spy are changed but in some moments you might hear their real voice (haven\\\'t find all sounds).
If you have slow pc disable the ENB series before loading or starting game by pressing LShift + F12
