Reviewby Scott Yanow:
Ella Fitzgerald's Berlin concert of February 13, 1960, highlighted by her ad-lib version of "Mack the Knife," is considered a classic. The performance on this CD dates from the following year and is almost as rewarding. Accompanied by pianist Lou Levy, guitarist Herb Ellis, bassist Wilfred Middlebrooks, and drummer Gus Johnson, she sings 18 songs in a varied and well-paced set. Highlights include "Take the 'A' Train," "Anything Goes," "You'll Have to Swing It (Mr. Paganini)," "'Round Midnight," a new (but less humorous) version of "Mack the Knife," and an encore, "This Can't Be Love," that has the singer joined by the Oscar Peterson Trio.
