The old 70s British TV show "Doctor in the House", Series 1 and 2.  Technically speaking, this show only had two series (or "seasons" to us yanks), but in reality it morphed into other shows as the years went on, sort of like spinoffs, with characters leaving and returning, and plots/setups related between shows.

Was looking for this forever until I was finally able to join one of those exclusive UK torrent sites and download the goods.

Now, I, TheJollyRodgerer, happily share me booty with you all!!!


These are all the AVIs as I originally downloaded them.
