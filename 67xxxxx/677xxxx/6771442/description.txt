Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

Mike Adams hosts as Alex Jones continues his assignment on the road. 

Mike covers the latest breaking news, including new revelations and developments on the murder of Moammer Gaddafi in Libya as economic disaster teeters on the edge in Europe. 

Mike talks with author Gwen Olsen in-studio. Olsen, a sales rep in the pharmaceutical industry for fifteen years, wrote Confessions of an Rx Drug Pusher, a book that describes how big pharma entices doctors to push prescription meds on patients. 

Mike also talks with raw milk activist Liz Reitzig who along with the Raw Milk Freedom Riders is challenging the FDA to arrest her in November. 

Health, nutrition and nature-based philosopher Daniel Vitalis talks with Mike about preparedness, Libya, and the coming economic riots and wars.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
