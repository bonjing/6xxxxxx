├»┬╗┬┐├»┬╗┬┐In a small apartment on the northern shores of Denmark sits electronica-artist Kiloton. Surrounded by computers, sound modules and various electronics he concentrated leans over a small short wave receiver.

Distorted fractions of radio signals and static from all over the globe resonate into the room from the little box and mix with deep electronic reverberations from Kiloton├óΓé¼Γäós own sound systems. A sound with distinct reference to the instrumental dub-music of Jamaica, but in a more brisk Scandinavian version, which in interplay with the crackling sound fragments from the radio receiver creates an emotional expression that communicates without words. An almost lost language - which is now released as an album.

For over two years Kiloton have elegantly recorded, edited, manipulated, distorted and modulated the crackling - and globally originating - short wave sound samples to form pieces in the complex, melodic and challenging puzzle that is his musical creativity. Having produced and performed for several years as well as contributed to several releases both domestically and abroad, Kiloton aka. Mads Weitling has now finally releases his solo-debut ├óΓé¼╦£Language Lost├óΓé¼Γäó, which hit the street on Friday, August 27 2010.

An abstract, wordless and dark, yet dreamy album that carries a distinct nordic tone. Characterized by sharp, abrupt rhythms under deep, smouldering and crackling dubscapes, Kiloton has developed an almost cinematic sound that leads its listener through changing moods; beatiful and sincere as well as melancholic and thoughtful.
