,garlic2n8t,2011-10-27T17:39Z,"note: sometimes the game asks for the dvd to be in the drive (or mounted), pressing 'cancel' seems to work without trouble. when having the dvd in drive or mounted it does not come with the request. - just thought i wanted to tell this minor issue."

,Kazekage,2011-10-30T23:11Z,"Would anyone who has gotten this to work, kindly tell us what setup they are using?"
,dothackjhe,2011-10-31T02:47Z,"I think none of our current firmware made it work yet, I'm not sure. But I read somewhere about the game having a protection that even the latest custom firmware won't make it work. ."
,paxju,2011-10-31T17:49Z,i cant make this to work but i played demo and i think its worth to wait to translation :)
,Kazekage,2011-11-01T00:39Z,"@dothackjhe

You say it wont work with any CFW, probably. But the two guys above have said that they have gotten it to run. So what gives?"

anyone can tell me i'll be very thank full"
,canasian,2011-12-29T23:43Z,"Whoever said that this game works is a total liar.

This game doesn't work on any CFW.

I tried with an iso loader and iso tool, it either crashes at the start with a black screen stopping you from trying to exit or turn off the psp, or it crashes onthe NOW LOADING screen."
,canasian,2011-12-30T01:44Z,"I tried it, IT WORKS.

This ONLY plays on 6.60 OFW.

DOES NOT WORK on CFW.

Until somebody has the patched version, this version in untouched. Will NOT lay on CFW."
