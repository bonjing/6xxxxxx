Its one thing to have a skull and have the occasional typo, its a whole different thing when you're a nobody with no history, spelling errors left and right, and only a single seeder..
I would advise all to find one of the trusted uploaders to download this from, I believe this is either an incompetent uploader or a possible virus. I may be wrong, and am willing to take the consequences if I am."
