,GravyGuy,2011-10-27T09:01Z,When will you be uploading Fullmetal Alchemist brotherhood part 5? Oh and will be seeding this torrent once it finishes
[T],trialNerror,2011-10-27T10:25Z,"FMA:BH 5 might take a while to come around. I only uploaded the torrent here which was already available from someone else on another site.  I checked their recent upload activity and they're currently doing Heroes complete series 1080p - roughly 80GB total.  They're going to be busy for quite some time. As soon as I see it I will post it.  I want it just as bad as you folks.

And p/s:  I appreciate your help seeding.  Even with almost 1mb/s uploads speeds now it still doesn't seem to be enough for some people.

Not directed at you. Just drunken babbling here...  There's some damned greedy sunsabitches out there.  Those hit and runners piss me off, too.  Or, those that limit their upload speed thinking it will make their download faster.  FALSE!  That only slows down the whole sharing process for everyone.  GO UNLIMITED!"
