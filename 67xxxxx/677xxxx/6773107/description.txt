The.Fifth.Estate.2011.10.21.Scouts.Honour.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 214MB]

[/b][/color] For more than three decades, the fifth estate has been Canada's premier investigative documentary program, acquainting viewers with a dazzling parade of political leaders, shady characters and ordinary people whose lives were touched by triumph or tragedy.
The tradition of provocative and courageous journalism which began with Adrienne Clarkson, Warner Troyer and Peter Reilly on September 16, 1975 continues unabated with our current team of Hana Gartner, Linden MacIntyre, Bob McKeown and Gillian Findlay.
