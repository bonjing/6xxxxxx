Firstly i want to say i had own cam audio ready, but wasnt as loud as Illuminatis so i took theirs.
I cleaned it up from hiss and noise, was already synced perfectly.
Now before you say wtf why doing a 5.1 audio from a cam audio. 
yes its strange but in this case it works. 
cam audio is just ok on voice scenes, but not good at action scenes and any kind of music and sound. thats why the
the Russian Surround effects come in handy. in this movie they are only when there are action scenes. Normally the music would drown the voice scenes but they don't in this movie.
so you have the advantage of having a good cam audio when there is voice and all effects when there isnt. 
Which helps improve the audio for the movie.
well enjoy that nice audio mix.
check sample, choose a spot where you can hear that surround music.

ps: there are rumors about missing video or audio, well cant say there is missing anything anywhere, video is dvd and audio is from first word to last. so there is nothing missing.
