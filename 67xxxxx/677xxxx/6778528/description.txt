Hi,

I Love Pink Floyd, so I listen all new torrents. The last torrent: a foot in the door, was quite succesfull. Nice! I was a bit disappointed however. Some tracks did not sound too well and others, I did not like too much. I prefer an other compilation. This one is quite similar but somehow a bit better. I think Floyd fans will appreciate it.


Pink Floyd - Hey You

  01 - Time 
  02 - The Great Gig In The Sky 
  03 - Wot's... Uh The Deal 
  04 - Hey You 
  05 - San Tropez 
  06 - Another Brick In The Wall 
  07 - Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Part I-V) 
  08 - Welcome To The Machine 
  09 - Money 
  10 - Us And Them 
  11 - Any Colour You Like 
  12 - Comfortably Numb 
  13 - One Of These Days 
  14 - A Pillow Of Winds 
  15 - Wish You Were Here 


Enjoy
