,bambinoitaliano,2011-10-28T00:43Z,"Is there a reason why the show was cut half way through the third girl performance? Anyway I found the rest on you tube if anyone interested in the final girl performance and which 3 girls got pick for next week. Thanks VeroVenlo, all your effort is very much appreciated."
,darkdefender95,2011-11-03T06:15Z,Why do these shows always take so long to put up?  The other primetime shows are up like 30 min after airing.
