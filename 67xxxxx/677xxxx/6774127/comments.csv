On a related note, thanks for posting a link to your website.  I've NEVER commented on a website before, but I have to say, yours in a great one!  Very clear & easy to navigate, and I love that browsing there is like browsing netflix or something!
Awesome site :)"

,holabandola2,2011-10-28T17:40Z,"Thanks alot Yify.

I just wanna say that its really good that you have the subtitle as an .srt file. Cause then you can use it on an android device (because they dont support muxxed subtitles) :D"
