              NOTES


         - Our releases are always virus-free. If you think you found
           something  suspicious, it\'s  a  problem  of  your security
           software. All those  antivirus systems  will  never be too
           smart, so don\'t complain.  And always remember that we are
           not responsible for modified releases.

         - We aren\'t stealing releases. We respect hard work of other
           people and always  indicate  original authors of releases.
           We have permissions to use their files.

         - We are doing all this for fun  and  knowledge only. Always
           remember to support the developers if you like the product
           and its quality.
