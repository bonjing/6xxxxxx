    It is a mystery that has baffled scientists for            
    centuries: how were the Ancient Egyptians able to         
    perfectly preserve their pharaohs for millennia?         
                                                              
    Now Channel 4 follows a team of pioneering scientists      
    attempting to solve this 3000-year-old enigma by          
    mummifying a body donated specifically for the purpose.  
                                                              
    Filmed inside one of the UK's leading forensic             
    pathology labs, the scientists want to unlock the         
    preservation techniques used during the 'Golden Age' of  
    Tutankhamen.                                              
                                                               
    The 18th Dynasty was a time of huge cultural and          
    political revolution, but it also marked the pinnacle    
    of Egyptian embalming techniques. Using a secret and      
    complex blend of ingredients and processes, priests        
    managed to stop decomposition almost entirely.            
                                                             
    But what were the mysterious and complex recipes they     
    were using? Did they really understand the science         
    behind them? And, if so, could this represent the         
    greatest scientific achievement of Ancient Egypt?
