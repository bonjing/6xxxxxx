,mickmac56,2011-10-27T15:34Z,Many thanks for the upload.A=9 V=9 but unfortunately M=5 due to the shocking acting of the females.If not for that it would have been a decent addition to the slasher genre.
[T],winto_bungle,2011-10-27T18:58Z,i worked on this film - for free - this is why i encourage you all to download this not pay for it. but it is also pretty bad.

,LarryInColumbus,2011-11-02T05:36Z,"Really bad movie.  Defies common sense, poorly written.  Bad acting.  Idiotic plot.  

If you watch it, keep in mind that it does not get better as the movie progresses.

A:9
V:9
M:2"
