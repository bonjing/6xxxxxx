Paula DeAnda is the eponymous debut album by American pop singer Paula DeAnda. It includes four singles: "Doing Too Much" featuring Baby Bash, "Walk Away" featuring The DEY, "When It Was Me", and "Easy" featuring Bow Wow. The song "Overloved", written by Diane Warren, was originally recorded by Raven-SymonÃ© on her third album This Is My Time. The album peaked at #54 on the Billboard 200. This ultimately became the only album DeAnda released through Arista due to low sales.
The album was re-released in 2007 with 4 new tracks, "Irresistible", "Back Up Off Me", and Spanish Versions of both "Easy" and "Doing Too Much" respectively titled "FÃ¡cil", and "Lo QuÃ© Hago Por Tu Amor". "Lo Que Hago Por Tu Amor" was previously an iTunes Bonus Track on the original version of Paula DeAnda and "Back Up Off Me" was a Japanese bonus track.
