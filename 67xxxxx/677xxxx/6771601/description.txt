"Last Halloween Standing"

Mike feels let down when his daughters aren't into 
celebrating Halloween with him the way they used to. 
He decides that his two-year-old grandson, Boyd, can 
be his perfect trick or treat partner. But Kristin, 
Boyd's mother, adamantly tells him that she doesn't 
want her son to go out on Halloween. Mike sneaks him 
out -- with a plan to get the child home before 
Kristin gets back from work. When Mike, dressed as 
John Wayne from "The Green Berets," gets to Ed's 
house with Boyd, they are greeted at the door by 
Ed's lady friend, Elvira
