,kidvilla,2011-11-13T07:38Z,"excuse me for sounding impertinent, but this album seems to be suffering from the same disease afflicting many other files of the same name: if you note song ""2-08 Ice"", it is only 2.21 long and ends abruptly. the song should be 4:30. This is not the only file afflicted: https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6768246/Kaskade-Fire_And_Ice_%28iTunes_Deluxe_Edition%29-2011 is also like that, except it has MP4 files and the aforementioned file has an EOF marker at 2:21. unless my computer is barfing this one song at the same time in two different formats, i suspect all these files are based on one corrupt rip.... the only reason i doubt myself is that nobody else seems to be reporting this on any forum... can anyone else confirm? thanks!"
,kidvilla,2011-11-13T07:40Z,the file at this link (https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6767866/Kaskade_-_Fire__amp_amp__Ice_(iTunes_Deluxe_Edition)_%5B.m4a%5D_%5BMp3Boxx) also gives me the same incomplete track. i wonder if all torrents have this same corrupt track... 
,kidvilla,2011-11-15T10:59Z,"thank you for the suggestion. i managed to find a copy of the track on Filestube, so i won't need the link, but others might try it and get a 404, as i tried it and that's what I got... all i can suggest is if you need it, go to filestube and just search for ""kaskade ice dan black"". sorry if i am suggesting using something other than torrent, but it solved the problem for me."
