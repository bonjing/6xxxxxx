,NanoEntity,2011-10-29T09:55Z,"Not fixed.

storm_api.dll missing

However no virus detected in this one, seems clean."
,NanoEntity,2011-10-29T10:02Z,"NVM works

However the Renegade Ops v1.0r6 *Update* THETA breaks the game.

If you do clean install + skidrow crack it will load and work."
,NanoEntity,2011-10-29T10:12Z,"OK game works 100%, PC controls are shit, if you have a console controller then this game might be for you.

I RAGE quit, the PC controls are so bad I don't know who came up with the stupid shit....."
,Matinator10,2011-10-29T11:56Z,"storm_api.dll error:
Copy and paste the steam_api.dll and rename the (copy).dll to storm_api.dll
Enjoy playing"
,gaza99,2011-10-29T14:16Z,"Thanks. if the game is not launching or showing not enough memory download this and paste it into installation directory.

,g0dsize,2011-10-30T06:08Z,"This release works perfectly and even includes the file in the crack to fix the AVA_MAIN crash issue.  No rootkit/virus like one of the other releases (tested on a backup PC and scanned thoroughly).  Best played with a gamepad (the game tells you as much when you launch it).

Great upload, pretty damned good game. I'll be buying it.  Many thanks for the upload, tim2251337x."
,Hewash,2011-11-08T15:55Z,"These 2 releases never worked well at all :

 - 1 - THETA 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6776890/Renegade.Ops.v1.0r4.multi6.cracked.READ.NFO-THETA_[ALEX]   *GAME*

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6776895/Renegade.Ops.v1.0r6.update.cracked-THETA_[ALEX]            *UPDATE*

 - 2 - SKIDROW

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6774909/Renegade_Ops-SKIDROW   *GAME*


http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6781743/Renegade.Ops.Update.1-SKIDROW_[ALEX]   *UPDATE*

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6779649/Renegade_Ops-SKIDROW_(fix_only)     *FIX*



and they had alot of fale positive viruses report that made me paranoid

I tried to freeze my system with deepfreeze 'n work without protection on them

and YEt .. at Best chances I could play only in the menue of the game then lags freezes comes and mostly crashed 'n black-screens

No matter what I do 'n how I do it.

On my opinion ? avoid those links 'n torrents or try it 'n tell me how it worked nice 'n almost flawless for you


------------------

Yet here is a Good release I found : 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6778621/Renegade_Ops-SKIDROW(fixed)tim225 

I installed it 'n copied the content 

I the start, there was no report from my antivirus like the others 

But the game didn't work nice or even not working at all 

so I had to bring an updated patch from Leecherslair called 

Renegade.Ops.Update.2-SKIDROW

and recopied the cracks AND it was amazing flawless game, I played 2 hrs and reached lvl 3

The only time the game lagged was at a mission where u hunt down a fleeing chopper

I believe the lag was caused by the AI's pathing  .. not the crack or anything :)

--------------

PS:  update your Direct X with the latest dlls from Microsoft
