Wilko Johnson organised a charity event on 18 February 1978 at The Roundhouse to raise money to help preserve some William Wordsworth manuscripts. The Count Bishops and MotÃ¶rhead were also on the bill, but for contractual reasons MotÃ¶rhead needed to perform under another name. Lemmy came up with the name Iron Fist and the Hordes from Hell, part of which would later be used for the name of a studio album. 

Chiswick Records boss Ted Carroll organised the Rolling Stones mobile truck to record the event and later released the album through his Big Beat Records label in 1983.  After that it has been re-released with other titles and/or other sleeves, amongst others as "The Watcher" in Canada, "City Kids", "Live, Loud and Lewd" and "Iron Fist and the Hordes from Hell".
