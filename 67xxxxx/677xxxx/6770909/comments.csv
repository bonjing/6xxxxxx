This is a Steam game, moron.  Read the description.  Even though it's priated doesn't mean shit, that just means you wouldn't have to play it through steam (herp derp, why they crack it).

,Gerbuli,2011-10-28T10:25Z,"Well this isn't that bad.

I played for ~30min and discovered that:

#1 My 20 pikemen got killed by 5 enemy pikemen since my pikemen stopped fighting once they killed the first enemy man I ordered them to kill. They did have the ""aggressive stance"", but that didn't seem to make any difference.
#2 I built a wooden wall around my base to protect my peasants from the wolves in the woods. Little did I know that the wolwes could just run through an invisible door on my solid wooden wall. Raped everyone in my base.
#3 My archers were up in a tower but still couldn't shoot back at the enemy archers standin down in the ground level, shooting my archers.

... There will be a hell-of-a-series of mass suicides for those who payed 49,99â‚¬ of this shit.
Thank god I didn't!"
,raWr-,2011-10-28T10:43Z,"As a big fan of the Stronghold series, I eagerly awaited this game. But I was met with utter disappointment. This is by far one of the shittiest games I've played all year.

Full of bugs and glitches. Did you know wolves can run right through wooden walls? Or that a bear can kill 30 peasants while they sit around and do nothing? HORSE SHIT.

If you were a fan of the series do NOT download this game but rather assume that the franchise is dead. Because after this game, it will be. "
,Gerbuli,2011-10-28T11:38Z,"To HempTeam

Oh yes I forgot to mention the amazing climbing abilities of the wolves :D

I had this wooden outpost, which is a platform ~5m high with stairs in the middle to climb into. Had some archers up there and the wolves indeed had no trouble climbing the 100% vertical stairs up to the platform and attack my archers.

It seems that the Firefly team has spent majority of the time they had improving the physics of the game. Yes, the archer that just got killed does fell pretty nicely from the tower and pikemen dying on top of a hill may roll all the way down. Realistic and nice.
Such a shame that they have had such a false overall picture of the game. While having ok graphics and physics the gameplay itself was left unattended and therefore its slow-going, boring and yet pretty buggy. It doesn't work as a whole. 
The bugs can most likely be easily patched off but the whole gameplay might not.

Well. I'll just keep playing the old strongholds."

hope you r fine.

Is there any way we can patch this ourselves, or does anyone know if one has been cracked yet?
Without a patch it really is quite unplayable. Judging by what ive read there has been a 3rd/4th update released thus far, but can only be obtained through STEAM. Any help anyone?"
,raWr-,2011-10-29T16:39Z,Firefly released a big patch on Steam but it doesn't seem to be uploaded anywhere else.
,inCarbon,2011-10-29T19:18Z,"Judging by the reviews and the time Firefly is taking to resolve issues, its unlikely we will see a cracked patch any time soon, that would make enough changes to gameplay/tech issues to enable the game to be enjoyed. Pity.

Any news about update? As i heard there is one on steam allready... how could they release such a bugged game ? "
,hahahahohoho,2011-10-30T20:34Z,"From Grzabek:
""... how could they release such a bugged game ?""

IMO; Diablo 3 and TES V Skyrim will be released soon. Maybe FireFly shit his pants for this, or under the investors presure.

,Atharol,2011-10-30T20:43Z,The game works to start. However you cannot play the game. when you press on start the game quits. i'm not shure why SKIDROW dident test it before the relesed it. i suggest we wait for Reloaded Torrent.
,Grzabek,2011-10-31T00:13Z,"@ Atharol 

So please tell me how did it happend that on VISTA X86 (laptop) it runs without any problems? SKIDROW never fails, just apply the administrarion previlages to exe file and it will run. (I have only problems with some aditional missions from the ""historical battles"", some of them stops on loading screen, rest is fine) 

@ hahahahohoho

Hmm, this made some sense to me, how ever the strategy of development made them loose clients like me - i wanted to test the game before running, so i think i would make a lot of noise on official s3 forum after buying that game ;) i cant comlete the 4th missions becouse enemy units go through my walls! i cant set a troops into towers becouse they cross the wall! I cant build a stairs to let the men enter on the walls ;D IM STUCK ;(

The only thing i can say, is that game works... but i sugest not to download it, if you dont want to hate it from the start ;D

to everyone that cant play on there laptop there is a solution that has already been provided if you wanna take the time to find it. (not the run as admin) it has to do with ur drivers.

just because it doesnt work at first it is not skidrows/extremezones fault. there are countless different types of computers that are all configured differently. something on your end is not right and needs to be changed."

Then the game crashed after the first ""trailer"" at start of game, but ran it as Administrator the second time, and it worked perfectly. 

I feel that this release from Firefly is disappointing. I mean that this game is worse than Stronghold 2.. I like the collections and have waited a long time for this release. Very disappointing release...

to your

C:\Program Files (x86)\Firefly Studios\Stronghold 3\bin\win32_release

If using laptop, then

,legio9,2011-11-03T16:31Z,"Works ""FINE"".

On Windows 7 X64

1) open with power ISO and extract the Skidrow folder.
2) Mount the iso with deamon tools.
3) Install it all.
4) Copy/paste the win32_release folder from the skidrow folder and paste it in you in the directory of the game (program file..)
5) RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR, otherwise it wont work.

NOTE: if you are using dual display, it will fuck up the game, so just disconnect your second monitor.

YES, the game has bugs (like most games), but it is still playable.
YES there is no skirmish (a big no-no if you ask me) but Heck!
NO there is no virus.
YES a patch will be needed for this one; but heck!, the game just recently been released! So give some time.

""Intel inside, idiot outside"", if you think that there is a problem with this image: check your hardware/software and config first!

If you still complain: get a life, you spoiled little brat."
,legio9,2011-11-03T16:52Z,"@extremezone/skidrow: Thank you, as usual, your release are of a great quality.

@Noobs:
Work fine on window 7 X64

1) with power iso, extract and copy the skidrow folder.
2) Using Deamon tools, install it all.
3) Copy  the win32_release folder located within the skidrow folder; Paste it in the folder where the game been installed (program files..) and replace the current win32_release with the ""skidrow"" win32-release.
4) Run the game as ""run as administrator"", otherwise it will mostly crash at start up.

Note: For some reason, having dual display crash the game, by simply disconnecting the second monitor, it fix it.

Yes, there is bugs (like in any games), but it is still ""payable"".
Yes a patch will be needed, so give some time OR manage to create a patch yourself....
NO there is no virus.
YES the image is fine, check your system and methods before complaining.
Yes there is no skirmish, a huge no-no if you ask me.
Yes, compared to previous Strongholds, if you remove the visual effects, there is LESS ""substance"" and less craftsmanship.

If you still do not know what to do: ask intelligently a question and say what you have done so far, so we can pin point the problem and try to help you.

,faizaan10,2011-12-27T20:00Z,"i need a patch. This game has so many glitches. in the 2nd level of the ECONOMIC CAMPAIGN i built walls around my castle to secure it from wolves.then i saved the game.  when i loaded the game i found many portions of wall missing which meant easy access for wolves to the castle and eventually my defeat. At first i thought there might be some other problem but when i tried with other save files,the results were the same."
,faizaan10,2011-12-27T20:27Z,"@Gerbuli.
That comment made me laugh like hell. Seems like i am not the only one facing these shitload of problems.
and yeah this game taught me that wolves have amazing climbing abilities. :D
i hope some patch fixes that problem.
did you by any chance face that problem that i mentioned in my first comment?"

Had to do this to get it working on windows 7. Should work on vista too. 

After installing dont start game. 

1. Delete shortcut, open game location. 
2. Copy files from skidrow folder then Paste in game directory. 
3. Create new shortcut.
4. Run on administrator.

Hope this helps!!"
