"Finessing the Bromance"

Kenny gets jealous when Will and Grant 
strike up an unlikely "bromance." 
Things go from bad to worse when he 
finds out Grant is coming to the 
weekly Keen Sunday dinner. In an 
attempt to strike some common ground, 
the guys try a "Star Wars" screening, 
a film Kenny is obsessed with, but 
Grant has never seen. 

18/Slower
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
