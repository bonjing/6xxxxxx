,djledisko,2011-10-28T19:49Z,How about you download it and find out for yourself and if its shit come back and tell me.
,Funkybeatzzzz,2011-10-29T04:09Z,"Pretty sure LiberOne is right!  What's with all the ""padding files,"" eh?"
,Num13ers,2011-10-30T02:41Z,Works fine.
,shartovo,2011-10-30T20:33Z,All songs work fine
,deeisblue,2011-10-30T20:34Z,she works! thank you so much :)

,tordajav,2011-11-01T16:08Z,Its too loud even when my speakers are on the low volume. Got to normalize the tracks!
,djledisko,2011-11-01T19:18Z,"@ tordajav really? Because i have NO problem with the sound, these are in 320kbps. Right click on any song and go to properties and click on the ""Details"" tab and you'll see the Bitrate is 320. "
,Funkybeatzzzz,2011-11-03T22:01Z,"Downloaded, even though there are all that ""padding,"" and works great!  Thanks:)"

Because even if I modify the gain (order a few dB less) I can still hear the clipping occuring- and if I then load the file in to Soun Forge I can see what a mess this is

You have to be deaf to not to hear the shitty quallity



I don't know if this album is yet another lost battle in the loudness war, or isn't only a bad torrent release by some idiot


PS   If something is in FLAC format it doesn't necassary mean it is 

automatically of a lossless quality; I can rip a gold CD into a 8-bit mono 8 000 Hz wave and encoded it into 320 kbs stereo- the outcome of this will be a piece od shit and not a piece od music"
,spunkster,2011-12-23T02:42Z,"He doesn't need to normalize anything, guys. This is a perfect rip. I just downloaded several versions of it (all 320k), plus checked out Youtube versions of a few songs. They're all clipping just the same. 

According to 2020k, a mixing/engineering music blog that reviewed this, ""itâ€™s easy to get lost in the loudness and allow the noise from the record to in an essence, actually drown the outside noise toxins around you and drown you in itâ€™s own pollutions"". They wrote about one song, ""Sonically, itâ€™s a disgusting mess with low frequencies clashing and trying to cancel each other out due to a lack of equalizing and giving certain portions of the bass and kicks to have their own sonic wholes, instead, all combining to muddy up everything. This disaster best describes every single imperfection present throughout this Florence + The Machine presentation."" They go on about it, you can google ""2020k ceremonials"" (sorry, the link's not permitted here). 

Please educate yourselves before pointing fingers at an uploader for a shitty sounding recording."

,djledisko,2012-01-02T07:11Z,@ spunkster Thank you (:
,torque96,2012-05-11T15:36Z,"hey I think there really is some problem with this rip. I heard some cracking while playing 'Never Let Me Go'. So i tested it with http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6790763/Florence_and_The_Machine_-_Ceremonials_%28Deluxe_Version%29_%282011%29, that sounded clean. Both are 320k CBR. I don't know anything about ripping process but this one is really dull. I stopped downloading at 40%. 
djledisko, you wasted some 100 MB of mine dude. Not cool."
