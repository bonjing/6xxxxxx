Reading most of these books (or at least keeping them for reference) on my Kindle, formats other than pdf are much appreciated.
Keep them coming!"
,jakcreed,2011-10-28T15:59Z,You can read epub on the kindle?
,Rockr901,2011-10-28T16:11Z,"Thanks a billion for taking my request pal !
An awesome collection you have here :) would love to see more like this in the future, from everyone ! and i'll upload some too ;)"
,polyfilla,2011-10-28T21:48Z,"I can't load epub directly into the Kindle, but a program like Calibre converts them nicely into mobi format. Results for pdf are usually worthless"
,jakcreed,2011-11-02T04:11Z,"For more of the same there's another similar torrent with some new books and some also in this torrent.
