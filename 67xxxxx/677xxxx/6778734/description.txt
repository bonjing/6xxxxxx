"Oddly enough, the french network Canal+ is also producing a TV series on the very same subject, written by Tom "Oz" Fontana. The first episode will be aired in november 2011.

It's quite surprising that two networks work on the same time on the same subject... They engage in direct competition... How come ?

An interesting study (in french) on this Telerama article: http://television.telerama.fr/television/la-guerre-des-borgia-aura-bie n-lieu,64040.php

Short english summary of that article :
In spring 2008, Canal+, after having broadcast the first season of "The Tudors", wanted to make the same kind of show, with history, politics, violence, sex, and came up with the idea of a story of the Borgia family. They hired Tom Fontana to write it.

At the same time, Showtime was looking for a successor of "The Tudors", and asked Neil Jordan, who had been trying to make a movie about the Borgias for several years, to go for a ten episode version of it.

At some point, Showtime wanted to merge the two projects, but while they were still at the pilot stage, Tom Fontana had already written the whole first season. ..." ironic no?... politics & "rivalry' in the Borgias makin':)
