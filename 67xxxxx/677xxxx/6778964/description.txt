Bringing to life the bestselling novel by Nobel Prize winning author John Steinbeck, this TV adaptation faithfully follows the history of the Trask family from the Civil War to World War II. A recreation of the biblical story of Cain and Abel, East of Eden follows estranged half-brothers Adam and Charles (Timothy Bottoms and Bruce Boxleitner) as they reunite after the death of their father, Cyrus (Warren Oates). They live together on their fatherâ€™s land, constantly quarreling, when they meet the manipulative and beautiful Cathy Ames (Jane Seymour), a prostitute with a dark past. The theme of good versus evil runs rampant throughout and entangles itself in the Trask family legacy through each generation. Jane Seymourâ€™s brilliant portrayal of Cathy through three decades, from young runaway to aging mother, earned her a Golden Globe. Fans of Steinbeck and Seymour alike will be pleased with this retelling which won an Emmy for best art direction and Golden Globe for best miniseries. This three-disc set features a biography on John Steinbeck, exclusive interview with Jane Seymour, and cast filmographies.
