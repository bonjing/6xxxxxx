,jakcreed,2011-10-28T07:52Z,You know I was just thinking about how there wasn't a collection of teen titans the other day. And now you've fixed the void! Thanks redrobin!
,zeuslogan,2011-10-29T00:28Z,Thank you so much RedRobin  great upload
,SeverTheHead,2011-11-01T12:27Z,Thank's so much RedRobin0. I got halfway through DL in one day and I've been stuck at 59% for the last 2. Someone Seed plz!!! We need to help each other! I will seed for a few days at least once done and I've got good upload. This should be a great DL Thanks again! I'm kinda new to torrents so If I can do anything to help don't hesitate to instruct me on how.
,Sil000,2011-11-02T17:46Z,"I was able to get all of the necessary files to start this torrent up again. I have every issue of V3 1-100 (or at least I think I do). However, I wont be able to do it immediately as I need to get at least 2-3 people to seed with me before I put the torrent back up on TPB. This torrent failed because 1 person tried to seed to a 100 leechers. I wont make that mistake. SeverTheHead if you are interested in helping me, or whosoever is reading this comment then send me an email at this email address Silvonous@Gmail.com."
,bugmeless,2011-11-03T12:01Z,"Well, no.  If this torrent has ""failed"", it's not because only one person was seeding.  It's because that person stopped seeding before anyone finished."
,Sil000,2011-11-03T23:27Z,"I am having some trouble getting people the necessary files so instead I am going to redirect you to where it was I got these files. I got them from here: http://www.filestube.com/5oivfsT2tPaHXpGhPBJ0jJ/Teen-Titans-V3.html  The reason I didn't tell everyone where to get these files in the first place was because I wanted to finish my own downloads first, so that even if the files are removed from filesonic I will be able re-upload them myself. Sorry for all the trouble.

P.S. I downloaded the files without getting any viruses, and, I know that these files are the comics."
,RedRobin0,2011-11-04T01:49Z,"havent stopped seeding, but im pretty inexperienced with torrents, and the upload speed si really slow for some reason."
,RedRobin0,2011-11-04T01:55Z,"ive gotten about 86% uploaded so far, but this being the first torrent ive ever done i really have no idea how to boost the speed. going to keep seeding until it gets fully out there, it will just take time"
,Lupinite,2011-12-05T06:14Z,volume 72 is in spanish. Anyone know where to get an english version or how to change it to english
