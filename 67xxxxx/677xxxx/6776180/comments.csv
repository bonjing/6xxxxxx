Running windows XP if it matters"

About audio file, u need to mount it, open mounted drive then copy paste everything from drive (audio and some other files) to GTA 3 game folder and replace... BTW is it possible (it was on ps2 with cheat code) to enable gore (like when u shoot some1's leg it drops off) ?"
