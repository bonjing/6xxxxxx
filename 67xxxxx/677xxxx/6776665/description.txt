Miss Representation brings together some of America's most influential women in politics, news and entertainment, including Condoleezza Rice, Nancy Pelosi, Katie Couric, Rachel Maddow, Margaret Cho, Rosario Dawson and Gloria Steinem to give audiences an inside look at the media's message and depiction of women.  The film explores women's under-representation in positions of power by challenging their limited and often disparaging portrayals in the media.  Miss Representation takes the stand that the media is portraying women's primary values as their youth, beauty and sexuality - rather than their capacity as leaders.  The film premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival and was the winner of the 2011 Maui Film Festival Movie Matters Award.  Miss Representation is written, directed and produced by Jennifer Siebel Newsom.
