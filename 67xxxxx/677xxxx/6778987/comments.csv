To those knocking the video quality, I think what you interpret as poor video quality, are actually intentionally placed filters by the film editors. The converted video quality is actually fairly pristine. This film kind of comes off as a full length student film. It bears earmarks of less than professional filmmaking. There is dirt on the camera's lens during several shots in this movie, while opposing angle shots don't have dirty lenses, which is a total rookie mistake. It's just plain, careless camera work, and lack of budget for a reshoot. Generally, even your lowest budget indy film wouldn't permit shoddy camera work to this degree. The first thing that cued me to recognize the amateur quality of this movie, was the opening dialog's audio, which is just strangely in your face. I don't know if it's poor mics or, crappy sound equipment, but something about the audio lets you know right away, that this is not professionally produced.(I'm thinking, they didn't have directional mics, or they overdubbed a lot of scenes adding no score or effects on voices.)  The camera work and editing was decent, aside of what I mentioned before. As far as inciting incidents go, this one came about halfway into the film.(I wasn't sure it would ever come.) The opening hook is poor. ""I'm building a flame thrower,"" and something about a car, like some inside joke between the screenwriter and his real life best friend???.... That's your opening hook??? (Believe me, ... that isn't enough, to create a box office smash. ) ... Then 50 insipid, dull, monotonous minutes of young adults, doing what, I could walk outside and watch young adults do, outside my door. It's just irrational, idiot kids, being, ... idiot kids. (Sort of talentless on the acting end.) If you just sit and watch your roommates, ... it'd be about the same as watching this movie. Maybe a little less violent. The film introduces chapters as if it were following some kind of act structure, which it ... isn't. I'm surprised this film received any accolades of any type, unless hollywood, just sees this kid and wants to let him in for some obscure reason. I won't say there is no talent. There is some. Some will say that the director is some indie film innovator, but he amounts to little more than a trite screenwriter that has a lack of education to that effect. That's just the facts. The fact the film receives any attention at all, is beyond amazing to me. I can only imagine the politics, ... i assume half the attention it's gotten comes from the production companies promotional contracts with their associates. I'm suprised a production company bought this film, but who knows? Again, the film world has their obscure politics as to  why things do what they do. "
