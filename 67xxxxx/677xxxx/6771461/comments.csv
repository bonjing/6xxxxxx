He however mentioned that ""echoes"" was the SECOND attempt... it never got submitted to kubrick as he had already finished production. The first piece they wrote to sync to 2001 was ""atom heart mother suite""... when kubrick heard it he told the band it was brilliant and that he loved it but that it was too much music and not enough weird noises.  roger said the band and he especially were ""crushed"" and kubrick told them if they got him another recording of the same length (note both pieces are identical in length) he'd give it a shot. About 1.5 decades ago, I had pretty solid results with both by starting them at the beginning of the final sequence only....(youve tagged it JBtI) Roger did mention they composed the songs to the ""end sequence"" im very interested to see your work though... kudos for your taste in music, film, and urban legend! thanks also for the effort! and id also recommend getting a copy of atom heart mother and playing it to the end sequence there are some pretty startling synch-ups... and roger also mentioned officially that he nor the band had anything to do with the wizard of oz and that he hadn't even seen the film before they made dark side. dave gilmour piped up to agree.
anyways thanks and kudos and maybe ill up a version of the atom heart odyssey..."
