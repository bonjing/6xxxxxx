,Starguy256,2011-10-29T00:53Z,DO NOT GET. GAME HAS NOT BEEN RELEASED YET. THIS IS A FAKE!
,overpowrd,2011-10-29T01:13Z,because games have never been leaked/released by a re-seller early?

,black_shadow_1981,2011-10-29T04:58Z,not fake because my backup dealer has started listing it on his site as of about 3hours ago
,Staryoshix,2011-10-29T22:01Z,"when i try to extract it to my hdd it said it coundnt recognize it as a 360 iso, abgx said the same. is this  really a 360 iso?"
,treetall,2011-10-29T22:48Z,"doesn't work for me, and I have the new 2.0 update.... it doesn't recognize it... just ""open tray""... maybe it's just me?"
,Staryoshix,2011-10-30T00:23Z,"@treetall

yeah same here, i think this upload might be a dud"
,Terora,2011-10-30T01:55Z,Burn Xbox backup creator and speed 4x!!! Works Great

,pirates4eva,2011-10-30T02:57Z,yes this is a 360iso ABGX does not reckonize this bcoz it is a XGD3 game and ABGX does not reckonize these as of yet.
,pirates4eva,2011-10-30T02:00Z,@treetall may i ask what drive have you got in ur 360?? just because the sammy drives have been having some problems with the XGD3 games but still playing older games fine. i can confirm this defo works on my liteon and benq phat perfectly.
,micko84,2011-10-30T08:37Z,"thanks pirates4eva! :)
to everyone else, i dont u/l duds!"
,micko84,2011-10-30T08:39Z,"FYI, goldeneye will be released today"
,seedersstartseed,2011-10-30T12:14Z,how do i get this to my xbox?
,kurtpy,2011-10-30T15:39Z,"@micko84 , dont work ? "
,overpowrd,2011-10-30T18:13Z,"works perfect using Singapore verbatim media, lt2.0, LT-Burner Max. If you are not using all of these things stfu about it not working"
,overpowrd,2011-10-30T18:22Z,"works using lt max, lt.20, verbatim singapore media. in the process of installing now and currently at 77%"
,steelllynx,2011-10-30T20:17Z,"ImgBurn is the program to use!

Are some DL discs different sizes than others?  This is the first time I've seen this message with ImgBurn:

Image Size:  4,267,015 Sectors (8,334 MB)
Disc Size:     4,173,824 Sectors (8,152 MB)
...

I will try to overburn but I suspect the game will work but crash eventually.

The ZRY copy is 0.02 GB smaller and there are more seeds for that one now."
,pirates4eva,2011-10-30T22:48Z,@steelllynx all dual layer discs are 8.5gig you should not use overburn method in imgburn for these XGD3 games u should use  truncate method if using the newer imgburn and standard dvdburner or even better get urself the dvd burner and custom firmware of c4eva to enable u 2 burn 100% of the game have you ever burned 1 of these XGD3 games??? because u will require lt+2.0 2 b able 2 play this.
,Zenman1976,2011-11-01T00:47Z,"I thought if you used truncate that the hashchecks would be in the wrong place and it would cause a flag.. 

I might be wrong of course, seem that aint nobody sure about burning, unless its with the new IHAS drives and custom firmware.

I also though this was why Forza 4 eventually gave you the ""unauthorized disc"" warning no matter which way you did it, because those checks are on the ""extra"" space created via the XGD3 format"
,pirates4eva,2011-11-01T01:39Z,@Zenman1976.. all ov my XGD3 games have been burned using the old imgburn where you get the 4 error msgs NOT the truncate option and not using ihas dvd burner or verbs aone and mirror discs all play perfect i have completed forza4 and bf3 and driversf all the way to the credits and i have had no fails at all....so it seems sum people do know how to burn them with no probs just follow instructions 2 burn that was included in the first releases of XGD3 games and ur fine. 
,steelllynx,2011-11-02T22:59Z,"I burned with iHas324 but I forgot to check OPC at 4x burning.  Trying 2.4 now.  Anyway, I put the disc that didn't verify in the 360 and it wanted to apply the update (I flashed LT+ 2.0 earlier today) and verified with Final Fantasy XIII (it still worked) so now I'm trying to figure out how to update the dashboard without it reflashing my drive."
,steelllynx,2011-11-02T23:53Z,I burned at 2.4x without OPC and still get verify failed at 49%.  I'm using Memorex DL discs but never had problems with them before.  I'm going to keep trying.
,steelllynx,2011-11-02T23:54Z,"It read the disc, applied the update, but then it just says Unrecognized Disc when I try to play.  Other games still work so I know it didn't reflash my drive."
,steelllynx,2011-11-03T00:37Z,"always fails verify at sector 2112480
disc has Last Physical Sector in Layer 0: 2,283,519
This should be working.  I will try my iHas124 next and see if it has the same problem"
,chronic2011,2011-11-04T19:11Z,"for anyone having slow speeds, i used xbox360iso.com to get the game and I was CONSTANTLY getting 1MB/Sec i don't use torrents anymore i use that site. "
,steelllynx,2011-11-10T03:15Z,I bought some Verbatim DVD+R DL (in jewel case) and this works now.  I'll save my Memorex discs for games that are not XGD3.
