However, if you use utorrent as your torrent client you can pick and choose which films to download.

Nobody cares as long as you seed back what you have taken.

Best wishes

Its a shame my ISP has joined the other big ones and imposes bandwith caps and gives out warnings about copy protected files being shared. I enjoy these shows but woulden't be able to see them were it not for you and the torrent community. My cable provider charges me over 100 dollars a month and I cant find any of the things I find here. if my wife wasn't addicted to the TV I would drop service. Thanks again for all the great shows!!!!!"
