Oates has emerged as a frontrunner among the new generation of Brit folkies, marked out by the purity and dexterity of her voice and her hyperactive work ethic. She even has a cosmetics range named after her. Her fourth album is an exquisite piece of chamber folk, setting her lark-like tones to cascading piano, solemn viola and chiming handbells along with accordion and hurdy gurdy. It's low on surprises (no BjÃ¶rk cover this time) but stalwarts such as "Sweet Nightingale" and "Brigg Fair" emerge refreshed, and the contrast between its sometimes dark themes (misfortune, mortality, murder) and the stateliness of its music makes for an atmosphere of rare enchantment.
