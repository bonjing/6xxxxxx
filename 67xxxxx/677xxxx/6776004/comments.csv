[T],wowcabbage,2011-10-27T16:06Z,No sign yet  for Alpha or Captain America #4 of the same week :( So is Alpha ongoing or cancelled? i'm confused.
,MuserClair,2011-10-27T16:37Z,"thanks for the ul :-)

oh, and...
""Fans and friends, I'm sorry to confirm that Alpha Flight will indeed end with issue #8,"" co-writer Greg Pak tweeted this week. ""The book was originally conceived as an 8-issue mini, so we're still telling the big, fun story we intended from the start."" (taken from digital spy.)
also said on the same article iron man 2.0 was ending.

so, alpha flight hasn't done yet, but it will be soon, as will iron man 2.0 :-("
