I found the organization of the text to be excellent. I particularly like the order in which the author has presented the material. The author has provided an exceptional overview of the profession of a paralegal; the ethics, the responsibilities and regulation of the profession. This is well done.

The information Statsky compiles in this text creates a thorough foundation for the introductory paralegal student. It is a wonderful reference for students throughout the entire paralegal program, and a text the students will want to refer to when they transition from students to working paralegals
