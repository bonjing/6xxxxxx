A"
,Ztrident,2011-10-29T15:24Z,YeahâŚ54% then stuck. Where is seeder?
,iD0ct0r,2011-10-30T09:19Z,"Hey dudes, I managed to get more files from the HTTP download. So I'll share them.
But the HTTP downloads have been reported, and deleted, so I won't be able to get more...

All we need is the seeder to seed a bit more, and we'll get what we need."
