Synopsis:
-----------

38 17 "Grounded"   October 14, 2011 694-038
 
While all of Providence have left HQ for training exercises, Rex is grounded following an 
incident near where Dr. Rylander's lab used to be and is forced to clean the Providence 
storage warehouse. Noah convinces him to have a party, but can only deliver four hoodlums for guests. 
Rex initially has difficulty entertaining the four, who refer to him as an E.V.O. freak, 
until he takes them to the shooting range where they have fun shooting targets with Providence firearms. 
When Nightshadow, the Jungle Cat E.V.O. that was petrified by Van Kleiss in Dark Passage, 
reanimates and quickly takes down the remaining Providence forces, Rex locks-down HQ to stop Nightshadow 
from escaping. Rex, Noah, and the hoodlums discover that Nightshadow repetrifies whenever the E.V.O. 
gets distracted. During an intense fight, it is discovered that Nightshadow wants to escape in order 
to take revenge on Van Kleiss, so Rex manages to convince him to join Providence.
