          PLOT SUMMARY             
                                                                            
        
         In the vein of Bertolucci's Stealing Beauty, Richard Gray's SUMMER 
         CODA is an Australian film with a decidedly unique setting - the 
         stunning orange groves of sun-baked Mildura against the majestic 
         backdrop of the Murray River. Rachael Taylor (Bottle Shock, Cedar 
         Boys) and Alex Dimitriades (Head On) star in the romantic drama, 
         supported by a strong ensemble cast including Susie Porter, Angus 
         Sampson, Nathan Phillips, Cassandra Magrath and Jacki Weaver.Having 
         grown up with her mother in Nevada, Heidi hasn't spoken to her 
         father since she was seven. Now a young woman, haunted by his
          memory, she returns to Australia seeking closure. Travelling to 
          her hometown, Heidi is forced to busk for cash and her melancholic 
          violin score catches the attention of handsome orange picker 
          Michael, who offers Heidi a ride. Both are initially guarded, 
          but an unexpected connection soon blossoms.Fleeing to Michael's 
          orange grove after a family reunion turns sour, Heidi finds the 
          escape and camaraderie she desperately needs. Whilst Michael 
          seems conflicted over Heidi's presence, it's picking season and
           he is soon immersed in the colourful surrounds and offbeat 
           characters of the arriving citrus pickers. However, when Heidi 
           drops her guard and allows her feelings to flourish, Michael 
           struggles to reciprocate, his wit and charm masking a tortured 
           soul. As the past unravels, Michael and Heidi are forced to 
           confront the future, discovering that their lives and secrets 
           are better shared.
