Convert a Windows keyboard control to a verbal command and it will run .


Say "Copy" and your PC will copy etc


Just found this on an olde drive .


This is a prog , from back in April 1996 . 

It still works on XP , maybe beyond . 


Basically you create a keyboard control ie "play" , using your keyboard , give this command a verbal control (like say "Play" or whatever into the mike) and it will run .

I used to use it a lot in earlier days . 
Trying to figure out now how to use it again :-))
