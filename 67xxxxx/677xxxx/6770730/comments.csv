,R4ptor,2011-10-25T22:14Z,"I have problem with this. Whenever I go to ""Set up game"" it says ""Failed to setup"". When I open game and go for the first time to play online I got several ""servers"", lobbies whatever, but I cant join, says again ""Failed to join"". When I press again to play online ( when I don't reset game ) I can't see any lobbies. Down in left corner it says there is like 300 player online but I cant do nothing."
