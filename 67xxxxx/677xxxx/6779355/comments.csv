,v360961,2011-10-29T08:05Z,How do you install it? Can't I use it directly from my Xbox configured USB instead of transferring it  to my Xbox HDD and then playing it?
,sam_tauras_1990,2011-10-29T10:37Z,"Instructions:

-Open your 360 configured USB stick with Xtaf
-In the Content Folder, create a folder named E00002F35AFE8556
-In that folder, just copy the pack and then move it to your HDD.

Notes:
- If Xbox shows '0Kb free space' for your Usb, then definitely the content hasn't been fully copied(although Xtaf will show that it is copied but it isn't) and it will give an error on moving. Format it and then repeat the process.
- If the Pack doesn't appear on xbox, then copy the BF3 save file to the usb(it'll be easy if it is only the save file on the USB), connect it with your pc, and then identify the folder in which the save file is and then copy the pack in the folder along with the save file.
