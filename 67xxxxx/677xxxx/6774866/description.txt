
One night, an alien spaceship arrived. It came with the specific purpose of collecting specimens for strange new experiments. But this time, there were no cows at the farmâ€¦so the aliens turned to sheep! Help the sheep break out of their lab and escape the ship. Direct the scared sheep toward a teleporter by setting arrows along their path. Help them overcome obstacles, boss aliens, and more in Running Sheep!
