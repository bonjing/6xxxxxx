,majuaraan,2011-10-29T22:30Z,Oh wait I was all excited then i just relized my ps3 only has 40 GB hdd =(
,arnes_king,2011-10-29T23:13Z,"@majuaraan

delete the 3D scenes from the game then you will free up 10-15 GB maybe even more :) 

Or just get yourself an external hdd and play off it"
,Lambience,2011-10-30T00:05Z,"I love the uncharted games just as much as the next person but i don't really understand why. It a simple action/adventure shooter, the puzzles aren't that complex, and there really arent that many additional features. But im freakin addicted to uncharted lol. Must b the theme song...."
,alithegamer,2011-10-30T06:44Z,"its in the comments that it freezes when you open the JOURNAL,,, and its important part of the game you have to see the journal many times,,, so can any one confirm that it works perfectly? if it does than i must say that its a the BOON for gamers... its the game of the year guys........."
,arnes_king,2011-10-30T14:23Z,"That's right, everyonething works fine expect that it freezes on the journal, but download the game and wait a little more for a new fix, it won't take long to make it :)"
,eni_ndreu,2011-10-30T17:09Z,can you upload the ripped version its only 29 gb no 3d movies : http://www.ps3iso.com/showthread.php?t=91246

,supahgl00,2011-10-30T21:42Z,"Thought i would let you all know, ive been looking into this, and while the fix for 3.55 works in a sense... it requires the eboot fix (link at the bottom of this comment). However...the game crashes every time the journal is opened... the fix for this is an official patch to 1.01 that automatically launches on trying to play. if installed, the patch renders the game unplayable.... Even if the eboot fix for 3.55 or 3.41 respectively, reports are that when you reach level 9, the game freezes at a doorway... So some guy called nu9000 uploaded a workaround savegame to get past the level 9 crash, only to find that the game crashes again on level 11... There is no workaround as yet to get past level 11, so the game is impossible to finish... but if you just wish to have a try, get this torrent, then google the following for the fixes (TPB doesnt like links):
""uncharted 3 eboot fix"" for the eboot for 3.41/3.55, it should be on the ps3hax site

then google: ""nu9000 level 9 fix"" for the savegame workaround at level 9. It will be the first page that google returns, and the link is in the 172nd comment.
i will say again, you will not be able to get past level 11 until a fix for the 1.01 patch is released (if it ever will be)"
