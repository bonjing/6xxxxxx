,MrAtlas,2011-11-02T14:45Z,"What's wrong with people. This works perfectly fine. Don't you know how to copy a crack over? 

Also the game is meh, obviously the graphics aren't great but it's okay. One thing that annoyed me was the voice acting for the characters. You would want them to use the actual actors to keep it original but no. Only Robert Wagner and David McCallum lend their voices. Thanks for the release anyways."

,The_Doctor_Faust,2011-11-30T21:54Z,Can't figure this out for the life of me. I don't see a folder to copy over to make this thing crack so I'm not sure what I am suppose to do. A little bit more detail is needed
