Based on the 2009 Edition of NFPA 1021, STANDARD FOR FIRE OFFICER PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS, the third edition of Company Officer provides vital information for those who seek certification as Fire Officer I or II. Learning objectives in this new edition were validated by a committee of experts from the field to ensure that the content meets the intent of the Standard and highlights contents for each of these two officer levels. Content was thoroughly reviewed and updated to reflect new technology, practices, and terminology to remain current in the field as well as to focus on issues critical to the fire officer today â€“ budgeting, labor management, legal implications of actions, and more. In the tradition of previous editions, Company Officer, Third Edition continues to provide valuable insight and advice for aspiring and current fire officers alike.
