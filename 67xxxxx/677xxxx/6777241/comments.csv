Kaspersky Pure is like the bundle deal right? (so i don't need to install internet security also)"

,sam_code4u,2011-10-28T19:02Z,"if you are using Kaspersky Pure you don't need to have KIS 2012 or 2011. :)
KIS Pure is the best one.
though i would suggest KIS 2012 but pure is better if you have powerful PC"
,llotke,2011-10-28T22:45Z,"Sorry but I doesn't work for me: it's either ""invalid key for this application"" or ""expired"". I downloaded a lot of keys of you for KIS10, so you're a trusted uploader but those keys don't seem to work, at least for me. "
,g4gerrard,2011-10-29T07:55Z,"kaspersky serial doesn't start with ""0""..
all of the serial are started with ""0""
can't even type ""0""
explain that!!!"
,sam_code4u,2011-10-29T13:47Z,"it seems kaspersky is blocking my keys instantly. 
there must be something wrong.
i am working on it sorry guys."
,daviebhoy86,2011-11-10T22:06Z,i just downloaded it i got 38 days out it not too bad it worked tho! good man!!!
,sam_code4u,2011-11-15T05:11Z,"there are new keys. i guess you guys are not updated with my new torrent name.
