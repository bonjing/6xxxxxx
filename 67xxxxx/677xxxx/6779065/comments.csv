get it thru your fuckin thick skulls.....pun intended.  skull fuckin someone doesn't mean lying about a torrent on TPB, it means something entirely different."

,jsmoot,2011-11-07T23:00Z,"Why can't people come up with a cool movie like this and it not be about some crappy love BS man....I want it to be other people killing us because they are taking our places or something lol, these writers have got to get more creative with this stuff!!!"
,Powerslave0,2011-11-17T07:06Z,"The other ""Earth"" has very little to do with this movie; DUMB..."

,CGN3,2011-11-18T18:54Z,"What a shitty movie , waste of time.  A Melancholy bitch , looking for forgiveness "
,nex84,2011-11-27T13:12Z,movie is so fucking bad.. Ill rather watch the wall than the movie again.. btw.. its not sci-fi... the two planet shit is only 1% of the movie.. 
,esteban826,2011-12-05T21:08Z,"I have no idea how some people can rate this movie a 7..  at best is a 4...  
Very bad story, content..  Stay away unless you like to waste your time.

Quality of the torrent is great though"

,K.Lupus,2012-03-25T13:51Z,"So I'm guess the required IQ for watching this show is a step up for many around here, hmmm? I'm guessing many thought ""Oooh, martians and tits! Cooooool""

Sometimes it does seem that YouTube and TPB seem to collect all the same trolls.

TY Aoloffline... been looking forward to this movie..."
,marc_lucas,2012-04-05T13:36Z,"Perfect 1080p Bluray but rubbish film, poor plot, nothing about a ""2nd Earth at all"" !!!"
,Frankenhedgie,2012-04-07T16:02Z,"Excellent quality rip, A10 V 10.  As for the subject, this is no more about sci-fi than the film ""Monsters"" was.  In both cases, the sci-fi element is only a device to indicate that what we see around us is not the only reality there is, but there is another reality--not ""out there"" where few if any can go, but ""IN there,"" inside us, where we can all go.  If you want ray guns and aliens and space ships, there are plenty of other high-quality offerings out there. "
,Resurrection2pac,2012-04-15T23:47Z,4.4gb? you're jokin' right?? i'll not down this..8 hours man 260 kb/s ..its good but 8 hours is too much for movie
