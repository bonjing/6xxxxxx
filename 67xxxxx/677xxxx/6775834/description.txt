Two powerful German guns control the seas past the Greek island of Navarone making the evacuation of endangered British

to meet up with partisans to try and dynamite the guns. The mission is perilous enough anyway but are the Germans on the 
island getting further help too?

*I don't take requests because I don't have time and everyone will fill the comment section with them instead of commenting about quality and other tehnical specs of the movies or say thanks.Thank you for understanding!
*For best performance I suggest you use KMPlayer(find it with google) for playback
*These movies were made especially for PC and they don't play on a PS3.If you want to re-encode for PS3 or test for other devices be my guests.
*I'll ask everybody to stop with the "it doesn't work","it's out of sync" comments because I tested the movies before I uploaded them and they work fine
