 Btw. you can try, but I don't recommend converting on avi/xvid/dvix/mkv ;P (except if your stationary media player can't play flvs)=absolutely no gain on quality (flv=lossy compression) but gain in filesize(waste of hdd space). "
[V],mirogster,2011-10-28T00:22Z,"Hmmmm Is Piratebay using other abbreviation for filesizes, just like rest of the world (except France ;P) =MiB (Men In Black)?"
,gr971,2011-10-28T01:44Z,"Out of curiosity, may I ask why you are posting FLVs?  "
,brigzy,2011-10-28T03:21Z,"FLV's suck and when converted the sound is about 15 seconds out from the picture, waste of time, dont download, I tried to watch 1 and 2 Horrible! Thx for trying though."
,brigzy,2011-10-28T03:22Z,"1 and 2 are out in AVI, they look ok."
[V],mirogster,2011-10-28T06:34Z,"@gr971 I like to piss off people on internet. No, seriously, that's the ORIGINAL format from the canadian website (it's a webrip if you noticed). Ask them instead=www.history .ca

@brigzy I couldn't agree more. Use some 3rd party flv players instead. And those AVIs are from MasterZilla, it's nice that he is helping disable people."
