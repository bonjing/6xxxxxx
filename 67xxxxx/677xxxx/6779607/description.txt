[b]Thx Hive

CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D

Source: Bluray

Encode:

normally i dont touch blurays much but as with hallows part 1 the bluray is again dark and colourless on my tv,also had grain and noise in the video.
Since its mostly a dark movie you cant see that much, so i brightened the movie up a bit and made the colours stronger to get you a better viewing experience,and removed the grain from the video. 

Enhanced Video Comparison:

Scenes at daylight are now also better, perhaps a bit brighter as needed but for the dark scenes it helps a lot.
enjoy

PS: if anyone still prefers a straight bdrip as usual without brightness/colour adjustments just request it in comms and i will up it too
