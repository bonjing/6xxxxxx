I first head Tourniquet circa 1991/1992; and IMHO, I think they're one of the best "Christian" metal bands out there (see also Living Sacrifice, Believer, Vengeance Rising, Mortification, and The Crucified).

I found this at a hole-in-the-wall used music store, on Bloor West (Toronto), I think. The video quality is......not that great, but I haven't been able to find anything better. And, personally, I think the band could have performed better, but...I'll let you decide. I've never seen them live myself.
