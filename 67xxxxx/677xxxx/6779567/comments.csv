Tried unpacking with one program & it didn't work, so tried another & all good.

Did have to remux though to get it to work with my media centre.

Thanks all the same :0)"

The video file is fucked up. Causes video player programs to crash or freeze, it even messes up transcoder programs (like transmageddon). Ferrelas never fails, download this instead:
