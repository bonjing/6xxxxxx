I'm on the Administor Account which doesn't have Parental Controls, my Parental Controls service isn't even running, and I'm not the only one who's experienced this..."
,VektorX,2011-10-27T17:52Z,"Alright, so here's a work-a-round...
Right-click on the ""DisneyUPC.exe"" file
Select ""Properties""
Select the ""Compatability"" tab
Check the box for ""Run this program in compatability mode for:"" and select ""Windows XP (Service Pack 2)"" in the drop-down
Click ""OK"" and you should be good-to-go"
,Squishygiblets,2011-10-27T18:53Z,"Maybe a dumb question but I've never run into this on extremezones stuff before...

When I try and copy the rld.dll from the crack folder it says I need permission from Everyone to make changes to this file.

I'm logged on as administrator, using Win7 32.  Any suggestions?"
,Trigptm,2011-10-27T22:30Z,"@Squishygiblets 

I would strongly recommend you to give Everyone permissions to make changes to that file, in the security tab, under folder properties.
