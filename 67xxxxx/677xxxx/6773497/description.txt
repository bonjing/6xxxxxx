SUMMARY......: 
Todd heads to Tampa, Florida, home of the original Outback Steakhouse and       
birthplace of the Bloomin' Onion. Everything about this recipe is top secret,   
from the breading, to the sauce, to how to cut the onion. In order to really    
understand this recipe, Todd must find the man who first created the Bloomin'   
Onion, but he's not so easy to track down these days. Todd gets himself into a  
few hairy situations in his search for Outback's secrets but finds out more     
than he ever thought he would from some surprising sources. With all his        
knowledge gained, will Todd's version of the Bloomin' Onion be able to stand up 
against the real thing in a taste test?                                         

RELEASE NOTES: 
Hybrid. As always we use video frame rate to avoid stuttering.  All overlay graphics on top of film parts are video rate as well so this keeps the overlays smooth.
