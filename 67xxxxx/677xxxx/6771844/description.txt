         Todd heads to Tampa, Fla., home of the original Outback       
         Steakhouse and birthplace of the Bloomin' Onion. Everything   
         about this recipe is top secret, from the breading, to        
         the sauce, to how to cut the onion. In order to really        
         understand this recipe, Todd must find the man who            
         first created the Bloomin' Onion, but he's not so easy        
         to track down these days. Todd gets himself into a few        
         hairy situations in his search for Outback's secrets but      
         finds out more than he ever thought he would from some        
         surprising sources. With all his knowledge gained, will       
         Todd's version of the Bloomin' Onion be able to stand up      
          against the real thing in a taste test?
