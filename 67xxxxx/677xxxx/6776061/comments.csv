This is definitely a CAM, not an R5. A good CAM, but a CAM none the less. The video was done very well, low res, but it's not too blurry, fairly clear, no distortion. Audio sounded tinny, metallic. You could hear laughs from the audience and ruffles towards the end (as the recording equipment is put away). 

*Also, about 2-3 minutes are missing towards the end. What happens is pretty obvious, but it is disappointing that that content is missing. There are also a few spots that seem to glitch, the video almost skips.*"
