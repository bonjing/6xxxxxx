HOMESTUCK SOUND TEST is a fan compilation of 'extra' music from Homestuck, with over an hour of play time.

It contains unreleased tracks, removed tracks (with the original cover art and track number), and remixed tracks (songs that have been officially released and then altered for use in a Homestuck flash), as well as music from two albums: The Baby Is You by Radiation and Exile by Bolin. There is also an in-depth credits text doc. Enjoy!

Changes from the previous version include: Cover art, removal of several songs now available for free from Homestuck Vol. 1-4, addition of The Baby Is You and Exile, and a couple of new tracks.

You can always contact me over Pesterchum (I'm incisivePlayer) if you want to suggest anything that can be added, or correct an error, or whatever.

Remember to seed!
