Well if you're gonna use smartsteam, wouldnt you just download it from steam?

Since this is a non-steam version i dont think it'll work like that."

smartsteam doesnt allow you to simply download games from steam,it allows you to play on steam servers.. and i've used the previous version of this game + a multiplayer fix which enables multiplayer and it worked,and since the release of this game it stopped working. it gives me the error: you must be logged in to steam to play this game. so i'm wondering why doesnt it work anymore?"

well i personally dont use steam so i know very about these programs. I think you can download the game from steam with GeenLuma, but again, i dont know much.

Not sure why it wouldnt work. Maybe try asking around in a smart steam forum. "
