,termi599,2011-10-28T22:48Z,i have to ask you ...this is the first time you run angry birds on your pc or it doesn't work with my setup?
,termi599,2011-10-28T22:51Z,"if you have a problem with this setup click x to the error..unistall the game or better delete the folder C:\Program Files (x86)\Rovio\Angry Birds and do the whole thing all over again...
or another sollution is to update your opengl drivers...you always have to be sure that you have the latest update....:D Just leave a comment if i helped you and visit my website..."
