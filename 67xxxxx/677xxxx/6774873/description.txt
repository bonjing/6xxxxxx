The Vampire Diaries is based on a novel series penned by L.J. Smith where you are given the insight into the diary of Elena Gilbert. Elena had always been a star student; beautiful, popular and involved with school and friends. As the fall semester begins, Elena becomes fascinated with the mysterious new boy in school, Stefan Salvatore, and she has no way of knowing he is a centuries-old vampire. While Stefan struggles to live peacefully among humans, his brother Damon is the embodiment of violence and brutality. Now these two vampire brothers-one good, the other evil-are at war for Elena's soul in the small town of Mystic Falls, Virginia.
