[T],dylanlutchman,2011-11-26T05:48Z,1 of the best albums ever...not like the relapse crap
,TyMod,2011-11-26T23:22Z,"Yep.  What do you mean by ""not like the release crap"" though?"
,TyMod,2011-11-27T00:05Z,"Just reread that.  Relapse, not release. My bad lol

I thought relapse was decent but your right about the fact it doesn't even compare to The Eminem Show.  Recovery was really good and different also."
,Killer3474,2011-12-26T20:47Z,It's great.
