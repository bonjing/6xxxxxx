,Dreadmore,2011-11-03T19:42Z,I don't like to join in on the flaming but really Jackoff why would you take the time to come here and talk shit on a popular show its not like its a movie where random reviews can be usefull.. Its on its fifth and final season Anyone downloading it knows good and well if they like it or not.. Maybe someone just wanted some attention :P
,Xeginy,2011-11-07T01:50Z,"great download, thanks"
,handel1,2011-11-18T21:05Z,I liked the show very much until now. It was fresh and funny. I even survived the completely messed first episodes of the 3rd season (which already was the reason the show to be canceled once)... but now I couldn't force myself to force and watch this episode. It's pathetic. Now at least I will keep the good memories from the previous seasons.
,handel1,2011-11-19T13:13Z,PS. I decided to give a look at the 3rd episode. It starts slowly to get back to normal - it seems the screenplay writers suddenly got a flash and understood they are idiots. And yes - they are idiots. Cause from the end of season 2 they try very hard to repulse the viewers and now they achieved it. Just wonder why they did it?
,cjngr,2011-12-24T21:19Z,thank you
