"Horror Fiction in Seven Spooky Steps"

When Britta (Gillian Jacobs) runs 
anonymous personality tests on everyone 
for a psychology class, one of the test 
results seems to indicate that someone in 
the group is deeply disturbed. At the 
group's Halloween pre-party, she enlists 
Jeff (Joel McHale) to help draw out the 
potential sociopath and the two of them 
lure everyone into telling their favorite 
horror stories. The results are spookey.
