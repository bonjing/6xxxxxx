,Mavin,2011-10-28T23:04Z,Oh...I still need to watch the first movie.  I guess I better get on that. LOL
,paperclipeo,2011-10-31T15:40Z,"I don't even remember watching the first movie, do these movies fall into the same timeline as the shows or are they apart?"
,cheater71,2011-10-31T23:53Z,"@paperclipeo

The movies seem to follow a basic timeline from the show, Wikipedia says this movie was released in japan on august 2nd 2008. At that time episode 70 was released in japan. So if you've seen up to that point, you're good."
,paperclipeo,2011-11-01T03:52Z,"Thanks, I should have looked that up myself but feeling especially lazy this week"
,paperclipeo,2011-11-05T04:31Z,"Just watched it. A: 10 V: 10. I wish all the shows could have such detailed artwork, it looked pretty damned awesome. Thanks for the UP I am still going to seed this till the next episode comes around"
