Old fashioned sad love songs CD 30s 40s  320k 
(remastered)+bonus tracks (musicfromrizzo)

With songs like "You are always in my heart" the 40s mainly were a period
of great romantic beauty - it wasn't until the 60s that cynicism and a 
rejection of romantic notions that some perceived as constraining in their 
ideas of nirvana that things seem to go downhill for the human spirit
bringing us to where we now are fully intent on turning things around 
as though we only just woke up from what would have to be described 
as a nightmare scenario that's been evolving instead as of late I'm afraid
to have to point out.

Without love nothing of any true meaning could be achieved
and it  takes the right environment to foster it with the right
care if one is to see it flourish once more for those who are capable
of this sincere virtue in our midst
