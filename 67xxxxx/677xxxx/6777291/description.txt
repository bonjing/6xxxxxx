Machines of Loving Grace Discography [FLAC][EAC][Log][CUE]

Late 1980's/early 1990's band out of Tucson, az, Machines of Loving Grace had a few early hits, such as Bullet with Butterfly wings, and a song on the Crow SoundTrack.  Unfortunately like most bands success met with drug use which led to the band breaaking up which led to everyone forgetting about them.  Best band from the Crow soundtrack you've never heard of.

First album was OK, best album was Concentration - very good complete album.  Last album, Gilt, you can tell the drug use.  Great band that should be mentioned alongside Nine Inch Nails, The Jesus and Mary Chain, Depeche Mode, or any industrial/grunge band.
