Anyone else having a FLAC error on ""Cheap"" from the Concentration album?"
,Kilotone,2011-12-20T03:38Z,"*Salutes* @ 320kbps or above ripped Disco! 

FINALLY (Never thought i'd see it!)

Nice to know some people still have musical taste out there & took the time to reload Machines Of Loving Grace.

Will crank Lilith, Shiva & my own Golgotha Tenement Blues in honor asa."
,Kilotone,2011-12-20T15:59Z,"Just finished & checked average seed speed was 25kpbs

All working & error free for me.

Just in case anyone needs it you can find the FLAC of Golgotha Tenement Blues here while it's alive and seeding!
