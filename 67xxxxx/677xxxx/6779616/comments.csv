,PCdoc7,2011-10-29T16:47Z,We had perfect AVI files in this entire series from TorrentDay.com  -  now suddenly the poster has changed and all we get is RARs so we cannot simply download and watch anymore.  THERE is NO NEED TO RAR AVI FILES.  Which is why no one can watch Episode 56.  Please stop with the RARs.
