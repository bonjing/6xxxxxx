(Qaushiq Mukherjee) who has described the film as a "rap musical".[2] It features Anubrata, Joyraj, Kamalika, Shilajit, and Rii in the main roles. The film's music is by the alternative rock band Five Little Indians.[3] Gandu previewed at Yale University before making its international premiere on October 29, 2010 at the 2010 South Asian International Film Festival in New York City.[2] Gandu was an official selection at the 2011 Berlin International Film Festival and was also screened at the Slamdance Film Festival.[4]
Gandu has received mainly positive reviews from critics. John Reiss called it "a stunning visual and narrative feast"[5] while Variety said it is "a happily transgressive rhyme-fueled romp".[1] The film has caused some controversy because of language and scenes of full frontal sex. Media outlets have reported audience walkouts during sex scenes[6] and it has not been publicly released in India.
