 Shortly after reforming in 2006, Candlebox returned to Seattle with all      
 four original members in tow to play this memorable show at the storied      
 Showbox Theater.                                                             
                                                                              
 Alive in Seattle is a live Cd/DVD set capturing the night and is a stellar   
 show from a vastly underrated live band. The show itself is a multi-camera   
 shoot with excellent sound and video quality and the DVD also includes an    
 interview from a radio station as well as acoustic performances of Cover Me  
 and Far Behind.
