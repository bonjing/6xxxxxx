,ifAAAAAkingrock,2012-01-07T19:46Z,how do you activate (or deactivate) a subtitel ?
,3lBartoo,2012-01-09T08:56Z,"If you use VLC media player you press on the tab Video -> Subtitle tracks -> Open File. And navigate to the folder where you have the subtitle. Mark it and press open. You should now have subtitle. To deactivate the subtitle press the tab Video -> Subtitle Tracks -> Disable.

If you mean when you play the movie on your DVD-player. You need to rename the subtitle track to the same name as the movie file and put it in the same folder.

For example: If the name on the movie file is 

Mr.Bean-The.Ultimate.Disaster.Movie.1997.Multisubs.AC3.DvDRip.XviD-3lBartoo

You need to rename the subtitle file to

 Mr.Bean-The.Ultimate.Disaster.Movie.1997.Multisubs.AC3.DvDRip.XviD-3lBartoo

If the subtitle don't starts automatically when you start the movie, you need to press the ""Subtitle"" button on your remote control.

I hope it was helpful.
