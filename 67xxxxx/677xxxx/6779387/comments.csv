,Drake9669,2011-10-31T23:33Z,"Thanx, WhaleOil. I didn't notice there was one missing until I was going through and naming them all. I might have mislabeled a couple-few at the end, but I KNOW the first 10 or so are correct.

P.S.:  Sorry for the slow d/l speeds. I am on a dsl connection, and even being on 24/7, it's taking my comp a long time to up to other users.

P.P.S.:  I have noticed that several people that had completed the d/l removed the torrent and are not seeding. To each their own, but I will not stop seeding until there is a good amount of other good people that continue to seed for the rest, as well. This is my ""Thank you"" to all that have done the same for me in the past."
