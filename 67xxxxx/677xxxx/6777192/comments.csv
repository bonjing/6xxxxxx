^Proper^"
,w-mute78,2011-10-29T01:22Z,Um..... Dunno why the nuke claim. Seems about the same as it always is to me. maybe someone trying to bump their own dl numbers?
,QborT,2011-10-29T04:42Z,"w-mute78, I told why it was nuked so I dunno what you are on about, plus the proper wasn't uploaded by me (I'm not TvTeam you moron).  
You obviously don't know anything about scene standards so I suggest you shut the fuck up until you know what you're talking about.

great download, thanks."
,gmdave333,2011-10-30T06:32Z,torrents fine shitbrick. stop trying to boost you own dls with false claims of nukedyness.
,gmdave333,2011-10-30T06:33Z,the torrent is fine. qbort is a shitbrick. 
,gmdave333,2011-10-30T06:34Z,fuck qbort torrents fine
,MuchoGringo,2011-10-30T07:43Z,"EZTV, I've gone far too long without telling you I love you, so here it goes.... I love you!"
,TorrentJezuz,2011-10-30T10:12Z,THANKS EZTV
,aXelius,2011-10-30T16:36Z,not proper qbort is right. first time eztv doesent deliver quality torrent
,QborT,2011-10-30T17:31Z,"LuLz, before you fools bash on me you should check the links I provided.  The first was to TvTeam, the second was to eztv's upload of the proper.

I am not trying to promote anything I have done, and if you think that is the case then you are an absolute idiot.

The fact that this was nuked has nothing to do with eztv, ASAP doesn't seem to be able to get the ivtc right on FX (this is the second time ASAP has been nuked with a Sunny episode for bad ivtc).  Blame ASAP (the group that made the rip) not eztv (the uploader)."
,jimbob7l89152,2011-11-03T06:31Z,Oh shush Qbort this torrent is working fine for the rest of us no need to get your panties in a bunch lol. 
,jayjay87,2011-11-04T01:57Z,Good quality DL. Thank you
,SDIA,2011-11-04T03:48Z,"some people take their torrents pretty fucking serious, huh?"
