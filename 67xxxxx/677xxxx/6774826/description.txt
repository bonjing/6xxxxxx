
Alluda Majaka is an Indian gem from the mid 90s starring
Chiranjeevi as Sitaramudu/Mr. Toyta.


Here is an extract of a review available in IMDB.

Alluda Majaka is about 2 hours and 45 minutes
long! That's as long as Avatar. This is not a bad thing
because the whole movie is awesome. It's like Michigan's
Adventure it's twice the fun!

I've seen MANY movies in my day but never have I
seen a movie that is so much fun to watch. There are
literally too many good scenes to mention. I like the
whole thing. Part of the reason why there are too
many scenes to mention is the fact that this movie
is LONG.  It starts you off with plenty of action and
a few musical numbers.  Then there is the infamous
tractor fight scene which is too glorious for words.
In total there is something like 7-8 full scale musical
numbers. All of which have hilarious choreography and
unique locations. I'll summarize what this movie is
like in one sentence. Picture the funniest action movie,
the most overdone musical, and the silliest drama you've
ever seen. Now combine the three into one film. That is
Alluda Mazaka!
