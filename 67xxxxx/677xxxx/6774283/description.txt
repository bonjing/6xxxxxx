Six shorts, experimentally, conceptually, not Mozart exactly:

"M Is for Man, Music and Mozart," composed by Louis Andriessen and directed by Peter Greenaway 
"Bring Me the Head of Amadeus," composed by H.K. Gruber and directed by Barrie Gavin (in German)
 "Letters, Riddles and Writs," composed by Michael Nyman and directed by Jeremy Newson and Pat Gavin.
"N*t M*zart," composed by Mathias Ruegg and directed by Ernst Grandits 
"WAM! Ltd," composed by Misha Mengelberg and directed by Anthony Garner
"Scipio's Dream," composed by Judith Weir and directed by Margaret Williams 


The Greenaway style, this time around, is reminiscent of "A TV Dante" or "Prospero's Books". 

A lot of "we're classical, we're geeks, we're so cool" attitude.

The subtitles are either on or off for the entire film. I couldn't find a way to just have them on for the non-English parts.

A young Timothy Spall is the center of "WAM! Ltd". Plenty of important names show up in the credits, Ute Lemper and David Cunningham to name a couple.

The collection itself does not have an IMdB entry, but most of the individual pieces do. I linked to the Greenaway contribution.

Nyman and Greenaway contribute to separate films here. Nyman actually gets some writing credit for "Letters, Riddles and Writs" and it is much like his earlier ventures into English operetta.
