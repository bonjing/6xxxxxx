Code-Breakers: Bletchley Park's Lost Heroes.
A Timewatch Special
Format: avi/xvid
Televised:25 October 2011


A BBC 2 TV documentary about the WW2 codebreaking at Bletchley Park The documentary that reveals the secret story behind one of the greatest intellectual feats of World War II, a feat that gave birth to the digital age. 

In 1943, a 24-year-old maths student and a GPO engineer combined to hack into Hitler's personal super-code machine - not Enigma but an even tougher system, which he called his 'secrets writer'. Their break turned the Battle of Kursk, powered the D-day landings and orchestrated the end of the conflict in Europe. But it was also to be used during the Cold War - which meant both men's achievements were hushed up and never officially recognised.
