[V],Hackulus,2011-10-25T17:07Z,@m3ndo26 it availability must be working i gave seeds just give it a few seconds and wait for a connection mate. it will connect @BF3CRACKRELOADED11 whats that link your posting
,Aerithia,2011-10-25T21:38Z,"Good job on uploading this! I've leeched the files and i will gladly seed it up again, but could someone please explain to me what to do after? I get this two files, one named DVD1 and the other named DVD2, they match the size of the file in the description. What shall i do now?

I'm only 13 and i'm new to this so please explain detailed if anyone could be kind and take the time to do it for me. Thanks for reading."
,Aerithia,2011-10-25T21:42Z,"Oh, i forgot to ad that i've readed the description on this site but it still won't work! I use daemon tools lite and it just says ""the file is corrupted"" or something like that.

Am i doing anything wrong? I click mount, and mount the two files with a virtual disc, then i go to My Computer and click on one of the drives and it's then when the error happens. I'd be more than thankful for help!
"
,Kamarik,2011-10-25T22:26Z,"I think it's this what you suppose to do:

1. Extract both ISO using WinRar at the same folder or Burn them to DVD's

2. Run OriginInstaller.exe

3. After the installation is complete, check the installation folder name if it has (TM) symbol, than just rename the folder and remove that symbol or any other symbols.

4. Copy the crack into the installation folder.

Than run the game, if you had problems, then try to default your video settings, if the game ran, start to modify your video settings and see what is causing the problem (mainly V-Sync causes problems with some games)

Got this info also from this forum...

B.t.w. I'll keep seeding!"
[V],Hackulus,2011-10-25T22:32Z,@Aerithia in the installation folder remove the letters TM and then install that should do it

Can you explain to me what seedbox is?

tnx bro "
[V],Hackulus,2011-10-25T23:32Z,"A seedbox is BitTorrent jargon for a dedicated high-speed server, used exclusively for torrent transfers. With a seedbox you’ll be able to download and upload faster than you ever imagined. Additionally, you can manage your torrents through a browser from anywhere, anytime."
,Insomneac,2011-10-25T23:35Z,"Is Reloaded the Limited Edition?

Thank You."
[V],Hackulus,2011-10-25T23:40Z,"Most seedboxes are on 100Mbit lines, which makes them really fast. Unquestionably faster than your home Internet access, You can sit back, relax and watch in amazement at how fast the torrents finish. Gigabyte files will be downloaded in minutes, practically without limitations. Of course, youâ€™ll still be limited to the speed of your home connection when you want to transfer these files from the server to your computer. so What i do is upload the files to my seedbox server and the seedbox does all the seeding,  at very high speeds so i dont have to use my computer once the files are on the server, my seedbox server is located in france for better speed"

Worked for me 100% on (win 7 32bit , nvidia 9500 GT 1 Giga , 2 Giga RAM and CPU 3 GH Dual Core )


Battlefield 3 Double Sound Echo Fix By Dr Ali Aliraqi


Before you begin and load your mission (on Game Menu)

Press Alt + Tab then Task Manager then rigth click on BF3.exe then Set Affinity

after that unselect CPU 1 ( Select only CPU 0 )

you will notice that  double sound or sound echo disapear ...

But you will notice also that game will become slower (because only one CPU of dual core CPU worked) so you needed to reduce resolution ...


Note :Few Seconds after loading and beginning your mission you can reselect CPU 1 with CPU 0 and game will become faster ...

But But But double sound or echo reapear when new loading regain (loading regain when you kill or begin next mission etc ... ) ...


So Conclusion : Dual Core CPU is main cause of double sound or echo ...


So we are waiting  computer supporter that make patch or installer or anything for : ( battlefield 3 begin with single core CPU and converted to dual core 
CPU automatically few seconds after loading complete and when new loading reapear it converted to single core CPU automatically and it converted to dual core
CPU automatically few seconds after loading complete )   

It is so difficult but we are needing that ...

My Problem is that my Battlefield 3 is unable to start correctly. I install the Program and i delete the (TM) in the installation dir. Then i copy the battlefield 3 crack into the installation dir. When i want to start it i get the error: Battlefield 3 doesnt work...

Maybe its because i didnt understand (3. Install the game. Redistributables as needed in \__Installer

I just installed it using daemon tools.

1. Have you copied everything from inside the original Battlefield 3 folder (the one with the tm at the end) into another folder?
2. Have you copied the crack into the core folder of the game?

IF YOU HAVE PASSED THE PREVIOUS TWO STEPS, MOVE ON TO STARTING THE GAME

1. If you encounter a black screen with nothing happening but you do at some point see a blue mouse, all you need to do is push start (windows key) or alt+tab. You will see the game in a window running fine. Although you may have trouble with sound...
2. Consider reducing your resolution if your mouse isn't able to click on anything. Worked for me.

The singleplayer will disappoint you because it is only 4 hours long, and even though there are moments of brilliance in the singleplayer it's obvious that something is very lacking. It's also obvious that they chose to concentrate on the multiplayer. 

This has to be one of the best multiplayer experiences I have had in a LONG time. The game still needs a couple of patches, but the multiplayer is almost perfect.

If you guys were saving up for a special game then Battlefield 3 and TES: Skyrim are it.

But be careful! BF3 is very addictive."
,mr357magnum,2011-11-01T13:41Z,"ATTENTION: If you do not have the latest Update on your Video Card, This Game will freeze up.
If you have your Video card updated to the latest drivers and have the recommended Computer, This game download works GREAT. 
The Game froze with me until I installed the Video Card updates.
(I have 2 Ati Radeon HD Crossfire 5770's)

FOLLOW THE INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS!
The install is also directed to the ""D"" drive so you need to change it to the ""C"" Drive or what ever drive your Hard Drive is.
You will also need to take the small tm off of the name of the installed folder.
1 - Once the Game is installed Just open up the
     Crack Folder on Disk 2 right click and copy the
     bf3.exe 
2 - Go to the install folder right click and copy 
     over the  bf3.exe
3 - Right click on the bf3.exe send to desktop as 
     a shortcut.
4 - Rename the install folder from Battlefield 3tm
     to just Battlefield 3.
5 - Go to your Desktop, left click on the Shortcut
     and play the game.
      It is that simple.
The only reason that this game may not work is if you do not have the updated drivers installed for your video card or you do not have a Computer with the minimum requirements.
THIS DOWNLOAD WORKS 100 Percent!!!!!!!!!

ALL THOSE WHOSE GAME IS CRASHING/NOT WORKING...

I found this out after a lot of bullshit. The only proper working crack is the 31.3 MB one (RELOADED). Remember: It's just the .exe file you have to replace. No bullshit patches/cracks/dlls.

Just replace with the right .exe file (31.3 MB), and rename the God damn folder from ""Battlefield 3â„¢"" to only ""Battlefield"".

The game crashes only because of the â„¢ in the folder name. Some fucked up. Don't know why that is.

Worked for me!

PS: Thanks to lastsumuraiz here!"

Don't use any other crack .exe file. Use only the one by RELOADED. The right .exe. file is 31.3MB. Not 31.2, not any more, not any less. Just use the right file. No need to copy any other .dll or shit. The game will run..."

That's was the key for me... its the main file that the game is in, titled Battlefield 3 TM, just rename it and remove the trademark symbol... then it should work fine : )
