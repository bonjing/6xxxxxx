              NOTES


         - Our releases are always virus-free. If you think you found
           something  suspicious, it's  a  problem  of  your security
           software. All those  antivirus systems  will  never be too
           smart, so don't complain.  And always remember that we are
           not responsible for modified releases.

         - We aren't stealing releases. We respect hard work of other
           people and always  indicate  original authors of releases.
           We have permissions to use their files.

         - We are doing all this for fun  and  knowledge only. Always
           remember to support the developers if you like the product
           and its quality.


As the mysterious and powerful "Guardian of Earth" your steely eye and HYPER-POWERED LASER ARM have kept the citizens of Earth safe for generations (as well as proving a hit with the ladies).
With all your awesome TALENT and FLAIR, surely it would be IMPOSSIBLE for a devastating invasion of Doom Beasts to descend on your cities and cause havoc without your knowledge? (Even if you were MAYBE showboating for a magazine photo-shoot at the time...)
Now, you must not only defend your cities from the ravenous hordes of Doom Beasts - you must defend yourself against accusations of gross incompetence from the Galactic Council of Justice! And this is all BEFORE you can even start to get to the bottom of just who OR what is really behind the attacks...
