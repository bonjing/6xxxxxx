Gas up Greased Lightnin' and get your hand jive ready, you're about
to visit Rydell High! Star in one of the most beloved movie-musicals
of all-time as you perform the songs from Grease.
Sing and dance to 15 favorites like "Summer Nights," "Greased
Lightnin'," and "We Go Together," complete with the real on-screen
choreography. Perfect your routines, join the one that you want in
duet choreography, and really get down in freestyle sections.
Sing and dance in Dance Mode or just belt 'em out in Karaoke Mode.
No Grease game would be complete without a Party Mode, where two
teams of four can go head-to-head in duet-style play.
