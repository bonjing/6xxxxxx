,GoreDaddy,2011-10-29T08:09Z,For the best performance I'd recommend to watch it with Splash PRO EX Player. That's what I use to stream it from my laptop to LED TV over HDMI cable. You can get a good copy here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6608849/Splash_PRO_EX_Player_1.11.0_Final_Incl_Key_-Team_Rjaa. Enjoy!!!
