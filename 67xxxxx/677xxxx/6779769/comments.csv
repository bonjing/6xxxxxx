,otnemem,2011-10-29T15:38Z,2.1GB in RARs? Yeah right.
,Bose321,2011-10-29T17:06Z,Stop uploading in those damn rars... Don't be lazy and just unrar it yourself. No way I'm going to seed this.
,bin462,2011-10-29T23:02Z,Bose321 maybe he uploads rars because he has a  cap from his isp and he's trying to save cap space if you don't like it rip stuff yourself and upload them can't stand people that get stuff for free then complain  
,bposaune,2011-10-31T03:43Z,"So why this year everyone is uploading way bigger files.  They used to set the size so they would fit perfect to DVD size.  

Like 30 mins would be around 500MB and an hour show would be like 1.09 GB.  Now it seems to be about double the size.  It seems like we are going backwards.

Can anyone explain why they are doing this?  Can't be quality because I don't see any difference.

Maybe....it takes less time to compress and/or encode so they can upload sooner?  That's the only thing I can think of.

They aren't doing this on movies, just tv shows."

Stop bitching and go download 300 MB rips if like a retard you want to copy these episodes to discs."
