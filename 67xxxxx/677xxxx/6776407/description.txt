If this is your first visit to Fitzyland then do be advised that despite being a comedy this show is not really something for the kids. There are plenty of reasons why this show is on HBO Canada and not Showcase or Global. If you are in the USA you can find Fitz on DirecTV's in-house channel Audience Network, where the second season is to make an appearance in the not too distant future.
