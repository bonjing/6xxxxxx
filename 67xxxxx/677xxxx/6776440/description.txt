
This is my first podcast and i hope it\'s fine.

Painkiller already is a podcast put together by three major Call of Duty Commentators, it\'s where three gamers discuss games, current events, and tell a few stories. It\'s a good laugh and these they all last a few hours. 

These are the last 70 odd podcasts, i\'ve downloaded them from iTunes and so they are all mp3 but they all sound fine.

Hope you enjoy and please seed.
