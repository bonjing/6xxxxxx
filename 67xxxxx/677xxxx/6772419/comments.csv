,dean2804,2011-10-27T00:57Z,Anyone got English subs for this?
,man314,2012-01-02T18:20Z,Does anyone know where I can find English subtitles or an English audio copy of this movie?  I know it says Dutch/English above but there was only one choice of audio track and it was Dutch. There are about three lines of that tract in English and the rest are all Dutch.  I searched various subtitle websites and only found subtitles for a 2010 movie of the same title about three international aid workers who were abducted.
