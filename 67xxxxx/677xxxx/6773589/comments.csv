How is anyone going to watch these in the right order?

TV episode titles should to be prefixed with the show name and the episode code.

Like this:  The.First.48.S01E01.Pilot.avi"
,TheBrew,2011-10-26T22:28Z,Sorry @velvet. I'm new to TPB. The order that you watch won't matter though.
[S],velvet.,2011-10-27T02:02Z,"Well, for those to whom it does matter, here is the episode list:

,yakacm,2011-11-04T17:43Z,"using the SnEn is meaningless wit the first 48, the only place they are referenced like that is on torrent websites, the people who make the show don't reference them in this manner, so the only way you can say which is which season and which episode is to have watched them originally, A&E TV do give them numbers IE the first 1 shown is show 1 and the last one which on torrent sites was S11E39, is show 206, but even these are difficult to use as there are gaps for some reason and they are not always shown in the order given on A&E TV's website. For this show it is far better to give the name of the investigation as Mr Brew has done here, you can go to A&E TV's website where there is an episode guide. The First 48 is a documentary show and isn't in anyway serial so it makes no odds what order they are viewed in, I would agree with velvet that in normal circumstances it's best to use the SnEn format, but as I say it doesn't mean much for this show."
