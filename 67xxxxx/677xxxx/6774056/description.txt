oldies.com Comment Review of this CD set:

The Searchers: Mike Pender, John McNally (vocals, guitar); Tony Jackson
(vocals, bass); Chris Curtis (vocals, drums).

Recorded between 1963 & 1982. Includes liner notes by David Wells.

This three-CD boxed set collects 75 tracks--including classics such as "Needles
& Pins," "Love Potion No. 9," and "Don't Throw Your Love Away"-- that the beloved 
British Invasion group the Searchers recorded for Pye Records from 1963 to 1982.

It used to be, with reissues of the Searchers' classic Pye Records sides, that the 
challenge was getting them to sound good. Since 20-bit and 24-bit remastering have 
become the norm, however, the only challenge for Sanctuary Records (or the Sequel 
and Castle Records imprints) seems to be how inexpensive they can make the group's 
U.K. CDs, and also how many different reissues and compilations they can get out 
on the group's Pye Records library of around 100 songs -- after all, this three-CD 
set is at least the second triple-decker career survey of the group put out by the 
label since the 1980s. And the Liverpool-based band is threatening to pass the Who 
in terms of the sheer number of reissues and compilations of their work, which is 
amazing when you consider that the Searchers last charted a single about 38 years 
previously -- to be sure, they've been adding many good and some great songs to 
their catalog in the decades since, but no hits as such. This set is nicely 
comprehensive at 75 songs, limited as it is to finished masters and official 
releases -- there are no vault finds here such as the Iron Door Sessions tracks or 
live radio recordings, just singles, B-sides, EP tracks, and LP tracks covering 
four years in their history, all sounding excellent and in stereo wherever they 
were mastered that way.
