Jethro Tull are a British rock group formed in December 1967. Their music is characterised by the vocals, acoustic guitar, and flute playing of Ian Anderson, who has led the band since its founding, and the guitar work of Martin Barre, who has been with the band since 1969. Initially playing blues rock with an experimental flavour, they have also incorporated elements of classical music, folk music, jazz, hard rock and art rock into their music. One of the world's best-selling music artists, the band has sold more than 60 million albums worldwide in a career that has spanned more than forty years.
