Hello. Thank you for downloading the Discography of Springfield, Illinois band: Dog Of Panic.

This Torrent was created by the band to gain more exposure for the band, because Record companies make it very hard for the small guys to make a living with their originals.

WeÃ•ve given you this free gift, in hopes that you will return the favor.

First and foremost, we'd like you to invite you to hopefully buy our music:

I know you're thinking, I already have your music. And it was free! But  I'd like you to think of your purchase in different terms. Think of it like a donation to a DIY band that's trying to make a name for themselves.  You'd also be supporting local music. And all the proceeds go directly to the band. No corporate fat cats, no royalties to labels, and NO STEVE JOBS!
