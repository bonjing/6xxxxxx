Plot Summary:
A rogue asteroid smashes into the moon in a tremendous explosion of rock and debris. Within days, disastrous abnormalities start happening on Earth. What started as the most beautiful and the largest meteor shower in 10,000 years unexpectedly becomes the catalyst for a potential collison between the moon and planet Earth. The world's leading scientists, Alex Kittner (David James Elliott, TV's JAG) and Maddie Rhodes (Natasha Henstridge, Species) have 39 days to stop the moon's course or the Earth - - and all of mankind - - will perish. Also starring James Cromwell (W. and The Green Mile). The countdown is on.


From the Uploader:
I just wanted to note here, while the quality is listed as TVRip and that's what it is. The quality of this movie is better than I've seen some on here that were actually DVDRips. Minus, of course, the little popup advertisements ABC does throughout the thing after "breaks", that is. Other than that, it looks beautiful.

Please please please seed this movie! If you like Armageddon/End-Of-Days type stuff, this should be a great watch. :)
