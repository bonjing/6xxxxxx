,RaSe_77,2011-10-12T19:00Z,No problem. That'll be available by tomorrow latest.
,lakuli,2011-10-12T22:47Z,"is it possible to do Captain America, Coana, and Hangover II??"
,RaSe_77,2011-10-13T15:55Z,"Yes, I will definately convert these once there is a decent source available (providing no one else does). I don't convert PPVRips/TS/Cam."
,gorm4660,2011-10-14T10:42Z,how about a copy without any subs?
,RaSe_77,2011-10-17T17:23Z,"Once a version is available, then yes, possibly I will do another upload without subs. However, the only ones I've seen are the cropped versions."
,Slammer94,2012-01-08T19:21Z,"HolyRoses has a 2GB+ high-def blu ray rip of this movie. You could recompile his into a smaller size for iPods. I could do it for myself, but I hate downloading things that big on my connection. And I'm pretty sure his is good quality, with no subs. He is HolyRoses, after all :) "
