,MarioBob,2011-10-11T02:45Z,Don't listen to SodaGod. Jesse does not die. What's Breaking Bad without Jesse Pinkman? Seriously.

,PaulKS,2011-10-11T04:06Z,"Jesse do not die! Everybody lives happy on ever after, or whatever."
,hitnrun4fun,2011-10-11T04:07Z,Jesse was scripted to die in the first season. there's a reason he's survived the last four
,moop13,2011-10-11T04:08Z,No way i believe Jesse dies.
,kroyfel,2011-10-11T04:17Z,Thanks for the upload!
,Joker-Face,2011-10-11T04:36Z,"Jesse does not die. The above user ""SodaGod"" is just a virgin troll with nothing better to do on a Monday evening than attempt to ruin a great show. 
Do not believe his lies. "

,josh0223,2011-10-12T02:25Z,There's gonna be a season 5. Jesse doesn't die; calm down and don't give SodaGod the satisfaction of your overreaction
,Crollo,2011-10-12T08:56Z,"Jesus christ calm down people, if you don't want to have anything spoiled to you DON'T read the comments.

 With that said, Hank dies, Marie discovers Walt's true identity, rats him out to the DEA and Walt is forced to kill Marie and then Jesse kills Walt over the poisoning of Brock. No really though, come on people."
,adriannest,2011-10-12T09:47Z,"i love it how everyone hates @Sodagod XD

...but seriosly, you can go fuck yourself!"
,Kamikata,2011-10-12T10:49Z,SodaGod !!!   Hmmm... that name says all !  Idiot !
,hightowahh,2011-10-12T18:27Z,"Maybe jessie dies, maybe not. 
Seriously, sodagod.. if i havnt watched this aldready i would hunt u down and kill u. 

And no, this is not the final season :D:DD"

I'll impatiently be waiting for the final season. Thanks :)"
,de350z,2011-10-13T06:35Z,"Jesse is not dead, white is not dead. But the people they wanted dead, are dead :D"
,BalisongBrad,2011-10-13T06:56Z,"Best episode ever! No doubt! I don't think I've ever been so addicted to a television show. Unlike last season, this season ended perfectly. Doesn't leave you hanging near as bad, and makes the 7 month wait a lot more bearable. "
,deadroleguy,2011-10-13T14:29Z,lily of the valley...
,str8pirate,2011-10-13T14:59Z,"UR GOING TO DIE A CRIPPLED OLD RATA..... LOL EPIC MAN I 2 LOVE HOW GUS COMES OUT OF THAT ROOM ADJUSTING HIS TIE WITH THE WHOLE SIDE OF HIS DOME BLOWN OFF.

,Syreus,2011-10-14T20:34Z,What the fuck is wrong with you people? You give away the entire episode in your damn comments. Thanks. 
,MyKrossini,2011-10-20T02:48Z,already watched but why would you post any spoilers on here? not cool
,everbleed,2011-10-20T15:44Z,"I feel sorry for you str8pirate. Did your mother not give you enough attention when you were a kid? Leaving you alone at home with your stepdad who touched you in bad places? Hmmm...?

Anyway, don't worry guys. This cunt is completely off. I was a bit disappointed with the season finale because it didn't provide the closure a season finale should provide, in my opinion. I mean, I know it isn't the end of the series but I expected SOMETHING to happen. Pretty much the exact situation we were left with as the last episode.

Oh well, all the more reason to look forward to season 5."
,harigata,2011-10-20T22:35Z,"Shit, I hope this horrible DEA show is over.... over for me, anyway."
