Zainub Khan has been found guilty by
Pakistan\'s courts and is to be hanged. Her
last wish is to tell her story before the
media, and after approval, she relates how
her family was compelled to leave Delhi
during 1948 and re-locate to Lahore. This
is where her father, Hakim Sayed Hashmutallah
Khan, married Suraiya, and hoping to sire a
son, instead ended up with 7 daughters. The
8th child turned out to be a hemaphrodite
and Hashmutullah wanted it dead but Suraiya
insisted that she will not let anyone know
so as not to shame her husband. They named
the child Saifullah, and hired a tutor to
teach him at home. After a failed marriage,
Zainub returns home, notices that the tutor
was molesting her brother and asks him to
leave. With dwindling income from his father.
