I may not understand the jargon geeks use for various things. But I do understand how to judge sound & picture. Am into film making myself!

I had to put the audio on VLC on max to be able to hear, and the picture was soft too.

Which does not happen on [eztv] , [vtv] torrents. Yes, I am a new bee and don't understand what they are. All I know from experience is that their quality is way superior.

But, even [eztv] f***ed up last time! So really not sure how this works.

However, am definitely grateful to you for this upload nonetheless. Prompt and pretty darn good. Thank you.

Learn to take criticism in your stride! Will help you in the long run. Barking back at criticism is not the way to go. No point being defensive and downgrade someone like this.

Cheers!"
