And could you pls upload Robin's new show The Chatter that airs weekly on thursdays at 1pm east on Howard 101.
I'm sure any Stern fan with enough time on their hands would be very interested!"
,makisunn,2011-10-15T14:19Z,"@jumpbreaker that would be cool. Robin should do that girl's night out idea. One where it's like the view but at night. Winamp has a Howard channel on its stream. I usually copy the info, open up VLC, hit Ctrl-N and paste the address and hit record. I just wish VLC has a tivo function when I have to go to work. :( "

,jumpbreaker,2011-10-15T15:10Z,"@makisunn
I got Robin's and Artie's new shows on the @SternGeek twitter feed. He has pretty much everything up there and on his website. But of course thanks for the good idea you had.
And btw Robin's show isn't excactly very similar to howard's show. It's more something you'd see on cable news channels and seems too produced."
