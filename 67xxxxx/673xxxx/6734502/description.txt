These games have been created for unsupervised
play, which means that older children will be able to
read the instructions and play these games with
minimum guidance. (Younger children may need
reading help and initial supervision.) You can tailor
the games to the specific needs of your group. For
instance, some games specifically ask players to solve
an equation in a specified amount of time. You can
increase or decrease the given time to suit the level of
the group or even that of individual children.
