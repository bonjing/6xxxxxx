,irkeith,2011-10-11T17:43Z,adding this torrent again does not change the fact that it is not being seeded..why are you putting up a torrent and not seeding it
,irkeith,2011-10-11T17:45Z,scratch the comment it is finally being seeded..i will continue seeding
,HandsOfManos,2011-10-11T17:46Z,"It's being seeded as we speak. If you have a problem, feel free to scan your own copy, ingrate. "
,memphian1,2011-10-11T18:29Z,"HandsOfManos - Any chance you might have an ebook version of the two published ""Dangerous Visions"" books?  Thanks in advance!"
,memphian1,2011-10-11T18:40Z,Never mind... I just found them on Pirate Bay as part of a collection.. That will teach me to type before doing some research...
,frobknob,2011-10-11T18:55Z,Thank you!
,frobknob,2011-10-11T18:57Z,"memphian1: Where did you find Dangerous Visions?

Another Ellison fan here..."
,frobknob,2011-10-11T19:21Z,"This book is broken. It won't open with Foxit, and looking at the data it looks to be all zeros."
,HandsOfManos,2011-10-11T19:54Z,"File is fine. To ameliorate the impatient, it's up on Rapidshare as well"

,memphian1,2011-10-11T20:05Z,Hands: I'm having the same problem as frobknob... Adobe reader is saying it's not a recognized format or a corrupt file...
,frobknob,2011-10-11T20:09Z,memphian1: Thanks!
,HandsOfManos,2011-10-11T20:58Z,"For memphian & frobknob and whomever else:

Like I said, the copy I'm seeding is functional. I can't speak to what some of the others in the swarm may have done to break it. If you have a bad copy, the pdf is at *h*t*t*p*:*/*/*t*i*n*y*u*r*l*.*c*o*m*/*6*d*u*g*d*n*z"
