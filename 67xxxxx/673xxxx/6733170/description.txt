]Cliff Robertson (soon to be seen in Spiderman) stars as wealthy American businessman Michael Courtland whose life is turned upside-down on his tenth wedding anniversary. After a lavish party, Michael and his wife, Elizabeth (Genevieve Bujold) hear a scream from their daughter Amy's bedroom. Elizabeth runs to see what's wrong, but doesn't return, and by the time Michael reaches the room, both have disappeared but he finds a ransom note demanding $500,000.

In order to save his family, Michael arranges to sell his interest in the business to his partner, Robert LaSalle (John Lithgow), but Inspector Brie of the New Orleans police advises against giving in to the kidnappers. An attache case filled with fake notes and a radio transmitter is handed over, and a furious chase ensues when the kidnapper escape with Elizabeth and Amy ending in a collision with a petrol tanker. The kidnappers' car bursts into flames and plunges into the river, apparantly killing Michael's beloved wife and daughter.

Sixteen years later, Michael and La Salle go to Florence on a business trip. Michael can't resist revisiting the cathedral where he met Elizabeth and it is here that he meets a young Italian woman called Sandra, who bears a striking resemblance to his late wife.

Sandra (also played by Genevieve Bujold) and Michael fall in love and return to the States, and Sandra develops a fascination for Elizabeth, even wearing her jewellry and styling her hair in the same way. However, Michael's new found happiness is short-lived. During their wedding night, Sandra disappears, and Michael awakes to find a ransom note....
