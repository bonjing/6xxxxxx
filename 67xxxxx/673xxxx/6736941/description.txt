New skin for virtual dj v7

The Pioneer DDJ-V1 is based on the DDJ-S1 for serato and been styled for VDJ, Currently in beta for windows OS only we plan to addapt it for MAC aswell.

This is for testing only and wouldnt advise using it for a live performance, altho all the controlls needed are in place. there are some blank spaces and im looking for suggestions to fill them so please add any ideas you might have below.

Seed & Enjoy
