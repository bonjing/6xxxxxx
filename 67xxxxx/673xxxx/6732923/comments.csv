,ozzie9,2011-10-10T18:59Z,"Works great, good quality, no password, don't listen to the other bs"
,Kamikata,2011-10-10T20:18Z,"as usual ... great UL ... Thanks , nice one again...
maybe sometimes there are too many people which are only taking and not giving ... and wondering that  the DL is to slow... ha ha ha ...
so folks ... seed and spread the uploads ... "
,golfer2,2011-10-10T22:39Z,who is the retard that posted that this is fake?
,rodogs,2011-10-10T22:45Z,Thank you. Always perfect. Cant thank enough.
,orias6891,2011-10-11T00:28Z,Ok I'm looking at the torrent now and it appears to be an avi inside a folder. But when i first downloaded this 10 hours ago it was a passworded rar inside another rar. I'm not one of those arseholes that just shouts FAKE for shits and giggles.

,bert2006,2011-10-11T01:32Z,"eztv's torrents are never fake. thats why theres is over 12000 seeds!!

,EarlShoop,2011-10-11T03:20Z,Thanks
,ron292001,2011-10-11T06:33Z,orias6891 what are you on?/ Every one knows that eztv doesn't post FAKES. So stop being a silly boy or you will be sent to bed early..
,Tanlic,2011-10-11T14:29Z,Thank you kindly
,Dohandro,2011-10-11T19:10Z,"I d/l this yesterday & also got a RAR file inside another RAR file. 
I binned it as I didn't like the look of it even though this is from eztv & should know better.
Anyway... d/l today & got a straight AVI file so I'm not entirely sure what happened.
Cheers."
,aapb,2011-10-15T16:26Z,"@Dohandro 

you are a confused fool"
,Dohandro,2011-10-17T17:04Z,"@aapb   (who is an obvious twat)

Care to explain how you come up with the ""confused fool"" conclusion?
I do have eyes & I know full well what I d/l.
I think I made myself pretty damn clear what happened.
You might also note that I did thank eztv as well."
,biafra84,2011-10-25T21:10Z,"howcome i cant find S2E2 by eztv?

1st episode was around 50m so don't think it was a dubble opener ?"
