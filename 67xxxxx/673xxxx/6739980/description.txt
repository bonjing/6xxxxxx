Proud and solitary, Eel Marsh House surveys the windswept reaches of the salt marshes beyond Nine Lives Causeway. Arthur Kipps, a junior solicitor, is summoned to attend the funeral of Mrs Alice Drablow, the house's sole inhabitant, unaware of the tragic secrets which lie hidden behind the shuttered windows.

It is not until he glimpses a wasted young woman, dressed all in black, at the funeral, that a creeping sense of unease begins to take hold, a feeling deepened by the reluctance of the locals to talk of the woman in black - and her terrible purpose.

This story, by the celebrated English author Susan Hill, is a tribute to M R James. This is brought to the attention of the reader not only through the fact that it is a ghost story but through other allusions such as the fact that the characters spend Christmas Eve telling each other ghost stories and also through the title of Chapter 10 - Whistle and I'll Come to You.
