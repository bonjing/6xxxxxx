THIS IS SOME CRAZY SHIT HERE,I READ IT FEW YEARS AGO...AND I STUMBLED UPON IT AGAIN,

AND DECIDED TO SHARE IT WITH YOU...BE SURE TO CHECK IT OUT!!!

The book is about an unnamed former Shaolin monk who wanders the land with a talking mule named Lord Evelyn Dunkirk Winniferd Esq. the Third. Having been "asked" to leave the Shaolin temple, he has since had a bounty placed on his head, which many are eager to collect. Given the Shaolin Cowboy's prowess in martial arts, however, this will be very difficult.
