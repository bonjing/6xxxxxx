Warehouse 13 is an American fantasy television series that premiered on July 7, 2009 on the Syfy network.

The series follows United States Secret Service Agents Myka Bering (Joanne Kelly) and Peter Lattimer (Eddie McClintock) when they are assigned to the government's secret Warehouse 13 for supernatural "artifacts". It is located in a barren landscape in South Dakota, and they initially regard the assignment as punishment. As they go about their assignments to retrieve missing Warehouse 13 artifacts and investigate reports of new ones, they come to understand the importance of what they are doing. They are enthusiastically joined by young, hip, brilliant techno-wiz Claudia Donovan.
