Eric Sardinas and Big Motor are back. After their successful 2008 debut they return in 2011 with Sticks and Stones. Sardinas has put his onstage lighting in a bottle for the new album Sticks And Stones, an 11-song odyssey that ricochets from die-hard country blues to stone boogie to romantic pop to flame-thrower rock n roll. Matt Gruber, whose credits range from Ricky Martin and Carrie Underwood to the Scorpions and Lit, returns for Sticks And Stones an album that Sardinas says captures the full range of his playing and the full excitement of his trio's stage performances in a studio setting for the first time.
