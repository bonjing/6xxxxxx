Developer deank has released another great tool for all of your jailbroken PS3 consoles,
called discBOOT. This tool will allow you to play your PS3 game backups, both on DVD
and BD, through the XMB without the need for a backup manager on 3.41/3.55
CFW/MFW. You will also be able to take screen-shots and listen to music while playing
games using this method.
