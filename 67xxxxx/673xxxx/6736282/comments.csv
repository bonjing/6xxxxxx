,zeone31,2011-10-11T16:31Z,Can you please start uploading all Criterion blu-ray films? It seems as though their new releases either don't get uploaded or take a long time. Beauty and the Beast and Carlos have already been released in blu-ray yet there's no sign of them  on TPB. Thanks!
[V],GoodFilms,2011-10-11T20:15Z,Beauty and the Beast and Carlos are both here at TPB. Use the search engine? or come find them at hexagon

,linus_sweden,2011-10-12T08:35Z,"There is a problem with the audio on this one.
The original is supposed to be 3.0 (LCR). But this one is 2.0 and all dialogue comes from left and right speaker instead of the center speaker."

,k0ticgood,2011-12-22T10:37Z,"@BOZX

Big thanks. Just wanted to let you know that you are my favorite uploader now. Somehow every time I go to download a movie recently on my to-watch list, your release is always the most seeded blu-ray available (minus those stupid fake 700mb releases), and not once has the quality been less than perfect."
,k0ticgood,2011-12-22T10:40Z,"http://subscene.com/english/Midnight-in-Paris/subtitle-504284.aspx

English subtitles for the movie. Didn't use them myself, but they are were made for this release, and the comments lead me to believe they are of good quality."
,UKROB86,2012-03-02T04:01Z,"anybody else finding this movie just wont play either on WMP or DivX player? It just never starts, i've downloaded it twice?!"
,ChuchuPirata,2012-03-06T20:18Z,"Good Movie.

,Grodann,2012-04-12T16:36Z,"Thanks for the up BOZX. Great quality and sound as always =) Movie was good too, I'd recommend it ^^"
