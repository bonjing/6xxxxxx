FSX FlyTampa Hong Kong Kai Tak

Now released VHHX Airport Procedures for the NGX version of the PMDG B737.
The files have now been converted for use with the NGX FMC.
I have included an automatic installer for nav data files,because  Kai Tak Airport has now been decommisioned and is not included in latest Airac data bases.This has been tested by me and works 100%.
I got this file from xxx.austscene.com/#VHHX P.S.It is important to note that the next time you upgrade your AIRACs this information will be removed and you will have to re-install it again.

Such a pretty airport,its an addon you must have.Safety Warning:Fireworks display every evening(Starts at 8PM),so keep your pets(cats(h*ts)dogs)indoors.Have fun.:+)
