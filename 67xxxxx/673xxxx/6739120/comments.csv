Please SSSEEEEEEEEEEDD !!"
,huxley57s,2011-11-30T08:09Z,somewhat new to torrents. it says that only .187 is available.. im guessing that means i cannot get the full 32 gb..? never had this problem before

I guess that is all we could get before the original seeder decided to tank his own torrent. >_"
,Xorakka,2012-02-13T05:00Z,38%...
,Xorakka,2012-04-16T11:22Z,"54%...

I have already downloaded a lower quality version and watched the entire series, but getting to 100% is an obsession of mine now. >_<

It is almost as if the OP only logs on for an hour a week, oblivious to his forgotten torrent."
