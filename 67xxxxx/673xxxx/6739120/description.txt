Ed Stevens is a contracts lawyer at a high-profile New York City firm. Around the same time he splits with his wife (she slept with a mailman), he makes a single error in punctuation when going over a contract; and because of the resulting financial loss to the firm, he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s fired. Despondent, he heads back to his (small) hometown of Stuckeyville -- \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Anytown\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\', USA. There he realises he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s been missed by a lot of friends whom he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s missed; and he sees Carol, the girl he\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'d adored in high school. Swept up in roiling emotions, Ed buys the local bowling alley on a whim, moves to Stuckeyville, and determines to win Carol\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s heart. His horizons broaden as he settles once more in Stuckeyville, and the series itself settles into a charming, funny, often serious slice-of-life series focused not solely on Ed but on the lovable ensemble cast of people who live and work with him in Stuckeyville.

Tom Cavanagh plays Ed Stevens, a hot shot New York City lawyer, who, upon finding out that his wife is cheating on him, moves back to his hometown of Stuckyville where he buys the local bowling alley and sets up his new law practice. Ed tries to win back Carol, the woman of his dreams, only to find it is more difficult than it seems.
