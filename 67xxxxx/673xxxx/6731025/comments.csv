,Jackholed,2011-10-23T21:08Z,Is this the dub from 1990 or 2001? I've heard the one from 2001 is much better.
,bettyw,2011-10-24T08:55Z, A beautiful copy. Much appreciated.
,pynipple,2011-11-03T05:42Z,this movie runs like a demon penis rotating in a bag of hotdog water - thanks!

Uhm, that stuff you're smoking...do you have a prescription for that?

Both dubs have their flaws and levels of 'cheesiness', but hearing a new version gives the movie a facelift.
For the file size, the video quality is excellent."
,vincentvega9,2012-02-13T03:29Z,"he guys. question, i would probably prefer to watch the jap audio version than dubby coz they generally distracting when mouth moves at different speeds and stuff, is there an english subs for this included??"
,ojtheslayer,2012-02-20T23:05Z,"For some reason this won't play on Divx player. I'm really new to torrents, can anyone give me directions to how I can get this playing on the comp? Whether it be a player, or some little something in the settings, or just a link to instructions on what to do, anything would be appreciated."
