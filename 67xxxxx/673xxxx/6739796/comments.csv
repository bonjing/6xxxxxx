,Rhac,2012-01-16T16:59Z,"For those who do not know or are having problems, just download the .ISO and if it doesn't come with a .DVD File just use ABGX 1.0.6.  

before using it download the waves (i would download all if i were you) 1-13... after all goes green go to IMGburn (Last Version) 2,4x, TRUNCATE , don't do anything with your PC while is burning the ISO..."
