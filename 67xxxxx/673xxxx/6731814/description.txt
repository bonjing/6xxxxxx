Well, here we are, finally, meet the archetypical girl from the USA. Fake satin blond hair, northern europe inherited frekles, fake eye lashes, too much makeup, suspended driver's license, weatherproof smile, actress wannabe, yet so cute and ... still manageable waist line and unbelievable real boobs. I can't stand yank barbie dolls but I'll make an exception for this one.

The girl already did a scene on ECG as Lilly, not to be confused with another Lilly on GDP.
