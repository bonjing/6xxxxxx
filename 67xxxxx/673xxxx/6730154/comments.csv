are you fucking stupid dude just do us all a favor and stop uploading. go to the movie theater were you can get a better picture than what ever pay per view bull shit you got, or if your going to record ppv at least buy a dvr ""digital video recorder"" so it is quality is better."

Have some respect. and if you tweak your video settings [turn up brightness etc.) these ppvrips are quite watchable. looks like a vhs rip on my 32""LCD. Thanks for the up!
