,MrMcMahon,2011-10-12T17:02Z,"They would have profited much more by placing a hefty advertised version on Youtube, perhaps even split into multiple parts."
,DLLimport,2011-10-12T18:05Z,"Guys i have stopped seeding now, make sure you carry on seeding or the torrent will go dead."
,dkent555,2011-10-12T23:19Z,Sorry dude but this isn't worth downloading. It is poor quality and most of it doesn't work.
,DLLimport,2011-10-13T18:49Z,"Fuck off blaming me, the stream you get after paying is shite, worse than most of their youtube uploads."
,CAPiiX,2011-10-13T21:16Z,Thanks for the upload. The quality isn't as bad as someone said in he comments.
,FrottyZ,2011-10-15T23:58Z,"At their Webplayer you can switch HD on and off-
Quality is still okay tho. Guys its free, so stfu."
