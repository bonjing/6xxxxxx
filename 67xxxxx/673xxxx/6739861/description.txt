An up-to-date and in-depth look at the weapons used today by the United States Army.

In addition, it covers cutting-edge technology that will soon be employed by soldiers around the world.

Also included is a thorough discussion of Future Combat Systems (FCS), the system of systems that, when fully operational, will provide the army and the joint force with an unprecedented capability to see the enemy, engage him on their terms, and defeat him on the twenty-first-century battlefield. 500 black-and-white illustrations
