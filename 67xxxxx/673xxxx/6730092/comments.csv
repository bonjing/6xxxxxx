,MyKrossini,2011-10-09T18:26Z,"I don't think this was meant to be ""fake"" as you say it is. Something is wrong with the file but this is definitely from reliable sources so give them a day or so to fix it and I'm sure there will be a working, or ""real"" copy of this out very soon. Thanks for the effort sceneline!"
