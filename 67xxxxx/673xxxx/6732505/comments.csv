If youâ€™re trying to increase any given characterâ€™s trust rating via conversation, try the following. Find Pharaoh (the cat) and get him to follow you. Every time you have a conversation with a character when Pharaoh is around, youâ€™ll have a ""great conversation"" regardless of what options are chosen, thereby raising your trust!"

,greenieme33,2012-01-02T21:24Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!
You gotta do a survey to get a password, the read me instr. are a joke, and my comp is having trouble finding the file even though the set up went EXACTLY like the uploader's directions. 
Not good to waste time on!"

here guys :
43aaf8k9a3mv1ax7k8fsflx65h5a13

that should get you past the install hang for the password, might i mention this is a rip you guys should not be here putting crap like this up so you can line you pockets with cash if you files arent pass free and or catch free then that is the same as tryn to sell them which makes you the lower piece of fecel matter there is.
Enjoy the game guys and P.S. i didnt have take that damn survey to get the pass, because i got it from the maker his self."

Sparsh999
YugiohGXPc

antonybrooks53
lenzbrad
abreujeffry
michaelferraro86

Just check the time of when it's written and you'll see, also they all write with the same childish style.

Comment above has the working password for us to use, which also an earlier one also gave us"
,CoolChill,2012-01-30T20:04Z,"ok so all I should have to do is run the Setup right?

Bc if so after its been run, I click my yugioh short cut only to be given an error message.

I just cleared all the files of this off and redownloaded it, I read through all the other comments and no one else seemed to have this problem. Do I need to go in and extract some of those files or are they good as is.
If anyone knows what I am doing wrong I would really like some help"
,CoolChill,2012-02-04T08:28Z,OK its because I didnt know what it meant to mount the image. Go On with your lives. lmao

,ToniCar,2012-05-02T18:08Z,what are system requirements for this game and why while installing when it comes to iso frezzes? please help me
,zokolad,2012-05-05T20:47Z,"This is just pure shit.

The uploader hasn't given any instructions on how to get the game to work. No one mentioned I had to have a PSCX2 emulator.
I can't get the game to work,even after doing everything like it was shown in the ""Gameplay"" video.

Bad...just bad.

Next time,if you're gonna upload something,add some real instructions and while you're at it,remove the surveys and just give the damned CD key."
