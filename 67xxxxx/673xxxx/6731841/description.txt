Game information:
=================

"A Game of Thrones - Genesis" immerses you into the heart of the battles
and intrigues between the Houses that shaped the Kingdom of Westeros. From
Nymeria's arrival in the Kingdom of Dorne to the awakening of the "Others"
beyond the Wall, you'll live the origins of A Game of Thrones saga through
more than 1000 years of history, by taking part in Westeros' founding
events and largest battles.

In this great strategy game, victory does not necessarily result from brute
force. You can choose to use a military approach and besiege your
opponents, strangle them in an economical war, or even use dirty tricks and
diplomacy to politically crush them. Treachery and deception are everywhere
and can be more efficient than the most powerful army. So watch your back
and show no mercy if you want to keep sat on the Iron Throne.
