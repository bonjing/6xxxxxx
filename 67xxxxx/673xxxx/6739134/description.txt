Giraffes? Giraffes! are not your typical math rock group. Though they combine technical instrumental work with upbeat melody and a penchant for unique song structures, they add a touch of jazz styling and psychedelic influence to forge their own unique sound. This lovely concoction first appeared on their debut album, Super Bass, but suffered from some overly repetitive moments and energy-draining slow songs. Their next album, More Skin With Milk-Mouth, corrected these mistakes but lacked some of the more exciting shorter songs of the first album and had a less approachable sound overall. Dont get me wrong, both albums were wonderful, but they weren't perfect and showed Giraffes? Giraffes! still had room to grow. Enter Pink Magick: a perfect conglomerate of the first two albums plus a much stronger psychedelic and 70s prog influence.
