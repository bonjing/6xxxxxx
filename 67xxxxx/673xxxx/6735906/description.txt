Hot N Heavy is Bill â€œSauce Bossâ€ Whartonâ€™s eleventh CD of his own swampy slide guitar blues. Drummer Justin Headley, and tag team bass players, Robert â€œFreightrainâ€ Parker, and David â€œBiscuitâ€ Miller provide a slamminâ€™ bottom, making this album, by far, the heaviest yet. Biscuit Miller has played with Lonnie Brooks for decades. Freightrain did a long stint wit Florida Harp icon, Rock Bottom.

After serving free gumbo to over 165,000 hungry fans, after playing and cooking in homeless shelters all over the country, after twenty years on the road, the Sauce Boss is going for it.
