[b]Thx Hive

CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D


Source: 720p ZERO
thx

Encode:
16h of work on a perfect video!

well we got that awesome 720p with that nasty korean subs. The old Problem is still the same,
either leave it, crop it or blurr it. blurring 2-line subs is terrible, cropping them both away
and you lose too much video. But i discovered the above subline is only visible very rarely,
in fact exactly 70 times for 1sec 2 or sometimes 10secs. Thought i make a special version,
didnt realize that it will take that long. but after 16hours of intensive editing i am finally there.
the lower subline is constantly and only half in the video so i cropped that 14 lines away, wont be
missed anyway. now comes the tricky part. i thought about blurring the above subline only when visible
but that would ruin that perfect video so i decided to cut and resize only that above mentioned 1 up to
10 secs parts and leave the rest of the movie untouched so that you dont loose any video information.
That was really hard work, if i would make a brutal cut on that parts you would have seen jumping video,
who wants to see that. so i used camera transitions inbetween scenes to hide when that parts are.
In the End you cant and wont see any cutparts i made. The Movie looks like it was that way.
the right definition would be cropped only when needed, the rest is all there - audio is cleaned up too.

hope you enjoy all that hard work i made on this movie, i wouldnt do it twice again, its too much to do.

this is a masterpiece you shouldnt miss!
