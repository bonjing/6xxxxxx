Ive got this app for my Bb curve 8520 and it works spot on.!!

For the people who dont know what this Whats app is...

It basically uses your internet conection / free internet usage on your mobile to send txts to anyone all over the world instead of your credit.!

Works perfectly fine on BB's, jsut downlaod via the BB app world.

Works on BBm, Android and apple!"

,jamesmccabe20,2011-10-15T04:26Z,"uggenabben is Correct, this is for iOS systems only. If it were for any other oper. system it is free and therefore have no need to DL off of piratebay. Which is why I wanted to make this availible to iOS users for free."

appstore search doesn't find it.  and when you go to their website and click on download, it takes you nowhere."
