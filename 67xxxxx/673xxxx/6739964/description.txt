This episode of the documentary series focuses on the new giants, the heavyweights 
of the dinosaur world. It is only in recent years that experts have unearthed the 
biggest dinosaurs that ever lived.

One monster eclipsed all others; more than seven times as heavy as diplodocus was 
the immense argentinosaurus - a single backbone was bigger than a human.

For years, these giants were considered immune to attack from any predator - until 
the discovery of mapusaurus, a new giant killer whose fate appeared to be 
inextricably linked to argentinosaurus.
