,rocco_sifredi,2011-10-12T23:49Z,"what the fuck are you all talking about ? I downloaded this game in 1 hour and that was this afternoon and I already played 3 missions. I managed to avoid that  saving bug (you have to get out the game completly, to the desktop and restart the game). The game is a let-down, I didn't expected, It looks ugly, it has no heroes feeling at all, all creatures have retaliations, those stupid saint woman character are useless with all their resurrection perk; the spells are utterly useless, 90% of them are not spells at all, they are just stupid powers for the stacks; the enemy heroes can cast spells and resurect in the same time, your heroe can't...It a IDIOT game made by IDIOTS that have no idea what a HEROES game means for fans. That is no surprise, it's UBISOFT again after all, aren't they ? I really liked those russina guys game , Heroes V, I was so fond of that new interface...I won't buy this game, it's a shit  and has no feeling connection to the Heroes series...so be warned."

,g0dsize,2011-10-13T08:25Z,"First, thanks for the upload, extreme.  Quality as always!

Second -- for people with the blinking cursor problem, this is not a problem with the torrent, it's a problem with the game itself. The game's forums has post after post about it & Ubisoft is working on a fix.  The best way I've found to *minimize* the blinking is this -- in the video options menu, lower your refresh rate from 60Hz to 59Hz and make sure that vsync is *off*.  This doesn't get rid of the problem, but it does help it a great deal.  

Happy gaming, everyone."

,Midgetbuster,2011-10-13T12:00Z,"For the target thingy most people are asking for and solve any errors.
1. Make a shortcut by A. going to install location and right clicking the application and sending it to desktop as shortcut. or B. doing it via desktop and locating application.
2. Now on the desktop locate your shortcut and goto properties
3. in properties under ""Shortcut"" tab goto ""target"" field
4. Enter this as your target
""YOUR INSTALL LOCATION"" /offline
5. Set your game to run as admin (if error2 appears)

And voolah should solve any errors."

,SpyNT,2011-10-17T01:32Z,"This installed and launched for my fine. Windows 7 64bit. Some comments:

-Shortcut should look something like this:

-This isn't really necessary, you can just hit ""Quit"" during the patch download and it'll still launch the game in offline mode.

-The game seems very buggy at the moment and not very optimized. Even with a powerful computer, there is a long wait in black screen before the game launches. If your computer is older than a year or is not a gaming laptop, move on to the next game for now or find a patch with a crack (haven't tried Skidrow crack on this patch so I'm not sure).

Want to know why? Because ...
****SPOILER****




The main character of those 2 missions dies and the story continues as another campaign. So at the campaign screen, when you say you can't continue, just check the top left of the screen where you have all the faction icons. Click on one of the other faction icons and continue the story with another character."

,leoshik,2011-10-18T06:42Z,"Yes pretty much every one is getting the blinking cursor problem. Some people report that having vsync off makes it more bearable (mine was already off so I guess my cursor blink isn't as bad as it could be). Also some said that setting refresh rate to 59 helps. Other than that, wait for a patch.

I'm more concerned with a Dynasty crack. Seems that the items and bonuses you get from that are pretty overpowered. I'm playing the game on Normal and it's kicking my ass - but I might just suck at Homm 6."

V-RAM has nothing to do with it for the most part. Your using a laptop chipset which own it's own usually indicates an issue.

,keijin,2011-10-22T09:37Z,"For all those having problems to run the game.

There are two ways to make the game work.
Don't forget to make backups of all files you replace.

First:
1. Install the game
2. Run Game.exe and let it update to 1.1
3. Download http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6753049/Might.and.Magic.Heroes.VI.v1.1.1.Update-SKIDROW_%5BALEX%5D
4. Update the game to 1.1.1
5. Crack the game
6. If your game still crashes while opening it, try to run as admin. Using the crack you don't need to type /offline after, but you can if you want to.

Second one (opening by the Ubisoft Game Launcher):
1. Install the game
2. Run gu.exe
3. Update both game and ubisoft launcher
4. When the login screen appears, close the launcher.
5. Download http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6696953/Driver_San_Francisco_CRACK_Only
6. Go to your ubisoft launcher folder (default is C:\Program Files\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher) and replace the game launcher.
7. Run gu.exe. Register an account and login.

Please note that both ways don't let you play online (the first one says Invalid Password, and the second says Invalid Validation key).

Some people said that you don't need the skidrow crack to play it. Only type /offline after updating and it works, but I never tested.

If your game still not work after following these steps, maybe your pc doesn't have minimum requirements."

,cjvosh,2011-10-27T10:28Z,"THIS GAME SUCKS, DONT WASTE YOUR TIME.

it is not very thought out. the boss of the first map is strong enough to where you need significantly more units, including some ranged units when you first encounter him. you can run back to your city to build units, but first of all you can only build 9 units at a time, and second of all you can only build one kind of unit, which is a melee unit. they give you some ranged units in the beginning, but all through out the map, everytime you encounter enemies and fight them, they ALL attack your ranged you units, so half way before you get to the boss, their all dead! when you get to the boss, it specifically tells you you need to have ranged units to win this battle. but of course the game gives you no way of obtaining ranged units in the first map! Very stupid. I uninstalled immidiately!!!"

If you DO NOT apply the crack, you need to create a shortcut of ""Might & Magic Heroes VI.exe"" and and "" /offline"" in the Target textfield.

If you DO apply the crack, you still need to create the shortcut and add the offline parameter.

In short, the crack does nothing."

1. Clean installation from here http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6739165/Might_and_Magic_Heroes_VI-SKIDROW
2. Download and install the update using gu.exe in game folder
3. Again download the second update (v.1.1.1 I suppose) using gu.exe in game folder (with first update it just doesn't work)
4. Replace the ""Might & Magic Heroes VI.exe"" with one cracked by PROPHET http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6741203/Might.and.Magic.Heroes.VI.Update.v1.1-PROPHET
5. Made a shortcut of this *exe, go to shortcut properties and add to the end of it's target line "" /offline"" (without quotation marks)

It seems that in my case the problem was solved by the second update, which was meant to solve the starting problems on some laptops. "

,rescape31337,2012-02-24T03:38Z,"FOR ANYONE HAVING TROUBLE:

1. Download and install the game using this torrent.

2. Go to the installation directory (default is C:\Program Files\Ubisoft\Might & Magic Heroes VI\)

3. Run the update program from Ubisoft (gu.exe)

4. You have to run it three times and let it complete 100% each time, it's not hard, just don't even bother with torrent patches and cracks yet. 

5. After the game has been updated to 1.2 by gu.exe, download this torrent:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6905134/Might_and_Magic_Heroes_VI_Update_v1.2-RELOADED

YOU DON'T NEED THE 1.2 PATCH INCLUDED WITH IT, JUST THE CRACK FOLDER. IF YOU WANT TO SAVE TIME, DESELECT THE ""Update"" PORTION OF THE TORRENT AND GET JUST THE CRACK.

6. Copy the cracked .exe from the 1.2 torrent into the Might and Magic directory, replace existing .exe - Voila. Works perfectly, except obviously you cannot access the online features of the game without actually buying it - so don't whine to us about not being able to get Dynasty weapons - you are getting a free game here illegally - go out and buy it if you enjoy it."

`Might and Magic Heroes VI Update v1.2-RELOADED`
 if you want total ofline game, its working 100%, tryed it and any1 that is telling you it isnt working is A FUCKING LIER!!!!"
,Kid_Carter,2012-04-14T12:08Z,"If you use the 1.2 crack, you can update to 1.2.1 & the crack still works fin. I haven't played the orc campaign yet, but it shouldn't matter because you don't need 2 finish all campaigns to unlock the final 2. You only have to finish 1 on the tears path and 1 on the blood path. If you have unlocked them but can't get them working, try changing from ""custom"" to ""normal"" settings. There is no way to access dynasty content. If you want that $#!+ that bad, buy the game."
