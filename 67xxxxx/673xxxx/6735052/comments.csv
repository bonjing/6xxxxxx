,sween64,2011-10-11T03:51Z,"You can, it just looks and sounds bad.  The other rips by sunDox have had poor reviews.  I wouldn't bother with this."
,curialk,2011-10-11T05:05Z,"The quality is great for 200mb, the sample is only @5mb, i recommend downloading it. Thanks sunDox!"
,Thedethroned,2011-10-11T07:43Z,thanks sunDox! 
,fishword,2011-10-11T09:44Z,"Audio quality is poor. I don't have fancy audio system, but it really sounds like shit. I had to dl a version with proper size.

Video quality is decent for such a small size."
