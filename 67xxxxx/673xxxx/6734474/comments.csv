,Buck.Nasty,2011-10-11T00:18Z,Is this version going to work online/ multiplayer? BattleEye is a pain in the butt sometimes.
,RMJ13,2011-10-11T09:41Z,"HEADS UP, fade  protection is still full in, all this so called cracker did was remove to bullet drop. so this is a CRAP call of duty VERSION,  there is no bullet drop

yes you hit what u aim at  but what makes ARMA great is understanding bullet drop for the distance, IT IS REMOVED!  Allso  the graphic are still in full fade protection.  the game look,s like you need GLASSES,  everyting is FUZZY!

NICE TRY  but a huge MISS!

It is playable but your missing the whole point to this great game!

VITALITY version of  ARMA 2 is much better, they removed all the fade  in ARMA 2

But to play online you have to MODE our regisiry so noone uses the same game key! easy if you know how,   this is CRAP!


NICE TRY THOUGH"
