,deadly13,2012-02-16T15:12Z,is the pokemon games are very slow in this NDS android emulator Its slow in my Xplay plss help I realy like to play pokemon :CCC
,haluwasa1,2012-03-30T20:28Z,what version is this? is it outdated?
,AznAssassin,2012-04-03T11:48Z,"thnx for the upload BONE but the emulator lags a lot. I am using a DUAL core 1.4GHz HTC sensation with 768MB RAM with the latest Android software updates (which is a high end smartphone) and testing Pokemon HeartGold. It plays at around 3~5 fps. It loads pretty fast but the game itself lags. 
3/10"
,Scyrthis,2012-05-09T22:43Z,"1: No root is needed.
2: this is the real deal.
3: no use of getting it since it only supports dualcore and with my quadcore tegra 3 htc one x phone, it still lags just as much as it did on my old tegra 2 dualcore Optimus 2x."
