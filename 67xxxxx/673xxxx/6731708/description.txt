Very fine recordings, originally on the Capitol label, of four classic ballet scores by Aaron Copland ("Appalachian Spring," "Rodeo") and Leonard Bernstein ("Fancy Free," "Rodeo"). Conductor Robert Irving was the long-time conductor of the New York City Ballet Orchestra, and even though these ballets are associated with (American) Ballet Theatre, he leads first-rate performances of the scores.
