,ferretgirrrl,2011-10-09T17:48Z,Ha - I just thought - perhaps jimminy thinks the last episode WAS the season ending - that's kinda funny too...
,m0torrr,2011-10-09T21:22Z,Lame...
,OliverTwisted,2011-10-10T03:25Z,"I don't get it.  How can you post Season four, when season four is yet to end?"
,ViolentC,2011-10-10T03:52Z,"whats the point of this torrent S4 with no ep 13 ??
You must be smoking the blue"
,creffield,2011-10-10T06:34Z,smokin' the cock more like it. what a faggot lame
,petjax,2011-10-10T07:18Z,"and what the hell is the problem you want all the seasons you download it and put the ep13 in later ????.

you all should get a live and apreciate the effort you old wive's go play bingo.

some sad people in this world hahahahahaha"
,hitnrun4fun,2011-10-10T07:38Z,why is s04e13 taking longer than usual to post? the new episodes are usually up by 11 each sunday... of course this WOULD happen on the finale!!!
,oobe54,2011-10-10T07:55Z,I see the leechers point but there isnt any need to be rude about it he hasnt done anything that wrong it will be annoying for some people in the future if they think they have the whole complete season 4 but its just a minor annoyance having said all of that people on the internet are way to rude they would never speak to people like this in real life or else they would get their asses kicked. 
,miguelsuch,2011-10-10T08:02Z,"I get the feeling this torrent is responsible for e13 not being up yet. TvTeam and eztv think the season is over, or it would be up by now. 

dumbass."

,hitnrun4fun,2011-10-10T08:16Z,"oobe sounds like they have something to prove. i can hold my own if someone doesnt like that i speak my mind in 'real life'. eztv up'd s04e13 about 15 mins ago. look him up cause it doesnt come up when you just search breaking bad. a missing finale is more than a 'minor annoyance' its false advertising; thats why he's jimmy JR, senior would have got it right the first time"
