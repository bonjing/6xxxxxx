,weaponx4701,2011-10-18T04:34Z,"Having just a few problems.

I installed the program and at the end there are check boxes for Install DirectX and Install Microsoft Visual C Redistribution Package. I checked both and the following labels appeared.

Setup
C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Rage\directx\DXSETUP.exe 
create process failed; code 740 The requested operation requires elevation.

Setup
C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Rage\msvs2010\vcreditist_x86.exe 
create process failed; code 740 The requested operation requires elevation.

There are no specific installation instructions so after installing I tried to launch the program from the Desktop icon and received the following error message. 

Stream Error:
5:00000065434

I then tried to launch the program from the Rage.exe file in the SKIDROW folder and I got the following error message.

Rage.exe - System Error
The program can't start because binkw32.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.

I reinstalled and the problem was not resolved.

I tried copying the files from the SKIDROW folder into the CD3 folder as is indicated in some of the other torrents with instructions about installation but the same error message came up when I tried to launch the program.

Any help with this problem would be much appreciated."
