,raptor78,2011-10-10T22:24Z,"No problem, it's my first upload so sorry if anything goes wrong or it's initially slow to download, my broadband speed isn't the best here.

I looked everywhere for this and eventually found it somewhere, so thought I'd put it up for other people who remember it. 

It's not got the best acting or best special effects but good story and really creepy!"

I have deleted your previous (RARed) version."

,raptor78,2011-10-24T17:39Z,"I'm new to Pirate Bay so hadn't realised my upload speed was so lame. 

I'm onto my ISP about it, I've been seeding for ages but its so slow. 

I'll seed again when upload speed is fixed over next few days!"
