I'll update with more at a later date assuming all goes well.  Thanks, very much appreciated.  I've been waiting till rebellion's release to buy the updates (and partly because I'm low on funds atm), and it's nice to be able to play all the newer mods."
,mike88984,2011-10-11T04:47Z,Your welcome aha
,sting88,2011-10-24T03:28Z,"The game is playable just fine for single player or LAN multiplayer.

But I can not get on Ironclad online. I tried changing numbers from the provided serial for like 15 minutes and couldn't get anything to accept. Honestly... it doesn't make any sense that you could pick a random serial to work on their website... so I don't think this is legit. There needs to be a keygen or this is no way you're just going to be able to guess a serial."
,Bad213Boy,2011-11-05T23:42Z,"Confirmed, everything works perfectly. However the Ironclad Online key does not work. Maybe it was a glitch on their end and they finally fixed it."
,Bad213Boy,2011-11-06T00:28Z,"IRONCLAD ONLINE UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I got it to work. You have to make up a random number. Keep trying until it lets you. Fill the entire box up with random numbers. Spread your fingers across the top row and go crazy. Worked for me."
,GoldVenom,2011-11-24T03:32Z,"So, how do I update it? Please help me, a step by step on how to do it would be very nice! Is inside of the game on the online section? Or is a file inside game folder?"
,AutoToxicMan,2011-11-25T01:44Z,"When I try to play online, it says ""old version. Make sure to update"".
How can I get around this? I really want to play this online, but this doesn't let me...

I would really appreciate it if anyone could help me with this issue."
,garlor,2011-12-14T14:23Z,@AutoToxicMan buy the game
,AutoToxicMan,2011-12-15T18:36Z,"If I had money, I would have bought the game, garlor, but since I don't have any, this is the only place I can get it..."

,TheKillingJay,2012-01-04T15:19Z,Scratch that comment... Now i just need to set it up for online play. Random keys dont work xD
,Coldboy93,2012-01-07T23:37Z,I have a problem. When i try to play with the original sins or entrenchment in the main menu there is nothing to click on btw its 1.34 version
,TheKillingJay,2012-01-08T17:24Z,Yea happens to me too. But whats the point of playing those when you have Trinity?
