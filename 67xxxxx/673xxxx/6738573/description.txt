:  DESCRIPTION

     Microsoft Office holds a solid 80% of the productivity software market.
     That means virtually everyone at one point or another comes into contact
     with Office files. There were significant changes to the interface in
     Office 2007 and that paved the way for Office 2010 to focus on features
     that will bring your work to a whole new level of professionalism and
     mobility. Because 2010 is not about interface or new applications, many
     of the features are subtle or hard to recognize at first glance. This
     course will show you what you need to know to get up to speed and quickly
     take full advantage of the Shared Features.

This is iNKiSO release, (thanks iNKiSO)
but with little editing on the file names and I add a Playlist for each chapter and to play all. 
I prefer to play this files with Windows Media Player. 
With the other players (BS Player, The KMPlayer, VLC ...)it is not smooth :(
