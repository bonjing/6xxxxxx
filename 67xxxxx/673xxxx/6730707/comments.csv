,billygoat71,2011-10-09T06:32Z,A-7.5 V-5 Audio is really good and its in sync. Vid could be better.

,5amjr,2011-10-09T10:48Z,"I'm aware it's just out in the cinema so not expecting much but the guy giving it v-7 needs his glases back on!
Really deep contrast + out of focus look throughout which will ruin it for u unless ur happy watching any old shit.
V-4, A-5.
Thanx anyway."
,shadowmilo2,2011-10-09T12:08Z,"Ok, so after quite awhile of jsut 50 kB/s, finally got finished, and i must say, i am disappointed.

ALTHOUGH, yes, it is a cam. I have seen far better cams than this one.

FOR A CAM- Rating:

V-6
A-5.


COMPARED TO REG DVD - Rating:

v-3
a-2
(As some people like to see this rating)

I would stick it out for either a better copy, or see it at the cinema, i fear, by me watching a horrible copy, that it shall ruin the movie for me, but ill go see it at the movies anyways.

Cheers for taking the risk to film this though."
,Ojib,2011-10-09T15:03Z,"Actually very good,especially for only being out for 2 days now at the theaters."

,StonerCritic420,2011-10-31T10:47Z,"So when I saw the Preview for this movie I thought it was gonna be wack, Ran outta movies to watch so I Downloaded it. ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I have seen in a long time, I probably watch 15-20 movies a week. yaya i know i got no life. 

as far as the copy, 
V: 5/10, So dark probably 15 minutes of the film you have no Idea what your looking at.
A: 6/10, Not to bad you can hear everything that is said and the timing is on most of the movie.

Movie itself: 9.5/10, Dont know what it was but this movie was pretty damn GOOD."
