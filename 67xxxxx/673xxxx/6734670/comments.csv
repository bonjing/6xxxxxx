Instruction:
install office run activator then click ez-activator wait till done and if your AV detect the kms as trojan allow it just to finish the activation then after that you can delet the kms file in your drive c or rescan drive c and allow it your AV to delet the file. dnt worry it will keep your office activated. the office 2010 is 32bit dnt try yet in 64bit."
