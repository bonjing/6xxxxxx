One more chance for a prize, but will it be enough to tip the scales at auction?
The end is approaching fast....

Go Fibro!"

,DngnRdr,2011-10-10T00:29Z,"Only one more episode... airs Wednesday night (Aust time)... just to make us all wait a bit longer :-(

I think the shop has a good chance to win but I hope it doesn't!"
,XaltedSmoke,2011-10-10T01:49Z,"I hear you DngnRdr, I like the shop.  Unfortunately August has turned out to be a complete smarmy DICK.

I don't know a lot about the demographics of the areas of the houses.  If I knew a bit more about the areas I would feel more comfortable.  

It just seems like the Fibro was a steal, and with the added space it will push their profit percentage higher and higher.

If there happens to be a season 2 guys I'll make sure that they are posted.  Only time will tell..."
