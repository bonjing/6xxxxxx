They attempted about to crack good Programs well.

When their work was done, they modified the original Program a little bit and drew little pictures, music and scrolling text in the start of the Programs to make aware of, who had cracked the Program.

â€œPROUDLY TO PRESENTSâ€ or similar because their employment was a â€œHONORâ€ and their work was a real â€œMASTERPICEâ€. â€œPROUDLY TO PRESENTSâ€

And today, all it's over because the modern Cracker have no professional ethics anymore.
They are arrogant, cracking badly, integrating viruses and they are a shame for the ex-Cracker Guild.

They have bad purposes and are influenced by evil intentions. They sell themselves for poor interests and have no professional pride.

â€œThey feel like Kings and they are just Assholesâ€

Like a Cracker from the first generation, i am ashamed of myself for my modern colleagues.

Look for this tragedy, NERO MULTIMEDIA SUITE 10 (19.6.11300 or newer), more then one year out and no one is able to deliver a good cracked version.
