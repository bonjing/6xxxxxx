SUMMARY

Rachel is a lawyer. When she was in law school she fell
for another student, Dex, who comes from an affluent
family, but she was too shy to say anything. When Dex
meets her best friend Darcy, who sometimes treats her
like dirt, Darcy makes a move on Dex and gets him.
Eventually, they get engaged and Darcy asks Rachel to be
her Maid of Honor. However, Rachel still has feelings
for Dex and still can\\\\\\\'t say anything. Darcy throws her a
birthday party and Dex is there. When she and Dex are
alone she blurts out that she had a thing for him in
college which surprised him, and after drinking a little
they spend the night together. They try to forget the
whole thing and agree that it means nothing. Ethan,
Rachel\\\\\\\'s close friend, tells her that she\\\\\\\'ll spend her
entire life regretting that if she does nothing.
