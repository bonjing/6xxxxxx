Walking On Thin Ice,  is a single disc compilation of 19 highlights.This album reveals Ono's many compelling musical sides. From the undeniable groove of the 1980 hit Walking On Thin Ice, to the tender lilt of Nobody Sees Me Like You Do, to the all-out rock and camp of Midsummer New York, this disc shows an artist with the ability to cross many stylistic lines with ease and finesse. Hell in Paradise, could set any dance floor jumping, while Death Of Samantha, is a cool, almost jazz-inflected tune illustrating with brilliant dark humor the spiritual death of a young woman. And the title track may be her musical peak, a fierce rocker featuring ahead-of-its-time grunge guitar by John Lennon. Tackling a wide range of subjects with equal amounts of insight, wit, honesty, and, above all, a knack for melody and rhythm, Ono shines through as a musician of formidable vision. (amazon.com)
