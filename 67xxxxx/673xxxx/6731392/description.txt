Review: Scott Yanow (AMG)
This matchup between pianist Oscar Peterson, bassist Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen, and drummer Louis Hayes directly precedes Peterson's recordings for Pablo. The pianist is in typically brilliant form on the LP, performing six standards (including "Soft Winds" and "On the Trail") along with his own "Wheatland." It is not too surprising that Peterson would want to record frequently with Pedersen in future years.
