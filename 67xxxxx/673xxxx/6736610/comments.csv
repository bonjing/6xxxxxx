[T],metalcore.,2011-10-11T17:41Z,"both are fucking scumbags. 

jobs isnt as bad as gates- clearly. but jobs is also noone to look up to. 

largest shareholder of disney.

his entire existence was lived vindictively, his sole purpose in life to outdo gates (both pathetic and sad).

corporate scumbag- fucking employees, terrible environmental rights record.

copyright and patent WHORE.

the only value jobs has was a mass marketing manipulator...hocking stupid ""gadgets"" to a class of fucking idiots with no principles and money to waste.

sorry steve, i will not be crying over your death...in fact, one might argue you are better off dead! you can only hope gates is next to go."
[T],metalcore.,2011-10-11T17:42Z,"i shit on his legacy, and your applause for it. moron."
,sarsapil,2011-10-11T18:04Z,"Sorry guys, I admire them both although Gates s my choice, I never went for apple shit, windows was perfect for me, I still use Win98, since XP, Vista and the rest were conceived for morons and retards who couldn't use 98 properly. Gates made a lot of money but then donated billions for charity, can't be so bad after all and he and his people gave us a whole world of technology."
,ptv83,2011-10-11T18:34Z,"STEVE ""Conman Thief Narcassist"" JOBS

After being fired from apple steve was rehired, he instantly CANCELLED apple's charities to NEVER reopen them, Steve NEVER gave ANY of his personal money to charity, he only pocketed the apple charity money as his salary grew and grew... all while he patented the crap out of everything and sued anyone.. EVENTHOUGH the iPOD is a DIRECT RIPOFF of the Braun T3 Pocket Radio .. infact most of apple's product line incorperates or directly copies MANY of Braun's past products.

How much money has Bill Gates given away to charity, above and beyond what's merly needed to give a ""tax break"" . 

OSX doen't work with crap all in other branded products all through my home. I've got windows 7 streaming media to every room in my house with NO overpriced piece of crap iDevice needed, the windows platform works with almost everything.  Apple & Flash .. what a joke .. Quicktime in windows.. what a joke.. anyone notice how fast programs quit needing quicktime to be installed once itunes becam a manditory part of the install ?

Steve jobs was ""better than everyone"" he didn't need to concider what apple did, because it could do no wrong, they would take anything they wanted from other companies and sue anyone that became competitive, modify 'evidence' so that the judge doesn't laugh at them and try and trick/buy appeal after appeal to look legit in the media.

they profited from social issue nonstop while giving nothing.

all the while some douchbag hipster-doofus' bought into his cultist zealot programme.

Apple genius' .. gimme a break
Mac Pro that's outdated and wont do 10bit colour .. gimme a break PRO my ass... forget the price that would give u a triple spec PC that does do actual professional 10bit colour display.
constantly releasing lackluster iphones with tacticly missing fuctions/features to make you want to buy the next one even though if you bough the HTC or samsung you'd nly have to buy one phone for every 3 iphones with a cheaper price and more pleasurable/user friendly/more functional experience... 

Bill gates vs Steve Jobs... what a dumb ass question.... 

Ask micheal Dell who's the better man... he'll tell you Gates all day long.... ask Clinton who's the better man.. Gates all day long.. ask the consumer.. Apples pisspoor pathetic 1% of the market... the public says Gates all day long too... 

Jobs you should have died 20years ago and done the world a favour..... "
,aa221,2011-10-11T22:17Z,"For those of you that are too young to remember, Gates worked for IBM writing what he later stole and modified to become Dos.  Both of these guys tried to keep everything out of the public domain and both stole from the (other) rich to sell to the poor... Very common for the most successful"
[T],metalcore.,2011-10-12T01:02Z,"im glad you guys feel me. 

gates is much worse...giving his money ""away"" to a foundation he starts, controls and operates. his goals to feed the world and rid it of diseases like polio.

 he wants to feed the world using GMO's ""donating"" the money to monsanto and dupont and other corporations who seek to enslave the worlds agricultural sector and own and control the genetics of everything you eat. disguts me

as for riding the world of dieases, he does this by ""donating"" the rest of his money to international pharmaceutical corporations, an industry that recently passed the oil industry in its level of corruption. these corps go to asshole countries and subject the poor populations to experimental drugs...because their lives are cheap in their eyes. not to mention,  keep in mind the most likely way AIDS came into existence. 

bill gates is one of, if not THE, most dangerous men in the world. 

someone needs to assassinate him and his cunt wife too."
[T],metalcore.,2011-10-12T01:05Z,"and like ptv83 said, he probably made money by giving it to his own organization on tax breaks, still giving him control...im willing to bet if you look into it that the foundation will receive benefits from the technologies they help fund. at the very least they will siphon money back into the organization which will funnel back to them in a cycle allowing them to use the money but avoid paying taxes on it....speculation, but we'll see ;)"
,Hobbes73,2011-10-15T18:57Z,metalcore:  so what have you done to even be considered?
,supastick,2011-10-22T20:20Z,"The only one who sounds vindictive is you, metalcore (both pathetic and sad). Your life must be a miserable hell."
