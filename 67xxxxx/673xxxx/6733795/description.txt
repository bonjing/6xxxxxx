  Mel Giedroyc, Sue Perkins and the contestants have reached the Grand  
  Final. After seven gruelling weeks the three finalists face their     
  biggest challenge yet - baking for The Great British Bake Off's       
  street party.                                                         
                                                                        
  Inside the Bake Off tent new levels of stress are reached and the     
  pressure hits boiling point as they must bake not only for judges     
  Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood, but also friends, family and former    
  Bake Off contestants. None of them have baked on this scale before.   
                                                                        
  In order to be crowned the victor, they need to bring together their  
  skills, making a selection of petits fours and - for the first time   
  ever in the Bake Off - puff pastry.                                   
                                                                        
  Among their offerings are mille-feuille, mini Victoria sponges,       
  strawberry and cream meringue nests and miniature strawberry and      
  rhubarb cheesecakes.                                                  
                                                                        
  Only one can be crowned Britain's Best Amateur Baker and take home    
  the Bake Off trophy.
