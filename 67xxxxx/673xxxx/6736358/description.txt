Awakening later to find the streets of the city eerily empty, Laura crosses paths with a rambling
drifter named Neil who gives a terrifying account of the horrors that have just unfolded. Though
it quickly becomes apparent to Laura that Neil is psychologically disturbed, he quickly ushers her
to the safety of a nearby warehouse, where many others have gathered to avoid the alien space
probes and zombie hordes. In time, the group discerns that the extraterrestrials have been using
nanotechnology to enslave the human race, and that the only ones who remain unaffected are
the mentally imbalanced. As the voices in Lauraâ€™s head grow increasingly difficult to ignore, she
and the rest of the survivors make one last, desperate attempt to destroy the device being used
to control mankind, and send the aliens back into the stars.
