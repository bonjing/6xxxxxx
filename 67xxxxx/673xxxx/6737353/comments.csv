If you ever get the time, or if you've already done it, a Mafia II with all DLC's and patches would be great.

Thanks for all your work."
,brutal_product,2011-10-12T04:04Z,tyvm!
,warwind74,2011-10-12T06:28Z,can you do one for the xbox 360
,kcwPB,2011-10-12T07:14Z,Is this version of Mark of The Assassin in English or is it French like the other version?
,booger2000,2011-10-12T10:34Z,"If I already have everything except MOA and item packs 2, can I still install this torrent? Cause I'd like to get the item pack 2 stuff.
Thanks so much, I really enjoyed Legacy and don't want to give bioware more of my money."
,illiria,2011-10-12T12:34Z,"@ kcwPB

Why would it be in French? Am I speaking French? Did I mention French? o_O I believe this DLC comes in all the languages game was released in. English, French, Russian, etc. DLC will be using the language your game is in.

I played in English, so of course it's in English.

@ booger2000

Yes, even if you already have everything, you can simply install this torrent on top of it."
,DL_Dragon,2011-10-12T12:49Z,"Your amazing. Thank you, illiria. "

,illiria,2011-10-12T20:32Z,"@ Thompson93

No bonus ring here. Only the ""Assassin"" itself."
,Thompson93,2011-10-12T21:07Z,"Any idea how to retrieve it ?


* I have legal copy of dragon age 2  no offence but its ridiculous to pay the ""exta  content"" 
thanks to you we have everything for free. 
I read in official dragon age 2 site 

:To retrieve the free bonus ring you must complete mark of the assassin and earn one of the  achievements:

So please keep a eye on it :P"

You really fast :"">"
,illiria,2011-10-13T03:02Z,"@ gaza99

Don't worry, you can play it right after you get to Kirkwall. It's only ~15 minutes into the game."
,shadow180818,2011-10-13T06:10Z,is this like the full game with the dlc pack or do  i need to download it seprate?
,Kamianbu,2011-10-13T06:20Z,Does this have the 1.03 patch like in your other repack?
,gaza99,2011-10-13T09:58Z,Thanks alot @illiria. thanks again
,illiria,2011-10-13T11:30Z,"@ shadow180818

This is only the DLCs and the patch 1.03. You need to download the game separately.

@ Kamianbu

Yes, you game will be auto-patched to version 1.03 and crack will be applied during installation."
,druid513,2011-10-13T14:32Z,"anyone can complete Mark of Assassin? My duke boss jumped to high ground, and never came down. My arrow and spells wouldn't harm him."
,illiria,2011-10-13T15:44Z,"@ druid513

Yes, I've completed the DLC without a single problem. People, please stop posting the same questions in both of my torrents. I check them both and reply."
,Kamianbu,2011-10-13T19:27Z,"@Illiria

Thank you.

,jacksond2nd,2011-10-14T02:29Z,"illiria..thanks bud, very nice..one prob though, haveing same issue as druid513..when duke goes up afer gettin wooped on for a min, there's a red circle on ground where (guessing) Leopold is suppose to be in..well he isn't and can't do any damage to either while they are up on the ruins...please HELP, advise..sumthin...thanka"
,Die51,2011-10-14T05:54Z,"Another illiria release. Life is good.

Seeding to 2000% as per standard. 

Thanks and thanks for all the fish.

(Also; If you are still taking request. The latest Hitman + All Patches and such would be nice.)"
,illiria,2011-10-14T06:45Z,"@ Die51

Can't afford taking requiests. Too much to do, too little time. I'm doing several projects at the same time (not just repacks).

By ""latest Hitman"" you refer to Hitman: Blood Money, or upcoming Hitman: Absolution? Blood Money release is pretty straight-forward, I doubt there is a need for a repack. ""Absolution"", however, yes, I believe I'll work on it. If it will come out as some STEAM edition, without normal installer."
,Robertini10,2011-10-14T12:28Z,"@druid513 & jacksond2nd ... Lure Leopold closer to the cliff. It's on opposite side of the ruins where the Duke and Leopold are .... 

and btw. @illiria Thank you very much for another great release!"

,Gnoam,2011-10-15T13:46Z,"I love you so much Illiria, everything I have ever downloaded from you is absolutely perfect."
,illiria,2011-10-15T18:22Z,"@ Thompson93

Sorry for the delay. Already checked your torrent (commented), checked the item (works great), and already am recompiling the DLC Pack with the item. Great work you've done, thank you very much. Will make sure to credit you in the release. :)"
,redshurtugal08,2011-10-16T05:28Z,"This isn't working for me, and I'm not sure why. I'm using Windows 7, and after the installation is completed, nothing new happens. At all. The game doesn't patch to 1.03 either."
,Nynanne89,2011-10-16T20:41Z,"Seems invisible to me... Tis in the files, everything alright but no actual ""Memento of Mark of the Assassin"" involved. Pls help."
,stephon_,2011-10-18T00:09Z,nice one... thanks a lot !
