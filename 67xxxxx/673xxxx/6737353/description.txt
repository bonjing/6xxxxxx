************************************************************************************

This is my new version of a complete DLC repack. It includes ALL the DLCs ever released, from pre-order items to "Mark of the Assassin".

************************************************************************************

THE INSTALLER WILL AUTOMATICALLY PATCH YOUR GAME TO VERSION 1.03 AND COPY THE CRACK. ALL DLCS ARE PRE-CRACKED. INSTALLER AUTOMATICALLY DETECTS YOUR GAME FOLDER.

You only need to press "Install".

The usual warning: some anti-viruses may detect all and every my installers as viruses. This is a false positive. I have no idea why it happens, nor do I care.


Also, Windows Vista/7 may take a couple of minutes to launch this repack, because Vista/7 pre-load large EXEcutable files BEFORE they launch them.


You can share this torrent wherever you want. The more, the better.
