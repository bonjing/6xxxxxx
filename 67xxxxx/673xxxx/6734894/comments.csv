,fridal8,2011-10-11T18:27Z,what about episode 2!!??
,RedTy,2011-10-14T04:07Z,Any chance someone could upload a .avi or .mp4 version? Takes a long time to convert and ps3's don't play .mkv

VLC will play it but not transcode to a normal video format. Please stop using MKV, yes it looks nice, but so does H.264 with the quality setting full on.
Thanks."
