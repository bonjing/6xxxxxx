,ihavenoblackfriends,2011-10-10T10:59Z,Does this torrent include 'non-English parts only' subtitles?  I think every other season has had spanish language dialogue in (at least) a few episodes.

,lattari,2012-02-12T12:27Z,Thank you Konashine for providing these highres versions
,TheBlackWhirlwind,2012-04-06T11:31Z,"This is a very good rip considering the modest file size. The video quality isn't quite up to some of the BD rips of previous seasons, but this is still the best torrent around of this, and is in HD. Thank you!"
