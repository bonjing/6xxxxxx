,pharaohrocks,2011-10-13T07:58Z,"Awesome thanks. But there's 2 tracks on here that conflict with what's on Amazon.com. I'm kind of confused. And the last track, Birth To An Angel being one of them is questionable as it is just the instrumental version of ""Shivers"" that came out in 2005 on ""ASOT 2005"" CD 1, Track 9. Anyway, thank you again. "
