Blues guitarist Johnny Copeland (Mar 27, 1937 â€“ Jul 3, 1997) was an American blues singer and guitarist from Haynesville, Louisiana.

In his early years he played with such acts as Sonny Boy Williamson, Big Mama Thornton, and Freddie King, but his early records met with little commercial success.
