For those of you following the latest updates to multiMAN, by developer deank, a couple
of new releases have been made since version 02.09.00 was unleashed. Version 02.09.01
brought us 3.41 CFW/MFW (not for dongle + 3.41 OFW) support for PSX backups, while
version 02.09.02 brings more support for PSX backups.
