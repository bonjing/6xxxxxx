Everything works 100 % sound / movies / game.
Thought somone who downloaded might have poped a message to say yes this works, oh well."
,ToboldH,2011-10-12T10:42Z,"I downloaded this one and have sound on the intro clip only. No sound in game. The sound files are there, I verified that, they just don't play."

And for those of you having sound problems itÂ´s an easy fix just go to the game folder and locate the redist/DirectX folder and run DXSETUP it fixed my sound problem in-game:)
Hope this helps"

@alerik  thanks for that tip"
,XKadosx,2011-10-19T13:30Z,"Hi marco699!

Could you perhaps give some step by step installation tips? Thanx, I'm new to this...

I don't know what you mean about a 7.15 gig file- I downloaded a torrent that was 1.7 gig, which must be the compressed file you mentioned, but if that's so- how do I get the crack to work? Which file do I copy the CRACK- FLT file into? 

Any help would be appreciated,
Thanx"
,trivett89,2011-10-19T20:12Z,"@alerik
thx, works (i've reinstalled game, chipset and sound driver several times ;])

@marco699
big thx for upload

@XKadosx
* UNRAR A Game of Thrones - Genesis to where ever you want, once Unrar is done you are safe to delete the rar folder

* Copy all the content from Game of Thrones Genesis CRACK-FLT to the 7.15 gig folder, clcik Agot

Play, enjoy"
