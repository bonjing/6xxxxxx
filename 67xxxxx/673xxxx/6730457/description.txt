    A documentary that follows the evolution of the 'Halloween' movies       
    over the past twenty-five years. It examines why the films are so        
    popular and revisits many of the original locations used in the films    
    - seeing the effects on the local community. For the first time,         
    cast, crew, critics and fans join together in the ultimate               
    'Halloween' retrospective.
