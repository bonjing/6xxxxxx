Beskrivning pÃ¥ Svenska

Marcello Mastroianni, Anouk Aimee and Anita Ekberg star in Fellini's masterpiece about a thrill seeking journalist in Rome at its most desirably decadent. The Vatican tried to ban it, the left championed it, and the public adored it. Today the film has lost none of its style and popularity. It is considered the finest film of its era: visually stunning, highly intelligent and superbly entertaining.
