,kulhwan,2011-10-13T09:29Z,"I think this patch's got some small problem such as incorrect kits and Camp Nou stadium error. 

If u have problem for loading Camp Nou, Delete unnamed_2942.bin and unnamed_2943.bin in Kitserver folder (kitserver\pesedit\img-dt07.img) and don't forget to run manager.exe to Detach -> Attach work. 

Hopefully they will release the fix file soon"
