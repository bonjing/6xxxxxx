[T],thetorrentlord,2011-10-12T16:07Z,992x720? Is this a new resolution?
,totoroo,2011-10-13T00:10Z,^ it's in 4:3 aspect ratio.
,flynndownunder,2011-10-17T14:31Z,"The bluRay cover looks pretty nice I have to admit, and plenty of you have downloaded this (going by the seeds) and still no comments re: quality. Do what I did and download only the SAMPLE and then make up your mind. It's also in 2.35:1 widescreen just for the record!"
,_AssMan_,2011-10-19T20:02Z,Resolution is 1280x544 and quality is exceptional
,JMit,2011-10-23T07:30Z,"Aspect ratio is way off, see the screenshots. I had to adjust manually."
