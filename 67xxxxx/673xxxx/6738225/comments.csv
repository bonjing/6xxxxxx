,iOSXPC,2011-11-19T03:01Z,"Just to let everyone before I actually paid for the SlySoft Package deal, I too used to download the cracked versions...  Any Slysoft products that are cracked by either SnD or Resurrection are always choice...  The other hacker/cracker teams try hard but mostly are unsuccessful..."
,Wilkins_Micawber,2011-11-21T19:00Z,"Works great! Thanks Slicki

You have to follow common-sense steps for this update to work

1. Exit Anydvd if it's running 
2. Disconnect internet
3. Run new key FIRST
4. Install new version Anydvd
5. MOST IMPORTANT!!!: Uncheck ""automatically check for new Anydvd version"" in program settings 
6. Connect internet
"
,Wilkins_Micawber,2011-11-22T03:16Z,"One more step: 

7. Restart computer BEFORE connecting to the internet, THEN make sure updates box is unchecked and connect to the internet"
