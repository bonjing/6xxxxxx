A-Train is Train Simulator Game which was a cult classic in the early 90's and was originally released for DOS, Mac, and Amiga (among other systems).  In this game, the player builds a rail system to move resources from one location to other locations on the map, to allow building of the city in those areas.  On top of just the train system, the player also designs the city and runs aspects of the businesses/sotck markets/real estate in the city, combining the Train Sim and the City Sim games into one action packed, fun filled, simulation.  Note that this game also greatly resembles Sim City 2000 and is rumored to be the engine that was used for that title.
