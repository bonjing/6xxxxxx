I just saw your link in the other torrent comments, started downloading immediately. 

I was about to go to sleep too, so i saved loads of hours of downloading time (if it's needed). 

And of course, even if they don't do it for our benefit, a big thanks to SKIDROW, no matter what their motives are. "

,riplikethat,2011-10-12T15:44Z,"Minor visual upgrades. At least the fuckers didn't make it all cartoony this time.

I hope this has a better story and characters this time around. 90hr game with nothing but same combat over and over isn't fun unless you are a brain-dead retard.

But then again, it's not like I am paying for this shit so bwahahahaha.."

,bglamb,2011-10-12T16:16Z,"@.dude - Regarding people not uploading: Whilst I am happy to steal a game, and am grateful that you are helping me steal it, that doesn't mean that I want to help other people steal it.

I want as much money as possible to end up in Ubisoft's pockets. I just don't want it to be my money. You can call that selfish, but anyone here who thinks they are doing the world a favor by stealing is kidding themselves, IMO."
[V],.Dude.,2011-10-12T16:25Z,"Am quoting this post from Bitgamer.

froggy:solved. at work at least.

i did again what i said above.

but, when i installed the game, i put another folder name ).

like until now i installed everytime in d:\games\h6 (chinese+p2p)
now, i fresh installed in d:\games\hmm6, with the above steps.

started fine. i did not start launcher first, i did not touch files in appdata.





remove (delete uninstall) all might and magic 6 you have on comp.
uninstall ubi launcher.
delete ubilauncher folder in prog files.

check registri in local machine, software, folder ubisoft, delete might and magic entry.

mount iso.
install.
copy file from skid to game dir.
play.

you need to run like admin ONLY if you install in default program file directory.

use other non windows partition. like a pro ."

,mang87,2011-10-12T18:43Z,"Guys the crack works fine if you install it to a seperate location besides the default directory which is c:\programfiles(x86)\ubisoft\

Just install it to a different location, for example a seperate drive. I installed mine to my D:\ drive and it runs fine. I think when it's in the ubisoft folder it tries to run the official ubisoft launcher instead of the cracked one."
,Danorum,2011-10-12T20:55Z,"Unfortunately I can't get this to work. My game launches, but just keeps loading on the black screnn. When I switch to the desktop the launcher icon is still there.

,wowme,2011-10-13T00:29Z,"Don't install the game in the programms x86 folder, just somewhere in C:, then you won't need to delete any file.

,cgmcnama,2011-10-20T02:39Z,"First off, THANK YOU for uploading this and responding to comments. 

 While I have never had a problem with SKIDROW before, this seems to have me beat.  I am running Win 7 64-bit and did the clean uninstall, even checking the registry.  Installed in C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\My Games\hmm6, copied over the crack and then added the /offline to the shortcut. (w/o this the app crashes).  I get a black screen but nothing happens.  It may be something funky with my PC but I'm stumped.  

I'll keep seeding to help you out, it seems several people have been able to get this to work."

,Asthuran,2012-05-08T23:25Z,"This torrent gave me a bit of trouble, but I managed to get it up and running smoothly. Here are the steps I took.

1) Download torrent

2) Unzip it into one big ISO file

3) Mount the ISO file with Daemon Tools

4) Install the game

5) Open ""My Computer"", right click ""Might & Magic Heroes VI"" and select ""open"", open the SKIDROW folder and copy/paste the 4 files inside of it into your ""C:/Program Files/Ubisoft/Might & Magic Heroes VI"" folder, copy and replace all files when it asks.

6) Right click ""Might & Magic Heroes VI"" after copy and replacing it into the folder, select ""Create Shortcut""

7) Right click the shortcut, select properties, and add ""/offline"" to the end of the target (with a space before the last letter and /offline).

8) Open the game up using the newly created shortcut, and it should work.

This was done using Windows 7 64 bit."
