,Kerrence,2011-10-14T01:36Z,"I dled this torrent. It was not in a zip file form & there was no (zip) crack file. It only worked as a ""trial"" offer & would not convert any files."
,Kerrence,2011-10-14T03:07Z,"I re-visited this application & while there wasn't a Crack file per se, there was a file called AVSVideoConverter which I copied into the program files. It's now working like a charm.
A bit confusing but thank you.  "
,nooby284,2011-10-14T05:42Z,"Works fine followed instructions
Thank you"
,Huntzberger,2011-10-14T17:16Z,"Thanks uploader. 
I notice AVS still haven't updated this program so that you can input and output AVCHD M2TS. You can input, but only output to a different (lower resolution) format. Dumb!"
,relim1,2011-10-16T10:39Z,when converting files to dvd does this version have 5.1 audio output or just 2 channels like previous versions? a great program but the audio thing is an issue for me. thanks  :) 
,danilo86,2011-10-24T16:56Z,"Thanks man, works fine."

,buntline,2011-10-28T18:05Z,"Doesn't work,still get unactivated version."
,ericv1984,2011-10-29T07:11Z,"@scene4all... Works good, thanks for the upload. But, you need to update the instructions since there is no crack folder and it is not in a zip file."
,ericv1984,2011-10-29T07:13Z,"@buntline

After installing the program, copy the AVSVideoConverter file and then paste it into your Program Files.

Just basically follow the instructions in comment number 2."

,merlejr,2011-11-01T22:34Z,THERE IS NO CRACK IN THIS DOWNLOAD. SETUP ONLY
,thoppi,2011-11-03T15:35Z,"I copied the AVSVideoConverter file into the Program Files. Since it is a 64 bit OS, I copied the file into Program Files(x86) as well as Program Files. Still, when I try to convert it, I get the message its not activated.If I go ahead and continue, it states that since it is not activated a Watermark would be placed in the center of the screen.PLEASE HELP!!!!!"
,Arachne,2011-11-09T08:30Z,Simple and wonderful.  Thank you!  
,Arachne,2011-11-09T08:35Z,"@thoppi, when you copy the AVSV Converter file into the program files, remove the other files that give you the ""not activated"" message.  Play around with it and keep you Recycle Bin clean in the event you want to restore.  It isn't really a problem once you determine which file(s) are the ones giving off that message.  The best of luck."
,fofo2568,2011-11-13T20:46Z,"Like Kerrence,i run the setup installation and when finished,i copied the file name ""avsvideoconverter"" in the program file,so replace the old ""avsvideoconverter"" and it works perfectly...Thanks scene4all!!!"
,88ender88,2011-11-14T16:07Z,"works like a charm.
install setup, but don't open program.
browse computer program files AVS4YOU AVSVideoConverter and replace the AVSVideoConverter file with one included.
(f4cg is just instructions you can openwith notepad)
thank you!"
,88ender88,2011-11-15T22:25Z,"wooops...
nevermind only lasted 1 day for me :/ grrr"
,jowjowjow,2011-12-04T10:22Z,"Some of you guys need to use brain from time to time. There is a pre-cracked exe file in it which you have to overwrite.

Simple, ain't it?"
,TheRealDavegurn,2011-12-09T13:52Z,"Thanks alot worked great first time.

As usual copy the AVSVideoConverter.exe that comes with this file to the install directory.

you have to completely replace the original AVSVideoConverter.exe with the one that comes with this download.

As an extra precaution i block all the .exe files including AVSVideoConverter.exe in the install directory from accessing the internet using my firewall.

if you do this i guarantee it will stay activated."
,Rod321,2011-12-13T03:26Z,"Hello Uploader.
Many thanks for your effort, I don't mean to offend but facts are facts.

This is not a complete file i.e. the cracked file is only 4700 kb (not sure but somewhere around there) & the original file is 17572 kb so it cannot be a complete file can it.

I downloaded it 3 times thinking something went wrong with the downloads & then went to KICKASS & had a win. The torrent below gives a cracked file of 17572 kb in case anyone wants to try it.
[kat.ph]avs.video.converter.8.1.1.509.multilingual.incl.crack 

Thank you again uploader, without guys like you putting many many hours we would not be able to share.

"
,Triple-J,2011-12-31T16:12Z,"Great torrent.

,mrandev,2012-01-15T23:14Z,"The best video converter i have used so far, gives u the quality u need and the custom profiles give u support for almost any handheld and other devices, Thanks Scene4all keep the freebies coming !!"
,thomashaughton,2012-01-16T21:28Z,works fine !
,soljakid1995,2012-01-16T23:26Z,"to all those that are having trouble with the fact that the files are not in .zip form

go to the downloaded torrent and copy AVSVideoConverter 
then go to your program files (should be on your hard disk section on 'my computer')
and look for a file called 'AVS4YOU' and paste the copied file into that file

this should fix your problems"
,TranceJunky78,2012-01-17T05:26Z,"1) download this program and Install IT. dont run it yet. 2) FIND THE PROGRAM FILE LOCATION..( Computer> C> Program files (program files 86{64 bit users only use this step})> AVS4YOU> AVS video coverter ...NOW...leave this folder OPEN.. and NOW 2) open the containing folder of the torrent here you downloaded... and SIMPLY SWAP the Application file entitled ""AVSVideoConverter"" in both the 2 windows that you have JUST opened. thats it. swap the files (application type) ultimately deleting the original AVS converter application file that was in the program files of your hard drive, 'C' with the one thats on the containing folder in your ""AVS.Video.Converter.v8.1.1.509.Cracked-F4CG"" file"
,TranceJunky78,2012-01-17T05:33Z,it works golden people. it took me hours to figure it out im just above beginner status and i explained it for a computer wise retarded person (like me) above
,Sonicbacon,2012-01-22T03:52Z,"Great torrent as always Scene4all, many thanks."
,eekle43,2012-01-30T11:43Z,Great Torrent. Thanks. If you follow the instructions and replace into program folder. ALL works perfectly. Love your work
,SIMON-UK,2012-02-04T10:57Z,crack worked fine people are thick on here....i even download original copy from web site and then used crack with it .. and still worked.. cheers.... !!!!! 
,craigbrian,2012-02-04T11:43Z,"
THANK YOU very much. Version 8.0 was giving me error and problems 


this worked first time.
Thank yo for the upload

and people ignore the readme file you have to replace ""AVSVideoCoverter.exe"" with the cracked one, and place it in the ""C:\Program Files (x86)\AVS4YOU\AVSVideoConverter""


IMPORTANT!!!!!!!! to ANYBODY who is getting the error ""AVSVideoCoverter.exe has stopped working preferably or ANY other error that involves crashing for Windows 7.



click the Windows logo button in the VERY bottom left, right click computer and select ""Properties"" a window should pop up click ""Advance system settings"" now another window should pop up under ""Performance"" click ""Settings"" once again another windows should pop up select the tab named ""Data Execution Prevention"" click Add and ONE more window will pop up. go to were AVS Video Converter is installed for example ""C:\Program Files (x86)\AVS4YOU\AVSVideoConverter""

now SELECT AVSVideoConverter.exe and click open click apply then Ok 

NOTE!!!!!!!! this also works with other programs that CRASH such as if you have ""Flash Decompiler Trillix"" and it wont open ADD it to the list then try running it.

NOW try AVS Video Converter  :) have fun

I have a Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit"

,arg76,2012-02-11T20:29Z,"To anyone having trouble with this...
After dling the files click on the ""Setup"" icon to install the converter. Chose not to Launch the converter.  Go back to the files from this torrent and grab ""AVSVideoConverter.exe"" Put it in the avsconverter folder under Program files. You're just replacing the existing one."
