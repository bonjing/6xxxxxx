,joaquimario,2012-02-04T18:56Z,Is this really from BluRay? Does not seem so. It seems more a DVD upscale. Sorry if I'm wrong.
,calvados01436,2012-05-24T06:52Z,are you kidding me!!!?? How have I not seen this movie. Just got done with it and wow! One of the greatest stories I think I have heard. I love movies that open up your mind and this was definitely one of the greats. As everyone else has said A MUST SEE MOVIE!
