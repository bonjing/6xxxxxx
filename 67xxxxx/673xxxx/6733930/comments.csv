First off thanks for all your releases loved each one of them.

I'm having issues opening this file in WMP, popup comes up saying ""Windows Media has encountered a problem opening this file""

All my other videos from you open fine??"

,Eirik_FS,2011-10-11T00:23Z,Anyone think there will be more Breaking Bad? I think this maybe be the end.
,ziondave,2011-10-11T00:33Z,@Josex13 It's an MKV file so you'll need to download VLC media player.  It's a really good player so well worth the download.
,ziondave,2011-10-11T00:34Z,@Eirik_FS  I think there's 2 more half seasons planned with 7 episodes or so each.
,broblaster,2011-10-11T00:43Z,@str8pirate you are a cunt retard. I wish i knew where you lived so i could beat your ugly head in
,broblaster,2011-10-11T00:47Z,"@str8pirate 
This is not a discussion forum you f_cking inbred faggot. I cant even believe you wrote that"
,broblaster,2011-10-11T00:50Z,@str8pirate TPB just removed my previous comments because of how much profanity i was using to describe how mentally challenged you are. Along the lines of inbred and ugly.. use your imagination. I can only imagine how stupid you must be to treat this like some discussion forum and post something like that. 
,drakelong,2011-10-11T00:51Z,str8pirate. you are a piece of crap. I have never log in here and had to make an account just to tell you i hope your penis falls off. You are the best example of a troll i have ever seen.  I really hope your computer fry's in a fire ball for posting that. Thanks for the upload.
,baretoof,2011-10-11T00:53Z,"@josex13: use vlc player.. wmp is crap :)

and btw I dont release anything, just sharing a torrent. "
,baretoof,2011-10-11T00:55Z,@Eirik_FS: there will be more. accourding to IMDB
[T],cdesade,2011-10-11T02:08Z,"If you read past ""I love the ending how..."" then really, blame yourself. And don't feed the trolls!"
,Josex13,2011-10-11T03:22Z,"Thanks guys,

Works fine with CCCP player, just sucks all the other web-dl videos open fine in WMP.

Oh well."
,AlfNader,2011-10-11T04:00Z,"LOL, I had a feeling some shithead in the comments would spoil it so I downloaded it blind. Paranoia paid off..."
,AlfNader,2011-10-11T04:01Z,"Oh, great quality too. Thanks iTunes and TeddyBlue. :)

A:10
V:10"
,AlfNader,2011-10-11T04:08Z,There are 16 episodes planned for the 5th and final season although the show's creator and head writer made this episode as if it were the series finale in case contract negotiations for season 5 failed.
,broblaster,2011-10-11T06:10Z,those with reading skills past that of a five year old find it difficult to absorb only one word at a time like that
,broblaster,2011-10-11T06:15Z,and your uploads are f_cking stupid.
,str8upgay,2011-10-11T06:24Z,"If it makes you guys feel any better, STR8PIRATE's favorite movie seems to be a TS of Yogi Bear. Definitely a bottom.

,Whane,2011-10-11T07:26Z,"The ending did not dissapoint, I think we all got what we wanted and if the 5th season falls through as is common, for once I can say I'm happy with the finale. And of the 5th season does happen, sadly I think we all know what that means. But I'm sure it will be a hell of a ride."
,str8pirate,2011-10-11T13:08Z,"wow wtf is this all about? 4 all you motherfuckers who were talkin shit bout my comment eat a dick.. if you were a true breaking bad fan like myself you would of watched the freakin episode live on television on amc at 10pm. they aired it back to back for the fuckin noobs who were jerkin off to precious the movie!!!! now all this talk is cheap computer warriors or as where i have been in my life we refer to you bitches as ""cell warriors"" now go and poke ur ole lady in the ass and stop crying bout what comment i made bout this last episode got it!!!!!!!!!!! "
,OKtoaster,2011-10-11T17:56Z,"Say what you want, str8pirate, whatever excuses you make, you are a lowlife, and there is no escaping that truth whatever you write here.

Everybody who reads your comment knows that you must have a poor and sad life, to take pleasure in ruining the episode for who knows how many other. Again, write what you want here, everyone still knows you have a sad life...."
,broblaster,2011-10-11T18:41Z,HAHA str8pirate u got really excited about yogi bear cause u suck dick. Great find btw str8upgay that really explains a lot. You gotta take a lot of dick to think its ok to post a spoiler like that. you saw it air on tv and that makes you think people downloading it wouldn't mind seeing the ending posted where they download it from? Are you a retarded person?
,cuntmug,2011-10-15T21:49Z,Thanks very much!
,im_cobbis,2011-10-18T02:46Z,@broblaster. stop your nonsense!!
