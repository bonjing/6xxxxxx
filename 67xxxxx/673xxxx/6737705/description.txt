    This episode focuses on the Jurassic period, a time        
    when the first giant killers stalked the Earth and        
    lurked in the seas; a time when the slightest advantage  
    meant the difference between life and death.              
                                                               
    In North America the iconic allosaurus, an ambush         
    hunter with a lethal bite, dominated. Not even the       
    heavily-armoured stegosaurus was safe from this killer,   
    and incredible evidence reveals a glimpse of a vicious     
    battle between these two giants.                          
                                                             
    Life in Jurassic oceans was no easier; in 2008, a         
    fossil was dug out of a frozen island high in the          
    Arctic. It was a colossal marine reptile, twice as big    
    as most ocean predators, at 15 metres long and weighing  
    about 45 tonnes. This was Predator X. Its skull alone     
    was nearly twice the size of a tyrannosaurus rex's, and    
    its bite force unmatched by anything in the Jurassic      
    seas.                                                    
                                                              
    The balance of power between predator and prey is a        
    fine one, as prey continually evolve different ways to    
    avoid predators. But for the most successful and         
    enduring predators, the battle to survive has always      
    been tipped in their favour.
