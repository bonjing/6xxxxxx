It is widely agreed that there is a true need to transform care and support services. This book explores, for the first time, what person-centered support means, what barriers stand in the way, and how these can be overcome. The book offers both theoretical insights and practical guidance, and highlights the importance of a participatory approach. It is based on the largest independent UK study of person-centered support and is written by an experienced team that includes service users, practitioners, and researchers. Supporting People demonstrates how change can be made now, and what strategic changes are needed for person-centered support to have a sustainable future.
