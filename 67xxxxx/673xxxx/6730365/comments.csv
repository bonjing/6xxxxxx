,gurgsnekr,2011-10-18T18:26Z,"download went fine, no problems there.  game stopped as I tried to exit the sewers.  Unknown conflict that windows 7 could not resolve.  suggestions?"
,xXxJoEyxXx,2011-10-18T19:00Z,Have you tried downloading the latest patch?
,xXxJoEyxXx,2011-10-18T19:01Z,"Because I didnt patch it at first but when I left the sewers all the grass textures where mixed up with the map textures, so the grass had the imperial city printed on it."
,gurgsnekr,2011-10-18T21:48Z,"@ JoEy
Thanks for that suggestion.  Tried it with patch v 1.2.0416 from besthsoft.com same error/problem.  Even rebooted then restarted the game instead of continuing.  No success...bummer.  It could be my system, I'm running on a netbook.  "
,xXxJoEyxXx,2011-10-19T21:02Z,"@gurgsnekr
Yeah that might be why. Im running on a Windows Vista Laptop, it's not very good for gaming but runs very fast with Oblivion."

I installed the game, followed the readme.
When i try to run ""Oblivion"" from my desktop it pops up with the run screen fine. I click play and it derps and gets an error report. I've tried many times, but it doesn't wont to work for me.
I'm about to install the latest patch, but if it doesn't work, is there anything else wrong with it you can think of?
Thanks, Harvey"

@xXxJoEyxXx

If you are asked to reinsert the disc, then you're current game has not been saved and you will have to restart from the beginning each time. Thats what happened to me and I'm not sure how to fix it. Have any ideas?"
,HANS3N1337,2011-11-15T13:54Z,hi ive got a problem with install i have mounted it with poweriso and deamon tools but the installer crashes at D:\...\Data\Oblivion - Meshes.bsa and the error is F:\data2.cab please help me want to play this 
,imsomguy,2011-11-22T05:01Z,after i downloaded i used powerISO to mount a virtual drive to play so that may help some of you all. my question now is why cant i use the construction set? i downloaded it and used it correctly (ive worked wih it for years with morrowind) but nothing has displayed in-game that i changed. and yes i checked the box for plugin files
,Xayanort,2011-11-25T22:34Z,"Well i downloaded the game fully and when i go to play it brings up an error, anyway to help?"
,jschu316,2011-12-01T18:21Z,"I've downloaded and installed it. I still can't play it because it says ""insert disc"". I've mounted it using multiple drives. I can't get it to work."
,Niclroy,2012-01-01T19:38Z,I'm sort of a newbie with computers and I need to know what sort of programs I'm gonna need in order to get this game to work. Any suggestions?
,jerseykid,2012-01-06T21:52Z,"So game works great, but now I'm trying to get the expansion to work. Where do I paste the DLC after I copy?"
