,Xanthium1,2011-10-09T09:27Z,"Thanks sirpaul... whoever you are

And RUDOS.

You're always the first, always.

Always faithful... and not even at which point it no longer becomes possible (god forbid)... will you be forgotten.

You'll always be remembered for what you've done.

Let's just hope that that point never comes.  

There's people who benefit from your work that feed the soul of the world with their every action following the enlightenment which follows the information which is passed on by every one of your releases.

You make a difference... no matter what the opinion from those in the profitable, oppositional position which demand a profit from this created visual/audial work.

You are higher than them.

As are we all...

As are we all.

As we will always be.

United we stand and divided....

Well... we all know the result."
,Samika17,2011-10-09T10:50Z,seed plz! after you download the torrent dont stop it keep uploading!plllllssss
,fasteddie_felson,2011-10-09T11:44Z,"The scene is dying if people get their's but don't keep seeding. DL speed sucks if people hit and run. The idea people, is getting something for free, it doesn't hurt you to seed for a 1:1 ratio.

Seed please. Even after you get yours. Thank-you. And thank-you scene4all for the upload."

Found your problem. Get a HTPC, newb."
,truth-speaks,2011-10-09T13:29Z,"Why is it that I started downloading about 6 hours ago and with about 30 seeders available at the time and now the seeder quantity on Vuze is 56? What's stranger is that on here it says there are 1592 seeders. 

Can anyone explain this?

And thanks to the uploader. "

,wolf_ink,2011-10-09T15:34Z,"i apologise brod, read comments wrong way around ... kornypony, you need to grow up "
,Lustrum0005,2011-10-09T16:21Z,"instead of complaining every month about the lack of seeders in the first 48 hours, or how slow the torrent downloads in the first 48 hours, why not just take it as a given, and discuss the quality of the torrent instead. Last event Sir Paul up load had audio glitches.. any glitches this time around? "
,Wall-ay,2011-10-09T16:24Z,SEED Please this is taking forever 9/4787 seeds online.
,timbo1999,2011-10-09T17:13Z,sir paul the video on your uploads will not play on the ps3 or the xbox..... the audio will if you run it through windows media player but no video. please start changing the codec on your video files so that we can watch it on ps3 and the xbox. if you cant thats fine but it wiuld be a grat help. thanks you as always for the great uploades though!!!!!!!
,timbo1999,2011-10-09T17:17Z,you fucking idiods why would you ever say who wins on the comments knowing that everyone hasnt seen it yet EKAPAN YOU A A STUPID FUCKING FAGET SON OF A BITCH I HOPE YOU DIE AND CHOKE ON YOUR OWN SHIT!!!!!!!!!!
,ekapan,2011-10-09T17:47Z,"Chill the fuck out timbo,. i didn't tell you all the winners.. btw aldo wins over florian, cheal wins over  stan and guillard taps"
,yofa42,2011-10-09T17:57Z,+1 for timbo
,Koskankorva,2011-10-09T18:04Z,the audio is fucked up ..
,Lustrum0005,2011-10-09T18:40Z,"@Koskankorva Thank you for confirming.. UFC 135 upload by Sir Paul had glitches in the audio track. I had to re-download the last event because I like listening to the commentaries during the fights and the glitches in the audio were very distracting to me. 

Good thing I am downloading a different torrent and hopefully there are no glitches in it."
,necro-noxxx,2011-10-09T20:46Z,sound works well..u nubs should use vlc media player and quit whining about shit u know shit about.
,Erich505,2011-10-09T21:51Z,"Barely coasting and I've got super high speed. Can't wait, hurrrry!"
,fasteddie_felson,2011-10-09T22:13Z,"@ekapan

What a jerk man. Nice to see the fights without knowing who won. You really are being a jerk. Regardless you're a UFC fan, so peace out.

Video:8
Audio: 8 
Nice upload, thank-you again scene."
,birdboy,2011-10-09T22:42Z,"FUCK ALL you who get pissed on knowing who already won before downloading, its all over Yahoo.  Your dumb cheap ass should've purchased the pay per view. GRAY WON you whining BITCH!"
,Lustrum0005,2011-10-10T01:11Z,"@necro-noxxx dumb ass .. put on head phones or buy better speakers, if you pay close attention there are faint glitches riddled all over the god damn up load. 

Sir Paul's last UFC up load had the same problem and I got a different upload and there were no glitches in it... so it's not the player. Trust me, I'm not a noob but not that it matters if I am or not because any person would notice the audio has glitches. 
"
,Lustrum0005,2011-10-10T01:17Z,"@necro-noxxx  However you are correct, play it using VLC media players and there are no glitches, but if you run it using DivX the glitches magically disappear.  SO !! ... I take the dumb ass comment back.. good thing I have multiple players to run files in. "
,Jack0ff,2011-10-10T01:47Z,@birdboy - gray won? just because maynard fucks your butthole it doesnt change the results :)

,haitai,2011-10-10T03:58Z,"A sound glitch would be fine with me.

,Viriatus2,2011-10-10T11:35Z,"ffs who cares if it doesn't play in the PS3?? The PS3 is for gaming and not to watch the UFC....
