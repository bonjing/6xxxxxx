,heynow32,2011-11-07T01:02Z,"Thanks bunches. Quick question, after I have downloaded the books and opened them with my kindle is it safe to delete them from my files so I don't run out of space on my computer? One more question, how do I transfer them from my kindle for mac, to my kindle on android, if that possible? "
