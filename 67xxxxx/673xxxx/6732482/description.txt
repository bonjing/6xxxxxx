          The Black Eyed Peas + Will.I.Am Discography (iTunes Edition)





The Black Eyed Peas transcended hip-hop to become one of the most commercially successful pop groups of the 2000s. Their career began modestly, with a pair of albums inspired by the positive-minded likes of A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul. After adding Fergie, the groupâ€™s pop instincts reached full flight. Ignited by the Top Ten hit â€œWhere Is the Love?â€ and the Grammy-winning party anthem â€œLetâ€™s Get It Started,â€ the group scored three multi-platinum albums in 2003â€™s Elephunk, 2005â€™s Monkey Business, and 2009â€™s The E.N.D. (Energy Never Dies). While still connected to hip-hop, the groupâ€™s sound turned toward dance-pop â€” a savvy move that transformed them from a cult act to a mainstream phenomenon.

The group's earliest connections go back to the early â€˜90s, when high schoolers will.i.am (William James Adams, Jr.) and apl.de.ap (Allan Pineda Lindo, Jr.) were part of Tribal Nation, a breakdancing crew. Eventually the pair focused more on music and split off on their own as Atban Klann, their esoteric name an acronym for A Tribe Beyond a Nation. Eazy-E's Ruthless Records signed the group in 1992, but many in the Ruthless camp were puzzled by the group and the enthusiasm of Eazy, who had no problem reconciling his own gangsta style with the affable, peace-minded spirit of Atban. Although an album was recorded, Ruthless shelved it, unsure how to market a group whose style wasn't dependent on violent braggadocio like that of N.W.A.
