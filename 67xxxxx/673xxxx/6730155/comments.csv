,nflfan,2011-10-08T21:25Z,"I would guess you're in the minority 72Suited, but if you DO insist on wanting to watch the games in a poorer quality format, rather than phatwarez cater just for you, I suggest you use, say, the free Any Video Converter and you can convert to whatever format you like in the poorest quality you like.
