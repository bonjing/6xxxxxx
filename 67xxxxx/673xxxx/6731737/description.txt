Number One Hits of the 50s +xtras 5CD 320k (musicfromrizzo)

Ive substituted a 320k in here where possible and have used a remastered
track or two. Ive also snuck in a Frank Sinatra rare ancient treat
("Road to Mandalay" - Live in Australia although it may be anachronistic
perhaps - btw this version is remastered). That said, its all great beautiful
music otherwise, from the 50s including the number 1 Hits from the full five
CD set of these. The great added bonus tracks are all essentials for this 
line-up equally I subnit!

Enjoy old fashioned memories once more - its a better way to live!
