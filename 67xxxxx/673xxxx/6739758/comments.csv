,Luxifer,2011-10-25T14:55Z,"You fucking wanker, you do know DVDR is DVD rips, NOT bad cams converted to DVD format ... right? OR ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY BRAIN DEAD?!
ALL your releases sucks a donkey's ass ...  "
,hyperspeed04,2011-10-27T19:26Z,"Brain Dead? DVDR does NOT stand for DVD Rip, it meand its READY TO BURN TO DVD without conversion.. its a FORMAT.. The TITLE says TS(which means TeleSync aka cam rip with audio from direct line).. can you effing READ??
Some people do not wanna download the 800meg version and convert to dvd format. The uploader has done the work.. you dont like it download the source file and watch on your divx player.
Know what you are talking about before the complaining"
,j-killer,2011-10-28T05:09Z,soo is the quality good or not ?
,Timrulez,2011-10-28T21:12Z,You don't deserve that skull
,aztk.ajn,2011-10-29T19:11Z,"don't download it, its 4.3 gb for a cam rip? no way this guy keeps uploading camrip as ts2dvd and that is why this is in the top 100 dvdr but damn it its only a 4.3gb cam rip"
,commace,2011-10-30T17:18Z,"Beste NLUPPER002,

Waarom blijven jullie toch CAM & Telesync versies uploaden in de DVDR rubriek?? Waarom zou iemand een CAM of Telesync versie op een DVD formaat willen hebben??? Tegenwoordig hebben de meeste DVD speler een AVI afspeel mogelijkheid of heeft men thuis een multimedia speler, wat is dan in hemelsnaam het nut om een een CAM of Telesync versie om te zetten naat DVD. Het is heel erg frustreerend om de DVDR rubriek door te bladeren en dan telkens die TS2DVD versies tegen te komen...

Zouden jullie deze torrents aub is de juiste categorie willen zetten??

@hyperspeed04 -> Can you please enlighten the rest of the world, were it says that DVDR stand for 'READY TO BURN TO DVD'...."

,DieHardNinja,2011-11-07T06:54Z,"Look, I understand some people may believe I don't have a right to post any comments because I haven't uploaded yet.  Relax; I'm getting there!  I'm new to this and am doing my best to understand how things work.  (Everyone has been a beginner before)
That being said, it appears that NLUPPER002 has uploaded quite a bit of popular content content.  That doesn't mean that the quality is that superb and I greatly appreciate those who comment on the A(udio) & V(isual).  I'm a big fan of not wasting my time.
My question is how to report/complain/notify piratebay.org of people who consistently mislead other members by uploading to the wrong category.  It seems at some point we should be able to say, ""That's it!  I'm pulling your green skull icon!""
On a side note, I think it'd be really awesome if piratebay.org would simply have separate sections for various languages.  There have been a number of times that I've been totally psyched to find something only to discover that there are subtitles in a different language than my native English.   I'd rather not feel like I want to reach through cyberspace and backhand someone for uploading a movie that was filmed in English but has German subtitles.  Germans, Spanish, French, Russians, Japanese, etc.  if we all had our own subsections, it would cut down on the frustration level for many people.  Like I said, I'm just making an observation.  Thank you all!
One final note, just because I use complete sentences, proper grammar, use common sense, and THINK as well as proofread what I've written BEFORE hitting ""Submit"" doesn't mean that I'm a girl, gay, or a nerd.  I don't fit a stereotype, thank you kindly!"
,GeekyGamer01,2011-11-09T09:01Z,Were all fucking capable of making a TS into DVD format. Movies DVDR is spammed with your torrents. TPB should make a TS2DVD category. But you probably still wouldnt post them there cause your so retarded.
,sassystar420,2011-11-10T19:00Z,"hi i am new to the bay and would like to know if n e one can tell me what file type i would need to play on regular dvd players or my portable dvd player, n e ones help would be greatly appreciated thank you"
,GeekyGamer01,2011-11-14T01:56Z,"Sassystar420 i recommend using ConvertXtoDVD (get it from the bay), you just DL the movie u want and u should get the hang of convert x its quite simple, then just burn onto blank DVD and play"
,2TheMan,2011-11-16T17:33Z,Now what is this real steel or Dragon Crusaders
,kwakdeuze,2011-11-17T16:50Z,TS crap for noobs
,DarkWolfDK,2011-11-21T08:27Z,"Am i the only one who notice that this is not worth the download???
CMON guys!!!
It says TS and Xvid??? Why is it in DVDR section at all???
It will never be a DVDrip when its recorded in a theater!
It does not become a DVDrip because you make it burnable as a DVD!"
,omgwtfnoob,2011-11-22T08:15Z,"someone please correct me if i am wrong, but does 'DVDRip' not mean a video (avi/mp4) file that has been 'ripped' from a DVD? and not how @hyperspeed04 or @NLUPPER002 is describing 'DVDRip' as being a CAM that is converted into a DVD format?"
,praneeldude,2011-11-22T09:09Z,only 40 seeder are seedin! you motherf****r

,pluss1000,2011-11-29T20:36Z,"Hi.
I understand that there will always bee bad quality in the beginning but shourly 100 of the same bad quality. Is that nesesary? Why do you have to copy others shit quality and uppload again just to get accepted as a upploader?
Is there no one with good quality then dont uppload! There is enough of the same shit now! IÂ´m not an upploader BUT IÂ´m a very generous seeder.
Have a nice day."
