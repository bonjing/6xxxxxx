,KebertX,2011-10-11T03:56Z,"I take issue with punk333 saying some people don't know how to seed a torrent. What is there to do? Just leave it there for the peers. Fucking seriously...?
Also, thank you seeders. This was done in 16 minutes flat. Quality is excellent."
,captain_frag,2011-10-11T05:25Z,"I dunno, i actually mostly agree with  punk333.There is alot of bitching and complaining on here about torrents when this shit is all free so who's to complain??? Not to mention the fact that most of those complaints are from retards since the same torrents they complain are not being seeded are downloading very quickly on my end so who's the fucking idiot really??? Anyways punk333 to seed just leave the torrent online for others to download til you've at least uploaded what you've downloaded or x2 would be even nice.THanks for the great torrent btw EZ :)"
,angelroseblog,2011-10-11T05:46Z,Punk just leave it in your downloader... it will auto seed
,punk333,2011-10-11T07:11Z,"@captain_frag & @angelroseblog - thank you! @kerbertX - I didn't mean to come off as dumb, but it really is confusing to a lot of people what with the SE and LE numbers being so off, I saw an BBC article claim a movie was the number one download and they were looking at the SE number.. it seems like they should be looking up the LE number instead? Anyway..now that I know.. seeding forever"

,gmc14,2011-10-26T08:10Z,"==========================

                        WARNING

==========================

Thanks to this torrent, I received a Copyright Violation warning from my ISP.

@RanY2jith: 
A. relax
B. think: CBS issues a warning to the ISP (based on your IP). Your ISP inspects their logs to see that your account was using that IP at the time. Your account likely has an email associated with it. That's how you would receive an email."
,arcane211,2011-10-26T08:54Z,"@RanY2jith it's true I don't know whats going on with eztv. I think they actually work for the studios. No joke I got busted for downloading Generation Kill from them awhile ago, and lots of comments saying the same thing.. It makes you wonder how they get such good quality so fast."
,tommarvoloriddle2010,2011-11-09T12:34Z,"Thnx eztv!!
thnx 4 all d hrd wrk.
I love eztv uploads!!
