,Mesohappy,2011-12-06T03:49Z,"Again Thx for all of these races. Yes it is sad about Senna. I have never seen a race all the way through of ones he raced in. I hope to enjoy the first 2 races. As with a lot of broadcast`s after a death they do pay tributes to these racers. These too are part of racing. That is history good or bad.
Thank you again"
