The More than Complete DC-Now More Completerer!

This fortieth alphabetical installment is: DC from Sham-Spd

What's This?
     It's a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.
       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those "Pre-DC" comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some "Post DC" comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c.875-885gb in total. It will take as long as it takes. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.

=================================

I have decided on the makeup the rest of the torrents - small changes are possible. I plan on 15 more. Most are 13-18gb. The Superman torrent will be around 35-38gb. The big Batman one was popular so I'll do the same with Superman.

I feel like I've been a bit remiss in searching out extra Non-DC stuff for you all for some of the lessor DC comics, but this series is already so big. (That's when she laughed)
But Sherlock Holmes in the original Arthur Conan Doyle works is a long time favorite of mine, so I made sure to get some extra SH in here even though DC only did the one issue.  I have also found a some of the later stories by new authors in books, radio and film, in addition to some of the adaptations of Doyle, that I thought were pretty good. The latest theatrical film (2009) is good as a film but it's not Sherlock Holmes IMAO (a is for arrogant-know it-all,  They should just have called it something else and removed the obvious Holmes tie-ins. But the tie-ins probably seemed a money maker. Of course in the opposite spirit  they really should have called  "Real Steel"  -  the new robot boxing movie,  "Rock'm-Sock'm Robots" with the line "You knocked my block off" prominently  placed somewhere. Back to SH movies -despite all the changes they did to the 30s and 40s Basil Rathbone films those were more true to the spirit of SH than the 2009 film, as are the latest BBC TV shows putting Holmes in the present. I, and I gather a lot of people, consider the older BBC series which starred Jeremy Brett to be the best film adaptations ever, largely because we think he is the best Holmes ever.

So here's more Sherlock than you can throw a persian slipper at. Light up some shag tobacco in your pipe and read them.
If you don't Like Sherlock, go away and stick a hypo of 7% cocaine in your arm. Much more genteel than snorting it, and doesn't wreck your nose. Perfectly legal in Holmes' day. Dr Watson will lecture about it however, and eventually get you off it. So wait till's he's out.

The next is a scanlation from the Dutch original. But only half is done so far. T02 is in Dutch.
Why include it at all if not in English?

1) You can't prove no Dutch speaker are downloading this series
2) You can look at the pretty pictures
3) If you know the story well you can tell what's going on anyway
4) Maybe this will inspire a Dutch speaker to translate & re-text this scan.
5) You wanna make something of it? Step outside the internet and I'll show you who's boss. (My wife is)

Secret Love - would that be the love that dare not speak it's name? (this was 1971 you know) Is that why it's in a sinister house? Or do they keep their love secret because they are in a sinister house? Is there a ghost maybe that hates to see a couple happy together? Maybe the guy wants her to keep it secret because she doesn't know he's actually married with 6 kids. The Bastard!

Superman actually met the Nestle's Quick rabbit which is even worse. What's next Teen Titans and the Trix cereal rabbit?
Martian Manhunter and the Jolly Green Giant with a Hulk crossover? Zatanna and Mr Clean? The mind boggles. Fortunately this sort of thing is rare.
