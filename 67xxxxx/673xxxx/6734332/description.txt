One of the more ambitious albums to come out of the disco era, "The Tea Dance" is essentially the score of a non-existent (to my knowledge) stage show, a mix of new tunes and some campy Hollywood classics (the introduction is from "King Kong," "Broadway Melody" was heard in "Singin' in the Rain"). La Rue's insistent beats, punchy arrangements and sometimes clever plays on words ("Indiscreet" or "In The Street" he asks in a song about the nature of hot gay romance in the pre-AIDS era) keep the set listenable throughout. "Don't Keep in the Shadows" is a duet with early 60s falsetto pop heartthrob Lou Christie. Apart from a few minor dance hits during the disco era, La Rue did not make it big, but in hindsight he looks like a pioneer in the field of openly gay music.
