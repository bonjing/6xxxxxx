,D4M3,2011-10-10T16:23Z,A bit late? :D
,rocco_sifredi,2011-10-10T16:46Z,so this edition has 5 more missions into the single campaign or I missunderstood ?
,rocco_sifredi,2011-10-10T17:00Z,I hope this is not a fake as the other kit here...If it is I'll be back for you dude...
,fabienwadja,2011-10-10T17:28Z,"YO ITS FAKE .PUT A VIRUS IN CPU , WHEN I WAS TRYIN TO INSTALL"
,Erocy,2011-10-10T17:29Z,thx .Dude.
,vineet120,2011-10-10T17:42Z,thnx for this dude !! downloading now ! 
,Wowtgp,2011-10-10T17:47Z,Minimum requirements pls.
,DR32MZ,2011-10-10T18:57Z,i read 'Video recoded to lower bitrate (HQ addon 1GB)' in the info.upload the addon if possible plz.i already have another repack but cut scenes were of really bad quality.
,DR32MZ,2011-10-10T19:01Z,@rocco_sifredi i think Gears of War for PC have 5 additional chapters than for Xbox 360 version.
,rocco_sifredi,2011-10-10T19:45Z,"there is something wrong with this kit... I installed the game (no viruses as that idiot claimed above...) but this is what is happening:
1.if I start the game with the  default installer icon , an windows jumps saying I must start the game with setup.exe !
2if I start the game wiht startup.exe the game loads but after modifying the video options I can't go back, the ESCAPE key doesn't work anymore...
3. I noticed there is a backup file with the same binaries folder files but all of them have an ALI167 added in them. I tried to replace the binaries folder with these ones but it wont; work as well.
So IDIOT, when you upload a game WRITE the instructions how to set it with IT !! Wouldn't that be fair enough ?
If anyone figured how to make te game start please let me know , but in DETAILS, alright ?"
,.l.l.l.l.,2011-10-10T20:02Z,wich one of gears of war is this 2 or 1??????????
,rocco_sifredi,2011-10-10T20:08Z,I remembered something else. The game warns me in the menu that it can't save if I don't have a Windows live account etc. Do I need windows live / Microsoft games market shit etc installed  to make it work? I don't remember this crap when I  played it long before...
[V],.Dude.,2011-10-10T20:08Z,"rocco_sifredi: Better dont download from my torrents from now onwards or il kick ur butt!
Cant u check the info,it written clearly."
,glynn5500,2011-10-10T21:46Z,cheers Dude it works 4 me ... thnx a lot m8 
,rocco_sifredi,2011-10-11T01:34Z,"In the info, moron, it doesn't say you have to be online to be able to play it with a offline account. In the info, also, idiot and stupid what you are, it doesn't say that the installer game's icon is broken and you can't use it etc.However I remembered that I gotta sign in to play it and I fix it to work. But still I don't get it what the fuck is with that backup folder. What is it for? Did those arabs forget to delete it ? 
Anyway thx for the upload but next time, when you just copy other people's work check if ALL the instructions are there, otherwise you'll be the joker whose ass will be kicked. Got it ?"
,dumas1000,2011-10-11T03:12Z,"Dude, you don't have to be online to save playing a Game for Windows Live game. You can either create a dummy offline profile or you can use an official Xbox Live account, play offline while signed onto that account, and the game will still save fine. You need no Internet connection at all. Most people already understand this fact. Just like a with 360. You don't have to be online to use your account."
,glynn5500,2011-10-11T09:07Z,"dumas1000... ur exactly rite m8 ... u av to av games for windows live set up b4 u can even play this , a lot ov games these days require u to av this installed then mek an offline account then ur away ... piss ov piss really if u ay a noob lol "
,DR32MZ,2011-10-11T13:23Z,@rocco_sifredi that must be the original execu. files in case u want to apply any patch in future.
,rocky7sb,2011-10-12T14:11Z,MANY THANKS DUDE.............WAITING FOR THIS A LONG TIME ..........FINALLY GOT IT.............+1
,topnana,2011-10-14T05:18Z,rocco_sifredi you really are one huge faggot sir.
,SnymanK,2011-10-14T09:27Z,sOMEBODY SEEDDDDDDDDDDS PLSSSSSSS
,dumas1000,2011-10-17T03:32Z,"I have confirmed this game does work and save without an internet connection, although achievements are impossible to obtain, but the achievement system for this game is junk anyway. You must use the startup.exe file in order to launch the game and not the desktop shortcut that the installer creates for you. The startup file can be a real bitch to get installed though, due to extreme false positive issues. My anti-virus program treats that particular file far more aggressively then most false positives. The best part is that this game launches without having to alter the date on your computer. Most versions you'll find of this game require you to change the date on your computer in order to play it. Not an issue here."

,sansyeux,2011-10-24T22:06Z,"@rocco_sifredi 

people like you should commit suicide ""Did those arabs forget to delete it ? ""

you must be one of those stupid racist americans who does nothing with his life but discriminate, go join the army, stick a rifle up your ass, then pull the trigger. 

if you think you can do better, upload your own rip and kiss your own ass and ask your mum to stick a fork on your neck.

in other words, you are a fucking n00b."

And to all those who say the game DOESN'T work ,etc  ; please shut the hell up and stop complaining because you have no idea what you're doing.

And LEAST OF ALL , do not criticize the person who uploaded the game!

He gave YOU a FREE TO PLAY game and you have the nerve to COMPLAIN about it??? WTF is wrong with you ppl??? 

Go out and buy it if you're so FUCKING unhappy!

But to those who are having an issue with the torrent do EXACTLY what rem9677 suggested.

Thanks again [.Dude.] and don't listen to ignorant assholes on here.MOST of us DO appreciate the fact you uploaded this awesome game and that you took YOUR time and effort to do so :) "
