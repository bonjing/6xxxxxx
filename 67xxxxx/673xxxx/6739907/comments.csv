,karaokeking123,2011-10-13T14:49Z,"there is a way to look for the links on the net.google the author,title of the book,and at the end type download.you will then get pages and pages of sites.with experiance you will know witch site to go on ,or pass on,(do not sighn up or pay for any of them,as it will prob; not be there anyway)You will find torrent sites or fileshareing links.with fileshareing links click onto free or slow d/l , you will have to wait apox; 30sec; before you can d/l.it will be in a zip folder (winrar) you will need winrar program to unzip.Do this also for music ,movies etc. good luck! i hope this helps."
