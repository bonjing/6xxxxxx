,grenole,2011-11-27T05:03Z,MPEG? Could you encode to MKV or XviD?
,flodburg,2011-12-01T04:56Z,"I encoded the file to the same format that I used to rip from my discs. I decided that I spent enough time splicing and re-editing that I didn't want to tie my computer up for re-encode. You're welcome to do it yourself, but at this point, I got it where I want it and don't want to compress it or change it."

,flodburg,2012-01-12T03:57Z,@egregius- thanks for the review. I appreciate it.
