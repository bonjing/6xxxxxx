From CD liner notes: "When Michael Hedges died in late 1997, he left behind this set of recordings as a sketch of the album he intended to call "Torched". Revealing a wholly formed musical vision in the process of being realized by its uniquely gifted writer, arranger, singer, player, producer, and recording/mix engineer.

Rather than try to guess where Michael was headed with these songs, we've chosen to present them here just as he left them; as works in progress. Taken as they are, they offer a rare glimpse at the inner journey of an extraordinarily gifted artist. If you hear rough edges, all the better. These are Michael's own hand-made recordings, unretouched."
