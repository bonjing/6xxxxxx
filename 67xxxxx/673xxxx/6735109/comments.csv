,FOURGiB,2011-10-11T06:48Z,"hey if its not too much of a hassle, can you please encode them as avi or mp4?  PS3 and BluRay player doesn't support mkv.  Thank you."
,G3TB3NT,2011-10-11T07:36Z,Awesome file as usual! Please do not go to avi.

,Evilution,2011-10-11T08:28Z,"FOURGiB; MKV is a superior filecontainer to AVI, transcode is yourself if you need another container.
You can stick more vid/audio-formats inside MKV, subtitles, chapters etc, that AVI and MP4 can´t.
That´s why MKV is popular. And I'm sure there are more reasons, but i don´t encode much lately so can´t think of any more right away. :)"
,MacWarez,2011-10-11T12:20Z,"@FOURGiB

You can easily stream to your PS3, check out PS3 Media Server or TVersity

As for MKV as a container I think it's overrated. MP4 coded with x264 is much more compatible. I found out my TV plays MP4/x264 complete with external subs via USB. Pretty neat."
,ccp041985,2011-10-11T12:22Z,eztv does a rip in avi as well as mkv. Thanks again.
,truthy,2011-10-11T13:38Z,"thx for sharing

to the mkv-container - if your brplayer doesn't support it (mine does) just remux to mp4.

mkvextract audio & video yamb to put it in the mp4 container - mkv2vob for ps3 is also an option"

,fakharzk,2011-10-16T18:36Z,This is episode 3!!!!! not 4!!!!!
,mostwanted187,2011-10-16T20:49Z,"cant be epsoide 4, that airs this monday, the first epsoide was part 1 and 2, so i think thats where the mix up is"
,Thor-csf,2011-10-25T00:01Z,"@fakharzk, mostwanted187
Episode one (Genesis part 1 & part 2) is actually considered two episodes, as it lasts 2 hours (including commercials). It's the way FOX does its series premieres for some time already (since 24 and Prison Break). So this episode ('What Remains') is indeed the fourth episode in the series."
,unRheal,2011-11-01T05:30Z,"as toneloc78 over on eztv's S01E05 720p said:
The problem seems to be that Fox and IMDB are labeling Genesis as episode 1, while Sky1 is separating it into part 1 and part 2.

So arguing about it won't help if yer both right, depending on what station you watch. Maybe people should start including the episode TITLE too? ;)"
,prince__vlad,2011-11-08T15:22Z,thx a lot!
,007rambo007,2011-12-13T15:55Z,cheers eztv :D
,McMerda,2011-12-16T05:47Z,"to everyone praising mkv: u r idiots. the first goddamn episode of this series and periodically it comes to a point where it restarts the movie. u dont get glitches like that with avi. 

and lets not forget the awesome subtitles. remember that show battlestar galactica? well because some asshole put it in mkv it had subtitles which u cudnt turn off. fuck your mkv, we watch these episodes on goddamn laptops. we dont need uber fucking surround sound. for those of u who have an ellaborate sound system, buy the damn dvd."
