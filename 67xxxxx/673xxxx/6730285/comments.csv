Didn't play that far yet, maybe someone who downloaded can share some light into this?"

It's full version but with it got some bugs. The 'graphic bug' can be avoided by turning off MSAA in the graphic details. As to the trap upgrades, they don't seem to work at all, at least for me they don't.

I will wait for a proper release."

@Angelo85
So sorry, it was not showing any torrents for this when i posted up mine, if I had seen yours i would not have uploaded."
,Whobuysgames,2011-10-09T06:02Z,"Thank you for the note on the Contrast. i was at 8x and experianced it. as for upgrades, go without for the time being, theyre not to incremental in the early game, save up skulls until a fix is released

going Low Quality made level 4 playable, im guessing its a Lighting issue with the higher qualities"
