After two veteran truckers give up and head home, Hugh Rowland and Lisa Kelly are forced to take on the Death Road without spotters. Lisa moves to the Southern Death Road, where she faces her biggest challenge so far--alone. The rookie team of Tim and Tino have to navigate treacherous cliffs as well as tight fits in town, where navigating around cars and buildings may prove as challenging as dodging landslides, all to get their load to a community in need.
