Jean Vigoâ€™s second film is partly a homage to French swimming champion Jean Taris (who appears in the film as himself) but mainly as an experiment into the possibilities of underwater film photography.

Despite its short runtime, Taris is beautifully filmed and provided a source of inspiration to future film makers, most notably Jean Cocteau.

The experience that Vigo himself gained whilst making this film enabled him to realise the famous underwater dream sequence in his subsequent film Lâ€™Atalante, one of the most captivating and extraordinary scenes in cinematographic history.
