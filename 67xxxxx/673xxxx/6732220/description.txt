Connie Evingson Stockholm Sweetnin' CD 320k (musicfromrizzo)

This gal does one of my most favourite "Besame Mucho" renditions
ever a it is genuinely with European vistue of an irish spirited
gal doing justice to the merits of the song.

Then again here's "The windmills of your mind" where she also comes
through nicely.

As for the rest of the CD, it has its moments, however the
best numbers for me are the ones i speak of above.

Enjoy, especially the great comrades in Sweden - one and all!
