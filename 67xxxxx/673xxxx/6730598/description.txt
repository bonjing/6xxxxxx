JungleFlasher 0.1.89(284)

========================================
Support for LT Plus 2.0
-Lite-on Slim 0272, 0225, 0401, 1071

Dummy from KeyDB
----------------------------------------
Extra step, for Phat Lite-ons if common post 13146 barcode
is detected, user has option to type in case barcode and
index key based on a pre update entry created with f/w that
contained the old barcode.

Benq and Sammy bad flash support
---------------------------------------
Added a work around to auto-intro. SlimIntro was putting
Benq and Sammy in a bad state, where as phat intro has no
effect on Slim. If bad state is detected, usually by status
0xD1, slimIntro is no longer sent.
