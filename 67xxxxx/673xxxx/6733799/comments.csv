traps including arrow walls, spike traps, spinning blades, and flaming

horde

11 Unique Enemies - Including ogres, flying hellbats, and of course, a
whole bunch of ugly orcs

Story-based Campaign - Fend off orcs across three acts to discover the
mysterious power behind their relentless assaults

,ggfrog12fails,2011-10-15T11:48Z,"hey i wanted to help the guys that couldnt work this cause i had the same problem for hours. For the engine error thing just search Orcs Must Die update Skidro on pirate bay and update! Also update drivers and directx

Second to install crack for the application error 000 something like that go to to the torrent folder which is the downloaded folder. (once torrent finishes)

 find and  install a clone drive i use virtual clone drive and then click on file that is it the downloaded folder then setup and install afterwards if VISTA go to program files 86 in my computer->Local C-> Program 86 find the folder robot entertainment go to orcs must die-> build->Release and leave that opened. Go to the clone drive thing (where you opened setup) and open skidrow folder copy all files then paste in the Release folder.

Then run the game. Hope this worked.. if more help just ask cause i didnt proof read."

,arturstalberg,2011-10-15T15:03Z,"Works fine. Funny, hectic and quite challenging game. 
Just extract the skidrow-file with power ISO, mount the game, install and copy the crack from the skidrow file in to the games 'build-folder'

Thanks SKIDROW! Always the best there is!
Can't wait for the pc release of Batman-gotham city!"

,Jericoice,2011-10-17T06:57Z,"For those getting a steam error after installing all you have to do is manually apply the crack on the iso file. 

Just open up the iso and copy-paste the crack from the skidrow files into the file location of the OrcsMustDie folder. 

Hope this helps. "

,largand,2011-10-25T01:54Z,"hey for those people who encounter the problem ""failed to initialize the engine"", before you try reinstalling,updating directx,etc. 
try searching for the game folder first, look for ""OrcsMustDie.exe"" file inside Build folder.
run that exe instead of opening the shortcut in the desktop.
worked for me. hehe"

,piotrekd,2011-11-12T09:31Z,"I found solution for this problem! First you install this iso in DEFAULT folder, then download this fix: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6745779/Orcs.Must.Die.Fix-SKIDROW_[ALEX] and unpack it in game folder, then install the fix. You will propably need to run it as an administrator. After this you run the game .exe file as an administrator and it works :)"
,lmitric,2011-11-12T10:18Z,"But when I want to patch it, the patcher freezes :/"
,piotrekd,2011-11-13T07:19Z,"You need to put patch file in the main game folder. I mean sth like C:\Program Files\Robot Enterteinmet\Orcs Must Die!

DO NOT put it in subfolder /build or any else"

""lol my antivirus detected a virus in the crack
is this really legit???""

- Yes it is legit, norton also detected a false positive 
in my case so I put it on the safe list. The pink skull
next to the uploaders name is there for a reason, 
you don't become trusted by uploading viruses.

Anyhow, thanks uploader! Good shit as always."
