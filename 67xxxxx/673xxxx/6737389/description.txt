Not to be confused with the Peruvian TARKUS of the 1970s, this Brazilian group with the name TARKUS started in November 2000 as a Progressive Rock band in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The music is based on the traditions of the progressive bands of the '70s. The songs on their first album were performed in English but their latest songs are in Portuguese.
TARKUS is not an ELP tribute group, but the name was chosen in homage to the second ELP album.
