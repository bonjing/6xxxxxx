Excellent video... audio OK.
I've noticed lately, most of the uploaders working with mkv & mp4 in small file sizes have heavily reduced the bit rate of the audio, compared to former standards.
Before, we had an average video with a good audio.
Now we have an excellent video with an average audio (sometimes lousy).
I don't get it."
