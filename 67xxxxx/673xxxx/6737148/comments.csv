Your previous uploads of this have been deleted.

Also, why in the world would you put video resolution terms such as HD, 720 and 1080p in the torrent posting title of a torrent that contains nothing but MP3 music files????

Were you drunk when you uploaded this?"

720p and 1080p have better sound than 320p"
