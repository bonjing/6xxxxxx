[T],burgundyranger,2011-10-10T15:16Z,"As far as I know, it's never been left with 0 seeds. You can't go by the seeder count you see here on Pirate Bay. It doesn't ""see"" them all -- especially me.

I always seed as soon as I post the torrent, and don't stop seeding until others have downloaded the file and become seeders themselves."
