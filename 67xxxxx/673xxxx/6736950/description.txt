Released: July 14, 2009
Label :Sanctuary Records Fontana
Format:Mp3@320

This  3 Disc collection, devotes one disc to group material and one disc each that focuses on the solo material from Pentangleâ€™s two standout guitar players, John Renbourn and Bert Jansch.
Disc one begins with their debut single â€œTravelling Songâ€ and continues chronologically with their 1968 self-titled debut through 1972â€²s Solomonâ€™s Seal (the last album with the entire original lineup). While much of the attention is given to the interplay between guitarists Jansch and Renbourn, percussionist Terry Cox and bassist Danny Thompson make a formidable rhythm section. In addition, Jacqui McShee more than holds her own with contemporaries like Sandy Denny and Maddy Prior. Most of these songs are taken from their first three (and arguably their best) albums. Highlights include the 7-minute instrumental â€œPentangling,â€ â€œSweet Childâ€ and their remake of the Jaynettsâ€™ 1963 hit â€œSally Go â€˜Round the Roses.â€ Only the last five tracks are culled from their last three albums. Of special note is â€œLord Franklinâ€ from 1970â€²s Cruel  Sister which features Renbourn on guitar and Jansch on concertina.
Disc two contains solo material from John Renbourn before, during and after his collaboration with Pentangle. The disc begins with â€œJudy,â€ an instrumental from his 1965 self-titled debut, and concludes with another instrumental, â€œThe Hermit,â€ from his 1976 album of the same name. In addition to the folk material he is best known for, there are several tracks from Faro  Annie (â€œWhite House Blues,â€ â€œShake Shake Mamaâ€ and the title track) where he works in a blues vein. He also shows his jazz side on the Charles Mingus tune â€œGoodbye Pork Pie Hat,â€ a duet with Bert Jansch.
Disc three does the same for Bert Jansch. It covers material from his first eight albums, beginning with 1965â€²s self-titled debut and stops with 1973â€²s Moonshine (his first album for Reprise after leaving Transatlantic). Jansch is a gifted guitar player and songwriter and expressive singer. Standout tracks are the bleak â€œNeedle of Deathâ€ and the lovely â€œRosemary Lane.â€
