    I originally got the files from a random torrent which contained a ton of books, but only a few of them were actually dune like the torrent info said it was. It did not even have the full series which i had to get from other sources. Worse, all the files were just there, without any organization or detail on ordering them. Incensed, I created this torrent so i could enjoy the full series in order, without having to look through a ton of junk to get them. Here I have compiled the complete Dune (and only Dune) series for you to enjoy at the best of quality i could find.
    I hope you find reading these will be much easier because of my work. Also, I have one last thing you need to know. As dune is a sci-fi book, there is a lot of fanfiction, and other stuff such as short stories maybe even written by the original authors. I have only the full series here, and nothing more. If you want the other books, you will need to get them elsewhere.
    Feel free to comment and rate the torrent :)
