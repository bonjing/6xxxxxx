Three teams of North American truckers take on South Americas Andes Mountains, where theyre out to prove they have what it takes to haul any load over any road. Veterans and rookie drivers alike will have to battle thick Amazon jungles, landslides, and cliffside routes where any mistake can be fatal. Its only the first trip, but already the roads are forcing even the most seasoned veterans to second-guess their decision to challenge The Death Road.
