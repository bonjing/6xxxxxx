,Cleve66,2011-10-13T03:15Z,"Ok, I need some help. I've only ever seeded by leaving something in my D/L list after it was done. How can I just seed using UTorrent? 

Thanks! "
,FastTaco,2011-10-13T14:55Z,"I'm not exactly sure but you should be able to put the file in your downloads folder, then get the torrent in your torrent program and it should see that the file is already there and start seeding."
