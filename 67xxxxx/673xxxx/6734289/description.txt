In Egypt, at least two dozen people died on Sunday when the Egyptian military attacked a large gathering of Coptic Christians protests. The violence broke out after a demonstration protest in Cairo against an attack on a church in Aswan province last week. Democracy Now! correspondent Sharif Abdel Kouddous was in Cairo and witnessed the killings. "Then the military attacked. They came rushing forward, beating anyone in their path and then they started opening fire. The sound of gunfire filled the air," said Kouddous. "It was a scene of chaos, a scene of bloodshed, the likes of which I had not seen since the revolution here in Cairo. The reaction of the army does not bode well for the future."
