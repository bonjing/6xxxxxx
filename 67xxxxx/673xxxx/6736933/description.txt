Sade-Live Performances

This upload consists of videos I recorded off of cable TV using two Sony SLHF-900 Super Beta Hi-Fi VCR's
& two Mitsubishi U-70 S-VHS Hi-Fi VCR's.
I would tape the entire show (Saturday Night Live, Tonight Show, etc.) and then transfer the music
performances to the other VCR for archiving. Some performances may be 1st gen and not tape to tape.

Some of these videos I may have uploaded in the past and if so only the file name has changes to include
the song title. You can rename your exisitng file to match the one in this upload to provide a seed and
download any new material.


This upload Contains:

Sade-Is It A Crime, Saturday Night Live '85 M TV-SB-SV172-AVI-MPG

Sade-Why Can't We Live Together, Live Aid #1 7-13-85 ST TV-SV411-AVI-MPG

Sade-Your Love Is King, Live Aid #2 7-13-85 ST TV-SV411-AVI-MPG



The file naming convention is typically
1. Artist Name
2. Song Name
3. Show
4. Segment Number
5. Broadcast Date (Month, Day, Year)
6. Audio (ST=Stereo, M=Mono, SE=Simulated Stereo, by the TV station) All audio is Hi-Fi, no linear track audio involved
unless listed as ML=Mono Linear Track (very rarely).
7. Lineage (Typically-Cable Television (TV) to Super Beta (SB) to S-VHS (SV) to AVI to MPEG2)
Tape number after archived tape format.

The reason for the AVI to mpeg conversion was that The AVI files were uncompressed and with PCM audio and
varied between 900 megs to 1.5 gigs for a 4 minute song and a little large for file sharing and storing.
When I started transferring these I was a little leery of what I might notice as flaws in the mpeg
compression over time and chose to record to AVI first and convert to a more reasonable sized file by
using mpeg compression.
As it stands I think the mpeg conversion is very good for a TV signal and have no regrets.
The audio is superb since these were recorded with hi-fi audio and the majority are from
stereo broadcasts. The video is good as these were recorded on super beta II and Super VHS SP tape speeds
unless (ep) is followed by the SV tape format (extremely rare).
Everything else I've seen from this era on torrent sites is from linear track mono and standard VHS
unless re-broadcasted recently.

Details on the transfer:
Video played through a Datavideo TBC-1000 Time base corrector to AVI capture card using Muvee Autoproducer 5.0,
Converted to mpg in VEGAS PRO 8

AVI Specs
Container-DV Type 2 AVI, Multipart Open DML AVI (2 PARTS)
Codec-DVSD DVC/DV VIDEO
720X480 4:3 DVD Format
PCM Audio 16/48

MPEG2 File Characteristics:
All the MPEG files are in DVD format and ready to make a DVD if you wish. I have kept them as MPG so I can play the
videos randomly.

System Bitrate: 9921 kbs Variable Bit Rate
Audio: MPEG-1 Layer 2, 48khz 224-320kbps (depending on when tranferred) Stereo, Constant Bit Rate
Video: 720x480 4:3 6,000 kbps NTSC

I WILL SEED UNTIL THE TORRENT TAKES OFF AND THEN LEAVE SO I CAN UPLOAD OTHER SHOWS. DO TO THE LARGE NUMBERS
OF SHOWS I HAVE TO SHARE I WILL NOT PROVIDE A RESEED! SO PLEASE BE NICE AND STICK AROUND FOR THE NEXT PERSON BY
SEEDING, AFTER ALL THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TORRENTS WORK.

PLEASE CHECK MY PREVIOUS POSTS TO SEE IF YOU CAN PROVIDE A SEED
