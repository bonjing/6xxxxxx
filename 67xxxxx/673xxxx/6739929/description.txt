Winemaking from the vineyard to shipment of the bottled product is a series of challenges for winemaking staff. The introductory narrative of this book is designed to be an overview, from the wine microbiologistâ€™s point of view, of those critical junctures in the process (CCPs) that are of concern in wine quality as well as intervention/control programs to address them. The second edition of Wine Microbiology builds upon the foundation of its highly successful predecessor with emphasis on modern molecular methods. It has been revised and updated with recent data and conclusions in all chapters.
