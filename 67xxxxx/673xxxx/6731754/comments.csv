[T],thetorrentlord,2011-10-12T09:34Z,Just a tip for future uploads IMHO don't put multiple episodes in one rar file as most people including myself will not download such files. You can include all the episodes in one torrent by just putting them in a single folder and then making the torrent of the folder so they can be downloaded one at a time if one choses to do so. Most will want to check the quality b-4 downloading all episodes as one file.

Mr Pink skull thetorrentlord again sticks his 2 cents in not knowing of what he talks.

All my complete seasons are rar files done by the folder.

After lots of thought, I have decided that NCIS Season 6 is my last torrent upload.

the effort to return favors is not worth the agravation of dealing with irratating, self centered, ignorant, know it all types that know nothing.

,orinvee,2012-01-03T12:11Z,"They are just words on a page. How can the mere suggestions of a ""know-it-all type"" irritate and aggravate you to the point that you now plan on NOT upping any more? It's only ONE person's opinion. Still, if your skin is that thin, upping torrents will not be a rewarding experience. After all, opinions are like assholes and everyone has them...even assholes (which I'm not saying that he is)."
