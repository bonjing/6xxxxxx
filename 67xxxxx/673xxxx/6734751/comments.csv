,some-young-guy,2011-10-15T04:33Z,"Really?  

Halfway into the film, I get a text message on my tv while it muted the sound out stating that the file is copywritten etc etc.  WTF Sceneline, what kind BS is that?

I watched via a PS3 on a flat panel."
,some-young-guy,2011-10-15T04:47Z,Do not d/l this torrent.  It is a waste of your time
,some-young-guy,2011-10-15T05:51Z,"Apologies for previous posts.  Cinavia is a chip installed on PS3 motherboards that disables certain files... aka a false positive, so I gotta beat my fuckin head to jailbreak it.  Again, sorry Sceneline"

It's a little blurry, and the speech is a little off from when they actually say it. It's watchable. Fast download, took about 20-25 mins."

for the audio, it feels like some parts are out of sync by a little bit. "
