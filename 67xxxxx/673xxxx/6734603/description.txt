"Kurohagi" (é»’è©ï½žKUROHAGI)  March 18, 2011

Logan and Yukio finally make it to Dragon Palace, but meet resistance by the combined forces of the 
Yashida and Kurohagi families. Koh and his men arrive just after to assist Logan with reaching Hideki Kurohagi. 
Vadhaka returns, mercilessly beats Logan, and as he is about to deal the final blow is stop Kikyo. 
Kikyo states that he wants Logan alive for a rematch at full strength, and the two work to destroy Vadhaka. 
Vadhaka seemingly holds Kikyo and Logan in a stalemate with his incredible strength and shooting spear attacks. 
Koh's men begin to siege the palace as the fight rages outside. Logan realizes that to defeat Vadhaka, 
he takes one of the spears that were threw earlier, and with Kikyo's aid, impale the monster threw its mouth- 
as it was the only material stornger than his claws which could break Vadhaka's armor. 
Meanwhile, Hideki takes a noncompliant Mariko to marry him elsewhere when everyone is escaping the carnage 
of Koh's men assaulting the palace. As Logan makes it to Kurohagi, he holds Mariko hostage threatening to kill her. 
Hideki, secretly holding a dart gun with a poison developed by A.I.M. to kill Wolverine, takes aim and shoots at Logan. 
Kikyo intercepts this and survives the drug attacking his healing factor mutation-- given that the poison was meant for Logan, 
the effects were not deadly.
