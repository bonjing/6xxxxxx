 In the tradition of BATMAN: YEAR ONE, this book looks back at how the original Justice League of America formed and the trial and tribulations that it had to endure during its first year of existence. Having to deal with human issues of trust and attraction in super human situations, we watch as founding members, the Flash, Green Lantern, Black Canary, Martian Manhunter and Aquaman learn about both the pros and cons of working as a team. Joined by Batman and Superman in some of their earliest adventures, these tales set the foundation on which the greatest super-hero team of all time was built.
