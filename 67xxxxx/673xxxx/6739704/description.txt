AFTER JLA YEAR ONE HERE'S A LITTLE CLASSIC...ENJOY!

Kingdom Come is a four-issue Elseworlds story written by Mark Waid and Alex Ross, with artwork by Alex Ross. It is set in the year 2020 where Superman and his generation of heroes from the Justice League days have been succeeded by a new generation of heroes whose ideals are more nihilistic, caring less about the people they're supposed to protect and more about their own egos, and are found even clashing with each other as much as they do with the villains. It is when a major disaster happens when Superman decides to rein in the new generation of heroes in the hopes that they would reform and adopt his generation's ideals of what being a superhero is about.
