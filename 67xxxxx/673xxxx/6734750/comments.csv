,IAmGordonFreeman,2011-10-12T05:06Z,"Is the app updated like normal, I assume so because it the droid just searches for updates on installed applications, but do we need to get a new version everytime?"
,ToiletClown,2011-10-12T18:40Z,I doubt it's updated automatically. You will have to use the new .apk when it comes out.
