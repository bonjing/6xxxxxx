,___jay___,2011-11-02T16:07Z,can you crack/patch or create keygen of the new update 1.2.1? i badly need it because it crashes everytime I start career mode and I don't know how to get the car running.
,Xtactic,2011-12-10T01:40Z,"I downloaded this, it was a chore to setup to english, and the voices wasn't english either... but also i couldn't get the automatic transmission cars to drive... only manual works. 
i don't think this crack works on 1.2.1 because it's a patched .exe among other possibly changed .dll's.
i downloaded the version from the site, which i thought was a demo, but it isn't, however the installer was purely english. "
,PROGamer2011,2011-12-20T19:29Z,"I run it on Windows 7 all of you have to do is :
