,fireydude,2011-10-10T12:41Z,I thought that Microsoft Project was a stand-alone application. Does this torrent include Office and Project or is it just Office with some additional templates etc?

,juliantoby,2012-04-12T20:03Z,"Hi people, i installed the software and after a month or so a notification came up that told me to activate. I tried downloading the MS Office 2010 activator from this site but then it did not work and instead i have this notification that comes up everytime i open Project 2010 and a red bar at the top of the page that says 'Activation Failed'. How do i remedy this???"
