WORKDONE:

Well considering the video was already cropped by play to how the bottom subs...
i decided too crop it a few pixels more to remove the top of alot of subs where you could
still see the top of them.
Also the colouring was shot too  pieces so fixed all that and also the AR was off,not badly but needing
fixing .
Audio was decent cam but was very loud and needed some work,so drop it in AA used a hiss removal and changed
all the EQ setting and resave and then remuxed to my encode.
Got too say IF being honest the video is poor,few times the camera zooms in,alot of movement here and there etc..
So i'd say view this on your pc or a small tv ....otherwise it will look POO!!
