,TrustedQualityRatings,2011-10-13T21:28Z,"Downloading now!! 

Will come back with a trusted rating with in 3 hours as usual!!! SO CHECK BACK! As always you can trust my ratings and I give you my word it will be the best rating you can go by. 

I usually wouldn't download quality like this but my GF really wants to see it and Bone worked hard getting this out so thanks to him. I plan on downloading 2 copies of this movie tonight so I will rate both for you, I think there all around the same quality though. You can decide for yourself after I rate though........



BE BACK SOON!

[I do this because I'm tired of 107 seeds and 174 leeches and 1 comment only that says nothing about the quality. Why do you even bother commenting? It just makes you look like a jerk! Also because I'm tired of half these people rating it 7/10 for a cam and the other half 2/10 for a cam, common people don't be so foolish]"
,baba73,2011-10-14T00:14Z,Thanks BONE appreciated greatly :)
,nautica002,2011-10-14T05:24Z,"all the torrents with this movie seem blurry. if HD is 720p, I'd say this is just under 240p.(like poo) audio is a little low and sounds like talking through a tunnel. but movie is free and watchable.thanks BONE. also guys,read the info just above screenshot links. =D"
,some-young-guy,2011-10-14T05:44Z,"This is also a tourette syndrome version.  The colors come through great and all, but it really looks like the cam holder kept getting fits of the chills.

My guess is that the cammer was a junky in withdrawls, and to earn enuff scratch to get the monkey off his back, he had to go film a film for his dealer.

My 2 cents.  Sorry .BONE. I love your uploads, but this quality is beneath your reputation."

,TrustedQualityRatings,2011-10-14T18:51Z,"SORRY I fell asleep last night, I know I said 3 hours but please forgive me, here is my rating.

For a CAM - 5/10
Quality in General - 3/10
Film itself - 5/10

Again if you expect anymore from this upload your just plain ignorent. You should be able to tell by the information provided by bone as well as the sample pics that it will not be a perfect 10/10 blu-ray. You should be thankful for everything he does and I'm sure he doesn't give a crap what his reputation is to you. With that said .....

This is blurry but watchable. It kind of looks like your watching it through a rainy car winsheild at a drive-in. Not dark at all but the main problem I had with it was the sound. Its defenetly watchable givin the kind of movie it is if you want to see it that badly but your not missing much if you decide not too, in MY opinion its pretty boaring. The same old same old. Not much comedy at all and its kind of a rip off of The Ugly Truth. I could not sit still during the whole movie and ended up playing with the cat through most of it, the gf was mad. Anyway enjoy if you can and as always.....

Hope I helped :)"
