**************************************

An intense documentation of the blood red second generation S-trains. 
They roamed through Copenhagen and her surrounding suburbs from 1967 to 2007. 
A steel hard generation now gone.

These are the final recordings.



COPENHAGEN TRAINS - VANDAL TACTICS is featuring some of the key players in the Copenhagen train scene. Live actions, heavy bombing, mind blowing color productions, top to bottom throw ups, all on those infamous red steel trains that was an object of desire for generations of writers worldwide. With recordings dating back from 1999 and to the end of the era in 2007 COPENHAGEN TRAINS - VANDAL TACTICS gives an exclusive and highly aesthetic presentation of the true train writing spirit of Copenhagen. 

All scenes are accompanied by an original soundtrack, composed and executed to the fullest by the Copenhagen Trains crew. The raw and dirty beats of the 808 and old school synths make up a soundscape so fat you can almost smell the rusty tracks and feel your fingers stick to the cap!
