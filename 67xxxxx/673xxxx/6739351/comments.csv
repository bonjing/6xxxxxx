is there any chance that it is my computers problem?
anyone else experiencing the same problem?"
[T],Ferrelas,2011-10-15T09:49Z,"Recently read about people having this problem with DVD:s and someone said that it has to do with the wide dynamic range of the AC3-codec, and that this can be mitigated using volume normalization. This is AC3 (at least according to mplayer), and I had the same problem with it. I have since stared using volnorm and checked this file now and it sounded much better, so this should solve it.

- af volnorm=1:0.2 (cli)

af = volnorm=1:0.2 (config file)

This is for mplayer, users of other players may help themselves."
