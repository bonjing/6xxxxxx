,billygoat71,2011-10-09T06:34Z,The Vid is no where near a 9. A-8 V-5
,DuhAzMan,2011-10-09T09:06Z,"No where near a 9 and you rate it an 8... Hmm? is 8 not near 8?

personally I think its a great upload and stand by the 9 rating for a TS."
,nl223506,2011-10-09T14:10Z,"Ok, first of all DuhAzMan...he said, ""The Vid is no where near a 9"" to which he followed up and gave the video  5...look again dude. Secondly, it's a camera, I wouldn't expect anywhere near a 9 to begin with, since apparently all the people shooting these films in the theaters have camera's from the 90's."
,some-young-guy,2011-10-09T15:18Z,"A-8, clean but a little over driven in spots
V-7, a bit blurry and dark in insignificant spots, but overall is very watchable.  This rating is based on the sample BTW"

Really great compared to the other ones.
And, for all you haters or whatever you want to call yourselves there is nothing extremely wrong with the video its just that the video  resolution is the only real thing that is wrong with it. So lets say your on your computer, when in a video playing software like VLC. That software doesn't account for the pixelation that happens when you go from a 720x304 resolution to a 1280x1024 resolution. That's why your video gets all pixelated. So the only real problem you have to fix is the pixelation and the contrast issues. So there are two great ways I know to fix this problem. Ok, So the first is a pixel filter plugin for vlc and just mess with the brightness and contrast settings and you should be watching a great HQ video. The second is TVersity(Google it), this software is a media sharing software that will let you... What else? Share media. But, this software just doesn't let you share media, it also transcodes and converts your media while you watch so your T.V. or gaming system will let you play it without having to convert it then start watching it. So that's just the extra stuff that comes with it, but it also allows you to change the video resolution without the video pixelating. So it will give you a relative HQ video and the server can connect to almost any device, from almost any T.V. to almost any gaming system. The last thing is what settings you should use for TVersity, now I don't know if these are the best settings but they give me HQ video so I don't care. So, Here are the specs:
