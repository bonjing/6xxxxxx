,sell-out,2011-10-09T13:55Z,"Heres the read info from CM8 that extremezone ""accidently"" left off

well we got that awesome 720p with that nasty korean subs. The old Problem is still the same,
either leave it, crop it or blurr it. blurring 2-line subs is terrible, cropping them both away
and you lose too much video. But i discovered the above subline is only visible very rarely,
in fact exactly 70 times for 1sec 2 or sometimes 10secs. Thought i make a special version,
didnt realize that it will take that long. but after 16hours of intensive editing i am finally there.
the lower subline is constantly and only half in the video so i cropped that 14 lines away, wont be
missed anyway. now comes the tricky part. i thought about blurring the above subline only when visible
but that would ruin that perfect video so i decided to cut and resize only that above mentioned 1 up to
10 secs parts and leave the rest of the movie untouched so that you dont loose any video information.
That was really hard work, if i would make a brutal cut on that parts you would have seen jumping video,
who wants to see that. so i used camera transitions inbetween scenes to hide when that parts are.
In the End you cant and wont see any cutparts i made. The Movie looks like it was that way.
the right definition would be cropped only when needed, the rest is all there - audio is cleaned up too.

hope you enjoy all that hard work i made on this movie, i wouldnt do it twice again, its too much to do."
,xmaclass,2011-10-09T13:55Z,"Without your ongoing perseverance and commitment to legit bullshit-free and more often than not still in the Theaters torrents, id still be stuck in the second gear.

,Kewelll,2011-10-11T13:59Z,"Am I missing a codec or something? The video stutters for every 30secs or so, a frame freezes and continues normally after ~1sec. Extremely irritating. I've tried BSplayer, VLC and Windows media player, but the problem keeps occurring. Any tips to make this go away?"

,nazgull2k10,2011-12-02T23:04Z,Movie is TERRIBLE.  seriously.  Dont waste your time.  Plot is so full of holes my 6 year old was pointing them out.  We spent 40 minutes we watched this garbage laughing and heckling it.
,balrog814,2012-01-17T18:12Z,"I haven't seen it, 'cause I'm sick of this new idea, that chicks fight with badass guys, and win, or anything. On top of that, most of these chicks are skinny hot model types. Ridiculous. This whole industry is stupid, and as soon as I see in any film, that these stupid fight, that's over for me. Have you really ever seen a girl kick a guy's ass. Stupid, not entertaining."

,st0gey,2012-02-07T19:48Z,"I thought the audio was a tiny bit out of sync. Adjusted it while watching on VLC player. Apart from that the audio and video quality was fine. 

The movie however, was a steaming pile of horseshit. What's wrong with Luc Besson anyway?  'La Femme Nikita' was great, 'Leon' was OK, this is shit. Enough with the female assassin fixation already. Zoe Saldana was badly miscast and it was so formulaic you could almost predict every single boring sequence. Bah!"
