[T],metalcore.,2011-10-14T01:56Z,"just to let people know this is absolutely HORRIBLE quality. the documentary is from 2011 yet this looks like a VHS rip (and a poorly done one at that)...it is not properly cropped (black bars on sides and top...annoying as all hell), and above all that it looks like it might have been recorded via camcorder from a tube tv. i love your uploads Thorton, and appreciate all you upload...but for a bran new documentary this is awful....whoever ripped this clearly didnt even look at what they produced."
