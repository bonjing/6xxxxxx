,prikosnoveni,2011-10-09T19:05Z,"@redhillunited
It is supposed to be a stand alone sequel. Just hope it's a lot better than the original Disciples III."

comes as ""extremezone.aka.piratepedia.is.a.piece.of.shit"" on this torrent..

Thanks for the up anyhow :]"
,enterthehole,2011-10-10T05:16Z,. comment bugged
,munkman,2011-10-10T08:15Z,Why would the uploader call himself a piece of shit? Is there a virus on this or something?
,brandon75,2011-10-10T23:31Z,"great torrent game installs fine. You need to disable internet connection to run. Game has a known glitch where it will freeze the game on the first map after a cutscene. The russian 1.4 patch will fix this as I understand, however after applying the patch the crack no longer works and it requests a cd key. Any workaround to this or a new crack would be awesome thx "
,enterthehole,2011-10-11T00:49Z,"Yeah if anyone has a fix for the lockup glitch, it would be appreciated :]"
,pejo87,2011-10-11T01:59Z,is this game on english 
,stogi1knobi,2011-10-11T04:09Z,Thanks again Reloaded and Extreme
,enterthehole,2011-10-11T07:42Z,"in english, but cant get past the first mission as it locks up after a short cutscene every time. Anyone got it working past the first mission?"
,plvmlq,2011-10-11T21:13Z,"Well seems that the bugged/glitched version of d3r ended up on torrents hence the many delays@ steam and gmg though the russian version had these they were patched its 1.4 or higher so...im guessing a new d3r (english) version is needed since they wont release a patch to adress these issues (thats why they delayed i suspect they let ppl pirate the bugged version and then patch it delay it a bit then release the 'good one) not sure i may be wrong


also if ya get past the camera glitch in act I   you gets STUCK IN ACT VI   you have 2 leaders must meet on soem island middle map...thing is you cant REACH IT since the only way is blocked by a LOL effing stone so i bet the devs did this its too obvious it looks like a bug even an damn retarded one "

,soldado651maia,2011-10-11T22:03Z,"Disciples 3 renaiscence took a LOONG time to fix and update it,

,MeH88,2011-10-11T23:39Z,There is patch 1.4 (rus) but after install I couldnt even get pass the new keycheck screan. Is there crack for that patch??
,imjinah,2011-10-13T14:38Z,"there's supposed to be a witch hunter
standing beside a caretaker that looks like
a mage. i get pass that place once on the first
run without internet connection until deliver the spider to make poison, i realize
that eventhough the hero is a MAGE but you
have to put stat on STRENGTH to make his
attack power higher. i delete that save and play
again but i'm stuck at this bug since then.

when i replay the caretaker is standing alone,
witch hunter is nowhere to be found but dialogue."
,ismellfunny67,2011-10-14T00:53Z,It seems like all of my torrents come from you these days. Thanks for the upload and all of the work you've done. Long live extremezone!
,Darkorick,2011-10-14T12:24Z,"Seems if you run and do the first part of the mission within 5 or so turns (before your mission changes to the necromancer) the game works.  So just run and kill the witcher right away, don't waste any time picking other fights or items up and you will get past the crash.  If you have a problem I'II upload a saved file."
,crazypickle,2011-10-14T13:37Z,thanks man great torrent
,soldado651maia,2011-10-14T16:41Z,"Darkorick

,jurro30,2011-10-14T18:33Z,can anyone upload the update for this game? it's fucking annoying to see the game freeze when the witch person is gone from the screen. thanks!
,MeH88,2011-10-14T19:48Z,Geting to whicher no hard in 5 turn is imposible whit new game mechanics and whidout spell (no inaf mana in 5 turns tu cast anything :(
,soldado651maia,2011-10-14T21:20Z,"I Found a fix.. go to gamecopyworld
search for disciples 3 you find a trainer for disciples 3 ressurection use the +6 trainer is in german
open trainer and click num pad 1 and 0,
load your game or start a new game press ESC or minimize the options working display in red in the trainer, you have now unlimited turns and moviment it is strange that the necromancer appears in map now.."
,istanbul34,2011-10-15T11:15Z,"Arkadaşlar bu oyunun müzikleri içinde Türkçe parçalar var az önce Aşık Veysel'den Benim ""yarim kara topraktır""ı dinledim bir iki tanede tasavvuf müziğine denk geldim. Oyunu oynarken bu parçaları dinlemek gerçekten çok hoş. Oyuna çok mistik bir hava kazandırmış.
 Very nice game songs, magical!"
,Sivos,2011-10-16T04:19Z,"You know, this is the 3rd extremezone torrent I've been to today and all of them have +14/-0 quality points, lol.  And they were all RTS games too, lol."
,MeH88,2011-10-17T15:09Z,Any update/patch for this?? i want to finish first mission at least ;)
,mvri0028,2011-10-17T15:46Z,"Patch 1.4 fixes the bug,but still no crack for it...I like the game better than heroes 6,but I need to be able to play it more to decide if it's worth buying or not."
,dutchdrag0n,2011-10-20T19:30Z,keep up the good work ;)
,Mastard,2011-10-21T14:35Z,"thanks for this awesome upload !!

I managed to get past the ""witch hunter problem"", just like Darkorick said...you need to speed up and kill the witch hunter right away and dont waste time on picking fights with others and you will get past that crash

thaks for the tip Darkorick ;)"
,MeH88,2011-10-21T19:31Z,"On what level of dificulty were you playing Mastard, I`m personaly not intrested in easy. Is sombody working on crack for 1.4patch ??"
,AgentOrange12345,2011-10-22T12:57Z,"Ok the problem with ""freezing"" is the Witch is standing next to the dude you took to, but is getting killed in around 42 turn, if you did not meet the team who's triggering ""Necro"" quest. (She's killed by that team exactly, they exploring the map).So stand next to your castle, collect the gold aroud without fighting. Then when u get something like 1900 gold, build Lair of the Pack s in castle - and then hire one or even two Werewolves. Go straight to the village, as quickly as you can - if the Saalar dies underway no worriy about him and speak to the guy till Wchich is still alive. Then kill it and thats it. I did it around 42 turn without rushing, just about a time. You may also build Magic Tower, develop ""Summon Gworn"" spell and plant Gworn between the ""team"" and Wchich when you be close enough just to slown them down. In my game they just changed a path after killing the Gworn without moving toward Wchich...hope it helps, thx."
,pejo87,2011-10-22T15:36Z,i have bild so many creature bilding and i dont no where tu buy that creature(unit) can somewone please halp me. i no there is a option like a hire unit but there are just fyu units.....

,tocdo3,2011-11-25T21:00Z,"@michu22-22 Before playing the game, make sure you turn off your internet, so it won't asking the product key. After you get into the game, you can turn on your internet again."
