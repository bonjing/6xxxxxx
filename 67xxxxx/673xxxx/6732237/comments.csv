,shelbylab,2011-10-12T06:01Z,There is a gap in the center of the 2 images that changes size. Noticed it after trying to watch it and it looked off. Seen this before. Not sure what causes it but it sure makes a good 3D program unwatchable. Thanks just the same for all the effort that goes into bringing these movies to us.
