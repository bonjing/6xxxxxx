thx

Audio: Reborn/Illuminati/Suckit

thx to audio supplier and to the previous audio syncer

Encode:

well another days work on a new movie with usual problems.
The Russian Video itself was basically ok just dark and colourless.
Had to cut the video in 6 parts, not all had the same problems.
added brighness,sharpness,chroma,contrast and rgb all when needed differently.
blurred the two spots where relizlab video logo appears and made new video out of it.
Took the audiotrack from the illuminati version, cleaned it up and wanted to mux it to the russian video but i noticed 2 mins audio is missing, the russian video is a lot longer.
At 8 spots video was missing and was brutally cut out, this scenes have each a length from 6 up to 30 secs.
There is nearly no voice spoken in that parts. some needed only music, the biggest cuts were inside robot fighting scenes.
who wanna miss that parts? NOT ME
So i either inserted random audio at the parts that needed no explanation and for that robot fighting scenes i made a audio looping from the fighting scene itself. basically the audio at that parts is only plonking metal at each other, so you shouldnt notice that major, the audio comes right back in when there is voice.
In the end i just fixed minor sync issues that were either there or due to syncing, all in all very watchable.
it wont get better than that and you can at least enjoy a full movie.
enjoy
