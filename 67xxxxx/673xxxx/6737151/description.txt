Often compared to the work of Nick Drake, Upon Velveatur is a dense and mysterious French-Canadian folk-psych suite, featuring beautiful melodies, lush orchestration and scorching electric guitar. Barely circulated on its original release in 1972, it has gathered a major cult following and is now making its first appearance on CD, complete with five bonus tracks, rare photographs and sleevenotes by the enigmatic Rodier himself.
