ATTENTION: IF YOU DOWNLOADED THIS TORRENT BEFORE AND I STOPPED SEEDING, PLEASE REDOWNLOAD. 2 OF THE FILES WERE CORRUPTED SO I HAD TO REUPLOAD, SORRY FOR THE CONFUSION!

Taken directly from the download I got from thekingoflimbs.com. Left as originally downloaded, so if any of the tags seem inconsistent or strange, it's what they're supposed to be. I also added the original artwork from each of the 12" singles as a secondary artwork for each of the songs. 

Enjoy!
