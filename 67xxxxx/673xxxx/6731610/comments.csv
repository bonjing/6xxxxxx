,Huntzberger,2011-10-10T19:30Z,"Thanks for the heads up TeamLeaks :) I'm having trouble loading an AVCHD M2TS file onto the timeline. The video appears, but I can't see the audio (as I should). Any ideas? I'm trying to mute or delete the audio and replace it with new audio. Hoping someone out there knows how to do this?!"
