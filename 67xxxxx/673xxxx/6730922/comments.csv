It seems that they stopped developping a premium version for this app. It's now free to download!"
,Majestik1,2012-01-31T10:38Z,@ Da5niper - yep 100% right. Thanks man!
,Tecness3,2012-02-08T16:56Z,"You both know, this has the serial included right? The version you are downloading (From the official site) is not 100% free. It requires you to buy it activate certain things. Such as Registry Cleaner, Internet Booster, Registry Defrag, and Cloned File Scanner (there are some others, within free versions, but these are just some of the main ones)."
