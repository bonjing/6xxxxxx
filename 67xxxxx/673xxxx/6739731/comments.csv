[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-12T20:53Z,"Has the artist changed on this series? This issue just didnt look right. And I know they want her to look pale and Goth, but she looks like she's blue WTF? Still love this series and characters - honestly wish they'd steer a little more away from supernatural, but i guess she's gonna be the BatPerson Vs Boogie Men.. *sigh"
,Ohmstar,2011-10-23T16:12Z,One of my favorite things about the Batwoman series is that she is fighting supernatural enemies. JH Williams' art really works well with the supernatural. We have enough Batbooks where they're fighting normal mundane criminals and villains. I'm very happy there is a (truly amazing) book featuring more supernatural elements.
