Shazam: The New Beginning was a four-issue limited series published from April to July of 1987. It re-introduced the character of Captain Marvel into the continuity of the Post-Crisis DC Universe and brought back some of his classic adversaries, including Black Adam and Doctor Sivana. Due to a second Post-Crisis reboot in the title Power of Shazam, this series is no longer considered part of the canonical DC continuity.
