In the months since US Navy SEALs shot and killed Osama bin Laden, news media have written the first draft of history. But so far, no one has told the epic story of human, political and diplomatic intrigue that began years before 9/11 and ended in a bloody ambush in Pakistan, May 2, 2011.

The fifth estate brings the hunt for Osama bin Laden vividly alive with three-dimensional imaging, blueprints, stunning original footage from Abbottabad, dramatic depictions, and provocative exclusive interviews with the people who witnessed it first hand. 

We cross the world to the White House Situation Room where U.S. President Obama awaits the outcome of a mission that will define his presidency and change the world. One of the people inside the room that day describes that moment of unbearable tension. Would they ever hear the words: \"Enemy Killed in Action\"?
