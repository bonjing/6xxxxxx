,GeniusAnomaly,2012-01-14T20:33Z,"Why did you hard-wire your name (theLeak) into where it usually displays the record company, when playing it on the iPod?; that is extremely tacky.   

Thanks A Million For The Up!"
,GeniusAnomaly,2012-01-14T20:37Z,"Everybody appreciates and thanks you for work 'bow', but people ask me, what is theLeak, I'd rather not have to explain it to them, I have no idea how to remove the hard-wired part where it displays record companys names.

Thanks again for the upload!"
