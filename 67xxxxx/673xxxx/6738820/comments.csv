,mromeo1987,2011-10-12T18:53Z,"My cursor is blinking as well. I can hardly complain about a free game, but it sure is irritating. Messed with all the settings i could and still couldn't make any progress with it. Still a good torrent. "

,asder111,2011-10-12T22:30Z,"The fucking SKIDROW cracks are getting worthless, this has been going on for a while. They don't know how to crack games properly anymore. This game is choppy and it's not because of my system. Fucking SKIDROW, they really are SHITROW. Where is reloaded when you need them?"
,Naridar,2011-10-12T22:44Z,"The game drops a ""Might and Magic Heroes VI stopped working"" message right at the splash screen after I start it. Cracked as instructed, I have no idea what could be causing this.

My system is a Win7 Ultimate 64-bit. All requirements met."

,asder111,2011-10-13T02:38Z,"Man, you can't write your opinion on the net before a retard comes and lectures about morale and what not. You fucking retard(smoke_nl), what do you care about what i say?  And stop telling me what you do with sheep and assume that i or everyone else does the same. 

AND FYI, i just payed for the game and the it has no problem at all. And on the game forums you speak of, are only retarded people like you that downloads shitrows crack and complain there as if they payed for it."

If you play on a laptop it is probably because your video card is not supported"
,alex_costin89,2011-10-14T08:00Z,"i play on pc :video card is 8800gt, whit latest beta drivers."
,alex_costin89,2011-10-14T08:02Z,"anybody tried this? : if you have probleme to launch game with black screen and return to desktop
you must add key Dword in windows registry
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers]
“tdrLevel”=dword:00000000 and restart Pc"

Nakon sto instaliras i crackujes igru, pokreni je, ali joj ne smes dozvoliti da se apdejtuje (update) preko neta. Ja imam windows xp i nemam nikakvih problema za sada."
,ovnoglavi,2011-10-18T22:24Z,"@prikosnoveni
Care, daj molim te reci kako da pokrenem igru na engleskom... Sve je kul kod mene samo što je na poljskom... Džaram windows 7 ulti 32bit-a... Molim te reci kako da pustim game na engleskom!!!
Unapred zahvalan"
,prikosnoveni,2011-10-19T14:17Z,"@ovnoglavi
Koliko ja znam jezik biras na samom pocetku instalacije (na padajucem meniju) i nemoguce ga je promenuti naknadno. Ne znam kako se desilo da je igra na poljskom (ne znam koji si torrent skinuo, a sami developeri su priznali da je igra bagovita u picku materinu), ali mislim da sada pomaze jedino reinstalacija.  "
