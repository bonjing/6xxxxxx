,jaredneedsalife,2012-01-04T20:55Z,"The Quality of some of the films is somewhat fuzzy.  This is to be expected though with the relatively low size of the collection.   On the bright side the whole torrent only took me overnight to Download and they all play through windows media player = Its great for me having access to all of the bond films through my Xbox through Windows Media Center.  

Many Thanks for the upload rjaa !"
,jaredneedsalife,2012-01-04T20:58Z,"...Also there is nothing wrong with the collection, it downloaded fine for me.  all of it.  If it seizes up for any reason just force the download.  All the films work fine with generally average quality.  

Nice inclusion of Never Say never again btw. It gets a rough ride but its actually not a bad little film at all.  Look out for a young Rowan Atkinson providing the comedy relief. "
