Release Notes....: Discovery Channel's telecining on this episode is fuckin horrendous - blends and dupes throughout
                   with no distinguishable pattern.  We applied a deblending decimation filter but some parts were bad
                   enough that it didn't completely remove the blends.  This is about as good as it's gunna get.
                   Enjoy
