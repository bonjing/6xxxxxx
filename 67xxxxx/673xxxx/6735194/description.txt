This is a bundle of mobi versions of Donald Westlake's most famous creation, the perpetually put-upon thief John Dortmunder. For those who've never had the pleasure, Westlake was one of the finest mystery/crime writers ever, and the Dortmunder series is a run of comic capers that will entertain you for hours on end. Enjoy.
