A story of greed, a lust for power, and ultimate revenge. The Great Lord Hidetora Ichimonji has decided to step aside to make room for the younger blood of his three sons, Taro, Jiro, and Saburo, the Lord\'s only wish now being to live out his years as an honored guest in the castle of each of his sons in turn. While the older two sons flatter their father, the youngest son attempts to warn him of the folly of expecting the three sons to remain united; enraged at the younger son\'s attempt to point out the danger, the father banishes him. True to the younger son\'s warning, however, the oldest Son soon conspires with the second son to strip The Great Lord of everything, even his title.
