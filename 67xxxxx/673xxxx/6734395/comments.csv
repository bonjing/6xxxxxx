,bigfudge,2011-10-13T17:00Z,"gotta say as a kiwi, that was probably the worst refereeing display ive ever seen at a world cup.. i thought wayne barnes was bad. Watched the 1st bledisloe this year (thanks to shemyaza), pocock was penalized of the park by Craig Joubert (imo best referee in the world atm).. hopefully more of the same this weekend. i feel for you springbok fans. Go the ABs and thanks as always shemyaza for the torrents"

Thanks to shemyaza for all the work getting these games up. I haven't been able to watch any good rugby for years, but now I can."
,munkos,2011-10-18T04:20Z,watched this game live - was right there when the bokke scored that try. not even a hint of a fwd pass. really felt sorry for the guys - they played so well. pity to go out of the world cup in such a manner. would have much preferred being beaten by a quality side like the ab's. anyway - thanks agaian shemyaza
