Hittin' the Note is a 2003 studio album by the American Southern rock group The Allman Brothers Band. It was their first studio album to include lead slide guitar player Derek Trucks and bass player Oteil Burbridge and marked the full-time return of guitar player Warren Haynes to the band. It was also their first studio album not to include original guitarist Dickey Betts.

The CD was recorded live in the studio in New Jersey in December 2001 with lead vocal and minor overdubs recorded in early 2002. It was the first Allman recording co-produced by bandmember Haynes and Michael Barbiero. The album also marked the band's exit from Sony/Epic Records and was released jointly by Sanctuary Records and the band's Peach Records.

The album was met with critical acclaim but very limited radio airplay. Wall Street Journal, Allmusic, and Rolling Stone magazine were three of many prominent publications to give the record positive reviews. The track "Instrumental Illness" garnered two Grammy Award nominations in 2003 and 2004, both in the Best Rock Instrumental category.

Much of the record was written by the writing team of Gregg Allman and Warren Haynes. The band's history was not ignored: The structure of concert favorite "Desdemona" recalls that of "In Memory of Elizabeth Reed", while "High Cost of Low Living" features the guitarists quoting from other Allmans classics such as "Blue Sky", "Dreams", and "Mountain Jam". But the future is served too: The acoustic track "Old Friend" closes the album, and including only Haynes and Derek Trucks, thus becoming the only Allman Brothers Band track ever not to include an original member.
