                                   BBE Records first released the acclaimed "Stop
                                   And Listen" series late in 1996, a series that
                                   set the benchmark for latter day copies such
                                   as "Late Night Tales" and included compilers
                                   such as the legendary Masters At Work.

                                   This journey has always broken new ground and
                                   15 years young we're still ahead of the curve.

                                   Pete has continued to develop the label since
                                   2000 and has successfully taken it to new
                                   heights. BBE prizes itself on the motto of
                                   'real music for real people' and this has been
                                   borne out by the fact that there are now over
                                   160 compilations and artist albums released, a
                                   dazzling variety of sounds and styles from
                                   funk and soul to disco and Latin as well as
                                   house and hip-hop and beyond. Compilers,
                                   producers and musicians from around the globe
                                   have been brought in to add their expertise to
                                   the mix and in turn the label has profited
                                   from an extremely rich amalgam of diverse
                                   artists and a plethora of musical genres.

                                   Mixed by recent addition to the BBE roster
                                   Chris Read, "BBE 15" is a master class in
                                   bringing this music together in one seamless

                                   What a hustle tagging this joint.. To make one
                                   thing clear, the mixed tracks on this 2CD come
                                   split so no need for cue. Secondly, the
                                   tracklisting on the digipak (see scan) and
                                   those posted at the BBE site list ALL material
                                   that was used for the entire mix, including
                                   all instrumentals, acapellas, loops, etc. For
                                   example, Chris Read's mix of Pete Rock & CL
                                   Smooth's 'Appreciate' acapella uses 3
                                   different loops/instrumentals. Digipak lists
                                   all of these, but on the CD it's one track.

                                   So the actual tracks on the CD's are 25 on CD1
                                   and 20 on CD2, meaning basically we had to go
                                   tagging each joint with what's on the vocal
                                   track. Get it? If you wanna dig up all the
                                   loops and instrumentals go here:
                                  

                                   Or better yet pick up your own copy!

                                   Shout out to Chris Read for this dope mix of
                                   the BBE heritage, definitely a must-have
                                   compilation for all fans of good music.
