And after you tested it, you will like it, so support the developers and buy it."
,cuckoldu,2011-10-14T08:38Z,worked. thanks. :-)
,espirates,2011-10-16T06:15Z,"@tuvokk buying it sort of goes against the whole idea of pirating it in the first place.  After you test it, keep it without buying it is what it's all about."
,shani0610,2011-11-21T04:10Z,"The web developer (-one with mac) always seeks availability of coda, that shows how cool that app is. It also shows how PANIC has done hard work in developing this software. 

If you ever has compared coda with windows Notepad++(open-source), you will get the point.

I don't have money to buy this application, but I will certainly donate a few pennies in future.

thanks clique !

Would be cool to get 1.7.3 and some sort of keygen so that we can just get future upgrades from the Panic site"
,MPAAss,2011-12-30T07:56Z,I meant 1.7.5... anyone?
