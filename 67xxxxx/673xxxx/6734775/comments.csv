AQ succeeded in it's main goal, to bankrupt the USA and by looking at the US spending on ""counter""-terrorism, National ""Defence"", and ""aid"" to terrorist countries like Egypt and Israel, the work of AQ is still and will continue to be done looooooong after it is gone.

When the USA is completely bankrupt, likely within the next 20 years, there will be much more peace in the world and countries/leaders that rely on US Taxpayer welfare to survive like Israel and Mubarak, will disappear like a farts in the wind."

BTW are you still seeding 'The Satanic Verses' as you promised in :-
'http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6700876/Salman_Rushdie_ebooks_(epub_format)'

You were such an inspiration to me in that post that I decided to join you and keep seeding it too.

People will eventually come to see that it is visionaries like yourself that will shape the future - a bit like 'Planet of the Apes'.

TaTa for now!!"
