Math Wheels are a fun-filled interactive alternative to flash cards and
worksheets that present math facts in a game format that children love.
Because they invite children to take skill-building into their own hands,
Math Wheels are a powerful learning tool you and your students will
enjoy using again and again. Each engaging shape is designed to complement
popular classroom themes. Whatâ€™s more, because the wheels are
self-correcting (all students have to do is flip the moving answer-hider to
reveal the solution), they offer children instant feedback. And, if a child
does miss a problem, a turn of the wheel provides a fresh opportunity to
try again. Some of the wheels are interchangeable (Plus, Minus and
Times) so if, for example, you are doing a dinosaur unit, you can enhance
the unit by pairing the dinosaur shape with the problem wheel that
addresses the math skill of your choice.
Math Wheels are perfect for use with the whole class, in small group settings,
and for individual one-on-one practice. They can be used as the focus
of a teacher-directed activity, or placed in a learning center for children to
use independently or in pairs. And best of all, Math Wheels are easy to
make and simple to store.
