this update doesn't do much ""improvement"" at least on my end over skidrow's initial release.
already finished and encounted zero bug with rageConfig.cfg tweak though.
textures are still pops-in, and it's obviousness is varied from area to area as you already know.

If anyone else is experiencing this and knows what I should do, would appreciate a comment.

In the mean time I've reverted back to before the patch, I did so by backing up the following files before running the update.

All files (not folders) in the Main rage dir
the entire mp folder
and the entire base folder. 

if you backup these files before you update, it will help you revert in case you run into problems like I did. 

btw ty SKIDROW and crew for continued updates, and great game releases.

You will still have the blurry texture's because your graphics card only has 512mb of memory, it doesent have the capacity to store the additional texture's for rendering.
Also the 9600GT is pretty outdated now, so the processing speed's for textures will also be very slow."

COCKSMOKER, you think that's the problem when you have an dell xpz 17 2011, with 16gb ram, 3gb videocard? rethink bitchcock, now tell me the fuck how i can get this patch to work, i can't get the ""launcher"" over to my origninal installation folder. 
itt i cant get all the cracked files to my installation folder"
,drakowich,2011-10-12T12:25Z,"for people who cant use cheats here is what to do:

before installing the new patch, make a copy of the entire Rage folder somewhere on your hdd
install the patch on one of the two copies
make a shortcut for both Rage.exe and add the line for example: D:\Rage\Rage.exe  set com_allowConsole 1

so here's the deal, in the patched rage the cheats dont work and on the non-patched rage they do work
if you were stuck like me in Bash TV without enough bullets, i started the non-patched rage, added these two commands:

Press ` (Tilde) to open the command console in-game. Type these commands to activate the corresponding cheat.

   Godmode: cvarAdd g_permagodmode 1
   Infinite Ammo: cvarAdd g_infiniteAmmo 1

The codes below need to be re-entered after loading into a new area.

   Vehicle Godmode: cvarAdd vehicle_god 1
   Infinite Vehicle Boost: cvarAdd vehicle_infiniteBoost 1
   All Vehicle Upgrades: cvarAdd vehicle_enableAllUpgrades 1

and the miracle of this is, both rage folders saves in the same folder, so when you passed a mission with the cheats enabled
you can go on and play without cheats and the wonders of the new patch and go on with your mission

good luck !!"

Changing this one setting from force off to force on fixed this problem for me and now the games runs smooth as butter."

you must be having switchable graphics which are by default set to dynamic mode. you have to set it to fixed mode, to do this go to your bios and change the opion from dynamic to fixed. In case you dont find any such option then you'll have to update your bios(i had to do it for my hp dv6 6121tx) so visit your laptop's manufacturer company's official site. Install the bios then change to fixed.then boot the system and go to that switchable graphics window it will be little different this time around make sure your active gpu is high performance .After this for sure you""ll be able to play rage and in bonus you'll get rid of that crappy switchable option. 
Hope this helps as i have spend alot of my time sorting it out"

Power Master PSU. Hope this info can spare some the users trouble.
How to make Rage PC half working
1.	Donâ€™t update the new patch1 driver from official game site. 
2.	Add with a space between first word and after closed quote to short cut. +jobs_numThreads 0
3.	With step 2 two allowed to run on ATI Crystalist AI function w/ few but sometimes ctd/free at load screen. Turn this function on eliminates the artifact glitch. Other checked settings Triple buffering on, AA and AF to program control (8x at program), AAA set to disabled and crossfire disabled. 
Unknown effect of change. 
Updated ATI Diver Performance tailored for Rage. 11.10 Preview 2 driver.
Used so called crash fix pack from pirate site. W/t using crack provided instead original SKIDROW patch.
Recommended by another user before load to a crash quickly Ctrl+Alt+Del (Win7) to minimize the game and bring in Task manager upfront; waiting for indication on Task Manager to conform program running. (First try after tabbing back to the game, pause menu is shown.)
Introduction movie files at â€œbaseâ€ folder of the game deleted.
Created custom configuration file at main game folder with file name rageconfig.cfg. (used notepad save all files setting) Included setting in file:
vt_pageimagesizeuniquediffuseonly2 8192 
vt_pageimagesizeuniquediffuseonly 8192

,Covenant99,2011-11-04T01:28Z,"Hmm... doesn't work for me... doesn't even play, how come?

I installed it (Skidrow's) and updated (Skidrow Update I) it successfully but when I run the launcher or the RAGE.exe... it doesn't do anything, what went wrong? Does my V-card (ATI Radeon HD 4570) not enough?"
,Donnazz94,2011-11-11T11:24Z,hey i am running win 7 home premium 64bit with 4gb of ram and an ati mobility radeon 5470 512mb v-card and an Intel core i3-330m with 2.13Ghz with 4 cores. the problem i have is a persistent texture corruption (where everything is blue) please help!!!!!!!!!! it happens when the texture cache is on small and on large i have tried the paging file trick and it still doesn't work I'm decent with computers but this is stumping me. It looked like such a good game.....
,deache,2011-11-23T17:57Z,"Why are people talking about a serial for this game .... it doesnt need a serial. Apply the crack, if you dont know how to do that, just leave this site and never bother downloading any torrent again please.

,newmouse,2012-01-03T02:05Z,"If you are just looking to play the Single Player 
I don't think we really need a lot of the files in this  Update 1 .
There are a number of Non English Language Files & I suspect the English Lang file is same as before.

So have a look at the file list & deselect unneeded ones.
Comes down to 352 MB total .
I suspect we really only need the 20 MB of Files in The Skidrow Folder @@@"
,08191980,2012-01-04T03:05Z,"I can't seem to get Rage to run on my machine. I replaced a bad motherboard & decided to reinstall windows from scratch as well. I installed Rage & Update 1 through the usual method (mount images, copy over SKIDROW contents into install dir, etc.) but it doesn't work on my system. 

After I launch Rage, the mouse flickers for a moment then nothing...the screen doesn't do anything, I just sit in Windows. When viewing Task Manager, the Rage executable just flickers into existence for a moment before going away. 

I'm wondering if Rage doesn't like x64 Windows, but couldn't find anything about that just yet. Thoughts?"
,newmouse,2012-01-05T20:44Z,"08191980 : RAGE working fine on Win 7 64 Bit.
Check for latest Graphic Driver also DirectX 
& (particularly) Microsoft Visual C++ is all installed & up to date.
Do you have the Update 1 installed ? @@@"

,Ultimaniac,2012-01-21T01:00Z,"So I installed okay.  I started up the game okay.  I select New Game, the opening movie plays.  Then, right after the movie finishes, the game goes back to the title screen.  Any one know why this is happening?"
