25 track Best Of compilation spanning the solo career of Wild Bob Burgos from 1984 to present.
Burgos needs no introduction to hardcore rockers - he is the true Sledgehammer of Rock'n'Roll who made his name pounding the skins for wellknown Rock'n'Roll and Rockabilly artists such as Matchbox, Shotgun, Screaming Lord Sutch and The Wild Angels.

Since taking the lead as a solo artist, many of Rock'n'Roll's finest musicians have accompanied Bob, recording and touring in his band The Houserockers.

This collection is the perfect introduction to Wild Bob Burgos and his unique and wild brand of Rebel Rock'n'Roll, and is a great tribute to a living legend who has dedicated his life to Rock'n'Roll music.
