,Fre0n,2011-10-13T13:44Z,"Mount the image and then copy paste to your HDD.
Lauch the game with fm.exe

If for some reason the game is not working download steam software or download the demo for free from steam."
,CrockAA,2011-10-13T17:47Z,Where is the image? I can't find it.
,gkara2,2011-10-13T19:08Z,"The image is the .iso file.
Mount it with daemon tools or similar program"
,CrockAA,2011-10-13T21:16Z,But where is the .iso file? I can't find it.
,Jeff23021,2011-10-14T06:29Z,will you be uploading the full game when it is released?
,Fre0n,2011-10-14T09:00Z,I won't. I am sure RELOADED and SKIDROW will take care of cracked games :)
,jiten_lfc,2011-10-14T18:33Z,The demo itself is 2.4 GB this year :O
,luisbote,2011-10-14T22:35Z,were i download steam software ??? because didnt work for me
,Fre0n,2011-10-15T09:29Z,"@luisbote

https://steamcommunity.com/

Download the steam software, create a profile there then go to Store and type Football manager 2012. You will find Download demo on the right side."
,ackonish,2011-10-15T10:29Z,"There is one Crazy site, called Google, and you  can ask him all the stupid Q that you want and it won't laugh at you... 

For Demo you don't need CRACK, cuz... it is DEMO ... And Type Steam in google, and u will get the right location... like i did. "
,Flavinho,2011-10-15T19:51Z,can't wait to play the full game:)
,Fre0n,2011-10-16T11:03Z,Can't wait creating new leagues and messing stats with FMRTE lol
,lebbikex,2011-10-16T21:23Z,The game crashes before the start screen appears. Anyone know how to solve this issue?
,alkarahmah,2011-10-16T22:53Z,yeh geta better computer! Hope this helps
,alexsaba13,2011-10-17T06:55Z,"Mine crashes as well...And my computer is good enough..Either the requirements went up high,or there is a problem..."
,Fre0n,2011-10-17T09:14Z,As I said try downloading the game from steam if it doesn't work.
,SeanTaylor,2011-10-17T12:57Z,"To all you guys having problems with random crashes and stuff, you really should head over to the SI forums, and go to the technical help section. I'm sure they will help you solve your problems since there's hundreds of threads regarding crashes.

Seriously cannot wait for the full game though, I love trying to find the next big thing! And selling him for millions! xD"
,jeeshan,2011-10-18T15:03Z,Will there be a cracked version? SI has put so much of restrictions this time. We ll find out. 3 anxious days await 
,FM-Man,2011-10-19T13:48Z,"Hey @Freon  

will you be uploading the full game when it is out??"
,jeeshan,2011-10-19T17:22Z,Million dollar question FM Man
,Fre0n,2011-10-19T20:18Z,"@FM-Man
I won't. I am sure RELOADED and SKIDROW will take care of cracked games"
,FM-Man,2011-10-19T20:40Z,Hehe wel Jeeshan you right but if someone uploads FM12 when its out im sure we would all appreciate it and i speak on behalf of everyone :] 
,nixamere,2011-10-19T21:37Z,"The question is whether the game is crackable. Now we need to activate it through the internet (Steam). By the way, some people have the game already but cannot play it because it is going to be unlocked on friday."
,FM-Man,2011-10-20T00:04Z,@Nixmere if the demo is crackable then i would like to think the new game would be crackable too init...
,FM-Man,2011-10-20T00:14Z,@Nixmere you might right by there but if the Demo is rackable then im sure da full game is should rackable too init wel i at least i would to think so..
,Amelia1987,2011-10-20T06:39Z,I don't think we need to worry about that. Games with far more complicated DRMs have been cracked with ease.
,sensi187,2011-10-20T09:12Z,"will it come out on torrent anytime before 12 tonight? I am considering paying for it if not

how long doest it usually take to until we see it online?"
,jeeshan,2011-10-20T10:17Z,I doubt anyone can wait. Everyone has ???s in their mind. How long will it take for us to get hold of the game.
,nixamere,2011-10-20T14:09Z,"I would buy the game this year but SI has told that they had not improved the match engine. So basically you get a new-old game with minor changes (player interaction, UI) in comparison to FM11. I also doubt they hugely revamped the transfer market. Buying FM12 is a waste of money imho ;( The most important feature is possibility to add/remove leagues."
,mz4lyfe123,2011-10-20T15:34Z,Guys when will the torrent for the actually game come out??
,mikeywade,2011-10-20T18:57Z,"@nixamere That's false, they actually implemented many changes to the match engine: 

www youtube com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=CFlqnKX8Lug"
,mz4lyfe123,2011-10-20T19:20Z,"Guys when will the torrent for the real game come out, please someone tell me "
,nixamere,2011-10-20T19:53Z,"@ mikeywade

Read the forums - they said they had not changed anything apart from graphics and animations. That's why there are not so many bugs in ME this year. They plan to improve it in FM13."
,nixamere,2011-10-20T19:54Z,"@ mz4lyfe123

Nobody knows. Just wait as we all do :)"
,Dimmis80,2011-10-20T19:57Z,@mz4lyfe123 nobody knows that.The game is releasing tommorow in Steam and in Retail.Now when the game is out and the will manage to crack it someone like @extremezone will upload it here and in to other torrents and all we be very happy..Be patient dude be patient.I think its very close..

,callumdunbar123,2011-10-22T18:37Z,"miemars2 you will not be able to play the demo until the crack file is released, and are you mounting the file to a virtual disc drive?"
,miemars2,2011-10-22T21:05Z,I downloaded it from steam... Can you help me please?
,kingming,2011-10-23T02:54Z,It crashes during start up. Not able to reach start up screen even. I mounted the iso file using daemon and ran the exe file but it crashes 
,Fre0n,2011-10-24T08:30Z,Try copying the content of the mounted iso to your hard drive and try again from there.
,galinhas69,2011-10-24T19:10Z,game + editor
,Visotof,2011-10-31T22:23Z,"What is the difference between the demo and the full game? Ive played the demo now for over 13 hours and i cant really see differences?
As far as i can see you have all the options available."
,Fre0n,2011-11-01T09:16Z,Admins can delete this torrent since the cracked version got released.
