,cat3333,2011-10-11T22:06Z,"   I'll put more up as I can for you... ok?  I have all of the episodes ..  you want only 720p?  Right?  Glad you are enjoying them hun! I love the series, too!

720p
seasons 1-5  and seasons 9- 12 (2 episodes so far in  current season 12) 

and seasons 6 (1/2 in 720p), 7(a few in 720p), and 8(a few in 720p)"
,cat3333,2011-10-11T22:09Z,Any one episode or season you want in particular?
,cat3333,2011-10-11T22:14Z,"Also have all seasons of CSI Miami and CSI New York in HD... if you are interested....lol
(and all HD seasons of Criminal MInds, too)"
,SYNAESTHE5IA,2011-10-12T19:47Z,"Yes, 720p are great. To be honest, with downloaded files there isn't a massive amount of difference between 720p and 1080p visually, and these uploads look fantastic, and a hell of a lot better than the DVD boxsets I have!

I would like all of the CSIs in high-def, so will download them and seed to whatever your upload schedule is. Thanks again! :)"
,cat3333,2011-10-13T08:46Z,The ones I have that are not 720p are the regular 350mb size (not 1080p).... but... I have almost all of season 6 now in 720p (only 5 to go) ...  Its seasons 7 & 8 that are mostly the smaller size... but I will say that they are not all that bad looking.... lol  I keep looking for the HD ones to replace them with though ....
