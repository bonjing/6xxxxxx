,euphoria4949,2011-10-10T07:32Z,"Ok can anybody please tell me why when ever I download one of scenelines torrents they just sit in Vuze for hours before they actually start downloading??
I'm confused there are enough seeds so why wont mine start :-/"
,Evilution,2011-10-10T07:32Z,"seems something is wrong with scenelines uploading today... i got 3 torrents in my list, all sceneline, all dead at 0.0%"
,analjuggern4ut,2011-10-10T07:35Z,"If you upload it, you should also seed it. And *UNPACK* it first, nobody wants RAR's. Double negative for being lazy and not seeding."
,analjuggern4ut,2011-10-10T09:56Z,"@Evilution & euphoria4949: that's because sceneline doesn't actually want people to download his torrent, he just wants to advertise his own site by uploading non-working torrents. The site should be renamed to crappy.cd and the guy himself should be banned."
