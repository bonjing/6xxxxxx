,shaganese,2011-10-11T14:56Z,p.s is this an expansion or full game? thanks

I will indulge your ignorance for now. Yes it is an expansion as the title, picture and tag. Also the instructions tell you that you need to install it into Age Of Empires II Age of Kings. So pretty much all says it there in many places. So yes it is an expansion!!"

,avicknair,2011-11-11T04:33Z,having an issue mounting this one.  i love your torrents and have AoEII working flawlessly but i cannot get this to mount the image and when i do i cannot get the crack to work.  i know i am doing something wrong but i cannot figure it out....any help?
,VG4L,2011-11-18T05:26Z,"Im copying the crack file over the original .exe, but when i run the game, it gets to the main menu, then when i click single player a pop-up comes up telling me i need to insert the disk? 
any suggestions?"
,gijs008,2011-11-30T13:31Z,"@VG4L

Look on the internet for a no-cd crack. Copy that into your filemap and the game should work."
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-12-06T15:18Z,To all please remember you will need AOE II installed as well to run this game. Follow the instructions and it should work. If not then something is interfering with it.

,Xps630,2012-02-17T16:23Z,"Having problems when I want to start a campaign game. Everything runs fine, but after the 'intro texts' it stops running and shuts down. anyone got an idea?"
,Nikohi,2012-03-24T22:52Z,"Wow, this really helped! I downloaded your first version, the ""Age of Empires II: Age of Kings"" torrent, and I still can't believe that it works. I also have this one downloading right now, and it's almost done. I hope these seeders never stop seeding it! I have the third Age of Empires, but I still can't stop playing even this one! :D"
,Nikohi,2012-03-24T22:54Z,"Also, a friendly tip to everyone here that thinks you need to get a CD patch. You don't. Just download DAEMON Tools Lite! You can get it from here: http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/products/dtLite"
