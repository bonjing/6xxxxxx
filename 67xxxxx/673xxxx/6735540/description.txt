Hockey Night In Canada : Fuelled By Passion - The Return Of The Jets

This documentary was originally broadcast on CBC  7 October 2011.

This is a Hockey Night In Canada special presentation, a documentary on the passion of the fans which proved it viable for the return of the Winnipeg Jets to the NHL.  

The 1995-96 season was the last for the franchise which had started in the WHA in the early 1970s.  It was a bitter departure brought on by a horrible economy, a very old arena, and no options on the horizon. Mark Chipman had tried to buy the Jets in the mid-1990s but it didn't work. So he bought the Minnesota Moose of the AHL and moved them to Winnipeg. Then came a new arena and a partnership with Lord Thomson of Fleet, who owned the land where the MTS Centre was built. In 2010 they tried to buy back the franchise from Phoenix but it fell through at the last minute. A year later the Atlanta Thrashers were for sale and relocation and this time they got the team. 

The programme was broadcast in a bit of a retro style - shown without a bug, without snipes, and with almost completely clean end credits (the last frame had music from The Fifth Estate overlaid). There were however a few glitches in the video itself but they appeared in the broadcast from other stations too.

My grandfather was born in Winnipeg and even after moving to Ontario once the Jets came to be they were his team. He didn't get to be here for their return but this is released in memory of him.
