  St Helens vs Leeds Rhinos gives the Super League Grand Final an       
  overwhelming sense of dj-vu. This is the fourth time in five years  
  that St Helens have faced Leeds in the Grand Final but this year      
  their progress to Old Trafford was much more unexpected. Leeds        
  shocked everyone by beating the standout performers of the season     
  Warrington while St Helens got revenge for last year's Grand Final    
  defeat to Wigan in their semi-final.                                  
                                                                        
  Be ready for the Super League's Grand Final, sure to be full of       
  action, controversial decisions and hard hitting tackles!
