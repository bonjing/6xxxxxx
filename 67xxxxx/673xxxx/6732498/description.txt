                         |Falcon 4 BMS 4.32 1.02 realism mod|          
                          ----------------------------------

This mod is appliable without the need of the previous version, and goes directly over the game's main folder.       





-This Mod will bring most of the missile's flight models closer to their real behaviour and performance values

-The Aim-9X, IRIS-T and AA-11 (R-73) have been modified to respect the real life characteristics

-The SA-10 now has a hearable warning on the RWR when it locks on and fires

-The SA-10 now has two missiles in the air, just like the real one

-The F-14's advanced flight model has minor changes to the CG, making it more stable at higher alpha, and it's closer to the real thing's behaviour

-The F-16's advanced flight model has minor changes to the CG, and now it may do more stable loaded rolls, without departing due to the CG being too far
back initially (inertia coupling + CG combination made it more unstable than the real F-16), and it now respects the real F-16's flight anvelope

-Many aircraft's maximum reachable speed depending on altitude and acceleration levels have been revized and have their realistic value

-MIG-29 can go supersonic in vertical climb (at lower than 50% fuel state), just like the real aircraft

-MIG-23 now has it's realistic acceleration diagrams

-Fixed a bug where the F-14 could not takeoff or land (a fix for the previous mod version)

-Cobra manoeuvres can now be done with the Su-27/30/33/35/37, Mig-29's, F-14's, aswell as the powerloop with the F-22 Raptor, when using the CATIII config

-Also the F-18E/F Superhornet can reach higher AOA (up to 50 degrees), with less limitations from the flight controls, just like the real aircraft

-The Javelin missile has it's realistic range and burn time achieved

-The AGM 158 JASSM missile now has a more realistic range and characteristics

-The AGM 154A/C JSOW missile now has a more realistic range and characteristics




***IMPORTANT***

THIS MOD IS A MULTIPLAYER CRITICAL, SO ALL WHO WANT TO PLAY ONLINE SHOULD HAVE IT, OTHERWISE THERE WILL BE REALISM DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PLAYERS...!






Always check for new updates...!


Enjoy,

Have a Falcon day!
