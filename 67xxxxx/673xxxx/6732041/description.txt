SUMMARY:

Akitsu Masanosuke is a shy, self-conscious and slightly cowardly man with a goal of becoming a great samurai. However, when he is dismissed from his job after two days he must live the life of a ronin until he can return to service. So when a man named Yaichi approaches him offering food and a job as his bodyguard, it all seems too good to be true - that is, until Akitsu learns that this confident stranger is in fact a gangster of the Five Leaves who specializes in kidnapping and lives in the cityâ€™s red-light district. While the roninâ€™s sense of justice makes him think twice about accepting the offer, Akitsuâ€™s grumbling stomach, his growing familiarity with the rest of the Five Leaves, and Yaichiâ€™s determination to recruit the budding samurai, may well have other plans...
