I love Savage's show but he's been taking the piss recently; constantly plugging this book. So here it is for the princely sum of fuck all. Enjoy.

Amazon description:

Jack Hatfield [yes I know, a very English name for the protagonist of a book written by a Jew who is constantly slagging England off] is a hardened former war correspondent who rose to national prominence for his insightful, provocative commentary. But after being smeared as a bigot and extremist by a radical media watchdog group, he ultimately loses his job and finds himself working in obscurity as a freelance news producer in San Francisco. Hatfield is on a ride-along with the SFPD bomb squad when a seemingly routine carjacking turns deadly, after police find several pounds of military-grade explosives in the jacked car. And when the FBI urges Hatfield to stay out of it, he knows he\'s onto something big. This event will open up a shadowy trail that leads Hatfield to Tel Aviv, London, Paris, and back again to the United States, where he works with a beautiful and seductive Yemeni intelligence agent and a veteran Green Beret to expose a terrorist group known as the Hand of Allah - and a plot within the highest corridors of power that will make 9/11 look like child\'s play. In this lightning-paced first thriller, spanning the globe from Europe and Israel to the back alleys of San Francisco\'s Chinatown, a reporter must make the choice between protecting his own life and investigating a terrorist cell whose goal is nothing less than total political control - no matter what the cost.
