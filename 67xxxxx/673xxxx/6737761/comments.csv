,Skullsoldi3r,2011-10-12T06:28Z,"Leave it to eztv team to have the show up only an hour after airing. Not only that they dont give you any bullshit... just a tvshow itself and not 20 txt files  and folders trying to credit the uploaders like they directed the show. Thanks eztv for giving us another quality episode and timely. 

To anyone bitching about dl speeds learn how internet connections work. 99% of consumers have asymetric connections which means they DL much faster than they upload."

Best Show Around,
Just gets better and better....
Kurt Sutter has announced that Sons Of Anarchy will finish season four with two extended episodes. The show normally runs for a 60 minute time slot, but Sutter announced via WTFSutter, a video he releases to fans via Facebook and Twitter, that FX has signed off on a 90 minute runtime for episodes 11, and at least 90 minutes, if not more, for episode 12."
,Jammin Man,2011-10-17T07:58Z,"@Joehut
you seem to be the one that doesn't know anything. for some reason some files start out as password protected RAR's and then change to the real deal.
It has been happening for a while now and i got one a while ago so now i check to make sure before i download. other are trying to help and warn people about it before it changes.
Wankers like yourself spout bullshit, however you are the first to take yourself to a new level of Fuckwitness by calling someone out on the internet. get a life and move on to something else you loser.

And thanks for the up EZ, love your work mate."
,jlconc,2011-10-18T06:22Z,"hey this file is an .avi and great quality like all other eztv files, but only this one cuts to two and a half men at about 25 minutes.....??"
,nath570,2011-10-18T12:37Z,i got one  also that was rar and password protected that said it was eztv. first time this has ever happened with an eztv torrent for me. usually perfect
,scottsasse,2011-10-19T05:49Z,"Don't listen to the assholes complaining about rar files, passwords or this cutting to Two & a Half Men in the middle!! It is likely the same asshole who just has a couple different TPB usernames and is trying to trash TPB, eztv or simply trolling to piss you off and instill doubt. If they continue TPB's mods will delete their account soon enough!! This torrent is perfect!!"
,jlconc,2011-10-21T08:11Z,"scottsasse dude ur very sensative about eztv files arent u mate? u fukin remind me of my missus on her rags dude. man up bitch. and mate, the file i downloaded acutally did cut to two n a half men and i been downloading eztv for fukin yonkers so how bout u grow a pair and stop behaving like a girl"
