For those that grew up in the late 70s and early 80s too perhaps
this group's album was much a favorite and popular listening choice
for many who were hooked on it.

I bring it to you here to reach even those with polite tastes in music
as it does grow on you - even if you haven't had the unique thrill before.
Its part of the landscape and music history from the period.

320k Full stereo original version CD album with all ten tracks 
remastered by Greg Calbi in 2010 

including the nicest "Breakfast in America" number and "Child of vision"
along with the interesting and telling "Logical song" and the rest of
the lineup for this album title.

If you like disco, you'll find this genre too quite likeable I should think
