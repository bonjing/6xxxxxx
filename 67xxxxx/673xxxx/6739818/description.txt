Hell's Kitchen is an American reality-television cooking competition (based on a series of the same name, broadcast in the UK) broadcast on Fox. It is hosted by celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay and produced by Daniel Kay.

A former-pro-soccer-player-turned-Michelin-starred-chef, Gordon Ramsay is looking for someone with the potential to become America's next culinary star. The heat is on and the "steaks" are high as the contestants endure Ramsay's hellishly intense culinary boot camp. Each week Ramsay will grill the ambitious hopefuls as they attempt to prove they have what it takes to run their own restaurant. He will slice and dice the contestants, keeping only those who possess the right combination of ingredients to ensure success. The contestants' inexperience, combined with the perfectionist Ramsay's acid tongue, may be a recipe for disaster, but for one aspiring restaurateur, it's the chance of a lifetime. In this pressure-cooker environment, only one thing is certain: If the contestants can't stand the heat, they'll have to get out of "Hell's Kitchen."
