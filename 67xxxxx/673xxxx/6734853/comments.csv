Cool glad you sorted it al add that fix to my Win7 issues file for later if anyone else has the same issue. Also yeah there's no viruses on any of my torrents :) I am much picky about that."
,lightningwar415,2011-10-18T13:44Z,how do u install/operate after the torrent?
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-10-18T17:16Z,"@lightningwar415

I will indulge your ignorance. Since you seem to be unable to read the install instructions. Sighs

Step 1. Mount the image on to any virtual drive,

Step 2. Install via AOESETUP.exe on the disk,

Step 3. Copy the crack from the crack folder on the disk and paste into the game file and replace the original *.exe.

(hope am not losing you here.)

Step 4. Run the game with the *.exe file you just replaced e.g empires2.exe

(I hope that quenches your inadequate skills of comprehending information.)"
,Jaysun2012,2011-10-19T12:13Z,I got it all working but when i go to play it says to insert the disk. what should i do?
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-10-19T14:16Z,@Jaysun2012 then you must have not put the crack on!
,garyjnes93,2011-11-06T17:37Z,"Hey, I don't know if I did something wrong or if It just wont work on 64-bit. Which one is the crack file to repace the empires2.exe? When I tried a few of them I got a message saying it was for a 32-bit."
,garyjnes93,2011-11-06T17:54Z,"Hey, I don't think it works on a 64-bit. When I tried it, I got a message saying it was for a 32-bit."

,funtonite,2011-11-13T16:20Z,"When I mount the file, Windows says that it is corrupted. How do I fix this?"

,davidperd33,2011-11-21T17:54Z,"Hey, I donwloaded and installed fine, and I understand that I have to copy the crack into the game file on the mounted image but whenever I try to do that it says that theres not enough space on the disk and it doesnt give me an option to replace the original game file (.exe).  it also wont let me delete the game file even though I give it permission etc. thanks very much 
(go easy new to this)"

How did you sort the whole '...additional 2.44Mb...' thing??

Cheers"
,Taintedman,2011-11-30T20:13Z,"Where on earth can I find the crack?

Age of Empires 2 - Age of kings - (SerivusTheBear)

4 files with these names, no ""Crack"" folder - I've mounted and installed - but I can't find that crack anywhere.

Anyone help?"
,Taintedman,2011-11-30T20:16Z,"Never mind, I found it - Mount image, and open files for those who wonder."
,pjp125,2011-12-03T16:42Z,"got it working, but there was an issue with colours for me in win 7 - pink sea and red bits in the grass and trees, this solution worked for me:

1. Go into task manager and select the processes tab and end explorer.exe
2. Then alt-tab back into age of empires

Note: this will make your task bar and any open folders disappear.

To restart explorer.exe, open the task manager again in the applications tab, hit new task and type explorer in the box then ok.

Apparently the colours change because of the Aero theme's poor handling of colours"
,Lobizzle,2011-12-04T14:15Z,"I'm getting the same problem as a few of you guys, when I go to copy the crack folder it says there is no space.

If anyone had the same problem and found a way around it could you please post it here."
,Lobizzle,2011-12-05T14:47Z,"@Ygriek2

Could you please share with me how you got around that problem????? 

Really dying to play this game again after about 10 years so forgive the impatience :)."
,dougie-rathcoole,2011-12-17T16:23Z,"c when i download dis, its says i need software da open it can you recomend any 2 do so"
,OhhSoliid,2011-12-20T18:47Z,Seriously bro could you inform us of how to get around the no space available on disk problem
,ophiuchus3011,2011-12-20T19:06Z,thank you +1
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-12-20T22:36Z,"Right am going to state this slowly for everyone!

The game has been tested on a win Vista 32bit system! With no problems what so ever! If you are using a Win 7 version I can not help you with your problems. So saying things like (Seriously bro could you inform us of how to get around the no space available on disk problem) Dose not and will not score points with me.

Also those that cant seem to figure out where the crack is. Its on the disk in the crack folder. So do not ask stupid questions before LOOKING PROPERLY FOR IT! As it is stated in the description! 

Now for mounting it works perfectly fine with Daemon Tools Lite.

Now to those that have figured out a fix for the not enough space. I ask you to post it. As I have not been able to re create this problem people are having!"
,ranxio19,2011-12-21T03:11Z,"Sir i guess, based on some of their comments...they are putting the crack in the mounted image..


for those who dont know:

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ""PUT THE CRACK IN THE INSTALL DIRECTORY OF THE GAME, REPLACE THE ORIGINAL EXE"" 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

dont put it on the mounted image.... the mounted image is like a virtual cd, so if it is a real cd you dont put files on the already burned cd...except if its rewritable..
im just trying to help...


tnx for the torrent..."
,SexTurkey,2011-12-27T22:21Z,"I'm also having a 'space problem' when copying the crack into the game file. Says I need 2.44 MB. Any help regarding this problem would be greatly appreciated. I use win7 btw

Thank you."
,iarejester,2012-01-02T20:07Z,I actually own this but I can't for the life of me find the disks. Thanks a bunch!
,TTyota502,2012-01-30T00:39Z,Copy the crack folder from the drive to the downloaded file in your OS drive. Storage Space Fix/Misunderstanding!!
,TTyota502,2012-01-30T00:39Z,Copy the crack folder from the drive to the downloaded game file in your OS drive not the game file in the disc drive. Storage Space Fix/Misunderstanding!! 
,soniklad,2012-02-08T10:01Z,i cant find the crack file ive gone over it 3 times looking for it and the folder isnt there.

,Proxenus23,2012-02-18T20:11Z,Thanks for this! This is actually the first torrent that I've gotten to work on here (I've only just started with torrents). You made it really simple! Cheers.
,Proxenus23,2012-02-21T01:39Z,"The game loaded up great and is the tutorial campaign worked fine. When I tried to play single player, though, it told me that I needed to insert a disc and restart the game. Any fix for that?"
,dynfo,2012-03-06T19:57Z,"Thanks for the share !!

It perfectly works with windows 7 32bits (I only have UAC disabled) and I got no errors.

For people who gets crappy graphics on fields, here is one fix :

1. Create a .bat file, then open it and add this in it :
taskkill /F /IM Explorer.exe
age2_x1.exe
Start explorer.exe

2. About the age2_x1.exe line : For conquerors, or replace by empires2.exe for normal, the .bat must be located in the same folder, you can then add a shortcut."
,miracl3.whip,2012-03-25T13:24Z,"For the poeple looking for the crack you have to mount the disc with daemon tools, goto to the files from there it will be the first folder go in there copy the file with the age of empires logo.
Then go to your hard drive from my computer file the age of empires folder open it in a whole window, INSTEAD of pasting to the .exe or application file, paste it in the blank space under the files, it will ask it your want to overwrite the files, click yes then game on."
