,DivineDragon,2011-10-13T11:35Z,I'm going to do something real dumb. If the audio here is as  good as kev says it is. I'll just run this in the bg and have froggie's movie play up front. now I have acceptable a and v XD

OK quality for a cam. It's blurry during dark moments, the first couple min of the movie and a few areas when there is light. However, watchable.  Thanks."
,benito03,2011-10-15T20:29Z,"tnx for clear audio, because movie have a rely nice soundtrack. However video is blurry and those computer animated fights need better than that."
,sandisexmagnet,2011-10-17T05:22Z,why do wankers call it a TS when its a CAM? why??
,xSumonax,2011-10-17T08:40Z,"Because that is what a Telesync is, it's when you use a Camera but sync frame rate and inject sound from cable from a hearing impaired line or tape microphones right next to the speakers for more enhanced sound, (Possibly the best way to reduce other people's voice etc, Telesync can also be sitting next to the actual projector and audio put into it as well, a real Cam is someone just sitting in the audience."
,nathanielbeander,2011-10-21T06:40Z,stop bitching just watch the damn movie

,Winterkiller,2011-12-30T21:40Z,"The audio is ok(5-6) I guess but the video quality is really bad and blury (3-4). I wouldn't say it worth the 1.41 gb of download.
