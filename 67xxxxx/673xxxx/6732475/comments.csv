Ditto! This is the final series of a great show. Grateful as I am for the uploads, it deserves better than these very low-res copies. 720p at a minimum."
,popeye013,2011-10-17T07:06Z,"Its not in HD at all, its not produced by Kudos for the BBC in HD so there won't be any HD versions, 720p or 1080i "
