,gregmlr,2011-11-24T18:18Z,The file seems to be corrupt around the 30 minute mark (during the mermaid scene). My DVD player skipped around through it and stuttered but everything was fine at the beginning of the next chapter. I tried playing it on my computer and VLC completely stops the movie at the same part.
