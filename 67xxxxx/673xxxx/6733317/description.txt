Product Description: The fourth edition of Electronics: A Systems Approach is an outstanding introduction to this fast-moving, important field. Fully updated, it covers the latest changes and developments in the world of electronics. It continues to use Neil Storey's well-respected systems approach, firstly explaining the overall concepts to build students' confidence and understanding, before looking at the more detailed analysis that follows. This allows the student to contextualise what the system is designed to achieve, before tackling the intricacies of the individual components. The book also offers an integrated treatment of analogue and digital electronics, highlighting and exploring the common ground between the two fields. This fourth edition represents a significant update and a major expansion of previous material, and now provides a comprehensive introduction to basic electrical engineering circuits and components in addition to a detailed treatment of electronic systems. This extended coverage permits the book to be used as a stand-alone text for introductory courses in both Electronics and Electrical Engineering.
