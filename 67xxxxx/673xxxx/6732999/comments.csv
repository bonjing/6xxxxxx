xbox360 controller should work now for the game. the exe doesnt need to be turned on as it will automatically work with game after the initial setup.

I have dled two copies, the skidrow and clonedvd copies. 

The first time I ever saved it APPEARED to do so well but it never loaded again or worked properly from then on.

Please, any help would be much obliged, as it is maddening to have an awesome game sitting there gathering dust like this (metaphorical dust of course).

Would anyone be so kind as to locate the save file location on windows 7 x64 and let me know? That way I could create another folder with a similar name. Oh and the name of the save game as it appears (eliminating your own name from it of course).

That way I could maybe try and create a similar file or something.

Thanks in advance"
,cmoe,2011-10-15T14:46Z,"The funny thing is, I already tested that. DLed a DR2 (not OTR) savegame from the internet, created the folder and put it in there (since using a savegame from the ""old"" DR2 gives you an extra costume - the motocross suit). No chance, having the folder or not having it still gives the same error. Another fact is, on this computer i never installed the original DR2 either. So there's no chance in hell there ever WAS a savegame. Only thing i can think of is the crack causing this behaviour bc it tries to set save location somewhere at where windows doesnt allow overwriting stuff. Starting the game there is no save data either. Please help!!"

,cmoe,2011-10-15T21:31Z,"OMFG F*CK Capcom for this crap programming bullsh*t!!!!!!!!

SAVING GAME SOLUTION:
it actually IS the windows user name preventing the saves in case you have a username including symbols or german umlauts like Ã¤,Ã¶,Ã¼.
I already found that solution earlier and changed my windows account name. BUT that doesnt change the USER FOLDER name first created when you install windows... so that one still had an umlaut in it.

Just created a new user on my computer, started the game, voilÃ¡, saving and everything else works.

F*CK Capcom for shi**y programming and f*ck Capcom for releasing a 1to1 conversion of chuck greene to frank west as a ""new"" DR game.
Gonna delete it now that i know the solution lol

,Hamashedo,2011-10-16T21:04Z,"I like how people are bitching about this game sucking or being 1-to-1 release.

Capcom NEVER came out and said this was a brand new game.  When they announced this game, they annouunced it was just Dead Rising 2 with Frank West instead of Chuck.  If you don't like this game, delete it and move the fuck on.   Don't come on here to bitch about things no one cares to hear.

Now, maybe I'm the only one with this issue, but I can't find any options or configuration settings in my game, and I'd really enjoy turning up the graphics on this. Anyone else?"

As far as the game's storyline goes though, I was kinda pissed that they reworked Chuck Greene's story path to replace it with Frank West instead of giving Frank his very own, and so its almost like Chuck doesn't exist. I did like Chuck Greene better though, and I liked Frank West better in the first game without the cocky & show-off attitude. Same good gameplay though, and cool Sandbox mode."
