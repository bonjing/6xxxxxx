Although the Dutch are quite English oriented (all 10 cd are English) we like to be proud sometimes.

In the early days hardly any cd made it to the top. Lately however, Dutch influence is all around.

This is probably the reason why these cdees sneaked into my top 1000. A good opportunity to make a nice download for people who never listened to something else than things they already know or are produced within their own borders.

So its Dutch that can be understood outside our borders too.

Good Pop Music

Enjoy (and dont be an asshole and share)
