Way to go spoiling the whole damn episode, spazz420. "
,XaltedSmoke,2011-10-13T04:49Z,"You are correct BounceG, the name seems to be quite fitting...  

66 episodes in and this dolt decides to post a spoiler on the final episode.

THIS is why we can't have nice things...."
,tardis2010,2011-10-13T10:15Z,Thank You
,DngnRdr,2011-10-13T11:00Z,I think Bunnings are very happy with their promotion in the show and on the website - esp considering Mitre10 has The Block - so I have little doubt there will be another season.
,XaltedSmoke,2011-10-15T04:48Z,"Good news guys mediaspy.org is reporting the following...

""Despite dire ratings for the series, Ten insists the programme will be back next year with a revamped format.""

Stay tuned!"
