This torrent is for all of season 3 of River Monsters (with the episode titles with the CORRECT episode numbers) and two specials, The Lost Reels and River Monsters Goes Tribal. These files are in .zip folders, individually packaged so that you can pick what you want to download. 

These are files that Iâ€™ve collected offline. While Iâ€™m still seeding many of the original downloads, I decided to compile and organize them into a torrent myself so that anyone interested in the full season would be able to download it without the headache of hunting everything down or re-downloading torrents when the episode number was incorrect.
