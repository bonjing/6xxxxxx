,renison7,2011-11-06T21:52Z,what a fantastic effort +1 all the way. I must say I was a bit sceptical because it wasn't an mkv or mp4 container like most others but you proved me wrong. It deserves to be in the Highres -Movies section. I would recommend this upload because AVI container is the most supported file format. I would also like to know which software you used to encode this file. I will be following you uploads from now on. Keep it coming.
