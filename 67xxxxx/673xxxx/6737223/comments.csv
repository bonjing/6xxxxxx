,Mad_Fm,2011-10-11T23:45Z,"illiria, thanks."
,Dawidpepe,2011-10-11T23:58Z,Quick question I got the legit copy of DA2. I formatted my pc yesterday and im reinstalling everything. It always asks to connect to internet when u turn it on for first time. Should I just install it than your dlc packs up to legacy and than the mark of assasin and just turn it on>?
,illiria,2011-10-12T00:10Z,"@ Dawidpepe

You should install the game, then my DLC Pack, then Assassin. No cracks or patches needed - they are all in my DLC Pack.

OR

Wait an hour or two till I release my NEW DLC Pack with Assassin included (it's almost ready), then you won't need this torrent."
,Robben87,2011-10-12T00:23Z,Someone seed pls^^

THIS IS THE LINK TO THE NEW VERSION OF THE COMPLETE DLC REPACK:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6737353

**********************************************************************************
**********************************************************************************

Size isn't much bigger than ""Assassin"" alone, but you are getting:

1) Your game automatically patched to version 1.03.
2) PROPER (trust me, its hard to find) crack
3) All the DLCs ever released (including Legacy and all pre-order and signature items), pre-cracked.

And all that will auto-install by pressing a single button."
,eggdee,2011-10-12T01:36Z,"people pls seed this.. thank you so much illiria! i really wanted this! :,)"
,leviosathestral,2011-10-12T02:06Z,Do you have to do anything in particular to trigger the events of this DLC?
,shlop,2011-10-12T02:45Z,"Wow that was fast! Thanks, you're super."
,illiria,2011-10-12T03:09Z,"@ leviosathestral

To trigger events of the DLC, you have to do the same thing you did in ""Legacy"": go home and click on a statue."
,necro-noxxx,2011-10-12T04:24Z,what if u dont have a finished game or never made it to act 2 and have your own estate? can u start it from your uncles house?
,urineg,2011-10-12T04:45Z,iliria i LOVE YOU 
,illiria,2011-10-12T05:06Z,"@ necro-noxxx

Of course you start it from your uncle's house. I did.

By the way, I noticed two statues stand on some sort of carpets. There are a total 4 of them (carpets). Two are occupied by the statues, two are free. If it isn't some sort of a weird coincidence, we're gonna have two more major DLCs coming up. :)"
,kcwPB,2011-10-12T07:13Z,So this is only in French? Or is there an English option as well?
,booger2000,2011-10-12T10:42Z,"If I already have everything except MOA and item packs 2, can I still install this torrent? Cause I'd like to get the item pack 2 stuff.
Thanks so much, I really enjoyed Legacy and don't want to give bioware more of my money."
,bunke600,2011-10-12T11:54Z,im so grateful for your work here
,illiria,2011-10-12T12:33Z,"@ kcwPB

Why would it be in French? Am I speaking French? Did I mention French? o_O I believe this DLC comes in all the languages game was released in. English, French, Russian, etc. DLC will be using the language your game is in. 

@ booger2000

Yes, even if you already have everything, you can simply install this torrent on top of it."
,Fallerup,2011-10-12T15:39Z,"@ necro-noxxx 

you can, the statue is there too, if that's the object you use"
,ancient78,2011-10-12T16:32Z,"thank you illiria  for your effort and work , you always provide clean quality game packaging :)"

Don;t worry, you can play it right after you get to Kirkwall. It's only ~15 minutes into the game."
,felocan,2011-10-13T00:41Z,thanx illiria i'm glad that i can play this DLC as soon as possible thanks to you :):)
,kyriimix,2011-10-13T00:46Z,"For some reason when I download it, I only get a folder titled 'Addins' and I can't find an installer for it when I extract it. Help please?"
,illiria,2011-10-13T03:01Z,"@ kyriimix

There isn't supposed to be an installer in this release. Just extract into game folder and play. Simple as that.

I make an installer only for my ""Complete DLC Repack"" release. There, it's actually needed."
,kyriimix,2011-10-13T03:26Z,Oh. Okay. I guess I'm just so used to the downloads I get from you having an installer. XD Sorry for the noobishness and thanks for everything!
,Jakirai,2011-10-13T09:03Z,I'm missing Bethany and Sebastian in my party. Bethany is greyed out and Sebastian is not at the party selection screen at all. Does anybody know how I can get them back?
,gaza99,2011-10-13T09:59Z,Thanks alot @illiria. thanks again
,druid513,2011-10-13T14:30Z,"I couldn't finish this, duke boss jumped to high place and never came down from high rock. It looked like a bug. Even my arrow spells couldn't harm him. "
,v1c0d1n,2011-10-13T14:30Z,need more seeder to seed this one...
,illiria,2011-10-13T15:42Z,"@ druid513

I finished the DLC without any problems. Must be a random bug you are having."
,Diamlah,2011-10-13T23:06Z,"I'm going to sound like a complete noob, but which game folder do I put it into? There are a lot of folders under the Dragon Age II folder."
,Diamlah,2011-10-13T23:16Z,"Wait. I figured it out. Thanks a bunch, it works like a charm!"
,Banzay27,2011-10-13T23:39Z,"I'm certain it works just as all the others you've released, thank you, illiria."
,druid513,2011-10-14T01:14Z,Can anyone except illiria complete this DLC quest? I have a bug that boss wouldn't came down to fight. Thx for this and other DLC.

,pidgebc,2011-10-14T02:58Z,"I can't seem to leave Kirkwall to do this.  I started the DLC, and got through the introduction for Tallis.  Then when I go to leave for the Chateau Haine, nothing happens and I no longer have a DLC quest in my log.  Any ideas?"
,warwind74,2011-10-14T03:00Z,hay is any one going to do an xbox 360 one i hop so
,illiria,2011-10-14T06:52Z,"@ druid513

Tons of people have completed this DLC, I got replies from them via forum.

@ pidgebc

Another random game bug then. Some people had the same type of problems with ""Legacy"" as well. I have no idea what's causing it. DLCs work just fine for the majority of people.

As far as I can tell, these are random script bugs. Reinstall the game, and if it still isn't fixed, start a new game. That's the only thing to do, since BioWare is not willing to fix its bugs, apparently."
,illiria,2011-10-14T06:52Z,"@ warwind74

Xbox 360 release won't be coming from me, that's for certain."
,illiria,2011-10-14T06:56Z,"@ jacksond2nd

I can't help with any sort of DLC bugs, I am not a developer. There are some bugs I can fix, yes, but script bugs are not that type.

Understand, these are completely random bugs. Some script somewhere has loaded improperly. There can be hundreds of reasons for this. I can't go around checking each and every one.

As far as fixing goes, all I can do is suggest the same: reinstall the game, and if it won't fix the bug, start a new game. There is nothing else to do."
,Calli415,2011-10-14T08:44Z,Works Perfect thnks

,depressed,2011-10-18T18:55Z,"I've downloaded this & put it in the right place, but it doesn't show up under the DLC menu on the games main page, am I doing something wrong?"
,Cireagle,2011-10-23T09:40Z,as always works flawless...and as a side note: thank you illiria for putting this as separate download...saves some bandwith for those of us that jump on your work as soon as it's out ;)

,tetchy,2011-12-07T09:27Z,"i have an old (probably RELOADED) v1.00 of the game+crack and fairly recently added Exiled Prince, Black Emporium and Signiture Items that work perfectly after deda2drm and DA2_DLC -activator TEST VERSION 6

this however doesnt work for me. the game see's it is there but it isnt activated, and i tried deda2drm again but still not activated (the DLC-activator VERSION6 was for the signiture items)

my copy of the game has never connected to the official site (ive blocked the game with the firewall), and i have no account with EA/Bioware

any advice on getting this to work?"
,tetchy,2011-12-09T01:46Z,"although this didnt activate for me, i DLd illaria's complete DLC pack...  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6746710/Dragon_Age_2_Complete_DLC_Re-Pack_%28__The_Deep_Green%29_-illiria

,Sunny16,2012-01-21T18:19Z,"I don't understand what i do wrong.
I copy da2_prc_eye into my game folder :(C:\Program Files\Dragon Age 2\addins )
When I start the game, i check if my downloadable content are istalled and yes, they are. Then i start the game, when I go to Gamlens house, there is nothing. There is supposed to be '' Momento of Mark of the Assassin '' . 
How can i fix it?
