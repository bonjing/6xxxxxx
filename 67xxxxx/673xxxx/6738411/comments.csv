,Kakaru,2011-10-12T12:02Z,"yes, the install gives an error, but game works just fine when you run it. Thanks from me too."
[T],alexisthebest,2011-10-12T12:14Z,"@ej33t
I just did a fresh install and it worked."
,karlosss999,2011-10-12T13:25Z,"respect where respect is due.

This+THETA's 1.06 release = fully operational game. No graphics corruption, upgrades working and having a hell of a fun time. 

Thanks to alexthebest and THETA..."

well said about that crook he only steals them"
,huldu,2011-10-13T02:56Z,Still no sound/music. Game works fine beside that... gets a bit boring with silence tho.
[T],alexisthebest,2011-10-13T03:23Z,"@huldu

Audio works fine. Try doing a fresh install of the game."
,Zardrak,2011-10-13T18:57Z,My installation gets cancelled halfway and a console flashes. What is the problem?
,huldu,2011-10-13T20:17Z,Sound bug has nothing to do with the patch/release of the game itself. It's a coding bug that a few people are having. Just hoping they patch it up eventually.
,Kostisss,2011-10-16T04:11Z,my antivirus blocks the exe when i try to run it and deletes this...
,jamou,2011-10-16T17:54Z,"no matter what torrent i load of this game, everytime i get an virus called: Gen:Variant.Swizzor .2 Rated down. dont download, its virus."
,Zardrak,2011-10-16T18:24Z,The installation crasches halfway through and a console flashes. 
[T],alexisthebest,2011-10-16T20:47Z,"@jamou

THETA releases are always shown up as viruses. They're just false positives. Disable your AV when installing and downloading the game."
,Houds,2011-10-17T01:16Z,"I installed this and the v1.06 release. Everything is fine until i start up the game to the loading screen with the turning cogs, then the game just shuts down immediately after the load with no errors."
,Violent69,2011-10-25T06:08Z,"@Houds -- Same problem here.
