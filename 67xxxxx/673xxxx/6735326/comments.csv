,Brekemoff,2011-10-12T09:04Z,"This show is clearly not getting the backing from Discovery. Top ten episodes? 7-episode seasons? This series is on it's last leg, unfortunately, the competition/rivalry is a breath of fresh air to a very stagnant show."
,SignificantOther,2011-10-13T17:42Z,"Yeah, 'best of' shows are really lame. They're just cheap filler in a season, and no better than flashbacks like this one. Thanks for the up though, you're a legend! :o)"
