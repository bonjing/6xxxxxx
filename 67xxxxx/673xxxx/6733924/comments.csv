,Barkingspyder,2011-10-11T09:30Z,"A real PPV rip as I understand it means that the signal from one's cable provider is fed to digital recorder of some type and then uploaded.  That should result in something that looks much better than a cam but not quite as good as a DVD rip.  Pointing a camera at a TV playing a PPV movie is IMO still a cam and the only benefit is it's unlikely to have anyone walk in front of the camera.  

Any different on PPV rips.  I think I got it right."
