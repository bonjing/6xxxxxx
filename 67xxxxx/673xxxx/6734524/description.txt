Language arts skills help lay the foundation of all verbal learning.
So we teachers agree that students ability to comprehend and
communicate figures heavily in their success across the curriculum.
Engaging your language arts learners in a kinesthetic and creative way is
crucial. That is why Joanne, an art teacher, and I, a language arts teacher,
collaborated on this book. We believe that the easy to do activities in this
book will help you meet this challenge. In fact, weâ€™re excited by the progress
weâ€™ve already seen with students of all learning styles in reading and writing
skills ranging from poetry to punctuation.
Making art clearly benefits students on many levels. First, it gives them the
chance to learn creatively, literally having a hand in the process. Second,
artwork engages students by engaging their senses. The colors and design of a
well-devised project, the feel and even the smell of the materials, the
manipulation of these materials toward a tangible creation, and the inevitable
feedback of peers and parents all come together to reach students of all
learning styles and strengths. Finally, art making builds studentsâ€™ confidence
and self-esteem by offering them the freedom to execute their own ideas,
decisions, and evaluationsâ€”without the risk of being wrong. And perhaps
most important, it is fun!
