,Truther111,2011-10-11T21:35Z,"@ skat1140 & whoever else it may concern:  When your interest level in the pursuit of truth ever reaches above zero, you might start getting answers to questions that really matter in the event you ever start asking them.  Until then, mockery and insincere questions will only deservedly compound the depraved ignorance that stands in the way of your freedom.  May God's light shine upon your mind."

It was a long road let me tell you, but i am thankful that the lies could not continue to hide the everlasting truth which is the WORD! Godspeed & JAH BLess for his time is at hand! "
