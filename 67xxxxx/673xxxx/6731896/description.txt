In this darkly romantic ghost story, a woman (Academy Award Winner Mira Sorvino) travels to an isolated cabin where she finds herself stalked by an apparition (Shane West, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"A Walk To Remember\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") who has come to inhabit her space as his own. With the unexpected arrival of the woman\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s boyfriend (Golden Globe nominee Justin Kirk, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Weeds\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"), the dark spirit\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s haunting grows more obsessive. Soon the woman begins to exhibit weirdly irrational behavior as the thin line between sanity and possession begins to unravel. A stunning directorial debut from Tom Provost, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The Presence\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is grounded in terrific performances, beautiful cinematography, a lush musical score, and a Hitchcockian style that explores the idea of pure cinematic storytelling. Written by Flatland Pictures
