Recorded in november 2009 at 41 King Street music venue in Blackburn, Lancashire. Mixed and produced by Joe Fossard who handled MGB's first release "Touched By The Hand Of Nobby Bobson." The tracks were only ever aired once on the Punk & Disorderly radio show (Phoenix FM) and were never released due to the band line - up changing (Jak and Andy left to be replaced by Mark).
