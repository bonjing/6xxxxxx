    Navigate to D:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\orcs must die!\data\startup\ and create a text file called user.cfg
    Edit user.cfg and add options from the list below to change your settings:
        window
            This will force the game to run in Windowed Mode.  Currently we donâ€™t have a way to move the window around/reposition it.  We did this mainly as an option for people that want to run windowed mode but full screen.
        KeyboardLayout=""AZERTY""
        KeyboardLayout=â€QWERTYâ€
        KeyboardLayout=â€QWERTZâ€
            Use one of these to override the locale selection that the game is using to pick your keyboard layout.  Setting this will force the game to use the layout that you specify in user.cfg"
