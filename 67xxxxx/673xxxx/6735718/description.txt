Hayarigami is a detective adventure based on chilling urban legends. You can 
either investigate these cases through a scientific method or through an 
occultism method. These two paths lead you to different clues and different 
endings, so to learn the full story behind the often deadly cases, you need to 
ride through this ghost house roller coaster at least twice. And you have a 
total of four cases to crack to clear the game.

From chain mails that leads to murder, mysterious suicides and missing children, 
you, as a police officer have to put all your brain cells to work, connect the 
events together to discover the truth. Besides the three that you solve as a 
policeman, there is a bonus chapter where you need to find the culprit behind a 
series of foretold murders.
