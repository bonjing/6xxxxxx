,jonmobrien,2011-10-16T12:52Z,"As per the cover image and the mkv title - this is Rio. ie. This is Rio (2D).

I don't understand why people go to the effort of putting fake uploads up here. Why be a prick and pretend you've uplaoded a 3D film? Put this in the 2D section properly labelled and it is a great film in English and Romanian. I wondered as you did not list whether it was SBS or anaglyph and susptected given the cover art and mkv title, but I was happy to try it out as I'd be happy with Rio in 2D anyway although I'd rather a smaller 2D file than 4.33GB. So I downloaded this, and it is NOT 3D. 

Also, the file is corrupted in many places - stopping at several points, and only playable by re-starting it a few seconds in advance of where it stopped each time.

So avoid this torrent."
