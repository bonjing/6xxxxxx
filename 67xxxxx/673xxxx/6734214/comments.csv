,carrymeon,2011-10-11T08:10Z,Your Patch worked Like a charm...All products gets activated except nero Kwik Media. It asks for the serials...:((
,neil22768,2011-10-11T09:06Z,"@carrymeon

kwik media works perfect for me no serials asked for ive made slide shows with vidoes and movies never asked for a serial did you install it all offline?"
,geldenhuys,2011-10-11T10:53Z,Does not work for me also. Did install it offline. I even blocked Nero with my Kaspersky firewall. No luck.
,msgirish,2011-10-11T15:11Z,Perfect.Annoying patetent activation for Nero Recode dissappeared.Thanks.
,mj02x,2011-10-12T23:51Z,"Tyr3ll: I follwed instructicions to the letter.Installed pgrm, rebooted all offline, applied patch. Still get nag screen stating that Nero 11 detects unlicenced use of its software. What am I doing wrong? Thanks in advance."
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-10-13T01:06Z,"key has been blacklisted,may be...
Uninstall and retry !
install offline and reboot as still disconnected,
when installation start,unter following key provided here,install and finish all.
Apply patch and all must be ok now.
reconnect and test now,all functions to see if ok.
On vista/Win7 ,run the patch as administrator.
Despite that if it will still fail---> means key has been probably blacklisted so.
apply the patch at the end of the installation !
patch blocking server checker."
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-10-13T01:10Z,"use nero clean tool if needed.
Will see if i can find other serials.
Don't install other plugins serial !!!!
no need,just nero serial only as it is the HD Platinum version who have all apps."
,Tatletz,2011-10-13T09:13Z,Looks like we should wait for a proper keygen.
,geldenhuys,2011-10-13T10:56Z,I think if the key have been blocked it stores something on your pc. If you uninstall it and install it again the key is automatic in the program so it must be stored. If we can find a way to delete that key it will work. I have delete every Nero entre on pc and in registry and used a registry cleaner and the Nero cleaning tool but i can't get rid off the serial. Any ideas?
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-10-15T04:08Z,"try this new serial :

9X13-0289-HUX7-UT00-PH8L-HM80-A28H-CP39

should working fine this time ;)"
,geldenhuys,2011-10-15T14:45Z,"No serial does not work. Can't even add it, do not allow u to add it."
,auto14,2011-10-15T15:02Z,Very helpful indeed!!! But nero kwik media doesn't work for me too... Any solutions guys??? 
,Tatletz,2011-10-17T09:59Z,Do we really need nero kwik media? 
,mj02x,2011-10-19T06:36Z,"Serial is blacklisted. Ty3ll, can you pm me with a working serial if you find another? It appears our friends at Nero enjoy browsing the pirate bay too: :-)"
,mj02x,2011-10-19T06:47Z,Serial is Blacklisted. Can you pm if you find another working serial. Nero must have people monitoring posts to the PB!
,ajkclay,2011-10-24T15:36Z,"Ok, I rarely comment, but this patch works perfectly.

I've had all sorts of issues with server checks due to third party patent checks, especially with Recode - this fixed it.

I uninstalled and ran 4 registry cleans, 3 with Auslogics Registry Cleaner and one with Registry Mechanic, restarted and re-installed with internet off and followed the instructions below. 

Done and easy! 

Thanks to the U/L and creator"
,allanmartine,2011-10-24T18:03Z,do i need serial numba wen iv dwnloaded ths cn any1 tel me

,Arachne,2011-11-07T22:05Z,This worked wonders as well.  No problems here.  SEEDING!  *-)  
,KINGSLICK,2011-11-08T05:02Z,How do i patch it? 
,pirbay1958,2011-11-22T08:23Z,"SERIAL IS INVALID

Thanks to uploader for effort but does not work. The installer loads heaps of Windows (system) folders PRIOR to commencing Nero.The Nero installer asks for serial and returns invalid for both serial numbers tried (downloaded with ""patch"" and other displayed at Patch download page in comments).The install fails leaving you with uneccessary Windows junk installed. This was performed on fresh (now not so fresh) Win7 install and all offline. THE KEYS ARE NOT WORKING FOR INSTALL."
,pirbay1958,2011-11-22T13:22Z,"APOLOGIES,DISREGARD LAST POST

Serial Does work.I re-downloaded and now works (perhaps original dload got corrupted?)"
