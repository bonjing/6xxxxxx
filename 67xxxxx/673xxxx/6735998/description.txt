::Plot::
Gil (Owen Wilson), a successful and affable but distracted Hollywood screenwriter, and his fiancÃ©e, Inez (Rachel McAdams), are in Paris, vacationing with Inez's wealthy, conservative parents (Mimi Kennedy, Kurt Fuller). Gil is struggling to finish his first novel, which is about a man who works in a nostalgia shop, and Inez and her parents are critical and dismissive of Gil's stated desire to give up his lucrative Hollywood career and write a novel. They do not share his romantic view of Paris, do not appreciate the arts, and do not like the French, and while Gil is considering moving to the city for inspiration, Inez is intent on living in Malibu. By chance, they are joined by Inez's friend Paul (Michael Sheen), a pseudo-intellectual who speaks with great authority but little actual substance or accuracy on the history and art of the city. Inez idolizes him, but Gil, who is an ardent admirer of the Lost Generation, finds him insufferable.
