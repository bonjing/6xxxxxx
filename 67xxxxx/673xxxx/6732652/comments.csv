,Nash6989,2011-10-10T14:55Z,"its a VERY cheap parody of paranormal activity. i recommend doing what i did and just watch the best parts that are up on you tube. otherwise you going to waste about an hour of your life.. just tryin to help. but as i said. very cheap.. got maybe one laugh out of it, and i blame the weed for that one"
