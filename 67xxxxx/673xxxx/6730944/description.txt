These are assorted Crossgen odds and ends.
It contains:

Crossgen Illustrated is just art samples.
The sampler was sent to retailers and it contains the first few pages of each #1 comic (of the initial series).
The Primer was polybagged with Wizard #103 and it gives an overview of the Crossgen Universe, its planets and the main characters.
The Wizard Crossgen special edition are several articles on Crossgen as featured in the magazine Wizard.
