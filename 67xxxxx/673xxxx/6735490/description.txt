Ekarth's Timesaver Bulk Macros: Thumbnail generator,Bulk Auto-Renamer, Bulk Auto-File-Movers & MORE

Hi Friends, 
Using my limited knowledge of autohotkey scripting, I've created some tools which you might find handy

Bulk Movie screenshot makers (Must have for movie-uploders: Based on MTN technology)
Bulk File Mover crap Remover ( for download addicts to sort out finished downloads according to extentions)
Bulk File Renamer
Bulk Torrent Maker (GUI for on mktorrent commandline)

You'll need to download Autohotkey software to use these scripts. 
http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/OS-Enhancements/AutoHotkey.shtml
Everything is tested on XP SP3.

Here is the brief introduction of every Macro-script

Bulk movie screenshot maker
Drag-n-drop main folder and it'll create screenshots for all clips inside that folder

Again just drag and drop files or folders in bulk and it'll create torrent files for each of them.
Based on mktorrent program, Sometimes gives glitch though. But some of you good in coding please tweak it.

Bulk File Mover and Crap Remover (based on Teracopy)

You've 50 different folders, some have movies,some ebooks,some game-ISOs. Now manually sorting them out = WASTE of time 
You've 50 finished torrents, in 50 different folders, each has only one file that you want like a movie / pdf / rar / exe and 4 crappy .nfo,damenoid.txt,ahashare.txt,.url and crap like that. And You didnot have the time to 'deselect' each and every crappy nfo txt file before adding the .torrents.
How do you sort this out? Manually cut / copy-pasting every useful file in a different folder? that is WASTE OF TIME AND ENERGY.

So I've came up with a easy solution. Just drag and drop your main folder/directory, and give it parameters, it'll search all its sub-directories and copy/cut/delete the files according to the extentions.

--------
Bulk Photofile renamer (for those ATK, Met-ART sets)
Suppose there is a folder.
C:\My pictures\
It contains tons of subdirectories and each subdirectory contains 10-15 photos. Now you want to move these photos to one big folder for ease in browsing (or uploading). But then how to know which photo came from which subfolder? (in case u wanna identify the models later on!)
So You want those photos to be renamed as %name of the subdirectory%[0,1,2,3,4,5].
I've created an automated script so you can quickly do it.

--------
Multi Rename script 1.5c unicode
This one is created by a guy named Majkinetor. There two very time saving feature it has.
Please take the pain to read following information and you see.

1- Extracting file names for posting in nfo or Torrent description.
 
http://www.imagebam.com/image/7b92c1153448109

Suppose you've movie files like Hellboy.avi, Spiderman.avi, Harry Potter.avi
now when you upload them, you want to write the list in the torrent or warez post.
This software can just extract all the filenames from the folder and give you the text list so you don't have to type anything just copy paste.
Please see photo to understand what I'm saying

2. Bulk Autorename according to list

Suppose you've file with names 1,2,3,4 and so on.
You want the file1 to be renamed as spiderman,
file 2 as superman and 
file3 as spiderman. 
If you do this manually one by one, it'll take lot of time. Instead just type the list in a notepad, and drag and drop files in this program and it'll rename them accordingly. See photos to understand
