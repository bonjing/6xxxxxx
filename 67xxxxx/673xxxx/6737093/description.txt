couldnt find Gossip Girl Season 2 in HD on here, oror eztv, or anywhere else i go for tv.  finally googled and scrounged for a while and found this torrent from kat.ph(?) and thought i would index it on tpb.

its in x264 mkv and episode 17 works in VLC.  It also has over 5k seeds listed in uTorrent as im uploading, and i was getting it at around 350kbps.

never uploaded before but thought i would save other guilty pleasure seekers my hassle.  i found the transition to grainy low def for the beginning of season 2 greatly lessened my appreciation for this show..

hope it works for ya
