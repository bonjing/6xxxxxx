Experimental Hypno-Subliminal Mental Programming (2011)

This is an experimental project in hypno-subliminal audio programming "HYSAP" including several test samples: How you can hide a hypnosis file inside a harmless looking music file. I've been talking about this before several times. There are lots of subliminal messages on CDs and DVDs out there. In "The Simpsons" for example I've read they've hidden a subliminal file saying something like "join the army". Now many children watching this stuff have the unexplainable urge to join the army. Such methods being used by the illuminati are really criminal. Instead of merely talking about it, I thought it would be easier to just demonstrate how it's being done. This project shows the easiest way how to do it.

Basically there are two folders in this torrent: the input folder and the output folder. In the input folder you have three files:

A: hypnosis
B: pink noise
C: music

In the intermediary folder you have one file:

D: hypnosis masked by pink noise and reduced volume

The output folder contains one file only:

E: hypno-subliminal music - DANGER! PROLONGED EXPOSURE NOT RECOMMENDED!
