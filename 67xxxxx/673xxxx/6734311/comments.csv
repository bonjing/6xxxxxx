,bboy307,2011-10-10T18:54Z,HEY .BONE. CAN U UPLOAD A MOVIE CALLED VIDEO GIRL WITH MEAGAN GOOD... 
,bboy307,2011-10-10T18:55Z,CAN U UPLOAD A MOVIE CALLED VIDEO GIRL STARRING MEAGAN GOOD....
,dlarrym1111,2011-10-10T21:24Z,"@bboy307: Did you know commenting or in all capital letters is generally meanit to express that you are yelling or screaming those words?

#1) .BONE. is by far one the most respected uploaders and doesn't deserve to be screamed at, esp. with a request. If you screamed at me asking for a favor, why on earth would I honor that request?
#2) Are you incapable of being grateful? .BONE. already spends many many hours of his personal time and energy to bring to TPB the uploads you see already.
#3) The answer to 'when"" or ""can"" you upload this or that, is an retaged question in the first place. . . You already know the answer which is, when he gets a good copy of ""WHATEVER MOVIE"" then and ONLY then is when it will be posted. Do you know how many Members come to this site not to mention the Guests. If every uploader honored every request, they would have to abandon there own life to meet bring all these requests to TPB.
#4) LASTLY, Requests on this site are generally discourged due to the fact that if an uploader starts to honor say YOUR request (if it was for a movie that has been out a while or even years ago) That would set a presidense to honor EVERYONES request. It will bring nothing but chaos to this site. for example: Damn BONE, you uploaded ""BLAH BLAH BLAH movie"" for , why aren't you honoring my request. and then another would want the same and so on and so on and so on. . .  It is because the difficulty in honoring everyones requests (more then 5 million members and even more guests, with some days having more then half a million sign ons everyday!!!!) HOW in the hell can anyone handle that many requests. If one is honored then ALL will feel they too should have their requests honored also. 
In conclusion, FORGET YOUR STUPID REQUEST!!! 
.BONE. I am only trying to defend your position because I know you are busy as hell, this is the only reason I speak on your behalf. I am COMPLETELY a friend of TPB and yourself and all other respected uploaders. I send this info to ALL. Surly you can understand why people requesting will only make things worse. Yourself and many many other uploaders do MORE then enough already. take care and MEGA thanks for this upload. I like this kind of animation a lot. Of coarse the quality on A/V is great. Thanks again."

,bagpipegml,2011-10-10T22:10Z,Thanks!............Nice dvd rip........a must have on Blu-ray when released next week.....
[T],wowcabbage,2011-10-10T22:12Z,"You wasted your life typing all that in response to an idiot.

Many many thanks have been waiting for this."
,Zethar,2011-10-10T23:51Z," @dlarrym1111

You sir are a dick of epic proportions. The guy was only making a request for something he was having a hard time finding himself. And it wasn't even a request to YOU but some other guy on the interweb, who you then decided to speak for. Know your place and role friend...know your place. "
,arabin,2011-10-10T23:58Z,"@dlarrym1111 - well done. you stood up for a fellow up-loader whom you respect and would like to help however, you could have been a bit softer addressing bboy.

@ the_rest_who_hated_on_dlarrym1111
he is entitled to stand up for a friend if he so chooses. He made several valid pints and you have the right to disagree but, name calling you don't."

,THE_SK1TZ,2011-10-14T17:42Z,"Why do people keep giving the Video qaulity a 10?
Its obvious that it is not a 10. Its a 7 at best. For fuck sake, people just throw 10's around like its not a big deal. Why is there no HD upload to be found on TPB? The retail version is being released in 4 days. There should be a damn High res upload by now."
,Capian,2011-10-14T18:43Z,"@THE_SK1TZ: You rate accordingly to the video, so it's a 10 for a DVDRIP... God damn it..."
,naufragus,2011-10-14T23:01Z,"@skitz

i think people watch stuff on crappy laptops or their phones.  i agree that generally many of the ratings baffle me."

F*** Off, wanna be batman fan. Do you even know what year one is. It's one of the best Batman Graphic Novels made, and is also the source of Batman Begins. This is an adaptation made for it.
If you wanna watch batman being the big fan you are go watch batman & robin because that'll probably be your favorite movie of all time."
,nogoodziggezz,2011-10-19T17:19Z,"@matt612346: Yes. Maby a 10 year old would wanna watch this. Maby some adults as well. How the hell can that be you business? I have kids who would love this U stupied ****!

,joshernater9,2011-10-22T09:26Z,"@matt612346 Fucking faggot. I'm so tired of people saying that just because something is animated its automatically a kids show, Thats complete BS. Like a friend of mine says he's a big batman fan..Yet he says that the cartoons suck and that The Dark Knight is a better movie than any of the cartoons..This, My friend, Is utter shit...

Year one, Good movie, BTW :D"

10 out of 10 
perfect sound and perfect pic  "
,nightmears,2011-10-27T03:30Z,"@matt612346 , i believe that this story is done from frank millers comic from the same name. Its really not suited for kids, has a lot of violence in it. The art style is not really suited to the source material. Would have been better for the style of maybe the gotham knight (this is an awesome batman dvd) has the original batman voice from the animated series Kevin Conroy. You must have some interest in batman thats why you are here along with all of us, rather than abuse you like others have just thought i would let you know what its all about. 

A 9 
V 9 
M (imo) is 8 . 

Great if your a batman fan :)"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-28T02:46Z,"Quality is great. Bryan Cranston as Gordon is perfect. Not a fan of the OC kid for Bruce Wayne but...

Story from comics is great but first 15mins is pretty slow, after that it ratchets up quickly - Highly recommended."
