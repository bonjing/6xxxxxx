January 2006: About a year after Nasum called it the quits, drummer Anders Jakobson started looking for members for a new grinding band. After posting in his blog at nasum.com, Anders Bertilsson (Ruin) - vague acquaintance to Jakobson - offered to play the guitar in the band. At the same time Relentless's bass player Oskar PÃ¥lsson was looking for a session drummer for a possible solo demo. He asked Jakobson who informed him about the new grinding band plans and the two ideas were merged into one. The three members started to send riffs back and forth building up a small library of ideas. 

February 2006: The first rehearsal took place on the 2nd and a few songs were written from the library of riffs. The band continued to write songs and do rehearsals the following weeks. A decision to add a second guitar player was taken and the band announced for a forth member in Jakobson's blog. 

March 2006: AndrÃ© Alvinzi (Carnal Grief) joined the band as the second guitarist. As the fourth songwriter in the band, Alvinzi rapidly added the last piece to Coldworker's puzzle of sound, introducing some more technical riffs into the grinding death metal. 

April 2006: Early in the month the bands name - Coldworker - is announced and later in April Joel Fornbrant (ex-Phobos) joins the band on vocals. After trying Anders Bertilsson as the singer, Coldworker realised that is would be best for the band and the music to have a separate singer. As a five-piece the band continued to write and work on the songs. 

June 2006: Coldworker did it's first show together with Gadget and Radioskugga and then immediately started recording their first album "The Contaminated Void". The album was recorded by the band in their rehearsal room over three weeks, and it was later mixed by Dan SwanÃ¶ and finally mastered by Peter In De Betou (everything documented in a studiodiary. A deal was signed with Relapse Records. 

August - September 2006: Coldworker did their second and third shows awaiting the release of the album. 

November 2006: "The Contaminated Void" was released worldwide on vinyl and in Europe on CD. Right after the release Coldworker did 10 shows around Sweden and Denmark, most of them as part of the "Close-up Made Us Do It" tourpackage with Arch Enemy and Path of No Return. 

December 2006: Coldworker did yet two more shows in Sweden before the end of the year. 

January 2007: AndrÃ© Alvinzi was replaced by Daniel SchrÃ¶der (also in Ruin). 

February 2007: Coldworker performed at the Finnish Metal Expo in Helsinki. 

June 2007: Coldworker went on a two week European tour together with Misery Index and Dew-Scented and visited festivals such as Fury Fest and Summer Blast. After the tour Coldworker went into writing mode for the rest of the year working on the second album. 

December 2007 - January 2008: Coldworker recorded their second album "Rotting Paradise". The album was recorded at four different location. The drums were recorded in Soundlab Studios, the guitars at the home of Johan Berglund (This Haven), the bass at the home of Jakobson and the vocals at Coldworker studios. The album was then mixed and mastered by Dan SwanÃ¶ at Unisound. 15 songs were recorded, 12 ended up on the album, a 13th song - a coverversion of Sepultura's "Necromancer" - ended up on the Japanese version of the album, and two songs were saved for the future. 

May 2008: "Rotting Paradise" was released worldwide on vinyl and CD. 

October 2008 - After a few shows in Sweden and elsewhere to support the release of "Rotting Paradise", Coldworker went into Coldworker Studios to record two cover songs for two tribute albums, "Den mÃ¶rka tiden" by Nasum and "Crematorium" by Repulsion. The songs were just recorded at this point, not finished. 

January 2009 - Coldworker did a few Scandinavian shows supporting The Black Dahlia Murder and ended the month with a perculiar event in their hometown of Ã–rebro. During the afternoon the band performed some kind of clinic for students (age 11-18 aprox.) attending the after hours Kulturskolan, and had a regular show at night. Certainly something different for the band. 

April 2009 - The October 2009 recording was finished with re-recorded guitars and mixing by Johan Berglund. 

July - August 2009 - The first of the tributes, "Tribute to Repulsion" was releases in July, at this time only on vinyl, by FDA Rekotz. In August, the long awaited split-7" EP with Deathbound, recorded during the "Rotting Paradise" sessions, was released by Power-It-Up. 

October - December 2009 - In October Coldworker had a minitour with Remasculate in Sweden with Gadget showing up at one of the shows as well. In November the "Tribute to Nasum" was released on vinyl and CD by Power-It-Up and in December the CD-version of "Tribute to Repulsion" was released. 

May 2010 - Most of 2010 was spent in the rehearsal room writing new songs, but in May another different show was performed in Ã–rebro. Coldworker attended a free festival where a lot of different people came to enjoy - or hate - the full blasting death metal live in person. 

December 2010 - The recording of the third album begins...
