This is a great file uploader for your website with multiple files and a progress bar.

In the folder are the zipped up version directly from the vendor and the unzipped files which I have changed perameters of so you don't have to advertise their product on your site i.e http://www.yoursite.com/their_product/index.html

I also made changes to allow for 10 uploads at once and a bigger max_file_size, which I think I set to 10mb.

If you are going to use the changed version, there's no need to upload the zipped version to your server as well.
