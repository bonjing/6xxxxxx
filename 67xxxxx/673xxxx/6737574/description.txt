Information
------------------------------

Harvest Festivals are celebrated each May, the one month of rest between harvest and planting for the following year. The festivals are thanksgiving for a good harvest and in honor of the patron saint of the farmers. The most colorful celebrations are held in the towns of Lucban, Tayabas and Syriaya. In a country where the different dialects provide around 200 words for "rice", this resource plays an integral part in the decorations, like the kiping, which are multicolored rice wafers. In Bulacan province the Carabao (water buffalo) festival and the fertility rites conclude these intense and happy Harvest Festivals.
