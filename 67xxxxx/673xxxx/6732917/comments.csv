,redzinx,2011-10-14T00:51Z,This about 2 best friends who got no job and live in NY. They decided to start a new men's clothe brand. I enjoyed very much the first season. This one seems cool too. The problem of this show is the age that incides and the type of ppl. The tv show entourage is the same way. Incides in a range of age. It's from the same producer mark wahlberg
