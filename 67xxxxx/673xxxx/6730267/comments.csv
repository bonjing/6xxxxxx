,puppeteer666,2011-10-12T15:04Z,It's a solid torrent I've only uploaded a few things but all are real.
,iroll24,2011-10-23T06:05Z,"Thanks, this download was very slow. Took like 2 days, anyway, looks like its not being seeded well. I'm going to continue seeding this torrent along with discs 1 and 2 until I've matched my download. Sorry I have a limit but atleast everyone doesnt have to suffer from crappy speed. SEED PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Thanks puppeteer666, This download was very appreciated! I've been wanting to check out this epic game."
