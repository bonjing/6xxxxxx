I downloaded this torrent yesterday and now it is on 76.6% but I keep on getting e-mails from my ISP that filles I'm downloading is illegal and stuff about law and things that can be held against me, stuff like that. This isn't the first time I get ""Abuse Report's"" from my ISP, had like 8 last week and all my Torrentz I get on ""The PirateBay""
any help on this coz I'm getting tired of my ISP sending me this mails thanx."
