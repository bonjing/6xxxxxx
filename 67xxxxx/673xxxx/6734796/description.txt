Patience and tempers are stretched to the limits on the Bolivian Death Road day after day. Dave and Lisa deal with their malfunctioning truck, racing against the clock to make sure they can still deliver their load on time. Hugh and Rick battle both the international language barrier and muddy roads as tempers boil. Inexperience catches up to rookies Tim and Tino, where they'll have to second-guess their ability to drive the deadly, cliffside roads. And at the end of the day, two truckers, pushed to their limits, call it quits.
