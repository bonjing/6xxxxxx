[T],rlf-rls,2011-10-10T16:11Z,!!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS !!!
,cmoe,2011-10-12T00:18Z,"saving does not work, neither the video options or game can be saved due to ""corrupted save file"" or ""another users profile already existing"", which needs to be deleted - but is nowhere to be found on the computer. can somebody tell how to fix that?"
,cmoe,2011-10-12T14:53Z,"PROBLEM WITH SAVING GAME: Changing video options cannot be saved due to ""another user profile already existing"", saving the game doesnt work either due to ""corrupt save file found. please delete"". Even when making the folder for saves myself, using a downloaded savegame it doesnt work. this is a problem more people encountered, can you say something about this? and other people, can you save the game with this or another release?"
,AndyKiller7,2011-10-12T18:39Z,"The crack is good.Saving the game is working fine(with the version CLONE-DVD).I don't know why those guys are posting comments like:""ooo,it's not working for me,bla bla bla"" before they learn how to freakin' copy/paste something or simple things like that.THE CRACK IS WORKING WITH THE SAVE GAME JUST FINE."
,cmoe,2011-10-13T16:46Z,"Well, Andykiller and all that have it working just fine - i dont know either why everything but the saving of the game and video options does work for you but not for me. I did exactly as written. There is nothing you can do wrong - use installer, use serial 11111-1111-.... and then copy content of crack folder to the folder of installation binaries. Done. Game works. But INGAME saving doesnt work for me. Got it? I am no fucking fool, so pls try to help instead of antagonizing. Peeps with the crashing/missing file problem i agree, you guys need to re-download and/or install without aborting. Btw. the KaoS-Release has sound stuttering issues for me while the iso provided by extremezone works flawlessly (excluding saving for me as written above). Pls help with this issue!!!"
,AndyKiller7,2011-10-15T12:02Z,"hey cmoe
I used a Clone-DVD version,with the password XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX or something.Anyway only x's all the line.I used this crack.I think you know how to use it.And that's all.It's saving,working fine,no error."
,AndyKiller7,2011-10-15T12:12Z,"In the begining after the arena fight,you're entering in a hallway.I entered in the first bathroom and saved.Closed the game,restarted the pc,reentered in the game and voila.It's starting right from that bathroom.So I don't know what are you doing wrong or what's happening but it's working.I'm on windows 7 by the way.I don't know what else can I do to help you.Good luck."
,cmoe,2011-10-16T13:48Z,"Concerning Saving game problems: it was the windows user name. If you are logged in with a user that (when first created!) has/had special characters in it (oe,ue,ae or symbols), saving will simply not work. Capcom programming f*cked up big time.
Solution: Create a new windows user with only regular letters and play the game with no more problems."
