=============================
Naruto: The Path of the Ninja
=============================

Path of the Ninja is formulaic, repetitive, and barely more than a touched-up Game Boy Advance game, but it's not an awful choice if you're a hardcore Naruto fan.

The Good:
========

    Control six different Naruto characters  
    Lots of weapons and jutsu magic attacks to use  
    Rips events and conversations right out of the comics and TV show  
    Quest takes roughly 20 hours to finish.

The Bad:
=======

    Grinding levels can be boring because battles are repetitive  
    The quest doesn't take any turns unless you try to find secret scrolls  
    Pretty much looks and sounds like a Game Boy Advance game.

Enjoy and seed... :)
