,fredob1,2011-10-09T13:04Z,"Thanks man, I don't need HD so this is perfect."
,geoff777,2011-10-09T13:50Z,"Cheers for the .avi

Missed qualifying no avi's just mkv & ac3.

My netbook can't handle playback of huge HD files.

More .avi's please!!!

Thanks"
,Bali2011,2011-10-09T14:05Z,Thanks man...
,digimike50,2011-10-09T16:40Z,"Many thanks. May I join in by saying that the lower res suits me because of the appalling internet service here in Thailand. Your (wonderful) HD qualifying, took all night and most of the following day (today)! BUT - I do NOT want to sound ungrateful, because, believe me, that is not true - I really am [grateful]! Thanks a lot!"
,SerSpec-V,2011-10-09T19:40Z,"Thanks very much! The file size is great, I don't DL HD because of my download limit. Most of us in Canada have download limits set by our ISP's so unless you want to pay $60+ a month for higher limits we can't DL HD."
,SerSpec-V,2011-10-09T19:44Z,My DL speed is 400 so there are a good amount of seeders.
,ftpv014,2011-10-09T22:47Z,Same here -- thanks for the medium size recode!
,soryu,2011-10-10T00:02Z,thanx
,Mesohappy,2011-10-10T05:27Z,"Cad40 did you get the forum? Hmmm perhaps.

,yokou,2011-10-10T09:58Z,thanks!
,ashnraf,2011-10-11T05:26Z,Thanks!!
,twatsnapper,2011-10-11T07:58Z,"Hey keep up the great work, these AVI file sizes are just right"
,S_A_U_S,2011-10-11T12:41Z,"Hey, did you use any special videoconversion? This file won't play correctly on a Popcorn-Hour A110. 

It works fine on VLC, but my A110 normally plays everything fine. 

Thank you for your effort, really appreciate it for those without BBC."
