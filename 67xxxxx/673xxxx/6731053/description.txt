Formula 1: The Japanese Grand Prix - Live
Jake Humphrey presents coverage of the 15th round of the season from the Suzuka Circuit (Start-time 7.00am). Sebastian Vettel needs just one point to be confirmed as champion for the second year in succession. The Red Bull team dominated here last year, with Vettel and Mark Webber qualifying in first and second respectively, and then finishing in those positions following a race which seven drivers failed to complete. With commentary by Martin Brundle and David Coulthard, and analysis by Eddie Jordan
