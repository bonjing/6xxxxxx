Finally, Evan Wofford (born May 1, 1989) Finally released his first official CD. For those of you who have his previous work, or who know him personally, he started when he was 12 scribbling poems in his notebook. Now he's here. And the music is free.
Take this CD, Copy it, burn it, give it to your friends, and spread to to anyone with a dream, because in the end, thats all I'm doing... dreaming.
