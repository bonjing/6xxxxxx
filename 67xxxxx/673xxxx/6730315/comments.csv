It truly is 4all, for all who need it.

And I don't mean want, I mean need.

If I had the $ and the 70"" flatscreen, I'd damn sure be ordering it on PPV (the main PPV card).

But, I'm flat broke, fucked up and crippled and can't earn shit, so I DL it for free.  Other people pay for my internet BTW, but all who DL this I'm sure would pay if they had the means.  (After all, who wants to wait till the next day for -30 fps?  It's a fucked up economy.) 

Thanks for enriching my life and soul with your work."
