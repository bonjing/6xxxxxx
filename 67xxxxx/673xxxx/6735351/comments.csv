,Phntzm79,2011-12-07T01:10Z,Check out my latest Lana Del Rey-Born To Die Singles Torrent from her upcoming 2012 album!Phantazm79. 
,Phntzm79,2012-01-02T21:21Z,"Keep up the great seeding! More than 400000 people have downloaded my LDR files! She isn't really an indie artist but has been labeled one because of the backlash against her by some really ugly female ""indie"" musicians because she became so popular so quickly. They are jealous of her because she is so beautiful, hot and popular after she released Video Games on youtube!.Peace, Phantazm79 "
,Son-of-Odin,2012-03-15T02:14Z,"Hi Phntzm79, you are obviously very big Lana's fan.
I am becoming one fast.
Can you PLEASE put up a torrent with FLAC versions of her acoustic and live songs?
Especially this single.
Thanks in advance, man"
