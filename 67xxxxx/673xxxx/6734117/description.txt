Storyline:

Greg Powell is a disturbed ex-con who recruits Jimmy Smith (aka Jimmy Youngblood), a petty thief, as his partner in crime.
Powell panics one night when the two of them are pulled over by a pair of cops for broken brake-lights. Powell decides to 
kidnap the cops and Smith, as always, reluctantly goes along with Powell's crazy scheme. The group drives out to a 
deserted onion field in Bakersfield, California and one officer is shot while the other escapes. The remainder of the 
film explores the nature of the American justice system, as well as the devastating psychological effects of this event 
and the trial on the surviving officer.

*I don't take requests because I don't have time and everyone will fill the comment section with them instead of commenting about quality and other tehnical specs of the movies or say thanks.Thank you for understanding!
*For best performance I suggest you use KMPlayer(find it with google) for playback
*These movies were made especially for PC and they don't play on a PS3.If you want to re-encode for PS3 or test for other devices be my guests.
*I'll ask everybody to stop with the "it doesn't work","it's out of sync" comments because I tested the movies before I uploaded them and they work fine.
