,killa_is_here,2011-10-13T06:03Z,no you must put it in the internal drive or if you have an external drive let xbox format the 16gigs and put it there. otherwise it must be in the internal hard drive. and if you using xexmenu its HDD1/content/0000000000000000/4D530910/00000002
,b10wme,2011-10-13T10:25Z,i have uploaded the file to free site but it wont post link on here
