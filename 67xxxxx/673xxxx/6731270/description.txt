Roland Voss, aka Lemongrass, moved through several musical phases before hitting his stride as a drum n bass/downtempo producer in the late 90s. The German-born Voss began taking drum lessons in 1974, and played with a variety of funk and jazz ensembles over the rest of the decade. When the 80s arrived, Voss became interested in new wave, and from there began experimenting with electronic means of sound production.
