Excellent quality, especially for the size. 

One thing, some of the embedded text (the titles, the book, the writing in the book) was in French when it wasn't supposed to me. OK for those of us who have French as a second language but just an FYI.

As for the film, I have never ever ever cried so much during a film. Make sure you have tissues nearby when you watch."
