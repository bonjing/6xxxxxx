Here is another "All-in-one" torrent for you multi-players out there.  As usual this one was born of me just being plain angry that I had to go through so much crap just to play multi-players with my friends (drag this, copy that, replace all this).

=====================================================================================

As usual I try to make this as simple as possible.  All you have to do is put the folder in your program files and then follow my easy steps.

=====================================================================================

1.  Once you have put the folder in your program files open up the "Steam" folder in the dead island folder.

2.  Run the program called "Smart Steam"

3.  Login with your steam account (just make one if you don't have one)

4.  Once logged in add the "deadislandgame.exe" under a non-steam game

5.  Last and best of all just hit play.

=====================================================================================

Tips so no one goes freaking out that it doesn't work.  You have to set the in game options to LAN to play on LAN, lol (people have missed that before).  And remember in the game you are unable to play with friends until you have got to Chapter 1 (aka like 5 mins into the game).

=====================================================================================

Any problems or concerns just leave a comment.  Other wise have fun and remember to seed and hit that +1 button at the top.  :D
