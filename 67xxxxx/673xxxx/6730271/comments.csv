,AllHailTails,2011-10-13T07:46Z,Does this work? Bit of a noob at downloading stuff like this so just wanna be sure :)
,ccmaster,2011-10-16T18:25Z,So I followed the instructions and when I click play nothing happens.  
,Frozeer,2011-10-20T00:32Z,"Is your computer able to run this game?

If it is, I would just imagen that somewhere along the way a file got droped or so, I would say try to redownload it, and I will make sure that all the seeds have the right files intact.

Sorry for any inconvinice, but these things happen sometimes lol

You don't even want to know all the sh*t I did fixing my Sc2 torrent haha"
