Virtual University of Pakistan
CS101 - Introduction to Computing
All Course Materials
Course Instructor: Altaf H. Khan

Although all these lectures are available on youtube, and the other material is available on many other Virtual University related websites, it is very scattered...
This is my attempt to offer this material in one convenient package.

WARNING-------------------------------
Large chunks of the lectures are in urdu! Do not download if u don't understand urdu.
