Movie Review 

After his â€˜Parthipan Kanavuâ€™ director Karu. Palaniappan has again teamed up with actor Srikanth but this time it is not again the family drama, â€˜Sathurangamâ€™ is an action thriller, to prove that the director can test his mettle successfully with any genre of movie making. 
â€˜Sathurangamâ€™ was completed long back; to be exact it was 2004, and was lying in the cans for years due to release problems. And, the movie is released now. The time of release definitely has an impact on the result of the film at the box-office. So, whatâ€™s the thrill in the game of â€˜Sathurangamâ€™ for us? 
Thirupathysamy (Srikanth) is an honest investigative journalist who exposes the wrong doers in the society with the might of his pen. He plans his arrest purposefully to get into a prison and exposes the dark life inside the jail and the corrupt officers and the politicians. In the game, he instruments the dismissal of the Jail Superintendent and the Minister concerned. 
The wrongdoers who are affected by the writings of this honest journalist take on a task to revenge their enemy No. 1, and Thirupathysamy falls prey for their acts. 
Indhu (Sonia Agarwal), who is the love interest of Thirupathysamy, is kidnapped and Thirupathysamy goes on a mission in hunting down the criminals in the society. Whether the honest journalist succeed in crushing down the criminals, his love interest is saved and what happened to his job, all is answered in the climax of the movie and for those thrilling moments you have to go to the theatres to watch it on the Silverscreen! 
The cast â€“ Srikanth as an investigative journalist fits the bill. His looks, body language and mannerisms are perfect and he scores in his acting too. He emotes well in all the parts and does his best in romance and, surprisingly, action too! Thanks to the director for chiseling the character of Srikanth and the efforts he has put in bringing out the best from the actor. 
Sonia Agarwal looks very young and pretty. She does her role with an understanding. â€˜Pithamaganâ€™ Mahadevan as the main villain impresses us with his acting skills. Bose Venkat, Manivannan and Saranya have done their part well. 
The experience that Karu. Palaniappan had as a journalist before entering cinema has come in handy in scripting scenes and in the characterization of the protagonist. Srikanthâ€™s character as a journalist has been etched well by the director. Karu. Palaniappan, with his script and directorial skills, has made his mark again with â€˜Sathurangamâ€™, but due to the late release all the efforts have gone waste. 
Music by Vidyasagar is good in the background score. It supports the action sequences. Songs do get your attention but fail to stay on your mind! And, the songs sure interrupt the flow of the film. 
Camera work of Diwakar is superb, a big strength to the movie. He excels with his different angles and lenses. 
Suresh Urs editing plays a major role in the fast pace of the film. A commendable work by him, lest the film could have been a big drag! Rajeevanâ€™s art work also speaks. 
â€˜Sathurangamâ€™ is a game of wits that is a big battle between the good and the evil. The game interests you with its speedy and the intellectual moves with those twists and turns. 
If it had released during the time it was completed (2004) you would have enjoyed many new ideas in the film, but as the Lady Luck did not favour, the film saw a release only now and all those novel concepts in scenes have gone outdated that you have already seen it in films that released after 2004. It may be mentioned that â€˜Sathurangamâ€™ could have shown all those thrills of Jiiva starrer K V Anandâ€™s â€˜Koâ€™ long back! 
Still, you can take your seat to watch the game of â€˜Sathurangamâ€™, and you may end up in thinking of playing the game yourself! Thatâ€™s the power of the script and characterization that the film contains in it. 
Verdict: â€˜Sathurangamâ€™ wins you!
