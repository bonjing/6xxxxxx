[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-12T20:35Z,"That was MUCH better than #1 - I like that they've reinvested in Damien's past and Darkness - esp without Dick to keep him in check. 


So, I somehow missed when Damien FIRST appeared - He was just suddenly there as robin and Bruce had died - What series/issues are good for his origin and such?"
,plattekak,2011-10-12T21:01Z,"son of the demon (1987) he's mentioned in there but if you want to see his first appearance you need to check out batman # 655 (Batman and son, first comic on the damian arc)"
,shamelesspunk247,2011-10-12T21:21Z,"Hey MrDowntown your looking for Batman and Son by Grant Morrison.You'll find it in this torrent

[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-13T04:30Z,"Thank you to both - somehow I missed it, I knew his (general) story because they say it in every comic he's in - but missed it :)"
