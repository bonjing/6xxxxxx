Thank you for the comment.

Initially, i failed to see the usefulness of this until i tried it and found that it contains many useful tweaks not available through Windows; especially the Context Menu tweaks, which i like to disable all the ones i don't use to speed up browsing and not to mention if you have too many it can cause Explorer to crash.

F.Y.I
I did not enforce ""CRC Check"" on the launcher which means it can be re-used for future updates: just extract the installer with 7-Zip, and paste over the files in ""App"" folder. The only time it wont work is if they change up the algorithm for the serial at which point i'll post a new launcher... but that's very rare."
