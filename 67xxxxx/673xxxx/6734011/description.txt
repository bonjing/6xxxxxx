::Plot::
The movie starts with typical hostel in Delhi University, where street-smart Bittoo Sharma (Ranveer Singh) collects money from everyone in the group to gate-crash into a wedding for tasty food. While standing in the queue in the food counter, Shruti Kakkar (Anushka Sharma) who assists the wedding coordinator suspects that he is neither from the groom or bride's side. He is successful in convincing her that he has a right to be at the wedding by calling his friend who is the videographer for the wedding. After watching her dance at the wedding, Bittoo likes Shruti and makes a video of her during the sangeet dance routine. Later he calls Shruti's employer and while pretending to be the groom's uncle, gets her full name and college. After finding this information, he gets on university bus while she is in it and tries to give her the DVD to impress her. She finally accepts it and tells him of her dream of opening a wedding planning company. Bittoo makes fun of her and she gets angry with him. When Bittoo's father comes to take him back to his village so they can plow the fields together, Bittoo refuses and lies to his dad that he and Shruti are going into business together. He goes to Shruti with this idea and she refuses but after seeing his persistence, agrees. They name the company "Shaadi Mubarak". Together, their enterprise is a success with the work equally split between the two.
