,orangenod18,2011-10-09T13:09Z,Can we upgrade traps and the 4th Level is not bright now with this release?
,Talehon,2011-10-09T16:07Z,"Downloaded relatively quickly, installed without issue, and the game runs great.

On level 5 now, no issues thusfar. Upgrades work, no visual problems.

Only complaint, is a lack of windowed mode as far as I can tell. Very fun game though."

On the first level i see only my crossbow, and the tie of the warmage, and sometimes those orc thingies, but only their shoulder near to the floor(the warmage's pieces are on the floor too). I can't move and i can't even unleash the horde,because sometimes it crashes when i press G and they break the gates. I tried the ""missing textures"" too, but it didn't work. I haven't see any problem like this, so somebody help me if could!"

havend played the game jet just started to download but what i think is the problem is that you should run it as admin 
-right klick on the launcher
-pres preferences 
-go to compatibility and then click on the box with run as admin

hope it works when you do this sometimes it works for me iff got problem 

and extreme many thx for this upload!!!!

,Kawajiii,2011-10-17T01:59Z,"For all non-english users here is the solution to lvl gateway crash and orcs spawning behind door.

Change your system settings.

Control Panel -> Region and Language -> Administrative -> Change system local -> English(United States), then reboot your computer, done.

Game will no longer crash on level GATEWAY; Orcs will break through the door on level THE BALCONY; Orcs will not spawn at wrong position on level THE BRIDGE.

Note your non-unicode softwares may not show your region characters properly.

These bugs are probably caused by wrong character encoding of some .onslaught files in datademo.zip.

Perhaps if you actually bothered to read the description completely, you would notice the following line:

""Uploader note: Install and play but from my experience it will be recognized as false positive virus,
disable your a/v or add executable on blocking list""

However, seeing as you're prime inbred material that enjoys a good bout of having your asshole relentlessly and violently penetrated by all male members in your immediate and extended family, you're condemned from the get-go to not understand that some cracked programs function on an algorithm that is very similar to viruses.  This makes the program(s) trigger a false alarm on many antivirus platforms.

Like I said, you and half-a-fucking million other worthless little child-touching decrepit testicle-fondlers won't ever understand this, so don't even bother to download any pirated material.  You don't deserve it, because you're just plain too fucking stupid to derive the answers that stare you straight in the goddamned face.

I can't nerd rage enough about this, seriously sick of you slobbering retards who refuse to make any effort to read anything and just expect it all to be served up on a silver platter with the click of a button.

Trust extremezone or don't.  If the latter option is the case, go find some moving headlights to make out with and hopefully a mangy street mutt will get some hip exorcise on the resulting corpse.

So, to summarize for this dick-hat propagator of faggotry ""zorenzo"" and all others like him:  Try reading more carefully or use your google skills to answer your questions.

This message could have been worded much more 'pleasantly', but that takes all the fun out of expunging some serious pent-up nerd rage on people who deserve it.

Oh, and thank you kindly for the upload, extremezone."
