Yes One, all originals, a matter of searching and finding. Yes i have some acoustic versions. Beck :) Modern Guilt and Everything but the Girl are already in the Five times series.

Besides Aaliya, Noah, Rob Thomas and Prefab Sprout (all excelent), I will include the acoustic version of Alanis Morissette (Jagged Little Pill). Others may follow.

Isnt it time to seed some of your perfect (sounding) records?

Enjoy and share
