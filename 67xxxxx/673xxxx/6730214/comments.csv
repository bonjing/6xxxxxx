,blackxino,2011-12-26T01:12Z,"@jaxx0r
seriously thanks man!


I will advise EVERYONE to ditch this piece of shit blueosleli...it is fucking shit!


they are ripp offs.
I bought a mini tiny bluetooth device, meant to be the smallest. I actually installed the software that came with the hardware which is bluesoleil and later the software is telling me i'm using an illegal copy and I have to pay for a new one to use full service.

what madness is this!? something that I paid for is telling me i'm using an illegal copy.


For a long time I've been searching for a way to crack that shit but can't. I gave up. Thanks for Jax00r for the Toshiba version which runs so much BETTER, EASIER AND SMOOTHER!


Man do you know how fucking hard it is to connect my bluetooth rphasdoy headphone with the shitty bluesoeil bluetooth? fucking annoying.

with toshiba, one connect and it's working brillant and perfect.


One thing I would give the makers of Bluesoelil, IVT. Their software is hard to crack man, kudos to them for that. now they can go fuck themselves and their moms!



save yourself and download this:

,devouringone3,2012-01-28T02:12Z,"Blackxino that torrent you gave us the link to, it couldn't recognize by Dell laptop's Broadcomm bluetooth chip. I was not able to install it because of that."
,blackxino,2012-02-20T16:58Z,"@devouringone3 

hmmm..try downloading Broadcomm software instead.

yo you need to Unistall any bluetooth software you have! Then install Toshiba's version.

I tried to use Broadcomm's sofwtare but it didn't work with mine."
