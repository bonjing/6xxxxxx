Publisher's Summary
'Here! Look here, for this haggard man who shuffles along this deserted road, his soul as bare and barren as the moors around him, his tears cutting through his heart like the road slices this open plain. His name is Covell. Covell the Wandering one. Let us fly toward him on the wings of a crow, and circle above him, looking down at his ragged coat, his tattered hat, his worn old boots and bundle, then let us swoop down in to his brain and listen to the wretchâ€™s thoughts! His voice is a low growl, like the distant rumble of thunderâ€¦.'
