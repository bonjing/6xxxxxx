Well, folks, we have here a nice 4CD set offering from CMAA 2011
almost all included mp3s in this folder are 320k with a couple of 
exceptions such as the "Live - Elvis I Cant stop loving you" which weighs
in around 256k instead.

Great Bonus tracks in 320k - Dean Martin doing "A Room full of Roses"
and Dear Ms. Leann Rimes with "'leavin on your mind" - supreme!

Heres the rest of the lineup - my favourite is below bein
Blue with Leann Rimes of course - then there's Marie Osmond 
with "meet me in Montana" - anything you say too, luv!!

Ciao!
