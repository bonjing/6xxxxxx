Speaking of which, I found a set of Nadia-Firefly done by a website called paintoy.com... they were very sad. Why would such a lovely lady subject herself to that?? I could post them, but they are NOT erotic at ALL."

I got away from them partly because many of their new models are NOT attractive, and the plumper content seemed to be a bit more popular.  I'm about to post some stuff from gallercarre.com  ...  also artsy.  Hope you like it."
