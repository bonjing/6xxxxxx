Kinda dificult the british one, but I cant understand The Misadventures of Sheriff Lobo not on the radar


Thx anyway. Always great torrents with eztv."
,Allinuse,2011-10-11T03:58Z,In before tenks
,sarsapil,2011-10-11T05:34Z,What's going on? No episode 2? I don't plan to even start watching this if episode 2 will remain missing...
,adamdaly,2011-10-11T05:59Z,"episode 2 is apart of episode 1,   ep 1 is 1 hour long :)"
,asdf234,2011-10-11T06:08Z,sarsapil ... I would have thought that it was kind of obvious that the premier was a 2 episodes as it's twice the size/length of a regular episode.
,tiaprae,2011-10-11T06:18Z,"sarsapil - The series premier was 2 hours long and is considered episode 1 & 2 (if you look closely at most of the downloads available they're written that way).  This is ""technically"" the 3rd episode but because of the double episode it's the 4th.  Do some research and quit whining."
,punk333,2011-10-11T07:06Z,yeh saraspll you only have to find 3 episodes (including this one) to be caught up
,sarsapil,2011-10-11T07:37Z,"Thanks, fellas, now I understand. I caught glimpses as I tested the episodes I downloaded, I love SF but I'm one of those cursed with love for SERIOUS SF like Blade Runner, Solaris, even the classic Forbidden Planet, Soylent Green, etc., but this one seems to be soapy and full of romance, quarrels and irrelevant stuff, sort of light entertainment for nowadays public who don't want to complicate themselves too much with THINKING... "
,wendun,2011-10-11T07:41Z,"hunterD1974, doubt if you'll find a torrent for the Guardians but the complete series is available on dvd at Amazon and Networkdvd. Cost is around £26."
,FMyLife0,2011-10-11T07:49Z,"HORSESHIT SHOW, TOTAL WASTE OF BYTES. ONLY FOR SMALL CHILDREN WHO LIKE DINOSAURS."
,CaPolarBear,2011-10-11T08:00Z,"Ahh, sarsapil... you mean ""too much thinking"", like figuring out how many episodes of a show there are if the first one was a double episode?

My irony meter just exploded."
,tttgroup,2011-10-11T09:23Z,A great Serial ...Thanks for the upload !!
,amvick143,2011-10-11T10:02Z,"FMyLife0 - Completely agree with you. Steven Spielberg being one of the Executive Producers, I was expecting much more that the f**king family drama and pathetic CGI.

The best show currently is HOMELAND. Absolutely edge-of-seat. Superbly done"
,TheSageM,2011-10-11T11:08Z,i love you EZTV!
,brutal_product,2011-10-11T11:30Z,+1
,Lideborn,2011-10-11T12:23Z,this is not episode 4 according to IMDB infact the plot most be episode 3
,pow.r.pop,2011-10-11T13:11Z,"This show SUCKS !

They are trying to have an Avatar vibe and it's stupid.

The characters are ridiculous and I want to see them all die in the mouth of a T. Rex 

That's the only way I'll like it.


And you KNOW that boys girlfriend is going to come through the gate and he will have to choose between her and this new girl.

Talk about shitty predictable writing !

Contrived ...thats the word 

Anyone actually liking this dribble?"
,Allinuse,2011-10-11T14:21Z,"Should be an easy choice, the new girl is 10x hotter."
,hunterD1974,2011-10-11T15:22Z,"Thanks, wendun... But if I wanted, or at least could, spend money on that I wouldnt be using TPB, dont you think so?"
,joakal,2011-10-11T16:17Z,"hey, if you don't like it, dont download it. Right? 

EZTV, you rock. "
,i_steal_media_hohoho,2011-10-11T17:11Z,"Thanks eztv. Your work is always appreciated, you're a frickin star!"
,sarsapil,2011-10-11T17:51Z,"CaPolarBear

I guess it all boils down to 'different strokes for different folks', but I wish some producers would once in a while surprise us with something more meaningful and thought-provoking. 

I thank anyway eztv for his hard work, if this show stinks it's not his fault."
,ssandy,2011-10-11T18:31Z,"hunterD1974 - ""The Guardians"" is available here - http://www.thebox.bz/details.php?id=131885 - OK, so its a private torrent site, but hey, you asked!"
,hunterD1974,2011-10-11T20:46Z,ssandy... Thank you... I guess.

I just downloaded Homeland 1 and 2, testing at the end of 2 there is the bastard traitor starting to chant some muslim nonsense, it gave me the creeps, he's surely up to no good, they should soot him on sight before he blows up something and someone."
,the-loft,2011-10-11T21:10Z,Thanks for uploading this series. Subtitles can be found here: http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-eng/idmovie-71017
,dr.byte,2011-10-11T21:37Z,"FML! Downloaded all the available episodes before watching it. worst sucky show out there! Bad actors and ""special"" effects made on PowerPoint:("
,vayzeria,2011-10-11T23:53Z,"Sarsapil  no worries.. some UL´s got it all wrong.. E01 is acctually, a part 1 and part 2. Then followed by E02 ...so it´s now E03 up and running.... messy huh?"
,davidvb,2011-10-12T04:50Z,tenks
,greest,2011-10-13T00:28Z,traitors wife is only credited for 3 episodes in homeland. my guess he gets shot next week :p s'all good.
,deadzio,2011-10-13T02:48Z,i have no idea what u talking about. this double episode... :P when i seen it on SKY it was ep 1 and ep 2 then i got ep 3 from tpb and now im geting 4th ...so maybe in us tv it's kinda different but not according to SKY ;]
,MaGicbush,2011-10-13T03:53Z,"Ignore the 3 haters out of the 20K + that have downloaded and liked the show, I generally don't ever comment if I like a show as do many others. Great show and I hope if actually ends, compared to other great shows never ending on scyfy.. about to give up on TV shows altogether if they don't get their shit together at least on one show."
,amvick143,2011-10-13T11:08Z,"SARSAPIL

Homeland is one of those shows which cannot be predicted. Thanks to Howard Gordon and Alex. As for TerraNova, well, complete waste of money and time. Predictable to the T. Dont waste your time.

,unRheal,2011-11-01T05:43Z,"@deadzio you are exactly right - as toneloc78 over on eztv's S01E05 720p said:
The problem seems to be that Fox and IMDB are labeling Genesis as episode 1, while Sky1 is separating it into part 1 and part 2.

So arguing about it won't help if yer both right, depending on what station you watch. Maybe people should start including the episode TITLE too? ;)"
,frantheman7,2011-12-21T04:46Z,How about Terra.Nova.S01E02
,zackbaker,2011-12-25T01:23Z,thanx v-10 A-10
,computerbits,2012-01-11T01:13Z,Stop moaning about series being canceled as its your fault for stealing the shows. GO BUY THE DVD 
,ZOMBIE91,2012-01-11T20:22Z,:D Thanks eztv! The episode is great!!!
