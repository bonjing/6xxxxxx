The team are called in to investigate the death of prominent human rights lawyer 
Richard Warner. He died in a fire at his home but it is not clear if the fire was 
set deliberately, so the team analyse the severely burned body without knowing the 
cause of the fire.

Warner had recently been visited by one of his old clients - Joseph Marial, an 
asylum seeker from Sudan, who had been deported a year earlier after he was found 
guilty of assault. Warner defended him, but was unable to get him acquitted. 
Warners son, Nick, is convinced that Joseph must be responsible, but there appears 
to be no proof.

In a race against time, Oggy, Mike and the team reconstruct the fire in their lab 
to try and establish more information about the fire that killed Warner. Their 
findings bring fresh evidence to light.
