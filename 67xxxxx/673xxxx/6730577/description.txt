   'Rascals' is a comedy about the joys of   
   conning where Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgn  
   play two cool competing conmen trying to  
   out-scheme each other in consistently     
   amusing and surprising setups.            
   But when both fall for the same girl ,    
   the competition reaches an all new level  
   as both men constantly attempt to outwit  
   each other to win over the surprisingly   
   elusive Kangana!Since much of the comedy  
   involves people taking advantage of one   
   another, having everything put forward in 
   ]such a gossamer manner that 'Rascals'    
   becomes an enjoyable journey throughout   
   with an interesting twist at the end!
