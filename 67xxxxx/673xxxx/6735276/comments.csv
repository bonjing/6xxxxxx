,dumas1000,2011-10-11T21:48Z,"As much as it sucked that it took me around a week to download BB Rage, you have to realize that BB repacks. They don't rip. I'd rather take the hit of a few extra gigs then to download a Kaos file with down-sized video that has been compressed/re-encoded. And it ain't easy. I'm in the same boat with downloads as probably everyone here. Often times I get only 40-50 kb/s on heavily leeches files. So yeah, 11+ Gib of BB Rage took me quite a while. From what I've seen though, I'm not sure Rage contains that much video. It's remarkably similar to Borderlands."

,cmoe,2011-10-12T14:52Z,"Tried downloading this one instead of the release by extremezone. Same thing - changing video options cannot be saved due to ""another user profile already existing"", saving the game doesnt work either due to ""corrupt save file found. please delete"". Even when making the folder for saves myself, using a downloaded savegame it doesnt work. this is a problem more people encountered, can you say something about this? and other people, can you save the game with this or another release?"

,genocide79,2011-10-13T07:40Z,"the game exe keeps crashing to desktop after 5 minutes,needs a  update to  correct this  bug."
,genocide79,2011-10-13T08:03Z,"I am also at the start of the game level but it crashes to desktop  when tj is talking to someone else and you have to take pictures of them ,is there going to be a update to fix this problem as its really annoying."
,opaleg,2011-10-13T09:31Z,I can confirm genocide79's problem. I think it's realted to getting enough PP to level up. I am pretty sure it's because of the rip or whatever this is. Not the game itself.. but how this group packaged it.
,genocide79,2011-10-13T13:03Z,"ganusk dont leave us hanging,we need a update patch from you to fix the errors of the rip,I and others want to be able to play the game."
,vishesh24,2011-10-13T13:42Z,"@xplor3r: thank u ! but it is very slow. i mean less seeders. anyway m  downloading it.

@vincento94 : FUCK OFF

@BTLW: if u have downloaded it then STFU and seed it. otherwise don't troll around here..."
,vishesh24,2011-10-13T13:45Z,what about RAGE?
,genocide79,2011-10-13T16:03Z,"2 errors when unpacking 
CRC failed in Audio arc File is broken
data in .rsc_1 file is broken 

may be be cause of the crashes in game as files are damaged or missing in rip."
,Darkoil,2011-10-13T16:34Z,"I can't seem to save in sandbox mode, does anyone else have this problem? Everything else works fine though."
,Darkoil,2011-10-13T16:54Z,"Don't listen to what i just said, im just a big idiot. Thanks its all good now."
,cmoe,2011-10-13T17:48Z,what was your solution to being able to save? or was it a different problem than the game saying your save files are corrupt and that you need to delete them (although there are no such files on your computer at all)?
,Cyrez60659,2011-10-13T18:51Z,"Okay, here is my feedback:

I can save totally fine, I can change video settings totally fine. Game is good.

I did experience the crash when you first have to take photos of TK, so I reloaded and simply didn't take any photos at that point. Game continued just fine afterwards.

Some of the intro cutscenes also don't seem to play but they did the 2nd time I tried. Really weird but not that annoying tbh.

Now I'm in the mall and everything plays ok.

Thanx Kaos, + 1"
,cmoe,2011-10-13T20:53Z,"can you pls check if the install/game made a folder under ""users//My Games/Save/Dead Rising 2"" or something similar? Because i noticed that I dont have any folder where savegames could be located, still the game says i have a corrupted savegame and already existing users options profile which i should delete. this problem is really starting to piss off big time."
,genocide79,2011-10-14T02:00Z,"got it running finally , played it but deleated it ,as its just like the other dead rising 2 game not much had changed in the game itself,rather boring."
,BTLW,2011-10-14T02:02Z,"vishesh, if id downloaded it why would i give a shit if its downloading fast? fail troll"
,Cyrez60659,2011-10-14T23:49Z,"Got up to the part where you have to chase TK on the train and now the game always crashes at that point no matter what. I don't know if it's the game or the rip, but it is unplayable beyond that point (for me at least)."
,Ajs47951,2011-10-15T04:02Z,the game keeps crashing alot is there going to be any fix for this?
,Ajs47951,2011-10-15T04:09Z,"If youâre on Windows 7, there could be a solution for you: Go to: Control Panel -> Sound -> Speakers -> Advanced. there, Try decreasing your sound quality to 24 bit, 48000 Hz. solved the problem to lots of people. Capcom games seem to have problems with audio quality, not sure about how much it affects the game itself. think this is also applicable on vista."
,wedran1950,2011-10-15T19:32Z,When will the crashing be fixed?
,b33fman,2011-10-18T21:03Z,"Guys, when I start the game it shows a black screen for a while and then it says Dead Rising 2:Off The Record is not responding and crashes.
I had the same problem with the SkidRow version, can somebody help?"

,mizztahd,2011-10-25T20:22Z,i am having same problem as b33fman. Any help?
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-11-17T08:13Z,can we expect the update too. one that works with this upload? a kaos update? if not can i get a way to make the skidrow update work with this? everytime i try it says something about windows live. i think it has something to do with not having the original game exe and i sure as heck am not about to dl a 6gb game just to get the original exe.....
