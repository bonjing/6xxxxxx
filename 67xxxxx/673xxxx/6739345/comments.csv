[T],V100,2011-11-03T10:40Z,Thank you for uploading this. I just watched this on PBS and figured it best to pass it around. It is -another- recent example of reckless and unconscionable law enforcement.
,BoonesFerry,2012-01-25T03:01Z,Thank you
,BoonesFerry,2012-01-25T07:24Z,I'm just now getting around to catching up on this show and this episode has just one seeder and it's downloading at 1.5 kB/s and will take 4 days. If you already have this episode and happen to read this will you please seed ;-)
,BoonesFerry,2012-01-26T05:40Z,After 24 hours with 4 days remaining to completion...I gave up. Found it on TorrentDay with many seeders.  Thanks again for the post. I would have been ok with waiting another 4 days if It were not available elsewhere.
