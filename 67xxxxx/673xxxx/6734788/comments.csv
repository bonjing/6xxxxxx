,icescate,2011-10-13T18:18Z,"this will take forever, because everytime someone completes the download they dont seed back. watch the number of peers go down but no one stays & seeds! this is a sign that the system isnt working and its going to fail if this continues!"

,icescate,2011-10-14T17:17Z,Ive downloaded a 65 g download that took less time than this. I was watching the peer/seed count and I finally got a seed in my area It was up on the screen for only 3 minutes than it was gone. So I guess the way this works is as soon as your download is complete turn it off. which is totally differant than what I was doing what I was doing was I would leave it seed until the ratio was at least 1.0000. Will any of the 200+ peers be cool enough to turn into a seed.
