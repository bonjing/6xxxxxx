Before sheâ€™s truly freed from the shackles of EMI, Joss Stone must endure one final indignity: that standard end-of-contract ploy, a greatest-hits album, covering her six years with the label. Every one of her 12 singles for the label is here, with the Jamie Hartman duet â€œStalemateâ€ -- originally released on Benâ€™s Brotherâ€™s 2009 album -- added as a concluding track. If this doesnâ€™t dig deep, it nevertheless hits all the highlights  -- her White Stripes cover â€œFell in Love with a Boy,â€ her Top Ten U.K. hit â€œYou Had Me,â€ â€œDonâ€™t Cha Wanna Ride,â€ her only charting U.S. single â€œTell Me 'Bout It,â€ the Common duet â€œTell Me What Weâ€™re Gonna Do Nowâ€ -- drawing a picture of the decade when Stone was always on the cusp of stardom yet never quite truly there. As introductions go, itâ€™s a solid one, capturing her potential and promise, alternating between singles frustrating and fun. ~Review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine
