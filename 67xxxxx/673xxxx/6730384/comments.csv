,Master3055,2011-10-10T18:40Z,"@micko84 cheers mate

Was just checkin in the DVD file if the LB was correct and that seems all good, but i noticed that the name was different
.dvd is (DRIVER SANFRANCISCO XBOX 360 PAL 0800 RIP  MEGA.iso)  and the
.iso is (DRIVER SANFRANCISCO XBOX 360 PAL 0800 RIP.iso)
should we rename the iso file and add the word MEGA or will it work the way it is?"
,Jacket_Tayta,2011-10-10T19:19Z,"abgx360 does not recognise this ISO? 

So I ignored that and tried to burn anyway but the included .dvd file has a LayerBreak=2133520.

When I try to use imgburn it errors with image size of 4,267,015 and my DL disc size of 4,173,824. ""there doesn't appear to be enough space on the disc...""

Is this just a standard ISO for LT+ fixed drives and not requiring a JTAG machine?...

,Master3055,2011-10-10T19:39Z,"@Jacket_Tayta 
XGD3 games come up with errors on image burn but they still work, google on how it should be done step by step, i use clone cd theres a tut on that also and doesnt have the errors"
,Master3055,2011-10-10T19:47Z,"Step by Step:
1. Choose ""Write image file to disc"", and after loading the .dvd file, click ""Write"".
2. ImgBurn will pop up a notice saying that there is not enough space on the disc to burn the image, and asks if you would like to continue anyway. Click ""Yes"".
3. Another message might pop up saying that optimal layerbreak position exceeds L0 capacity. Click ""Yes"".
4. An error will then pop up noting that ""Set L0 Data Zone Capacity Failed"". Click ""Continue"".
5. The image will begin writing to the disc.
6. Nearing the end of the write process, ImgBurn will pop up an error at around 97% or 98% (this is what we want -- it's intentional!). Click ""Cancel"".
7. A notice will then pop up asking if you would like ImgBurn to try and perform the ""'Close Track/Session/Disc' functions"". Click ""Yes"".
8. Let the disc finalize, and you're done! 

Abgx still not updated 
u need LT 2.0 to play"
,micko84,2011-10-10T23:57Z,"@Master3055 rename the files so they are both the same doesnt matter which one, i got the file from megaups.com i was pretty fucked up when i uploaded the file :S

use the burning method that Master3055 said if you have the old imageburn, but get the latest one its less bugs"
,Master3055,2011-10-11T02:57Z,"Thanks micko84
