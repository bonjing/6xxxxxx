,spiritofwrath,2011-10-11T03:21Z,is this for real hd and not a cam?  TY much if it is
,MasterFuse,2011-10-11T03:33Z,"Not a TS, just another really poor quality cam version."
,mytzlplyk,2011-10-11T03:55Z,"TELESYNC or TS: This is a CAM file, where the sound is recorded from an external source, rather than just the cameraâs microphone. The sound quality is therefore better than a normal CAM.

,outback-aussie,2011-10-12T06:37Z,"Saw this yesterday at the movies.  Just as a heads-up, a good proportion of the film was shot in VERY dim lighting - alleys, fight clubs etc - you may have to wait for a DVRIP to see real quality here."
,goodone1959,2011-10-12T13:36Z,"As mentioned the parts the are filmed in the dark aren't much chop and there is a lot but this is to be expected as far as Cams go! Having said that the Sound quality is brilliant and full credit go to the people responsible great job!
the main parts of the movie footage is quite watchable!
V=5-6
S=9
M=10"
,goodone1959,2011-10-12T13:41Z,"V=5-6 
As the important parts are quite watchable
S=9 Brilliant job to those people responsible - thanks ""Bone""!!
M=10 - Just loved it and can't wait to watch it again at the movies!!"
