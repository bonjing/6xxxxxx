,mr.eclectic,2011-10-13T07:14Z,Only disc 1 is here....listening now...seems OK so far...nice collection if it was complete. TPB for whatever reason dosen't seem to like non-english alphabets. TNX
,mr.eclectic,2011-10-13T08:37Z,"disc 1 plays perfectly..no problems...however, most english programs won't recognize the cryllic alphabet.....Pls upload disc 2...Big TNX. "
[T],willrain,2011-10-13T14:00Z,"Ok, i'll upload all 14 CD box set. I can't remove this (or any other)  torrent or edit him - seems like some problems on TPB, earlier i could remove old torrents and use non-ascii titles on tracker. About ""english programs"" - all (if not most) modern programs (and tags in flac-files) use Unicode, so they can recognize any language :)"
,mr.eclectic,2011-10-14T05:27Z,HOLEY MOLEY!!! What a great collection! Looks like I have my work cut out for me. Will take me a day or two to DL all this fine music. Hard to find good quality music these days. Keep the good stuff coming!!! TNX a million.
