[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-12T19:09Z,My bad - Apparently there are 2 Volumes - so I think I just confused everyone :(
[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-12T19:19Z,"Volume 1, #1-6 were collected in S.H.I.E.L.D.: Architects of Forever. I'll try to find it, and this year 2011, S.H.I.E.L.D. Volume 2, was released and is currently on #3 as of today."
