Summary
Here is an all-new, full-scale audio production of prize-winning fantasist E. Everett Evans' legendary off-trail romantic horror tale "The Undead Die" (written in collaboration with Ray Bradbury).

You will think you are listening to classic radio drama, or the soundtrack for a lost 1940s horror film. This new audio dramatization is read and performed by a full cast with a lush, eerie and evocative music score and realistic sound effects. With the addition of an informative introduction written for this production by Jean Marie Stine, the total package is a real treat for aficionados of terror and the supernatural.

But, be warned: Evans' dark tale is a little gem, built around an original idea and treatment, that reaches an unexpected and affecting ending.
