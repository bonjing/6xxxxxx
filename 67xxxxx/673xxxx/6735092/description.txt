This collection is an update to the earlier AD&D UK monster collection from White Dwarf magazine, the Complete Fiend Factory http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6211981/The_Complete_Fiend_Factory_-_AD_amp_D_Fiend_Folio_2_
 

The AD&D-centric writers of White Dwarf, including their editor, migrated to TSR UK's "Imagine" magazine for 30+ issues. Contained in this collection are the monsters found in its publication span. While not wacky and user-created like the Fiend Factory/Folio monsters, they are rather created and edited by professionals. Their presentation (and paucity) reflects this.
