Run the game as administrator."

,Four-eyes,2011-10-10T14:24Z,"Thanks for the upload extremezone. 

And thank you very much to the person who added  a mute button to the installer! :-)"

Haven't found a fix yet, anyone had any joy?"
,ratusa,2011-10-10T17:03Z,I wonder how many torrents the wining cunts who can't seem to grasp the concept of mounting an ISO  have uploaded for the world to enjoy... 
,lg1991,2011-10-10T17:55Z,"@ratusa - If you actually read what people are saying, the problem is not that people cant 'mount an iso', its that after installing it, the game crashes. 

No one is blaming the uploader, don't know if the problem is with the game or the crack"
,laughingbear,2011-10-10T19:27Z,Game is still crashing after intro movie. Black screen of death. Any solutions?
,mrjollol,2011-10-10T21:44Z,"I had the Black-screen issue, Simply installed directx manually and it got running"
,bronecar,2011-10-10T22:11Z,"for those experiencing the black screen: hit enter a few times and wait a bit, it will then load the game ;)"
,TeffyDon,2011-10-10T23:05Z,"For everyone who cannot get this to work (including crash):
1. Do not run the autorun setup, which asks for steam to help install.
2. Burn or mount the image, then open 'explore' the disk and click the Fairlight folder, inside that folder run FLT setup.
3. Complete the setup, and when it asks to copy the crack and do the one other thing click yes.
4. Once everything is completed, go to the program folder (program files/a game of thrones/) and run Agot.exe AS ADMINISTRATOR
5. MAKE SURE TO RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR!
6. Click two-three times to skip the intro vids, then screen will go black, press enter a couple times then be patient.
7. Play the game :)

I've seeded the whole download now, I'll seed for another 48 hours probably upload 3 to 1. Thanks for the upload much appreciated."
,DeadVal,2011-10-11T01:35Z,can we play multiplayer ??? 
,thiebault,2011-10-11T04:54Z,"Thanks so much, NEIRO15.
Takes a while to sort out the russian but then it's fast and clean."
,TeffyDon,2011-10-11T05:28Z,"Alright, played a bunch of the campaign first 10 missions or so.  

Plain and simple, this game is shit. Not fun. Not organized. Poor movement. Very slow boring game play. Save your time and don't bother downloading this. "
,Aygan,2011-10-11T06:50Z,THanks THanaks Thanks!
,longsheep,2011-10-11T11:32Z,"firstly thanks extremzone!

,sanjay66,2011-10-12T08:50Z,after menu loads the mouse clicking seems to not work you can move it around but when you click no response....
,sanjay66,2011-10-12T09:23Z,"if anyone has a solution as to how to get the mouse to work please post, game loads fine but i cant click any of the menus."
,sanjay66,2011-10-12T18:06Z,also makes a weird buzzing noise when hovering over the menu options.
,Smudger82,2011-10-13T08:54Z,"People complain about seeders and leechers yet they are getting the game for free. If you can't wait a couple of hours or even days, buy the game. As for LONGSHEEP try seeding your torrents for longer than an hour you tight bastard, its people like you who make downloads slower (hit & runners)...... Thanx again EZ, just havin a little moan whilst the game is intalling lol."

Double Click ""flt-setup""

PS: Don't forget to run the game as administrator."

,TheRetardedGoat,2012-01-21T08:14Z,"Why is it in French or whatever, is there a way I can change it to English? Otherwise I can't understand what to do in campaign lol"
,ArmutAsil,2012-05-01T23:54Z,"As WhiteLycanCES say, the installation method is this.:
Mount image (daemon tools)
Go to my computer
Right click on the mounted image (Mine is DVD Drive (J): AGOT)
Click Open
Double Click on the ""Fairlight"" folder
Double Click ""flt-setup""
Don't forget to run the game as administrator.

Thats it...no more, no less, and fine working everything.
After 3 hour gaming, my opinion just A+, this game, is fascinating, about 4-5 strategic games in one! No need high end PC, enough a middle grade.

Perfect game, perfect torrent, no bullshit. Extremezone...my men:)

Sorry my hungaris-english, but i'm hun."
,hhorde,2012-05-09T03:04Z,"HOW DO I RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR , I DONT HAVE THE PASSWORD??"
,Distefanor,2012-05-14T23:12Z,it all installed OK but i can`t play... the game wont start... and the it says there has been an error
,freedombaz,2012-05-17T02:03Z,for updates just copy the files into install folder ? program files / a game of thrones ?  or somewhere else? ...  and who file i copy update common or update_fr or both ?
