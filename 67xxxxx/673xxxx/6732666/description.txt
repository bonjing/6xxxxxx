Book Description
With the new C++ Standard and Technical Report 2 (TR2), multi-threading is coming to C++ in a big way. TR2 will provide higher-level synchronization facilities that allow for a much greater level of abstraction, and make programming multi-threaded applications simpler and safer.

As a guide and reference to the new concurrency features in the upcoming C++ Standard and TR2, this book is invaluable for existing programmers familiar with writing multi-threaded code in C++ using platform-specific APIs, or in other languages, as well as C++ programmers who have never written multithreaded code before.
