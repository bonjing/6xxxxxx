Can u please upload
Inland Empire (2006) 720p â 1.2GB
I know the size is a bit too large but please give it a try coz the movie is amazing.
Thanks a lot"
[V],sujaidr,2011-10-13T16:30Z,"@Kokua651,its a nice choice but its not about the size,seeding  a 1.25gb movie takes a long time and many who download dont seed back and i cant seed it all the time and eventually even if the quality is good compared to other uploads,the torrent dies,if everyone are gentleman enough to seed back as much as possible then i can upload it in the future but rite now looking at the state of my other torrents i'm very disappointed but still i wont stop and i'll keep uploading,but your request will take some time :-)"
[V],sujaidr,2011-10-13T16:39Z,"@suneelsahu,bro thats a lot of movies,must be a horror fan eh.will do it but give some time :-)"
,Kokua651,2011-10-13T20:30Z,"@sujaidr I understand I will wait 4 your upload. 
And its just sad to see mostly good movies are the ones that die early.
Crappy movies get a lot of seeds just coz they are new .

But i can assure u I seed as much as I can and only remove a torrent when my hard disk is full. :)"
,suneelsahu,2011-10-14T15:27Z,"@sujaidr
ty fer replying...take ur time...those r only 3 out of which the later 2 u can find scorps but i cant find ""Enemy at the Gates"" in small 720p...n yes i am horror/slasher/gore fan ;) ...BTW wher r u from??
dont worry bout seeds once u get ur skull u get more seeds also try trackers other than TPB to get more seeds i guess :)"
