The documentary itself is mainly in Czech, but with some spoken English and Korean. It is subtitled in Czech and English.  The extras are not subtitled. That means trailers and deleted scenes...

Not the most professional documentary about North Korea, but I don't suppose there are too many of those getting permission to film.  It is an interesting perspective, however, since some of the participants are old enough to have experienced a rather similar lifestyle, while others can only see it historically relevant to their own country, having perhaps only childhood memories of those days.

The participants describe their tour as more of a delegation than sightseeing, and that is pretty accurate.  They do not enter any of the inner circle or meet any diplomats.  They are basically shown that part of North Korean life the authorities want them to see.  Their comments, however, are unscripted.  Some will irk you, others will perhaps seem on the ball...still others pretty mundane and hippy-dippy.

Some of the soundtrack is provided by the ubiquitous Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble.
