Congrats"
,brandonp,2011-12-24T02:51Z,"good torrent thanks,but...I want a resident evil 4 without the graphics patch,because my computer graphics card is fucked up,and can't upgrade because its a on-board chip...can any one give a link for it?pleaseeeeee"

,Tuyang,2012-01-16T12:07Z,5 hours of downloading and this file has 217 seeders!!! no way!!!!
,blaymoric,2012-01-18T13:27Z,"This torrent is perfect and whoever says otherwise has no idea what their doing, is trolling, or both. I got a CRC error during installation, yes, however I'm just at the part where you need to get into the church with no lag or any issues whatsoever and all audio is in English.

+Quality for this fucker for uploading a great torrent. Also the controls are pretty easy once you get a Feel for em."
,stephenthedemon,2012-01-31T15:06Z,any1 know if this works on windows 7?
,bocmaxima,2012-02-03T02:55Z,"Thanks to the uploader, everything seems to be in place, includes the mouse patch and resolution controls, worked without a hitch on Windows 7.

Unfortunately the mouse patch sucks massively. It is very difficult to aim with it, Leon waves his gun around like a drunk. Unless there is a trick I don't know of, this is a terrible port. So far Wii version is best (as lame as that sounds)."

,NagoKen,2012-02-06T16:27Z,"I have uploaded Resident Evil 3 PSX PAL here http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7013044

It's tested and working fine. Thanks"
,hitiuga,2012-02-07T07:56Z,"My mouse isn't working. There isn't any mouse configuration or option. 

Was that just a joke? Fuck i need help."
,raylugojr,2012-02-09T00:00Z,Thanks this game is fun. For those having trouble with the controls use the right cntrl (1) and the enter (3) key to dodge the boulder. Apparently these keys are listed in the game as keys 1 and 3. You cant use these keys while playing using the mouse. Select the other version (non mouse). That's how I'm able to play the game using the keyboard. Thanks Zingooo you rock.
,Kixx123,2012-02-11T09:06Z,Please more seeeeeeeed thanks all ;)
,sarabecker90,2012-02-18T00:36Z,5 language.. its german???
,LzX,2012-02-26T06:37Z,"Works PERFECTLY. Thanks, zingooo!

Dont know why people are concerned about the time of downloading, i got it really fast.

Recommend people to use the mouse support cause it substitutes the analog stick when you need to dodge and use the keyboard for the rest (in my opinion it's easier!). But people who insist in using the mouse for everything and came here complaining, never heard about decreasing the mouse sensibility!"
,Crusher23,2012-03-05T01:23Z,"Anyone using an Xbox Controller or a joypad? The Right Analog stick is going crazy for this game and I cannot play it. It treats it like there's only for possible directions, when there's practically 1000.

Help?"
,Up5ka,2012-03-08T17:25Z,"is the keysetings good placed at this game?, i Dld a torrent when you didnt use the mouse"
,khanyq8,2012-03-19T21:47Z,i loved this game
,mayconpow,2012-03-21T02:56Z,massa
,iKeviful,2012-03-22T18:07Z,"Gonna download it now, Ratedloud made me really excited cause I think that I also will need a day to download it, On every torrenthost I read I need a f*cking PS2 Converter, I don't need it now, and playing with keyboard and mouse will be very good!! Can't wait till I blast some fools! :)
Great Thanks for this awesome torrent and when it's done I will seed it :)"
,Titoman767,2012-04-06T03:34Z,"Please help, when I go to start the game it says ""game.exe has stopped working."" What do I do?"
,chichama,2012-04-12T07:26Z,can u compress this! pls 
,DanteDarcia,2012-04-13T13:42Z,"Don't download, waste of time.

Yes it works but the whole game has to be viewed letterbox.

There is a launcher which lets you change widescreen, it lets you change between TWO resolutions,

The launcher is NOT for the mouse support .exe, so if you want to change the VERY limited graphical settings you cannot use the mouse.

Completely and utterly fucking pointless this game even existing,

Download a PS2 emulator and put your copy of RE4 into the DVD drive.

IF you want to play at 800x600 letterboxed then yeh go ahead."
,-Norcal-,2012-04-25T22:36Z,Worked fine for me.  DL speed 3.5 mb/sec.  NICE!
,zoomcloud,2012-05-04T02:58Z,I just installed this & i've never torrented a game before. How do I play it?... 
,kenshin987,2012-05-05T22:15Z,nao to comsegino baixar...
,icewolf72,2012-05-17T18:13Z,"I recommend getting a PS2 Controller / USB Adapter for this, otherwise you're going to have trouble controlling this game. 

It runs fine on any computer really, unless yours is ancient, I've got a Laptop, Intel HD3000 graphics, 2.3ghz, 4g ram, runs easily on high settings."
,Phailip90,2012-05-20T06:16Z,Works great! although the use of a mouse is difficult 
,CrzyNinja,2012-05-26T11:07Z,Does anyone know if this works on windows 7 32bit? also is it an ISO file that has to be burned to a disc?
,SkyJizz,2012-06-01T07:59Z,downloading it now ;)
,supermario5029,2012-06-03T15:53Z,"yeah,it worked on win 7,but the problem is,that the cutscenes doesnt work,WTF?!although i have an older pc at my grandma,downloading now,BUT WHEN I PLAY FOR SOME TIME(this happens on all games,beware),THE PC RESTARTS!my older pc has major problems,does anyone know what the crap is happening?!im so annoyed"
