,zeone31,2011-10-11T02:05Z,"Thanks for uploading a great Criterion Blu-ray. I find that it usually takes a while for Criterion HD stuff to be uploaded on TPB. I did a little searching and found out that HD-BB.org uploads a lot of Criterion blu-ray films shortly after they are released on websites like fileserv.com. You need to register for free to see the urls. I don't have a fileserv, filesonic, uploadstation or wupload account but if you do would it be possible for you to download the files and upload them on tpb? That'll be awesome since they have pretty much every new Criterion blu ray release. 

Here's the link for Phantom Carriage

Please keep uploading Criterion blu-ray. No one has uploaded beauty and the beast or Carlos (Criterion version) in HD yet. Thanks!"
