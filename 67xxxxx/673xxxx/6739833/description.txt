A ragtag group of Knights Templar hold out for months against the hard-fought siege of Rochester Castle in the thirteenth Century. Set in the time of King John's signing of the Magna Carta treaty, the group struggles against the King to defend the freedom of their country. "Judging from James Purefoy's bloody sword, the movie Ironclad is going to be a bloody feast! Well at least it will be somewhat historically accurate because the Siege of Rochester Castle was a damn bloody mess, a really hard-fought battle." -- (C) Arc Entertainment
