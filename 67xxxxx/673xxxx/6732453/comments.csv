,liftersband,2011-10-12T10:24Z,"I just found a download link on a blog. The leaks usually come from people working for music magazines, where albums are sent for reviewing before official release date."
,ThatSlinkyGirl,2011-10-12T19:19Z,"YOU ARE AMAZING!!
A thousand thank you's!! 
I couldn't wait another week for this. And the streaming online was just a tease.
Awesome quality.
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!"
,CarlosHigg,2011-10-13T00:54Z,"Ahh I see think it was streamed online too but this is better quality so thanks! Album isnt amazing but still some good tracks, would give it 7/10. Hopefully he'll bring back APC soon."
