An undercover ex-cop named Francine Driver, who poses as an assassin, meets a dentist in a Los Angeles bar. His name is Nick and he wants his wife Karen dead. He does not have the upfront payment of $20,000, but he promises he can get it for her before the night is over. When he leaves, Francine meets a young man named Henry, a photographer who charms her before stealing her wallet and running off into the night. Her wallet contains the device used to record her conversation with Nick, and the evidence is incriminating.
