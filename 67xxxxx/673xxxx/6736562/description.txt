For her first album in several years, Yoko Ono was joined by her son Sean Ono Lennon's trio Ima (Japanese for now), a trio adept at both abstract, improvisational free jazz and Sonic Youth-style noise rock. Both of these musical extremes can be found on Rising, a harrowing, autobiographical song cycle written to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. At the time of the bombings, Ono - who grew up in Tokyo - was hiding in the Japanese countryside. Given her most sympathetic backing since the early-'70s Plastic Ono Band records, Ono delivers her most heartfelt and experimental work in over 20 years. Highlights include the stunning 15-minute title track, where Lennon, Timo Ellis, and Sam Koppelman whip up an Ornette Coleman-like frenzy as Ono delivers some extremely powerful lyrics. The similarly passionate Kurushi, is almost equally chilling. Rising is an intense, challenging work.
