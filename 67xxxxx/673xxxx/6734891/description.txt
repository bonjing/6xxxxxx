Hedningarna is the first album of the eponymous Swedish band. It was released in 1989, when Hedningarna was still a trio. Unlike the other albums, the debut does not include amplified instruments and rhythm loops and is played entirely acoustic. Even so, the band still creates a very powerful rhythmic sound.

Using various instruments, such as hurdy-gurdies, moraharpas, bagpipes and fiddles, the album proves Hedningarnas ability to mix old and new styles, and the album honors the old Scandinavian musical traditions, while managing to combine these with more modern sounds.

The album was later released under the NorthSide label.  (wikipedia)
