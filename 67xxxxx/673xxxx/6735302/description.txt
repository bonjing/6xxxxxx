This is a big collection of 3DO games(60 games). Due to the big size of the collection I decided to divide it into 3 torrents. This is part THREE

games in this part are: 

41. Samurai Shodown
42. Sewer Shark
43. Shock Wave
44. Shock Wave 2
45. Space Hulk - Vengeance of the Blood Angels
46. StarBlade
47. Starcontrol II
48. StarFighter
49. Strahl
50. Super Street Fighter II Turbo
51. Syndicate
52. The Horde
53. Theme Park
54. Total Eclipse
55. Trip'd
56. Twisted 
57. Twisted JP
58. Way of the Warrior
59. Wing Commander III - Heart of the Tiger
60. Wolfenstein 3D

this is the final part, please seed!

Also, I have included the world only 3DO emulator, FreeDO v2.1 alpha and I included the somewhat hard to find bios file FZ10. (in part 1) 

To play a game open the emulator and select the bios file "3do_bios_fz10.rom" which can be found in the emulator's directory inside the bios folder (for the first time only), then Click: File then: Open Image

All Games should work straight away

Further more, I included the JoyToKey software (in part 1). Which will allow you to use a Joy Stick or a controller to play the games instead of the keyboard. It simple to use.

Have fun and stay tuned for the rest of the games... Shpaz
