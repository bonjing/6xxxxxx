This comparative text provides an understanding of major foreign criminal justice systems by discussing and comparing the systems of six of the world's more industrialized countries: England, France, Sweden, Russia, China and Japan - each representative of a different type of legal system - as well as a chapter on Islamic law that uses Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Turkey as main examples. Political, historical, organizational, procedural, and critical issues confronting the justice systems are explained and analyzed. Each chapter contains material on government, police, judiciary, law, corrections, juvenile justice, and other critical issues.


    * Each chapter introduces a country and then covers "concepts to know," government, police, judiciary, law, corrections, and juvenile justice
