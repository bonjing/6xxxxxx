Can someone help me please,

How do i burn this to disk?"
,Damien74,2011-10-18T23:21Z,Burn with Alcohol 120% or any similar ISO-burner. I think even Win 7's own burner does this job well now. Burn the ISO-file in a burn app that knows ISO. Nothing to it.
,BlueTaylor,2011-10-19T01:51Z,Thanks Damien74 all sorted now! Works great!
,wimpiewtf,2011-10-31T13:03Z,blue taylor@ depends on what kind of program you're using i myself use vuze but you cant get this file on a dvd through thepiratebay
