,japhater,2011-10-10T13:39Z,i dont understand why people upload vids with subs especially different language subs
,Urban_Ninja,2011-10-11T02:11Z,It is because they think ther own language is becoming more and more comon  :/ 
,DelArco,2011-10-12T17:02Z,"I don't understand why people come whining on subs. You don't have to read them, do you?
Maybe you like to watch chinese movies, without english subs?
And by the way, there are more people speaking mandarine chinese and spanish, then english in the world.
Maybe they think their language is becoming more common...?"

,muscle555,2011-10-17T15:19Z,"I think it is great if someone took the time to create subtitle files in different languages.  I just don't like it when people hard code special languages and hard code it onto the video so that others that do not want it can not remove it.  Subtitle files are not a problem and are great if they can be included.. if someone does not want to use them.. then it is not a problem.. but they are there is someone does.

Take care everyone!"
