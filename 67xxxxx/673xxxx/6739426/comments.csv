Some encoder/re-releaser apply filter like denoiser/smoother to make the video look better (making it different from the source/original blu ray). I am a fan of MXMG because they reduce the size without too much losing quality, almost identical to the source which is 6GB or much more. Although I often go for other release because I want smooth video."

,Mutegrill,2011-10-18T12:09Z,"And Kevinzee, please learn to find out how things REALLY are before you make it a task to falsely correct others. The fact is that MXMGÂ´s preview pics ARE rough and grainy, and consistingly so in many of his uploads. Since the original source uploder did not, do you actually mean MXMG applied grain to his preview pics? If that is the case, MXMG must be the worst advertiser for his own ""products"". In history...

The problem is that you judge the movie by itÂ´s preview pics. I for my part gets really suspicious if the previews are anus. Thus not downloading. If the movie does NOT relate to the preview pics quality, MXMG needs to take action. If he cares. Because we care, and we want GREAT uploads from MXMG!"
