,mocean,2011-10-10T23:08Z,Thanks for uploading this. Will definitely seed.
,RedTy,2011-10-13T02:16Z,Any chance someone could upload a .avi or .mp4 version? Takes a long time to convert and ps3's don't play .mkv
,Pharos01,2011-10-15T23:10Z,MKV & MP4 are interchangeable. MKV content is easily put in mp4 container. MeGui Demux HD to H264 & AC3. (Run queue) Then use mp4 muxer (also in MeGui) add H264 video stream & AC3 audio stream. (run queue) Voila an mp4 file of the exact same content. 
,Pharos01,2011-10-15T23:11Z,XviD4PSP does it in 1 go! Easiest.
