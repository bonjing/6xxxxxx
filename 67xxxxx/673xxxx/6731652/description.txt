Class-tested by thousands of students and using simple equipment and green chemistry ideas, UNDERSTANDING THE PRINCIPLES OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY: A LABORATORY COURSE includes 36 experiments that introduce traditional, as well as recently developed synthetic methods. Offering up-to-date and novel experiments not found in other lab manuals, this innovative book focuses on safety, gives students practice in the basic techniques used in the organic lab, and includes microscale experiments, many drawn from the recent literature. An Online Instructor's Manual available on the book's instructor's companion website includes helpful information, including instructors' notes, pre-lab meeting notes, experiment completion times, answers to end-of-experiment questions, video clips of techniques, and more.
