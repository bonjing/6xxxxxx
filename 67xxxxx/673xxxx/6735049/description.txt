Here's a wonderful little mini-series that came out bi-monthly and finished earlier this year. This series has got it all: Spidey web-slinging, Wolvie stabbing, time travel, midgets, diamonds, space aliens, dinosaurs, and so much more!

If you're at all fans of Spider-man or Wolverine or even if you want to be converted to the masses read this series; It's a ton of fun.

Written by Jason Aaron and all 6 issues are drawn by Adam Kubert.

Enjoy.
