Namaste"

,bil_gr7,2011-10-11T09:15Z,I wonder who will watch that crap.
,dwain-o,2011-10-12T20:05Z,"@dzlrules.... um, you do realize that this show is sending up the half-baked morons who believe that they've tapped into ""The Truth.""  I hope you're not seeing this as an affirmation of what you've gone thru.  If so, then you're the punchline.

Namaste back at you."
