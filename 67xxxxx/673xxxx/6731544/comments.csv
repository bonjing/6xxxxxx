someone post if this is real or fake ."
[T],Captain-Blood,2011-10-09T18:35Z,"the real deal. 
About the same quality as versions uploaded by TvTeam and others (I'm talking about the 1.21 and 1.38 Gb torrents.)
For this torrent I say Video 4 Audio 7.
Quality is poor, but watchable.
Video is dark, grainy. Not a CAM. Widescreen.
Having downloaded this torrent and the 1.38 Gb torrent I would recommend the 1.38 Gb torrent as it has better contrast and color tones. They both suck though, quality is poor, but as I stated, it is definitely watchable. Thank you froggie100!"
