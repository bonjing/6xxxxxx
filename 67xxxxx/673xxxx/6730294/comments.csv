Hi, everyone! :)

I purchased the audiobook version of ""The Son of Neptune"" by Rick Riordan a day after it came out, and it is always a special occasion when the book and audiobook are released on the same day!

I just now finished splitting it in to chapters and enhanced the wave form a little. It also is properly tagged, has cover art, and contains various ebook formats. Thanks to all whose work is included in this torrent release! :)

enjoy!
