TIP:  Launch the Video editor by choosing ""make movie or slideshow"" from the VIDEO menu, which is in a NERO  program group. When the video editor launches, as soon as you try to drag a video clip to the timeline (i.e., I dragged an mp4), a window will pop up asking you to obtain a serial number online or by fax.  Choose ""by fax"".  A new window will then ask you to input you serial number: there are in fact SIX serial numbers for plugins, which are listed directly under the major serial number that starts the instal. You you can feed the serial numbers in one after the other until all six are accepted. You can copy & paste these six numbers, unlike the initial serial number to instal that you must TYPE in. When all six are in, close Nero and re-launch it to work with it.

The first thing I noticed as an advantage of THIS Nero Video editor -- contained in this Nero MultiMedia suite -- is that it specifically IMPORTS ""Windows Live MovieMaker"" projects, so you can continue working on them and enhancing them. 

I've never seen ANY other video software offer this compatibility, and I think it's amazing. TIP: if you have old Windows XP MovieMaker projects, but you don't have Windows 7 that comes with ""MovieMaker Live"", it might be worth renting an hour or two in an Internet cafe that has Windows 7, (or visit a friend who has it) just to import & upgrade all your old XP MovieMaker projects into WIndows 7's ""Live Moviemaker"", then re-save all to a USB key as ""Live Moviemaker"" files. Then see if they will import into Nero. I'm going to try it.  If it works, I'm going to buy it, it's worth it for this feature alone!"

Same popup with every mp4 drag."
,watcheroo,2011-10-25T06:12Z,"Nero wasn't compatible with my MovieMaker, so I uninstalled it.

Uninstalling Nero left bits of Nero files all over the place. They interacted with WIndows installer, and every time I clicked on ANY folder on my desktop, Nero triggered Windows installer trying to reinstal Nero!  

It took me 30 hours to get rid of the problem. Let me save YOU the time. It was 'Perfect Uninstaller' that finally got rid of the remains of Nero. It had not properly uninstalled despite using Revo. It wasn't a virus, it's just that Nero is really really hard to uninstal.  'Perfect Uninstaller' will uninstal bare remains of programs other uninstallers have left behind. Hope you won't need it!"
