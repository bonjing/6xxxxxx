    A young girl, Johanna Ravn, is jogging in the woods, when she's          
    suddenly attacked by a man in an orange jumpsuit. Her assailant          
    drills a hole in her skull and leaves her for dead. When the police      
    calls Johanna's father, Morten Ravn, to ask him to identify his          
    daughter's body in the morgue, he tells them that she has just walked    
    in and is sitting in front of her PC... But there's something wrong      
    with Johanna. Black oil is flowing from her eyes and the only message    
    she's able to type on her screen is one long cry for help. And she's     
    not alone. All over town, people are attacked by men in orange           
    jumpsuits with electrical drills. The victims all suffer from the        
    same symptoms, with their bodies slowly disintegrating in front of       
    their loved ones. Frustrated with the lack of results from the local     
    police, Morten takes it on himself to investigate the attacks and        
    tracks the killer back to his hideout in secluded manufacturing plant    
    where he begins to uncover the secrets behind the assaults and piece     
    together the mysteries surrounding the killer. -The ruthless greed       
    and ecological devastation of the oil industry form the backdrop to      
    DARK SOULS, a satirical and stylish horror which uses homage as a        
    springboard for its original take on the genre.
