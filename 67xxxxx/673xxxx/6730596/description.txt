In 2002 Big Smo self released his first album, Kuntry Kitchen, named after the old
country store on *Yayoda Ranch* a 32 acre farm where Big Smo resides. The album
received rave reviews and Big Smo was on his way to becoming a local hip hop force.
A few years later he had released his sophomore album, The True South, and was
looking to expand on his already growing musical career. He began recording and
developing new artists in the studio he had custom built on the ranch and embarked on
learning the field of video production as well. Before long Big Smo was filming videos
for the popular Tennessee rapper Haystak, the two instantly hit it off. Their business
relationship snowballed, and soon Big Smo was hired as Haystak\'s hype man for live
events. He quickly became the official opening act, and even landed the role of co-
producer on two Haystak albums - Hard-2-Love and Came A Long Way.
In early 2010 Big Smo joined forces with some industry executives to form NME
Lines Entertainment. The company\'s first release is a new Big Smo studio album,
appropriately titled American Made. Songs like \"My Life In A Jar\" , \"Old Dirt Road,\"
and \"Kickin It In Tennessee\" send the listener on a thrill ride through the country in
an old Ford with no brakes. Guest appearances by Haystak, Jelly Roll, Lil\' White, and
outlaw country singer Charlie Bonnet III add flavor to an already infectious slab of
musical delight. If Kid Rock and Run D.M.C. had a love child on the set of Hee-Haw he
would be named Big Smo. Look out world - this man cannot be stopped.
