Readers Digest - This is my song 5CD plus more 320k (musicfromrizzo)

You are setting yourself up for quite a lot of expectations to come through
when you name a song collection "this is my song" as if it were meant to be
a significant testament to what are considered the standards and most popular
of our music offering so as to rate inclusion into it. As it is this Readers
Digest collection does not evidence any such intention or achievement by any
means whatsoever. In addition, the offerings are eclectic enough that we
dropped the song by Topol (If I were a rich man) as it is slated for a separate
Soundtrack launch soon from the Fiddler on the Roof movie). In addition we
swapped Miss Julie London's "Cry me a river" replacing it with "you'd be so nice
to come home to" as she does that sing especially well for an uplifting of the
spirit by comparison to the initial song title that was included. Other than
that we have left their collection pretty much intact, except to replace several
mp3s with remastered or improved fidelity (still 320k )versions from my library
here. That said without the added tracks this would not have been a great
collection, merely a nice enough offering instead I suppose. So I hope you will
show some indulgence in accepting these extra bonus picks I've included for you
as well intentioned and in the best conscientious spirit I could muster as that
is always the basis for what I do - honestly!

thanks again
