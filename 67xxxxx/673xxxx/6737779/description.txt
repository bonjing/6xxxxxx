                Crime drama series. The team are called in to
                investigate the death of prominent human rights
                lawyer Richard Warner. He died in a fire at his home
                but it is not clear if the fire was set deliberately,
                so the team analyse the severely burned body without
                knowing the cause of the fire. Warner had recently
                been visited by one of his old clients - Joseph
                Marial, an asylum seeker from Sudan, who had been
                deported a year earlier after he was found guilty of
                assault. Warner defended him, but was unable to get
                him acquitted. Warner's son, Nick, is convinced that
                Joseph must be responsible, but there appears to be
                no proof. In a race against time, Oggy, Mike and the
                team reconstruct the fire in their lab to try and
                establish more information about the fire that killed
                Warner. Their findings bring fresh evidence to light.
