Battle of the Blades S03E03: "Passion" - 8 pairs perform.

Battle of the Blades is a Canadian figure skating reality show and competition that airs on CBC. The series resembles Dancing with the Stars, but in this case, professional figure skaters are teamed with well-known hockey players.

There is 6 seconds without audio at 37:38 but fortunately it occurred just after a commercial break so nothing of value was probably lost.
