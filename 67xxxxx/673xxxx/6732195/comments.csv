Thank you for your comment and if for one side i have to say sorry for not making any game files for the moment for other side i have to say please donÂ´t miss any of the my new movie files because they really are great work to the perspective of any torrent file user and you can believe me ... see you around and thank you again ."

Real steel with all its CGI is unrecognisable in this file."
,5amjr,2011-10-16T09:11Z,"Ps i know how frustrating it is to have limited connection as i had it all last year. What i learned in that time is u have to sacrifice viewing quality if u want the movie.
No offence as i know u only do 250mb CAM movies and some games but calling it magic is a bit ridiculous m8."
