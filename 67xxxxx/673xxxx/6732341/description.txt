How many musicians are out there? Millions. How many of them are truly amazing? Hundreds. How many of them do what Jonny Smokes does? Nobody...
See why people are calling Jonny Smokes the greatest one man band in the world. Watch closely and listen! You'd swear there were 5 people on the stage, yet only one man stands before you. Is it pre-recorded? No, it is actually being created and captured right before your eyes and ears! His mastery of the loop sampler and effect switching is unrivaled, developing music so quickly and cleanly that the end result sounds like a radio song or CD, yet the live energy is intense and totally in your face!
Not only is Jonny Smokes playing multiple instruments with world class skill, his vocals are emotional and expressive, ranging from the sweetest ballads to the harshest angry cries. Combined with stellar songwriting and a proficiency in multiple styles, this is one musician who truly does everything, and does it incredibly well.
There are millions of bands and musicians, but there is only one Jonny Smokes...
