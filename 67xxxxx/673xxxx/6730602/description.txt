Dutch Feat is an idea inspired by the Dutch Treat series. However these are not compilations but standard CDees that has proven to be very useful entertaining your guests (and yourself). They are lesser known (why?) and sound a bit better than just perfect.

This is the fifth of the Five times series. Do yourself (and others) a favour.


Enjoy and share
