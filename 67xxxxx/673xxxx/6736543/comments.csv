,TwinAss,2012-01-19T18:15Z,"I allso miss FXG! 
I was going through the list of torrents for this movie thinking, there are no solid rippers these days that you can look for at the end of the torrent name... Rippers you come to equate with quality movies as well for the rip it self. And then there you were FXG_team :) 

What are you up to these days? 

Thx for the up!"
