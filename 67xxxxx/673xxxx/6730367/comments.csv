,Neil10,2011-10-09T02:14Z,"Thanks for the upload - been some good books the last 2 or 3 weeks so I'm good.  Having got Calibre organized on my laptop has been a big help as well.

What I am having a hard time understanding though is the Clive Clussler Book ""Chase"" being heavily advertised lately (very prominent in hardcover at the airport).
Connoly's ""Black Ice"" - and there was a third one as well that was a year old and now the big push.  What is up with that?"
