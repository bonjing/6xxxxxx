About the film

Twenty years after the original The Lovers' Guide exploded into the lives of the UK public, the ground-breaking guide is back with another no-holds-barred exploration of the pleasures of love-making. To mark the anniversary of the series that has brought adult sex advice firmly into the mainstream, the latest instalment has been created using cutting edge 3D technology as the next stop in the sexual revolution. Here the audience is engaged with a never-before-seen sense of intimacy and massively richer viewpoint. Now bigger, better and bolder than ever before, The Lovers' Guide 3D - Igniting Desire features the voices of Gemma Bissix (Eastenders, Hollyoaks, Dancing on Ice) and Jeremy Edwards (Hollyoaks, Holby City) and will take audiences to an altogether new level of love-making enlightenment. The Lovers' Guide 3D has been created by the original producers of The Lovers' Guide series--Robert Page and William Campbell--and filmed by the award-winning director Kenny Rye.
