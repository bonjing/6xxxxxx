,chaioth,2011-11-28T03:24Z,"http://box2.host1free.com/~spirit/index-dvd.html That's what it will actually look like on the extracted zip of the DVD. Don't use this one to navigate the site-- I uploaded a primitive version of the DVD to the website. (I only added this weblink so you can see what is available. If you want to actually rightly navigate the website, use http://box2.host1free.com/~spirit/index.html instead. Best of intentions to all whom glimpse these words, and especially those who do not read them."
