Bol (Urdu: Ø¨ÙˆÙ„; translated variously as "Say", "Speak" or "Talk") is a 2011 Urdu-language 

Lollywood film written, directed and produced by Shoaib Mansoor. The feature film was released 

on 24 June 2011. The film stars Humaima Malik, Atif Aslam, Mahira Khan, Iman Ali, Shafqat 

Cheema, Manzar Sehbai, Zaib Rehman and Amr Kashmiri in the lead roles. There was heavy 

scepticism about whether or not Atif Aslam would be able to meet the requirements of his role 

when he was first announced as the lead.

Atif Aslam, who features in the film as a doctor, in an interview stated, "I have done two songs for 

the soundtrack. Itâ€™s been a great experience working with Shoaib Mansoor, he is an amazing 

person and very dedicated. My role isnâ€™t controversial and we discussed it beforehand. Itâ€™s a film 

that is being made for a good cause". The film was reviewed by the Central Board of Film Censors 

in Lahore on 8 November 2010, and received its approval the next day. The film is set in Lahore 

and many students from National College of Arts' (NCA) filmmaking department have assisted 

Shoaib Mansoor on the film.
