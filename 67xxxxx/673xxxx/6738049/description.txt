"A Whole New Kind of Bitch"

Gemma (Tara Summers) asks Bridget 
(Sarah Michelle Gellar), who is still 
posing as Siobhan, to do her a favor 
that could cost Bridget everything. 
Henry (Kristoffer Polaha) is given 
some crushing news about his writing 
career, and Andrew (Ioan Gruffudd) has 
to deal with his tumultuous 
relationship with his teenage daughter 
Juliet (Zoey Deutch). Bridget meets a 
potential new sponsor named Charlie 
(guest star Billy Miller) at a local 
Narcotics Anonymous meeting, while 
Malcolm (Mike Colter) must face his 
demons when he is put in a position 
that could jeopardize his sobriety.
