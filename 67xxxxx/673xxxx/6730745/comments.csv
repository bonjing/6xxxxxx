[T],Captain-Blood,2011-10-09T16:59Z,"thank you TvTeam for making this available!
this is the real deal, however quality is poor.
Video 4, Audio 7
Video is dark, slightly out of focus. Grainy.
Like video from an analog TV with aerial antennae where you have bad reception.
Quality is poor. But watchable.
Does not seem to be a CAM, I see no people or evidence of a theatre. Appears to be wide-screen. Not being a CAM, why so grainy with poor resolution? Again, this is watchable and the audio is good."
,dashingguyof2k,2011-10-09T19:58Z,"oh man watched it again at home after watching it at the theatre, its an ever green movie, so badly want to watch it on dvd print now, please uploader guys try for dvd soon for this movie plz!!"

,Reaper13321,2011-10-10T09:09Z,"Decent quality, audio is fine, video gets fuzzy a few times during the movie but definetely watchable."
,b0ll0x,2011-10-10T11:42Z,"V - 3/4
A - 7

Watchable, but action movies need good quality video. Thnx for the upload TvTeam, keep em coming"
,jwhud148,2011-10-10T14:47Z,"honestly i don't download these cams too often, but i had to get this one. simply because when i went to see this in the theater, some a$$hole pulled the fire alarm during the title fight. and i am talking about at THE POINT where it was the most interesting. and the theater wouldnt even restart it at that point. so i just downloaded this to watch the last 15 minutes or so..."
,EiNST3iN,2011-10-10T19:35Z,Did you say WATCHABLE? Are you on crack or fuqin high?! This is worse than if someone filmed it with their cell phone! IT IS HORRIBLE! I feel like I am lying by giving it even a 1 out of 10! Its not even ratable!
