,OmniusPrime,2011-10-09T03:19Z,"Yes, thanks for the upload, but ... does it _have_ to be MKV? I stream from my PC to either my XBox360 or PS3 (whichever is on) and the only way to get MKV through is Media Center on the 360, which for some reason makes it blocky as hell. How about avi? please?
And don't get me started on the totally unnecessary multi-part rar ... 8^)"

Try Serviio or any other DLNA server, PS3 (or your TV) should then be able to display almost all mkv files. "
,matepoon,2011-10-10T10:48Z,To play mkvs on your ps3 stream them with ps3 media server. Great free app.
