In the vein of titles like Valusia and Stridulum, Zola Jesus Conatus has a name that will send listeners scrambling for the dictionary. However, the term, which refers to the will to survive and evolve, couldnt be more fitting for this set of songs. Nika Roza Danilova appears swathed in white on the albums cover, the polar opposite of the blue-black murk that covered her on Stridulum. As on that album, the grime of her earlier work is gone, but where Stridulum reached out with somber reassurance, Conatus is internal, examining destruction, surrender, survival, and rebirth up close.  Over the course of the album, Danilova nods to goth, synth pop, industrial, and abstract electronica without pledging allegiance to any one style; shes forging her own path, with the help of producer Brian Foote, her touring drummer Nick Johnson, and string players Sean McCann and Ryan York. Despite Conatus experiments, the vital elements of Zola Jesus sound - massive drums and Danilovas throatily majestic voice - are as unmistakable as ever. While Conatus isnt as direct as Stridulum, its still some of her most satisfying work. This is music made in and for the darkest hours, and a striking portrait of the times when crisis and opportunity meet.
