,cmoe,2011-10-12T14:54Z,"Tried downloading this one instead of the release by extremezone. Same thing - changing video options cannot be saved due to ""another user profile already existing"", saving the game doesnt work either due to ""corrupt save file found. please delete"". Even when making the folder for saves myself, using a downloaded savegame it doesnt work. this is a problem more people encountered, can you say something about this? and other people, can you save the game with this or another release?"
