On In the Pit of the Stomach, We Were Promised Jetpacks deliver songs that feel like a wallop to the gut. Much harder-hitting than their debut, These Four Walls, this album harnesses the power the band displayed before into a wall of sound that is as rousing as it is anguished, starting with Circles and Squares and only letting up for the occasional ballad. Their previous indie pop leanings are mostly gone, though Medicines driving post-punk has a tunefulness that makes it a standout. Their darkest and most complex work yet, In the Pit of the Stomach unleashes We Were Promised Jetpacks full fury with impressive results.
