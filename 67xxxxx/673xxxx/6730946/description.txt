Here we have 4 ultra obscure and hard to find LPs to listen and 


Lyon in Winter - As Winter Falls [1986]

It is a private press album out of New York from a multi-talented American musician. He works through 7 songs of synth pop rock with ease. Heâ€™s got a good voice to add to the overall package and a solid backing band who handles the percussion steadilyâ€¦.As in most cases when a Saxophone is present on these vinyl new wavers, it adds a nice touch throughout

The Contractions - Something Broke [1984]

An all girls triplet band consisted of Debbie Hopkins, Kathy Peck and Mary Kelley. Even their producer was a girl too. They made an attempt to ride the new wave bandwagon with this record, but as you know the rest is history. They remained obscure and without a contract.
