,white_arcades,2011-10-09T21:51Z,"Superb stuff Dan. John Foxx's ""Pleasures Of Electricity"" album cover is virtually a carbon copy of that RAF sleeve, wonder if that's pure coincidence? Cheers for the heads up on the Interplay album, a fine listen like you say and I'm going to see him perform it live here in Liverpool this month. 
Sorry to hear you're contemplating retirement, PB without 80z doesn't bear thinking about! Having said that we've been blessed with more than we could ever have hoped for. I can think of no finer benefactor on the net.
cheers mate"

[V],80zforever,2011-10-12T06:47Z,"welcome guys.

white_arcades, I had not thought of that before but I am sure John Foxx did not even know who RAF was lol by the way I hope life is back to normal for you. Enjoy the John Foxx concert. It's a shame we don't get to see him in North America. Cheers man"

[V],80zforever,2011-10-15T07:10Z,"Hi Johnny, thx for the comment and sorry for the error in Blue in Heaven rip. I have done a few rips from different vinyls and I was never happy with any of them. When I posted it i thought it was the best rip, but apparently I was wrong as I did not give it a listen. If time permits, I will re-upload it from a better source. saty cool! cheers"
