Kurt Hectic is back to save the universe. This time he is teamed with the genius Dr. Hawkins and the 6-legged gun-toting robotic dog, Max. Together they must out-sneak, out-blast and out-think their enemies as they attempt to reclaim earth from a vile alien menace... And this time he's in HD.
Overhaul Games brings MDK2 back to the PC in incredible high definition, with enhanced graphics, sound, and gameplay. See the classic action platformer the way it was meant to be seen, heard, and played... on a PC! Our crack team of commando developers have gone over every surface in the game with a steam cleaner, a paintbrush, and a laser cutter to make it as shiny and spectacular as possible. Your brain literally won't be able to tell the difference between the world of MDK2 HD and reality!
