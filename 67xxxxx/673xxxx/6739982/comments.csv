,Pakundo,2011-10-13T14:26Z,"After the so called installation, running the game exe file doesn't do anything.
I extracted the tar, and then also copied the contents of it to the folder above, still nothing."
,Stormfront73,2011-10-13T16:27Z,Hey alex i cant get this shit started whats up mate!
,zukke,2011-10-13T16:51Z,"Somewhat buggy!
Tried to Customize controls and CRASH!
Tried to use console (Â˝) and CRASH!
other than that itÂ´s been ok, good nostalgic gameplay!"
[T],alexisthebest,2011-10-13T17:31Z,"Sorry to those who cant seem to get this working.
I think people running 64-bit cant seem to run the game.

The game works, but from what i've seen, those people are running 32-bit.

Not 100% but that seems to be the case.

If your game works, please post what OS you're using and if you're running 32 or 64 bit. Thanks!"
,Stormfront73,2011-10-13T18:48Z,Im running vista 32 bit but still no luck wierd?
[T],alexisthebest,2011-10-13T19:54Z,"@Stormfront73

Yea. i'm not sure what the issue is.

I installed it on my computer and it doesnt run. I installed it on another computer which also runs Windows 7 64 bit and it runs on that computer.

I'm still not sure what the problem is but I'm going to try re installing visual c++ redistributable, .Net Framework and Direct X. I'm sure it'll work then."

Also thanks for the game. :)"
,Cyrez60659,2011-10-14T23:18Z,"Thanks for this. Seems to work fine on Win 7 32 bit. The frame rate isn't too good sometimes but definitley playable.

[T],ADHDerby,2011-10-20T23:23Z,"If the game doesn't start, try lowering the sample rate of your sound-card to 48000 Hz
Control Panel > Sound > select your default playback device > click Properties > Advanced Tab > change the sample rate to 48000 Hz"
,jvezirian,2011-12-24T20:16Z,48000hz fix worked for me... Running windows 7 64 bit home prem.
