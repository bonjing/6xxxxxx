,Great_Stillness,2011-11-13T09:54Z,"Nice one, thanks."
,stabzilla,2011-12-18T06:18Z,"Info says this is the AVC format, but when I get the files it is .mkv format.  does anyone know of a HD torrent that is PS3 compatible?"
,superaoe3,2011-12-27T23:26Z,"@stabzilla mkv is a container format.  Think like a zip file but without compression.  It actually contains a file for the video and a file for the audio.

MKV is a pretty common format for HD video, so you'll have most luck with SD releases.

Or

 You can ""demux"" (demix) and then ""remux"" the files into a single mpeg(H264/whatever), but you'll need twice the space to do that.

I have a ps3 myself and it sucks for playing HD videos from say a media server.  I really wish they would let us use NTFS."
,superaoe3,2011-12-27T23:31Z,look for the free program mkv2vob
,pseudoism101,2012-01-05T05:15Z,"i agree, mkv2vob works well"
