My Custom music for mount & blade games... Consists of many epic pieces from Hans Zimmer and X-Ray Dog...

Installation:
Just copy and paste the content from this folder to your game directory music folder (C:program files/mount & Blade/music... if you are using modules than the deafult path should be C:program files/mount & blade/modules, select the module you are using and go to the its music folder...) When asks to overwrite click yes..
that should be it... This is my first torrent so this is like some kind of tutorial for me... :)
