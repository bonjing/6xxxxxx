CD version

 \"The Secret Garden\" by David Sun, 1992

Enter an enchanted world of gentile sounds as this soft, tranquil music a path to your innermost being. The lightest touch of guitar strings hover and 

balance on the murmur of a garden stream. Birdsongs beckon you closer as the gentle caress of the music awakens inner sences. Immersed in the natural 

sounds and music, you are purified, energized and delighted.

Cover artwork for both CD and cassette by Danny Flynn.


NOTE: Although it\'s the same type of mediative, ambient music sharing the same title and artwork for both versions, the tracks are completely different 

on each. Obviously that\'s the reason I included both in the torrent. The quality of the Cassette version naturally is worse than that of the CD\'s. I 

used microsoft\'s sound recorder to copy it to my PC. But I guarantee the listening experience will pretty much be the same and maybe even better! That 

old cassette was the reason I bought the CD after all. But it wasn\'t the same.. Anyways! 
Happy listening!
