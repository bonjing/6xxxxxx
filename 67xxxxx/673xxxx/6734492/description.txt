This book is full of games you can use with your students to
teach any word families. (A starter list of word families and words
appears on pages 7 and 8.) Word families are by nature playful,
making games the perfect approach for teaching them. By
presenting this area of instruction in a playful way, you can
reinforce the idea that learning to read can be full of fun. Some of
the games, such as Ug, Ug, Bug! (see page 10), reinforce word
families through twists on traditional games. Other games, such as
Back to the Beehive (see page 23), come with reproducible activity
sheets for reinforcing the skill. There are quiet games, such as
Shake a Sound (see page 14), that children can play at their desks
independently or with partners, and more active group games, such
as Beach-Ball Word Builders (see page 9). The assortment of games
makes it easy for you to vary the way students learn about word
families, keeping their interest high as they strengthen reading
skills.
