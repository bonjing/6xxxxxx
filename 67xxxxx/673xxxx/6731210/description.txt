    Everyone is dying to meet their beautiful new neighbor. But soon         
    after the mysterious young widow moves into the quiet, little town of    
    Wilton, people start to die in bizarre and gruesome ways. Following      
    the trail of blood leads the local paper editor and town's physician     
    towards the lovely, lusty Claire Amworth. But her spell has cast its     
    shadow over a photographer named Jed who will stop at nothing to         
    defend her. Now the pair must find a way to rid the town of its most     
    beloved resident.
