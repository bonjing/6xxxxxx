INSTRUCTIONS:

Simply install (it's the trial off the maker's website, version 4.3) and replace janus4.exe with the one in the torrent. Now it's not a trial anymore! It's a keeper!

I got this from demonoid and repacked it with the latest version. Thanks for the great crack by the fine lads at dvt!

Tested virus free by kaspersky and gdata, and I've used it for a year. 

The only issue is occasional hanging, requiring restarting it, but it's uncommon and no biggie.

I'll seed this forever, but help a fellow out and seed a while. My dsl isn't too hot.
