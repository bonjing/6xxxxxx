,press2010,2011-10-11T16:15Z,"What is the difference between this one and:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6727484/MICROSOFT_OFFICE_2010_PROFESSIONAL__PLUS_X86_X64_SP1_%5Bthethingy%5D

Also, unless I am reading it wrong the link to the activator below seems to point to standard edition. Thanks."
[V],thethingy,2011-10-11T16:39Z,"press2010, that one lets you install 32 and 64 this one only installs 64, the activator link gives 2 ""permanent"" activators, one (the latest one) is for standard only and the other one (with 2000+ seeds) is for professional plus. "
,soletar,2011-10-12T03:03Z,"Mr Thethingy,

You have been extremely hard-working/generous this week. THANKS. I am a bit lot now with the flurry of uploads. Please what is the difference between the Microsoft office professional plus and the Combined edition?.

I thought Professional Plus was the ""ultimate"" edition, but the Combined edition seems to have more components. Thank you again"
,soletar,2011-10-12T03:03Z,"a bit ""lost""......not ""lot"""
,SSDfan,2011-10-12T04:52Z,"I know you have a permanent version back last year, but this one....is this torrent along with Visio and Project Professional ""Permanent""?

I rather use a Permanent method opposed to a KMS activation 6 month activation.

Please respond so I can download and seed."

,ReMO67,2011-11-04T13:21Z,"Hey,
I've downloaded and burned at slow speed (2 X).
Still I receive an error whilst installing.
I've seen changes in the registry but the program doesn't work.
I use Windows 7 Ultimate and have enough resources.
Help anyone?
thanks in advance"
,niebling,2011-11-07T03:57Z,"I had no problem with this installation.  I used the mini-KMS activator.  Downloaded torrent.  Extracted the files to a directory.  Cleaned up my hard disk, registry, defragged blah blah blah. Ran the setup customizing it to install proofing tools and only english.  Opened up each application that was installed and let them install if necessary.  Ran Windows update to install updates. Still didn't reboot yet.  Then ran the KMS activator (must install the service, start the service, and then activate MS OFFICE VL).  Rebooted and everything works snazzy.  Thanks Mr. Thingy.  180 days grace."
