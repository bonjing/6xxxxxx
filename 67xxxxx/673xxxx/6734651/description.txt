The Darkest Hour Part 2
With the kingdom on the verge of collapse and Morgana ready to attack, Arthur must carry on his mission to vanquish the Dorocha short-handed as Lancelot is racing back to Camelot taking a dying Merlin with him. Despite their journey to the Isle of the Blessed is filled with danger, the knights can't anticipate the sacrifice that Arthur has set his mind to make there. Friendship and loyalty are tested to the limit, but ultimately, it's the power of love which changes everyone's life forever.
