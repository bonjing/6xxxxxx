Providing all the temptation of a tasting menu on a much more versatile scale, this is an eclectic trip through the cuisines of the vast continent of Asia-from Turkey and Afghanistan, through Pakistan and India, and on to Southeast Asia, China, Korea, and Japan. The 90 recipes are clearly written with step-by-step instructions and icons which help to guide choices when grouping dishes to make up a menu. Keynote spreads throughout the book showcase ingredients integral to Asian cuisines. Asian Bites draws on the expertise of Tom Kime to bring you more than a collection of recipes, but also an education in the culinary traditions that abound across this vast continent.
