,TheLuc3nt,2011-10-12T21:58Z,Mp3? Why would you upload a tv-series in audioformat? Or am I understanding this in a wrong way?
,coolclay,2011-10-12T22:20Z,"Format is xvid and files are .avi

Looks standard to me."

Reading can really improve your understanding of things, you know.
May be you should try it sometime ;) ...

AVI is a video container format. The AVI files contain (among other things) two datastreams:
A videostream in XviD format (as stated in the description).
An Audiostream in MP3 format (also see description).

In Short: Yes you do! :D

,StanleyTheManly,2011-12-02T08:51Z,"Episode 2 of this is of very bad quality.  It gave me a headache.


However, every other episode is perfect.  I don't know whether this is a HDTVrip or DVDrip, I couldn't tell the difference.  Looked like a DVDrip, so that should tell ya something (very good quality).  Thanks for the upload."
,miguel0914,2011-12-31T22:34Z,Yes! Thank you for only season 4. Netflix had all the other seasons except this one and I could not just stop at the end of 3. This is honestly the best TV series I have ever seen in my entire life. AMC knows some drama.

Don't know what you guys are talking about:

On August 14, 2011, AMC announced that Breaking Bad was renewed for a fifth and final season consisting of 16 episodes. Bryan Cranston has said that the season will be split into two parts but AMC has not released a statement regarding this. Filming for the fifth season began on March 25, 2012. Bryan Cranston and Rian Johnson plan to direct some episodes. The season will premiere in July 2012, with the second half debuting in 2013.

Here is a cruel teaser for season 5:
