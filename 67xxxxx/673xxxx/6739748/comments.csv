I am looking for 7.0 please post the update torrent or full 7.0 client if you have it."

,lolbitsa,2012-01-18T20:06Z,"Yes you can now get the latest EU client from their website. I sent them an email and telling i made this torrent and said they can use it on their website if they want. :) 
To clear up some questions....this is legit, it is the EXACT SAME FREE CLIENT as you could get from their main website.

It is a very good game. Happy gaming folks! Oh and dont worry...its normal to be pisssed of at the beginning because you die alot and the tank is so slow :)"
,LCFer,2012-01-30T01:54Z,i can download this torrent and run the autopatch later right?
,lolbitsa,2012-03-21T23:55Z,"@LCFer Yes ofcourse, but why would you? Since I told the creators they made an own torrent. Alot more seeders there i'm sure.
At the time when i made this torrent there were no torrents at all with the game and the offical download was BIG and real slow.

Its a really good game, been playing it for months now. But beware, takes time to learn. Try to find a clan early to ask for tips..."
