A lot of this music is what has been played at stippers clubs
around this town for more than a decade now, as dance music.

I dropped one or two songs for complete lack of congruency with the
theme or lyrics that were not acceptable for a posting bearing my name
on the other hand I swapped some of the mp3 files with better version
ones from my library to give better quality on the same song. As well
Ive added some tracks to make the experience of the download enjoyable
based even on those added tracks in addition overall.

This is a 5CD offering at 320k - have fun - in good fashion amen!
