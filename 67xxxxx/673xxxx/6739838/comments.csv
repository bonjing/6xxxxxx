,BrianB420,2011-10-12T22:11Z,Thanks. Appreciative as always.
,trickdaddy0024,2011-10-12T22:47Z,So let me get this str8...Dumbo hates Romney but endorses Cain...Now Cain thinks he can pass this 9-9-9 BS Which will never pass. Instead of looking for a commander in chief. We are looking to hire a guy to deliver pizza or be FIRED within the next four years. I hope Cain wins so I could prove you Dumboheads wrong.END
,WillKane,2011-10-12T23:04Z,"hey dickdaddy, since dummycrats believe a simple majority is sufficient and filibusters are no longer tolerable, what do you think a Cain Presidency with a majority Senate would and could do?

Oooh, the dummycrats really made  a dumb chess move. 

You bring a knife to political fight, be prepared to have it served to you, with a twist."

,trickdaddy0024,2011-10-12T23:53Z,Listen WillNGrace bringing up political advantages in Washington means nothing to me. I'm not in Politics you idiot! Obama has No chance of winning in 2012 and Cain will fail badly with his Super Majority that will OWN the economy. Laugh Now Cry Later.END

,WillKane,2011-10-13T05:51Z,"you post crap in our torrents for Y E A R S, because we matter. 

No one here could give a shit about the oppositions opinions, but you waste Y E A R S whining on TPB about Rush.

Yet you contribute no content to TPB. Nice to see you so affected, that Rush makes you dance like a simpleton.
