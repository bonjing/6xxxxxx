Movie Review 


Nanda, another talented and unlucky actor, has been struggling to establish himself as a star in Tamil cinema. Jiivaâ€™s â€˜Vandhan Vendranâ€™ showed Nanda in a negative role. But, the mark he made with his performance in â€˜Eeramâ€™ and â€˜Kodambakkamâ€™ has gone waste because of his other outings that failed to register his name in the industry. 
â€˜Vellore Maavattamâ€™, for Nanda, is not only an out-and-out solo hero film it is also a high-voltage action packed powerful drama and Nanda doing a tough police officer. 
For a while when Madurai was set as backdrop for many action flicks â€˜Vellore Maavattamâ€™ has come as a relief taking Vellore district as its backdrop. 
The story revolves around the tough cop â€“ Muthukumar (Nanda), a young IPS officer newly posted in the district of Vellore â€“ who hunts down hardcore criminals, corrupt politicians and even the black sheep inside the police force who are ruling the district with their wrongful acts. Gurumoorthy (Azhagam Perumal) is the big baddie! 
Muthukumar falls in love with Priya (Poorna) and marries her. 
At one point of time, Muthukumar, steps back and quit the job of hunting those baddies. But, after the persuasion of his father he takes up his weapon again and starts his mission of crushing the wrongdoers and makes the district a corruption free and peaceful place to live in. 
Nanda as a rough and tough cop has definitely scored big points. The actor can be surely one of the major pluses of â€˜Vellore Maavattamâ€™. His anger and other expressions are good. Poorna, playing the female lead, does not have much work to do. Santhanamâ€™s comedy tries to tickle your funny bone. But, his double entendre is irritating. 
G M Kumarâ€™s acting is another part worth mentioning. 
After his romantic outing â€˜Masilamaniâ€™ with Nakul, R N R Manohar has come out with his action drama. He should have put some more work on the script front to include new and interesting twists and turns. In some places we tend to recall some scenes from the films â€˜Kaakka Kaakkaâ€™, â€˜Siruthaiâ€™ and many other cop films. 
â€˜Vellore Maavattamâ€™ team has worked hard. The film crew went to Indian Police Academy to study about the training and activities of a police officer and reflected in the script to make the film a different police story. 
Sundar C Babu has scored the music. Songs do not stay in mind, but background score is good. Na. Muthukumar and Thamarai have written the lyrics. 
Vetriâ€™s camera is another big plus of the film. He proves his mettle in action sequences. M G Murugan has done the editing. Really a good work! 
AGS Entertainment has produced another powerful movie in the series of their good films. Hats off, for having taken the risk of seeing Nanda as a police officer! 
Though the film gives a feel of those popular cop films its new look at some places and Nandaâ€™s acting skills make â€˜Vellore Maavattamâ€™ a different experience. 
You can sure visit this action packed â€˜Vellore Maavattamâ€™, but not more than once!
