If one is already on tracker."
[V],vAin4us,2011-10-09T19:53Z,"@ZUKTOR
This is a FLAC release and when I released it, it was unique..."
,vaporizebt,2011-10-09T23:32Z,is it just me getting no more than 4.0 kb/s  plzzzzz seeeeeeeeeeeeed
,oscartkoyou,2011-10-10T06:11Z,it would help if we had some fuckin seeders. serious guys. nobody is seeding. seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed !
[V],vAin4us,2011-10-10T07:37Z,"@pete101
Good point, still, the point of uploading multiple times is offering multiple sources :)"
,xeusoi16,2011-10-10T12:24Z,what type of fucking bullshit is this? there is not even a single seeder fuck this
[T],rjordan21,2011-10-10T12:34Z,"These files are exactly the same, bit by bit, as the files ZUKTOR uploaded.  The EAC log is even the same. You re-uploaded his torrent or the same one from another site.  Either way, diluting the seed bank and flooding TPB with yet another duplicate. Hey mistakes happen, but there is nothing ""unique"" about this torrent at all. "
,ZUKTOR,2011-10-10T13:04Z,"@vAin4us U could save original forlder name, that comes from what.cd,so dht could work between two  different torrents."
,garlic2n8t,2011-10-10T18:24Z,fake!!!!!! if you want to check a fake just click on files and if its blank its a fake!!!!
[V],vAin4us,2011-10-11T22:43Z,"Folks, I'm sorry, it is indeed from what.cd, I'm sorry, I was convinced it was a unique upload.

@garlic2n8t

It might be duplicate, but it's not fake."
[T],rjordan21,2011-10-12T03:24Z,"^^^^^ Like I said, mistakes happen.  ROCK ON!

*** THIS IS NOT FAKE ***

I verified with Audiochecker V1.2.  All tracks CDDA with probability 100%.

vAin4us is a trusted member of this community.  While not omniscience, give him/her some credit for not uploading a fake torrent.		"
,ZUKTOR,2011-10-12T09:25Z,"Ppl who says that torrent is fake just trying to prevent other from getting it, I think they put rating down too. Maybe work for copywriters."
,tokyoanimeme,2011-10-13T22:52Z,can anyone confirm this rls?
[T],rjordan21,2011-10-14T02:37Z,"^^^ what specifically do you mean by ""confirm""?"
,saequa253,2011-10-14T06:10Z,"jesus guys, seed please !!!!!!!! dl'ding so slow atm."
