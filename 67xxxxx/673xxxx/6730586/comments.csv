,Whobuysgames,2011-10-09T16:03Z,also there are are still missing floor panels...
,vultan,2011-10-09T16:57Z,Yep at the arena and forward you just fall trough the floor and die cuz there is no place onm the whole map to spawn :(
,D_W01,2011-10-09T22:55Z,"I think, I'll just buy it. Its buggy, and missing files is not worth trying to redownload it via torrent. From what I played, It seems fun, but I broke it becouse its not the full game."
,kattwuver202a,2011-10-15T05:30Z,for some reason this didnt fix it for me. there are still LOADES of missing textures and the lighting is still crazy. i put it in my scenes folder but didnt work. any help?
,gideon_96,2011-10-24T10:42Z,this fixed a lot of things for me but now I can't play on Chokepoint and the maps after it because the floor between the rift and the gates is missing and while the orcs can walk on air the apprentice can't....
