If you're looking at this torrent, trying to determine whether or not you should download it, then chances are you already know of Xfire.  And some might wonder why I've chosen to upload a free program.  I have chosen to upload this particular version because with the help of a fellow user, The Blog, I have constructed a portable Xfire client that has been tested and evaluated.  See the website for all you can do.  See the blog for details on what I did
