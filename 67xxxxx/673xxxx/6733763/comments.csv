,john4551,2011-10-10T12:31Z,thanks boobman any idea whwn a working driver rf or pal will hit ptb
[T],Sunblock.,2011-10-10T13:17Z,im not sure what u mean but there is full working driver here. There is no way around new XGD3 if that you mean. You need to get LT 2.0 is the only way.
[V],boobsman,2011-10-10T15:36Z,"@john4551, this game is xgd2 you need LT1.9 or above to play it and there is no way round that. As Sunblock has already said xgd3 games need LT2.0 so you may as well reflash no or you will not be ablw to play the latest games that are released."
