Since his 2007 debut, this young Glaswegian producers peak-time club spin on mainstream RnB and rap has, in an intrepid fashion, grown increasingly hyperactive, thrill-oriented, and indulgent. On Glass Swords, Rustie continues to integrate the currently hip and terminally unhip - garish probes of 80s synth rock, dance-pop, 90s rave, and bass music.
