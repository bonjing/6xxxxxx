,southak,2011-10-12T20:03Z,Why is this being uploaded now when series eight was broadcast last year?
,southak,2011-10-12T20:14Z,"Guys you are mis-naming these files, I just realised. Series 8 was last year, this year is series nine. Zoe ball did NOT present this show in 2010. So either the description is wrong or the name is. Can anyone confirm which?"
,Chenoa2,2011-10-14T09:50Z,"Not sure, but I think the first series of the main show did not have the accompanying It Takes Two, hence it is now only series 8 of that show (ITT), while the main programme (SCD) is on series 9. Would love to know if the main shows after Ep 3 are going to be uploaded. If I had to choose between the two I would much prefer the main programme of Strictly Come Dancing be uploaded regularly than ITT which is more secondary given it is about the show itself. Of course, I hope both programmes are covered for the whole season as I love them both. So please, can we have the SCD programmes which are missing. :-)"
