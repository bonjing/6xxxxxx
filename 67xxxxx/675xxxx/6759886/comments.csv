,grazza72,2011-10-29T06:40Z,Great thanks YIFY!
,trick721,2011-11-13T06:48Z,"31 kbps audio? Maybe I'm missing some miraculous codec, but this sounds terrible. "
,luisfer26,2012-02-01T04:11Z,Sound on this one is terrible. Not the first YIFY rip I've encountered with sound issues. YIFY has some great rips but not very reliable when it comes to sound and sync. I hope they fix this because otherwise quality and file size are great.
,spunkster,2012-02-06T05:49Z,"The video is great but the audio is absolutely awful. I'm pretty sure the other people who reviewed it didn't watch it all the way through. It starts fine but gets progressively worse. About halfway through, it starts stuttering, like you're talking through a spinning fan. At first I thought it was intentional, like an old crackling record effect. By the last half hour it's unwatchable. It's like a whisper slowly turning into a scream, and it doesn't stop. 
I had to dl another version. Skip this."
,fillipe_gooz,2012-02-10T18:12Z,V 9 / SOUND IS AWFUL
,grablife,2012-02-18T10:19Z,Great video. Audio is like calling Bangladesh on Skype. 
,iamcims,2012-03-20T13:49Z,"LOL how in the hell did the audio get so fucked up?

The video quality is outstanding 10/10
Audio is poor. and sounds like the source is not a cam but just really compressed, as someone revealed.

shame."
,mCihhh,2012-05-08T16:07Z,"Although the video quality is good, the sound is just plain awful
and I'm with luisfer26, this is not the first YIFY release to have the audio so fucked up.
It usually have very low quality but this is just unwatchable.

I wish he had some minimum requirements when it comes to sound
and not release something so poor as this release :"
