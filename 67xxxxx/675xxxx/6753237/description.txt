Free Software is not about price. It is about Freedom. Richard Stallman started the Free Software movement, and is probably the biggest computer hero in modern times. He is probably the single most important reason for the GNU/Linux OS being what it is today.

Richard Stallman explains why computer freedom - and freedom in general - is important, and the difference between \\\"open source\\\" and free software.

The interview is highly recommended, specially if you are using that non-free closed-source OS with NSA back-doors from the corporation who\\\"s CEO regularly pushes implantable microchips.
