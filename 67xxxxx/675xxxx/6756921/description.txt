Gorillas, one of our closest living relatives, are the largest living primates, and teeter on the brink of extinction. This study offers the first comparative perspective on gorilla populations throughout their natural range, and covers all known subspecies. Discussing phylogeny, evolution, functional morphology, behavioral ecology and conservation biology, this multidisciplinary work will be essential reading for primatologists, anthropologists, animal behaviorists and evolutionary biologists.
