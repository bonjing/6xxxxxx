12 "Logan" October 14, 2011
"RÅgan" (ç‹¼çœ¼ï½žLOGAN)  March 25, 2011[9] 
The episode resumes from the end of the previous with Logan's wounds healing in an instant and he fights Shingen. 
Shingen smacks Wolverine off a ledge and down through the hollow core of the castle. As Hideki brings a noncompliant 
Mariko to his office, he pulls out the A.I.M. poison dart gun from a secret safe, in the event Logan shows up for him. 
Hideki hears a nosie in the next room, and hears Logan injured. As he is going to shoot Logan, Shingen returns to stop 
him and finish his fight with Logan. As Shingen readies to cut off Logan's head, Yukio intervenes, only to be seriously 
injured with Shingen barely having a scratch. Hideki prepares to shoot Logan, Mariko tries to stop him, but is rendered 
unconscious. Kikyo intercepts the dart and removes enough of the poison to not kill him. Logan cuts Shingen's sword and 
tears his kimono, but finds he was wearing an exo-armor, made of Vibranium and Steel, this whole time. The battle goes 
on to where the two dive out of a window and land in a filled pool. As the battle rages, Hideki takes an unconscious Mariko 
and Kikyo helps Yukio. Wolverine and Shingen leave the pool with Yukio and Kikyo watch. Meanwhile, Hideki brings Mariko to 
his father's secret tomb and tells her he was the one who poisoned his father for his criminal empire, because he wanted to 
show he was a worthy successor even though his father belittled him. Hideki activates a bomb that will destroy the palace 
in 3 minutes. Logan gains the upper hand and puncture Shingen's throat with his claws. Logan holds him long enough for Yukio 
to kill Shingen to avenge his parents. She collapses from blood loss and confesses to killing Asano. She says she is ashamed 
for doing so and considers Logan a friend as she dies in his arms. Kikyo takes Logan to the catacombs to find Mariko and 
Hideki- who is restraining Mariko from deactivating the bombs. While in an elevator, Kikyo and Logan feel the shock of 
explosives blowing up the palace and pry open the elevator. The two make it to the bunker and lift open the door to the tomb. 
Kikyo holds the door long enogh for Logan to get in. Hideki holds Mariko hostage and shoots Logan as he approaches. 
The dart pumps a little amount of the poison into Logan, but is enough to seriously harm him even with his healing factor. 
Hidkei pulls a gun and plans to put a bullet in Logan's head. Mariko defends Logan saying that Hideki will have to kill her 
if he wants to hurt Logan, to which he slaps her aside. But as he does so, Logan tackles him, injects the dart into Hideki, 
and kills him. As Logan poisoned Hideki, he shot a round which fatally wounded Mariko, who dies in Logans arms. 
Logan buries her on a cliffside and later gives Kikyo his duel.
