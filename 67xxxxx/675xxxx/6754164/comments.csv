,graysonmac,2011-10-30T20:17Z,Hey man. i clicked and dragged the files to the the Oblivion data folder but it didnt work. by extract you mean use stuffit or something like that?
,_0blivi0n_,2011-10-31T21:16Z,"Yes, extract the .esp and .bsa files to the data folder using winrar, stuffit, 7zip, or whatever archival/compression program you use. There is also a DLCList.txt file included in each of the rar archives, though only one of them is needed.

Enable the DLC by clicking the Data Files option in Oblivion's launcher and checkmark the box for each addon you want to use."
