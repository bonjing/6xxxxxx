  An audacious hidden camera series with Chris Hollins. An acting       
  rogue tradesman tries to rip people off in their own homes using      
  well-known con tricks to show us all how easy it can be to be taken   
  in.                                                                   
                                                                        
  Roger turns up the heat about a pretend carbon monoxide leak, in the  
  home of Lancashire business-woman Joy. Will she pay him a fortune to  
  remove the spiders' nest that he claims is blocking her boiler flue?  
  He has more hot air in store for Berkshire social worker Stephanie -  
  but she subjects him to tough questions when he tries to fumigate     
  her bathroom as a cure for her mouldy ceiling.                        
                                                                        
  Plus, our cameras are present to catch the conviction of a Bristol    
  driveway rogue, whose tradesmen ploughed up people's driveways when   
  they'd gone out shopping for the day.
