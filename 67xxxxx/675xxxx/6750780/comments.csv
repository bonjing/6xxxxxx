,Rumpledog,2011-10-17T21:10Z,Just wanted to clarify that the addon works fine for me with w7. Ty upper
,jontoupin,2011-10-17T22:48Z,your error is because you use the real railwork not a cracked one i dont know why but steam is able to block some asset to show in the game. just download a pirated copy of the games and you will be allright
,Deadgit,2011-10-18T04:24Z,"Thanks RailGamer for this, your uploads are always great."
,BigUglyMotha,2011-10-18T05:37Z,"Great up, but I'm having difficulties driving this thing. For some reason the Train won't go forward. I once got to the 2nd station in a scenario and then the train refused to budge. a manual would be nice. Otherwise really nice sceneries, thnx man !"
,RailGamer,2011-10-18T15:45Z,@BigUglyMotha If you are driving the class 86 make sure you don't give it full throttle out of the station! if you find it ain't moving just set the throttle to idle and press the reset button wait a minute or so then throttle it out gently take it all the way to 100% throttle for about 2 seconds then take it to 50% throttle then you should start to pull away slowly.
,themilflover,2011-10-18T16:19Z,"Tried this on a legit version of RailWorks 2012 and in doesnât work. Same with Portsmouth route and a number of addons. Why?
Horseshoe, Isle of Wight and China Clay work with no problem - even when connected to Steam!
Also tried SKIDROW's, with the 4 updates applied!, but that also refuses to run."
,RailGamer,2011-10-18T17:25Z,"@themilflover i am afraid you will need to uninstall completely the official version of Train Simulator 2012 (But make sure you copy Assets, Content & manuals folders before uninstalling) as these contain your add-on's you already have then download completely SkidRows version install that apply update 4 copy the 3 files from the crack folder into ""Programs RailSimulator.com"" then download the add-ons you want and Bob's your Auntie's Uncle!!"
,ranny528,2011-10-18T21:48Z,jontoupin Thankyou very much I did as you mentioned and everything works and if anything it runs smoother without steam running. Many thanks for the upload railgamer and jontoupin thanks for the advice.
,BigUglyMotha,2011-10-18T22:15Z,"Thnx RailGamer for your advice and your great upload, much appreciated ! This game is far out."
