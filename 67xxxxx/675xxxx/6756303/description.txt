martina cole -The Take,mobi,KK


Freddie Jackson is just out of prison. Heâ€™s done his time, made the right connections, and now he's ready to ise them. His wife Jackie dreams of having her husband home, but sheâ€™s forgotten the rows, the violence and the girls Freddie canâ€™t leave alone. 

Bitter, resentful and increasingly unstable, Jackie sees her life crumble while her little sister Maggieâ€™s star rises. In love with Freddieâ€™s cousin Jimmy, Maggie is determined not to end up like her sister. 

Families should stick together but behind closed doors, jealousy and betrayal fester until everyoneâ€™s life is infected. For the Jacksons, loyalty cannot win out. In their world you can trust no one. In their world everyone is on the take


Enjoy!
