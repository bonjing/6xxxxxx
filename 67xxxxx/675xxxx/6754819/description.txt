128 KBps CD quality version of Dream Theater\\\\\\\'s Newest Album

Dream Theaterâ€™s knack for balancing the epic and the intimate has been a constant throughout the bandâ€™s lengthy evolution. The group first came together in 1985, when Petrucci, Portnoy and bassist John Myung were students at Bostonâ€™s Berklee School of Music.

A Dramatic Turn of Events is an album born from transition, crafted with studied persistence and possessed by newfound freedom and free-flowing invigoration. The album strikes the perfect balance between Dream Theater\\\\\\\'s intimate history with all that is heavy, progressive and melodic with each element fully realized. Longtime fans of the band intrigued by the speediness of the notes on display from Dream Theater have much to study on the album, while fans of melodic hooks will find equal pleasure within the songs.
