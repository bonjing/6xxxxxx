,mjyumping2,2011-10-20T08:30Z,"PLEASE SEED!
How to Seed?
1. After you finished your download, don't close the downloader you have used. Whether its Uttorent or Flashget, etc.
2. I know you are excited with this game. Please dont close the Downloader even after you installed the game and even when you're playing the game. Please do this as a favor. Thank you."
,AnamikaMogha,2011-10-20T08:31Z,"I think the crack files needs to be in the ""bin"" folder of the sims 3 base game. Just trying to help i'm not sure though as my downloading is still in progress. Pardon my bad english."
,mjyumping2,2011-10-20T09:04Z,"@AnamikaMogha
You are right. The crack files should be placed on ""/Electronic Arts/The Sims 3/Game/Bin"" Folder and NOT on the Pets folder.
This way of cracking was started since the Generations was released."
,chaoticsuicide,2011-10-20T09:06Z,A fix to the problem I was having when the game would error and say A problem has caused your program to stop working  if you added a mod folder to your game delete it. That will fix the error. the whole folder not just the mods. I think it is the recource.cfg that is used for the games before this one. When I deleted teh mods themselves it still errored on me when I deleted the mods and the resource.cfg it stopped. I will gladly play without mods untill that file can be updated.

,KalChoedan,2011-10-25T18:31Z,"Looks to me like Fairlight truly fucked up with this release, the game now includes some authentication code which has NOT been cracked.  The result is, if you install this, your game will be unplayable, even if you subsequently uninstall.  Wait for a new crack on this one, people."
,KalChoedan,2011-10-25T19:19Z,"I take it back.  If you put the crack in the wrong place (the old location - the game directory for whatever expansion you're installing) it /looks/ like the crack doesn't work.

If of course you put the crack in the /right/ location - just the main Sims3/game folder - it works just fine.

,tasha2450,2011-10-26T11:41Z,"Okay Guys I installed this and it works just fine!!

This is what I did:

Mounted ISO file
Began Installation..
Updated Game (This happens before installation)
Entered Keygen= EGGG-JNX8-O1PF-QCFU-2FLT
Installed Origin
Installation Complete..

NOW Once installation is complete you must then Copy two files called ""TS3W.exe"" and ""TSLHost.dll"" from Sims3EP05/Fairlight/Game/Bin (the MOUNTED DRIVE by Right-Clicking it and selecting Open) 
Paste them to *(C:) Program Files/Electronic Arts/The Sims 3/Game/Bin [COPY & REPLACE!!]

*Or whatever drive you have installed the Sims 3 to.

Once done in that same folder right-click the ""TS3W.exe"" file and send to desk-top to make a shortcut. Now go to your desktop,click it and play!

Hope this works for you, Happy Simming :)

,ppbb,2011-10-26T17:09Z,To avoid the crash after starting the game you should probably disable visual themes. Right click on the desktop icon > properties > compability.

I have an original copy of The Sims 3 I've downloaded this expansion and installed it in my Mac but it doesn't work because it says that I have to insert the cd. When I try to open the crack I can't because it's a .exe file,any help guys?thanks :D"
,JuYeon,2011-11-16T11:21Z,Thank you extremezone!!!!! Your the best! Stay Nice always
,DoctorHyper826,2011-11-16T20:36Z,ok so there was no .exe file in this torrent when I downloaded it. Care to explain???
,DoctorHyper826,2011-11-16T20:49Z,"Nevermind, I went back 3 pages to fiund out what to do, Basically sing uniextract extract files from .iso. and all necassry files should be there."
,ladykittyn,2011-11-22T21:05Z,I have tried the exact directions that other people have been giving in order for this to work and all I keep getting is a blank screen at loading with my cursor spinning around and around. I wait forever and cant even alt tab out of the screen or ctrl shift esc to shut the program down. I keep having to shut off the computer manually and restart. If ANYONE has a suggestion on how to get the game to work other than what has already been suggested let me know. All my system requirements match up btw. 
,Sakyy7,2011-11-25T17:26Z,"i finished tthe instalattion i cant crack it. but, somehow i can run the game but i get ''we are unable to verify that your disc is valid copy of the sims 3 pets. please contact customer service.'' what is that??? o.O"
,oievelina88,2011-11-28T15:23Z,"Otherwise this is good torrent but my animals look like nuclear waste mutants. When I tried to create a cat or a horse they just seem like the mesh is totally fucked up. I have tried everything: updating my graphics, deleting all mods and reinstalling the game... nothing works. I have two years old compaq notebook,  bought 4GB RAM to it, Windows 7. All the other expansions work fine... If anyone else have this same problem IÂ´d be happy to know what to do.
IÂ´m so sad because I waited to make cats(I love them) and now my hopes are crushed....
And p.s. IÂ´m not saying the flaw is in the torrent maybe this expansion just doesnÂ´t work on my computer."
,dafaq,2011-11-29T15:55Z,THIS WORKS PERFECTLY FINE! GREAT WELL DONE EXTREMEZONE!! Next I'm going to download Skyfuckingrim! :DD
,Katalina7,2011-12-02T00:35Z,It says there is no disk found. O.o?!
,jolindeex,2011-12-03T16:19Z,The installation went well but when i open the game it says: We do not know if it is legal. And then it close. Can somebody help ? plz
,shadow88kissed,2011-12-08T20:31Z,"Everyone has been posting questions about the whole 'Disc Authorization Error', does anyone know a solution? I just installed all the torrents for world adventures, ambitions, and now this one.. "
,marvalllll,2011-12-10T14:30Z,"I THINK YOU GUYS SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO THE CRACK. ""TS3W.EXE"" ITS THE BASE GAME'S CRACK. NOT THE PET'S CRACK. SO, YOU GUYS HAVE TO COPY IT TO THE BASE GAME'S FOLDER, NOT TO THE ONE YOUVE INSTALLED.

FOR YOUR OWN GAME'S SAFETY, BEFORE YOU CRACK IT, YOU SHOULD COPY IT INTO ANOTHER FOLDER (AS A BACKUP) SO IF THE CRACK DOESNT WORK, YOU CAN BACK IT UP."
,shadow88kissed,2011-12-10T15:34Z,"I will try that, thank you :)"
,mangabro7,2011-12-13T20:53Z,PPL who say it says u need a disk geez just download a doam
,applepiesteph,2011-12-15T02:36Z,"Hey, where do I find the KeyGen? Thanks"
,umhelloexcuseme,2011-12-21T13:06Z,"So I've downloaded, installed, and gotten past the whole ""can't verify blah blah blah"". And now! Now that it wants to update my gamee, I don't want to let it because it says to either remove my ""mods"" (referring to my downloading of Pets and Generations) or to get updated versions. So I didn't let it, and it kept crashing when loading a game/family, so I updated. and well. Nothing's been fixed. What the fuck do I do in this situation."
,umhelloexcuseme,2011-12-21T13:08Z,"Just to clear up my above comment, when I say I updated, I let the game update itself. It couldn't even get through the entire update because a file wasn't found. Yesterday, upon updating BEFORE applying the cracks, it was giving me the ""can't verify blah blah blah"" message. Am I just fucked over or am I doing something wrong?"
,umhelloexcuseme,2011-12-21T13:12Z,"Another clarification of the above, when I said that before, I had updated before applying cracks, and then recently, I applied cracks and then updated, This was done because I had to do a system recovery.. Just clearing that up. I had no other option. Before the system recovery it wouldn't even open the launch screen..."
,Maikeru79,2011-12-22T00:32Z,when it comes to Sims 3 do you have to crack all the games as you install or is it like Sims 2 and only have to crack the most recent game??
,Wraithlord55,2012-01-06T11:39Z,"this game works fine,but when i go to create a dog or cat,they look strange,why they are glitched?Somebody PLEASE HELP!!!"

Can anyone help me fix this? Do I have to reinstall with a different key or can I avoid it by booting up without the launcher somehow?"
,surentck,2012-03-22T10:17Z,Is this just the addon or the game+addon
,Connie13,2012-03-29T13:01Z,it says disc authorization problem.
