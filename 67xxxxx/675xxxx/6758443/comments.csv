,soletar,2011-10-20T20:08Z,"YIFY, of recent i have noticed a lot of people come to post nasty, false stuff about the quality of your torrents. You are my favorite uploader and i noticed you have been getting many unwarranted negatives....

For me all ur movies are A-10
                                       V-10

thanks for all your work, and haters...go f.... urselves"
