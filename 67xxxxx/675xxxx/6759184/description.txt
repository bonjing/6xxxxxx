With a new Consumerism chapter, enhanced art and photos, and timely updates, this Second Edition of Nutrition & You personalizes nutritionâ€“helping you make healthy nutrition choices and encouraging you to become an informed consumer of nutrition information.

 

Throughout, each vitamin and mineral are introduced in self-contained spreads, called Visual Summary Tables, that help you learn to identify the key aspects of each nutrient at a glance. Youâ€™re encouraged to relate the science of nutrition to your own dietary habits, helping you to separate fact from fiction and to distinguish high-quality nutrient sources from those of lesser quality. After reading this book, youâ€™ll know to think critically about information sources and the claims made in the popular press and online.
