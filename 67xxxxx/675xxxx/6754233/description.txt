This.Is.Jinsy.S01E06.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 116MB]

[/b][/color] Jinsy boasts nine parishes of huge beauty and incredible diversity (ten, if you include the largely unsavoury parish of Kraw): from the silt-banks of West Zententerton to the mud-crags of Pondarea, from the serated cliff-mounds of Nool parish to the grassy-under-ridgettes of Helleetertrond (now reopened to the public and officially declared non-toxic).

This is Jinsy is a surreal comedy show set on the fictional island of Jinsy.
As of now only the Pilot has aired and a series commissioned by Sky to air in Summer 2011.
