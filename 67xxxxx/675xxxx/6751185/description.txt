The â€œYeah Captainâ€œ album was recorded in 1969 and it was the first album of its type produced in Australia, a milestone!Music ranges between heavy psychedelic rock and poetic acid folk â€“ both in an outstanding level. Trevor sang and played all instruments, creating a perfect full band sound, that really blows. An original album, is near impossible to find â€“ also included 2 bonustracks by Trevors 45 record, that was also recorded on Nationwide Recordings Adelaide. Contains additional artistic statements by Trevor in form of paintings! â€“ A piece by one man with various talentsâ€“an absolute must!

cd ripped by me using EAC so that it has a 100% log and a cue and all that stuff.

please seed
