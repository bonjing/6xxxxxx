Filmmaker Walther Grotenhuis investigates the origin of three products that come from far, but we are quite common: soybeans from Brazil, shrimp from the Philippines and beans from Kenya. Parallel to this story we see how these products are prepared in a dinner buffet for a staff party. Where does this food come from?

A world of food throughout the year is on our plate and changing the world. Food groups like vegetables and meat travels around the world and are still at an affordable price on the shelves. The world has become our supermarket.

But what is really the price to pay for our food? Who knows where our food comes from, through whose hands it has gone, who has earned it and who is harmed by it?"
