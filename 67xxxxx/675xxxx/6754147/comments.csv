Downloading now at 500+kbs, dont let the low leechers and seeders scare you.

Going to reinstall FNV on this pc and then the addons.
Will comment again if it works!"

,GhoStPaw,2011-10-19T13:08Z,Kinda bs im uploading 100 kb/s and downloading 2.2 kb/s
,_0blivi0n_,2011-10-19T20:08Z,"I agree it's BS, but considering that I just barely posted it and my upload rate sucks, patience would be a virtue at this point. Hopefully things will improve once we get more seeders."

,MALicouseWAREhouse,2011-11-07T09:04Z,Does anyone know if these works with skidrow update 7?
,_0blivi0n_,2011-11-10T17:52Z,"Just to clarify, these files were pulled directly from my Steam installation and I have not confirmed that they work with cracked versions of the game.

As far as I know, Bethesda hasn't incorporated any additional DRM to prevent it from working so long as your game is up to date, but I could be wrong.

@islansun
This DLC will not update/patch your game for you, you'll have to do this yourself by downloading the patch from Bethesda's website.

Since I haven't tested it myself, I would appreciate feedback from anyone that did or didn't get it to work with the latest patch."
,_0blivi0n_,2011-11-10T17:56Z,"Correction:

Only Dead Money, Honest Hearts, and Old World Blues were part of my original installation. Everything else was downloaded here at TPB and works perfectly on my system."

,adolfobia,2012-01-29T03:27Z,"i have oficial steam game, can i install this without getin banned?"
,ante0,2012-02-18T12:11Z,"@adolfobia: No, you will not get banned.
You will have to place them in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\fallout new vegas\data

If you now installed steam to the default path, else you will have to find it."
,TBear420,2012-03-12T15:45Z,"so i tried unpacking just to the data folder, and also into a folder (i.e. story add-ons)  and neither way shows up on my dlc list might i have to re-install?"
