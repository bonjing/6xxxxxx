Former ""Baraka Boy"" pleads guilty in drug conspiracy

A 13-year-old Romesh Vance (seen at right) sat on a Baltimore carousel eight years ago, spinning slowly as he predicted his future.

""I think all our lives [are] going to be bad now,"" he said.

The statement was captured on camera by the documentary filmmakers following his journey â€” and its premature end â€” at the Baraka boarding school in Kenya, which gave a handful of disadvantaged city boys the chance to study in Africa. The school was unexpectedly closed in 2003.

On Wednesday, a 21-year-old Vance pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to participating in a drug conspiracy involving nearly two dozen people who allegedly sold cocaine and crack out of the Gilmor Homes public housing complex, The Sun's Tricia Bishop reports.

He faces a minimum of five years in prison at his sentencing, set for Feb. 22.
