Mr. West was the first feature film that Kuleshov made with a team of actors who had attended his Experimental Cine-Laboratory.  For four years, this group had been doing preparatory work as they planned to reform the art of cinema with an eye on montage.  Yet, for a long time, their ideas remained dry theory, because the workshop lacked resources to make films.  The focus of the Cine-Lab's practice was on acting Ã©tudes.  Details of scenes were story-boarded, photographed, or "framed" by special viewfinders in order to visualize how they might look in an edited film sequence.  Thanks to these exercises, the notion of montage that Kuleshov developed was inextricably linked to his ideas on acting and shot composition.  What he was aiming for was the aesthetics of American action films.  he admired them for their fast pace, well-wrought suspense, athletic performances, as well as narratively efficient framing and editing - in short, for everything that was missing from languid boudoir melodramas, which dominated the Russian screen before the Revolution.  Kuleshov's understanding of "American montage" came down to this essential rule:  each scene must be composed of brief sequences, filmed in close-ups or medium shots from different angles, so as to draw attention to the key phases of the character's movement and the most important details of his environment.
