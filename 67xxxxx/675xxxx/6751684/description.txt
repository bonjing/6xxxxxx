"Eye of the Beholder"

Castle & Beckett work a murder case around 
the theft of a valuable sculpture. Kristin 
Lehman ("The Killing") guest stars as 
Serena Kaye, a smart, sexy insurance 
investigator, who joins Castle & Beckett in 
the investigation, but she also has her 
eyes set on Castle, all the while hiding a 
very important secret from the team.
