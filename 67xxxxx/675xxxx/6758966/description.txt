 The Essential Self-Massage video is a guided program presented in a
 relaxed and informal massage-along style. Each of the program's 11
 chapters addresses a different body part, so you can use the video as
 a focused treatment (if you don't have enough time you would just
 perform the head massage to clear the five senses) or as a whole body
 routine.
 
 What really sets this video apart from the others is its production
 quality and the great wealth of included information.
