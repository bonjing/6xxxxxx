,strike_pe,2011-10-28T23:54Z,Why cant i see the swesub in the movie when i stream from Azurus to my sony TV? 
,Tazadar3,2011-12-02T19:01Z,"Sounds strange, coz the swesub file is burned into the file/movie. Only thing i can think of is a ratio problem when u watch it on ur tv. Maybe its zoomed so u dont see the subs, but u have prolly tried to change that on ur tv(16:9, normal, zoom etc)."
