'Voices' is the album which launched Kenny Thomas and his two biggest hit singles - 'Outstanding' and 'Best Of You'. He has an effortless and genuine charm and it's surprising he never became a bigger star. This album feels a little like George Benson or even Vandross with it's american-sounding production. Best tracks on the album except the hits are 'Voices' where the entire song is made up of vocal samples, withour sounding like Bobby McFerrin, and 'Something Special' which is a real soppy ballad for those totally infatuated with someone - as I was back in the day. an extra mix of 'Best Of You' is alright but you often think it could have been left out in favour of another song. An easy listening, comfortable CD to put on to relax or romance to. Class.
