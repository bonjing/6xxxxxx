Jascha Horenstein's famed 1969 recording of Mahler's Symphony No. 1 in D with the London Symphony. OOP in the US (possibly elsewhere) at present time. Released on the Unicorn label, this is a transfer to CD of a high-quality, four-track Barclay-Crocker open reel tape made in the 1980s from the original Unicorn master tape.
