""The Curious case of Benjamin Button""
Anyway, watch the movie, it is very good. :)"
,fasterthanlight,2011-10-19T13:51Z,"And change ""beleive"" to ""believe"".
Cant edit the info on TPB.
Well, I guess you understand it anyway. :) "
,fasterthanlight,2011-10-19T14:14Z,"Dont know what is happening. I am seeding, but it doesnt show it on TPB.
Weird. Keep on trying, this showis best at 720p. :)"
,fasterthanlight,2011-10-19T14:16Z,
,bon-bongo,2011-10-20T11:30Z,Is anyone get even 1 byte from this seed ? I suspect foul play. Or extreme case of stupidity.
,bon-bongo,2011-10-20T11:33Z,I guess we all better with this link http://www.rlswire.com/tv-shows/being-erica-s04e04-720p-web-dl-aac-2-0-h-264-eci
,fasterthanlight,2011-10-20T14:21Z,"No foul play here. Something is wrong, dont know what.
I tried to remove the torrent file and upload a new one, but TPB wont let me delete it, and wont let me upload another version of the file. Sorry. :)
My other torrents works."
,fasterthanlight,2011-10-20T14:22Z,Hmm?
,fasterthanlight,2011-10-20T14:27Z,?
,bon-bongo,2011-10-20T16:49Z,"I downloaded episode from link above and now seeding it. In several hours (ADSL 1 only) enough seeds will be ready. Too great series to waste it watching non HD.

   Si vis pacem, para bellum."
,fasterthanlight,2011-10-20T17:04Z,"Great. Thank you, bon-bongo :)"
,fish121,2011-10-20T17:13Z,"bon-bongo: thanks for the link. A/V = 10

fasterthanlight: There must have been a glitch at TPB. I've DL'd from you before - always excellent quality.
I appreciate the effort.

Cheers !"
,fasterthanlight,2011-10-20T17:53Z,"Thnx, and cheers fish121. :)"

The Hacker Manifesto
By +The Mentor+++
Written January 8, 1986

Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers. ""Teenager Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal"", ""Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering""...

Damn kids. They're all alike.

But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain, ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker? Did you ever wonder what made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?

I am a hacker, enter my world...

Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...

Damn underachiever. They're all alike.

I'm in junior high or high school. I've listened to teachers explain for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction. I understand it. ""No, Ms. Smith, I didn't show my work. I did it in my head...""

Damn kid. Probably copied it. They're all alike.

I made a discovery today. I found a computer. Wait a second, this is cool. It does what I want it to. If it makes a mistake, it's because I screwed it up. Not because it doesn't like me... Or feels threatened by me.. Or thinks I'm a smart ass.. Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...

Damn kid. All he does is play games. They're all alike.

And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is found. ""This is it... this is where I belong..."" I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to them, may never hear from them again... I know you all...

Damn kid. Tying up the phone line again. They're all alike...

You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip through were pre-chewed and tasteless. We've been dominated by sadists, or ignored by the apathetic. The few that had something to teach found us willing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert.

This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the byte. We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals. We explore... and you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.

Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for.

I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this individual, but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike. ""

Resistance is the mantra. :) "
