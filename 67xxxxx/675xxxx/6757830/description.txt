Found most of this stuff on some Chinese forum (bbs.pinggu.org), so respect to all the guys there (plus to Google Translate). I've added all 4 executables (small, IC, SE, MP) found on Stata's official site, plus pregenerated the license files. Not sure if serials & codes can be blocked by Stata Corp., all I can say is that they work so far. You can also find them below. All you need to do is to extract the main archive, and then just choose the flavor of Stata you want (=extract its executable and license). No installation necessary, just run the main program.

Everything is up-to-date as of today (Oct 20), and I've encountered no problems when updating. In case you want to recreate the STATA.LIC file using your own information, delete it and use the following:
