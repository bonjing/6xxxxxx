,tuvokk,2011-10-21T05:11Z,"The problem is not that the password fails, they all fail eventually, if you let LS phone home. 

The solution is that you have to deconnect from internet while installing and then start Little Snitch while still NOT being connected to the internet, and then create 3 rules in LS to not let it phone home. Only after having done that reconnect to the internet.

This was explained in an earlier LS 2.4.3 or 2.4.4 torrent."
,goodwood,2011-10-21T13:03Z,"Could you tell us again what the 3 rules are?

I understand the rest of the concept.

Thanks"
[T],NoggintheNomad,2011-10-21T17:23Z,"Disconnect from the internet before installing, and before you reconnect, create rules to block the following applications:

Applications/Little Snitch Configuration
Library/Little Snitch/Little Snitch Network Monitor
Library/Little Snitch/Little Snitch UI Agent"
,pryingeyes,2011-10-22T02:14Z,"No, there's more to it than those three rules. I've had those in place for years. 2.3.2 and then 2.4.2 both failed after three hours. It's not a phone-home thing, but rather that the software is aware of older, pirated serials. Thus my question about the serial provided in this remains: Are you having success with it beyond the three-consecutive-hour window?"
[T],joskewarez,2011-10-22T11:20Z,"Yes, it's a valid serial"
,pryingeyes,2011-10-22T23:10Z,"Failed for me after three hours, just as I feared. And yes, I know what I'm doing, have been running LS for years and years, have those rules in place. Now I'll uninstall, reinstall 2.4.2 and go from there."
[T],NoggintheNomad,2011-10-24T20:00Z,"Methinks probably the best thing to do is just buy the thing. After all, it's very cheap, and it does protect us all. I'm going to pay for it now."
,FrankWh1te,2011-10-26T07:42Z,"Pryingeyes I have been using this program for a while as well and never had to follow the step so closely before, but this actually works. Completely uninstall LS, double check because I ran the uninstaller and still found random logs and such. Once COMPLETELY deleted, TURN OFF AIRPORT.(I edited my hosts file as well and flushed my DNS cache) Reinstall, set your 3 rules, enter serial. No issues yet, ran for almost 10 hours straight first day. That was several days ago and I have had plenty of sessions online lasting longer than 3 hours with no invalid license message. 

Also I noticed every once in a while when watching online videos ""PluginProcess"" tried to connect to Obdev's servers so be careful what you approve. "
,alkwef,2011-12-01T06:09Z,"Software used mostly for pirating programs was pirated.
Irony at its best."
,trywait4,2012-01-03T07:18Z,"@pryeyes  maybe you don't know what you are doing then,think?  Use the SN to register the product, else in demo mode only go for 3 hours. As for myself, I use LS 2.3.3. I like it a lot, not sure if to upgrade. Gotta have a Little Sniffer or any sort when doing torrents. Indeed. thanks!"
,alkwef,2012-01-09T05:54Z,"it hasn't been three hours but it looks good because it says 
""Multi License (5X)
Registered to: 
Serial Number:"" and then it gives the SN"
,antonavy,2012-03-03T12:22Z,"If 40 euros is cheap for little app, then I don't know..."
,Killeh,2012-03-12T03:41Z,"Great Torrent. I followed the Three rules and it still works perfect after 3 hours. 
I used the Serial included. Thanks!"
,arthurtwosheds,2012-03-15T23:52Z,Follow Noggin's instructions and it will work. Did for me anyway. Thanks uploader and seeders.
,dinodig,2012-03-28T16:17Z,Thanks a lot.

,Luc1dity,2012-05-06T08:33Z,"I would really recommend a thing called Radio Silence. My harddrive crashed a few weeks ago, so now I'm getting all my old apps back, but I remember Googling around and finding that thing before when I was having trouble finding a good LS torrent. You don't have to worry about it phoning home."
,Luc1dity,2012-05-06T08:36Z,I stand corrected. It's $9.
,binyo66,2012-05-07T06:28Z,thx
