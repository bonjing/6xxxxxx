 his junior Mahalakshmi.For him his goal

 wants to become an entrepreneur for       
 himself and instead of seeking a job he   
 wants to give job to others. Shailu loves 
 him so much but hesitates to express her  
 love as she doesn"t know what was the

 proposes her. Krishna had a typical middle

 his life except five digit salary, four
