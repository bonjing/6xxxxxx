,Celtic1971,2011-10-20T22:32Z,"the shower scene(when she declares shes changing her surname) which was showed at the start of EPI 2 ""previously seen"" was not shown on Part1"
,Celtic1971,2011-10-20T22:38Z,"On Episode 2  at the start, ""previously seen"" hsowing her trying on gowns and the shower scene about changing her surname was not shown on this episode 1..this is what I meant by some is missing, like there was 2 parts to Episode 1"
,mpjbay,2011-10-21T03:16Z,"@Celtic1971 - misunderstood the comment, my bad. this is the only copy i have been able to find on all the sites i go to. if it is not complete, it would be nice to have a complete copy. :)"
,mpjbay,2011-10-21T03:18Z,"@mvewtcher - thanks :)

i am viewing this on a 42"" flat screen. it was a bit pixelated for my taste but totally watchable. "
,Celtic1971,2011-10-21T05:28Z,I havent been able to find a complete copy either.Kudos to kuruptmixer for uploading this much anyway :-)
,bipolarx,2011-10-23T05:32Z,The picture is quite jagged- shaky- like it's been downloaded off the internet but it's buffering every second. You get used to it after a bit- but it might pay to just hang out till it's on E- it's on everyday nearly. 
,TAMISH-ZN,2011-10-30T08:17Z,"yeah but here in south africa, season 6 starts 2day... my gf will only get the watch the wedding end of the year by the look of it...
