.: Plot :.

For more than 1,500 years, the Shaolin monks from China's Henan Province have applied the discipline of martial arts as a unique manifestation of their religion, performing feats of astonishing physical prowess and mental concentration within their Ch'an (Zen) Buddhist practice. Originally a means of daily exercise and a form of meditation, the fighting actions evolved into what is now known throughout the world as Kung Fu. Now, GREAT PERFORMANCES presents an exciting theatrical performance featuring the ordained Soldier Monks of the Shaolin Temple. With music, lighting, and a stage set evoking the ancient East, SHAOLIN: WHEEL OF LIFE tells the story of the monks' early struggle to establish and protect their temple in a performance that celebrates their history, religion, and tremendous physical and mental skills.
