  This second film charts the rags to riches-to-rags epic of            
  Stoke-on-Trent, a city built on clay and the heart of Britain's once  
  world-beating ceramics empire. On the back of the 17th century        
  phenomenon of tea, pottery in Britain exploded into a cutting-edge    
  industry and a source of enormous national pride.                     
                                                                        
  We meet the key characters responsible for putting British ceramic    
  art on the map: from Josiah Wedgwood, innovator, artist and           
  marketing genius, and Josiah Spode (who made it his life's work to    
  invent a British version of Chinese porcelain and came up, aged 60,   
  with bone china, which revolutionised the industry) to the great      
  20th century ceramicists Clarice Cliff and Susie Cooper.              
                                                                        
  We see how demands for cheap labour since the 1980s have forced the   
  closure of all but a handful of these great factories, leaving        
  Stoke's crumbling overgrown ruins as our Pompeii.                     
                                                                        
  Contributors include AN Wilson, Neil Brownsword, Lucy Worsley,        
  Miranda Goodby, Emmanuel Cooper and Matthew Rice.
