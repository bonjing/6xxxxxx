,Goodish,2011-10-21T13:47Z,"Shadow Master> You have to unzip tt51012a.zip - tt51012g.zip and then unrar tt51012.rar - tt51012.r05, then you have a trillian-v5.1.0.12.exe and a folder that named Crack. And the archive is not broken"
,Shadow Master,2011-10-21T23:32Z,"Ah, yeah, my mistake. I was only unzipping tt51012a.zip. I'm used to the rest just unzipping themselves after the first. Now that I've properly unzipped it, everything is there and so far, no ads."
