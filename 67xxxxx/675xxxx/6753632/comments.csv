,kwikkilla,2011-12-03T06:48Z,"@referhead

Just so you know, most movies now are protected on ps3. Cuts out the audio right? This has nothing to do with the people that uploaded the movie, it is Sony. The program is called 'Cinavia' and protects against pirated movies. Only way to get by the audio cut out is to copy the movie directly onto your ps3, or stream it through 'PS3 Media Server'"
