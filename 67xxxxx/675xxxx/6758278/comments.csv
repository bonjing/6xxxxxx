hmm.. now that i think about it. they're probably so terrible, because they never smile. maybe if we all encourage them to smile, their music will become tolerable."
,Ellipsis5,2012-03-02T20:33Z,"While I think it's great that there's artists like these, who support sharing, who know that the world of music shouldn't be about finances, I REALLY don't like the vocals. Like, it's not BAD, the attitude and all fits great, but to me it's just a bit too high.
I don't want to insult or hate the vocalist in any way, but it's just really not my style and I think I'd like a instrumental more. Good band in overall, thanks TPB for increasing my musical experience."
,marsow,2012-03-03T01:27Z,"Well, I saw the promo in the homepage and decided to listen a few songs.

At first instance, I didn't like vocals too much... was like a strange very high tone and loud less scream. But that different kind of vocals kept me interested in listening to one more song, and after another one and so on.

By the end... the singer doesn't sounds bad at all, in fact sounds good... because his voice was what made the strange difference that kept my ear on their music.

I would say ""give it a try""

And like Elipsis5 said, thanks TPB for increasing my musical experience."

,bil_gr7,2012-03-03T14:26Z,"Ellipsis5 we don't even know who you are, so why would you bother telling us if this band is ""your style"" or not? Who cares if ""it's not your style""? Don't you see that it means nothing to us? 

Its like someone completely unknown telling: I dont like Metallica, i listen only to jazz so they are not my style. Who fucking cares?"

,entimus,2012-03-05T15:19Z,"@thriftstoretalent, ÂżTerrible band?
You have to be careful to say that kind of things if you name bands like TRoW or RA. Same sound weÂ´ve heard once and again and again and again in pop ""rock"" bands. Nothing new, Nothing good.
No real bases for judging... "
,EcoPunk,2012-03-07T12:05Z,"Love this band! Ive been listening to them for years. We dont need another band who sounds like some other played-out band. Great, unique vocals and intensity."
