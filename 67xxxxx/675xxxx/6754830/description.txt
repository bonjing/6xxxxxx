Sniper: Bulletproof

A sniper has one chance, one breath, to rise to the occasion and save the day
-- if he misses, there may never be another opportunity. We'll deconstruct 
and analyze the little known stories of snipers and their actions. The people 
who planned the takedowns or pulled the trigger share their techniques and 
bring to light the many factors that have to be considered in each mission -- 
terrain, wind speed, temperature, elevation changes -- as well as the high 
tech gear each sniper carries on their classified missions to complete the 
job.
