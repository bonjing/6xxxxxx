Bringing together the most exciting elements of Eastern eroticism, including over 100 sexual positions taken from the Kama Sutra, the Ananga Ranga, The Perfumed Garden, and the Tao, Kama Sutra for 21st Century Lovers updates and reinterprets the classic, 2,000 year-old sex manual. Fully illustrated and featuring specially commissioned photographs, this newly created classic is a font of information on achieving, enriching, and diversifying sexual pleasure. The author emphasizes the importance of pressure points, manners, artistic freedom and, most of all, finding and pursuing a loving sexual relationship. Anne Hooper is a noted sex therapist, marriage counselor, and a best-selling author.
