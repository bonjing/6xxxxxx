DEEP PURPLE Mk 2 Live
Aachen Reiterstadion, Soers, Germany
July 11th 1970
 

In 1970 bootlegging was still a relatively new phenomena in rock music. 
With the often imperfect PA systems and the limitations of tape machines, 
many recordings from the era are of poor quality. 
However, Aachen is in a different league altogether. 
History has it that the tapes were taken direct from 
a feed on the stage and recorded on a basic stereo machine hidden 
inside a Volkswagen camper van (which certainly 
accounts for the overloaded vocals). 
In some places the sound is actually panned from one channel to another, 
so they may even have mixed it live. 

For this CD we have gone back to the first 1970/71 vinyl releases. 
These were digitally transferred and speed fluctuations evened out, 
before the best version of each number was cleaned up in the studio 
with levels tweaked where possible.
