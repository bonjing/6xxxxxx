â€œOne of the greatest and most exciting things that has ever happened in my career, was the blessed chance to go to Istanbul and perform in front of the wonderful Turkish people, and if that wasnâ€˜t enough, they allowed us to record this live CD in front of the most exciting crowds I have ever performed in front of. And to see the wonderful places of worship, the awesome appearances of mosque being awaken at 5:00 AM every morning for the call to prayer and a time to worship. We give thanks to Efes Pilsen for inviting us to their wonderful country to perform in front of thousands of people whom have elevated to be called fans.â€œ ~John Lee Hooker, Jr.
