Probably an early preview.
Btw,this is not the complete driver package as the original takes no less than 1 Gb when it is extracted.
this one has been reduced for size reason
and takes only 500 Mo when extracted.
several msi installers for different packages
are missing and even more.
But still quite interesting to get and keep anyway.
