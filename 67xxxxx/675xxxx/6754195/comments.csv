,rhinowar,2011-10-19T09:28Z,"It just locks up before the main screen.
Anyone else having the same problem?"
,kkkiwi,2011-10-19T15:59Z,"Pretty sloppy console port with obscure controls and camera operation.

Thanks for the up anyway, will seed to 3"
,climbmnts,2011-10-19T17:24Z,Musy2 Dont be a CUNT!
,Xebecs,2011-10-19T20:15Z,"Awesome upload dude, Tintin's adventure, the old school days! Yeah! That's what we PC people needed!"
,PhiberOptix,2011-10-19T21:01Z,"Åååhh... Synd att dom inte ger ut en svensk utgåva av denna också. Det hadde jag gladeligens betalat för! Det här får en ju att sitta och mimra tillbaka till dom goda glada dagarna, då ""tecknade serier"" var något man bläddrade i, inte något man stirrade på på dumburken..."
,waldurify,2011-10-20T13:44Z,"Thnx a lot extremezone! Once again you proved to be the best here! But then there is another hateful jpeg file, what's that all about? 
And people seed god damit!!"
,Angut2006,2011-10-20T14:38Z,"Game crashes after 10 seconds of gameplay at the beginning in the plane.

Anyone same problem?

I have E8400, 4 GM Ram, ATI HD 3870 512MB Ram. I have no problems with other games like Rage, BFBC2, Fallout 3, DeusEx."
,Angut2006,2011-10-20T21:10Z,"@extremezone, we have a problem. On some websites people tell that they have the sam crash to desktopo problems as me. Plz do something. I run win7 x64, E8400, 4GB RAM, ATI HD3870 512MB Ram. PLs HElp!"
,muhhw,2011-10-20T23:07Z,virus is inside the game
,waldurify,2011-10-21T00:01Z,"muhhw, you must be an idiot, there is no virus in this game and see, this is extremezone we're talking about! For people with crash issue, just install the game on a different location then the one it choose by itself, and don't forget to run it as adminstrator! This game worked perfectly and it was really fun aswell :)"
,Angut2006,2011-10-21T02:37Z,F-Prot and AVG finds viruses in solidcore32.dll. Maybe false positive but be carefull. The crashes still exist. Also crashes reportet on other internetsites using FLT_version of the game. 
,LuigiVuoto,2011-10-21T06:59Z,Is the game any good?  Tintin always struck me as being a little fruity.  But in a good way.
,dipam,2011-10-21T19:09Z,"can i run it smoothly on core2duo 2.53ghz,2 gb ddr2 ram, geforce 9400gt 1 gb ddr2????"

I'm so sorry but can you help?
Thank you!"
,jaks70,2011-10-28T22:42Z,"You are the best extremezone :)

Unfortunately this seriously has to be the worst game I've played in years. I uninstalled after 10 minutes of play because the controls are just retarded. If I had to rate this game solely base on the controls it would be 1/10. Graphics are nice and the story seems interesting enough but those damn controls are awful."
,mekol007,2011-10-29T02:05Z,"Was able to download it properly, install it properly. Right after the plane scene and cut scene, Tintin and Snowie just wont stop running. I hear the footsteps sounds but it will not continue."
,ameennoushad06,2011-10-29T05:24Z,Extremezone! Great torrent but i think there's some problem with the crack the game opens and the intro scene comes and then the game goes off !!
,docu2,2011-10-30T09:27Z,"mekol007

I have the same problem they keep running and its loading and nothing happens?? what's the problem?"
,KumaR,2011-11-01T15:39Z,"There is certainly a problem with the game. Not with the upload, but the game! Not working!"
,p4nth3r,2011-11-01T20:22Z,FLT thanx..you are very good programmer..game 100%
