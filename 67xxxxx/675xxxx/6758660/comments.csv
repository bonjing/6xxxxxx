,Hawkehearteater,2012-04-10T23:03Z,"Okay, so everyone knows you aren't supposed to put the crack file (rar) in the iso, that won't work. Use winrar to open the crack file and then take the exe file located inside and replace the exe inside the game folder in the C drive, not the iso. The exe will be located in the file bin and that's the one you replace. This should help if anyone is still having problems."
