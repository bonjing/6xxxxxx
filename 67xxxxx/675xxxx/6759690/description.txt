ReleaseNotes:

Shortly after reforming in 2006, Candlebox returned to Seattle with all four original members in tow to play this memorable show at the storied Showbox Theater.

Alive in Seattle is a live Cd/DVD set capturing the night and is a stellar show from a vastly underrated live band. The show itself is a multi-camera shoot with excellent sound and video quality and the DVD also includes an interview from a radio station as well as acoustic performances of Cover Me and Far Behind.

We did rip the DVD too-- look for the XviD release of the main concert.

We rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.
HHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)

Everyone that has supported us over the years.  You know who you are.
Just can't describe the feelings we get listening to some of these tracks. Lots of goodmemories from days long gone by...
