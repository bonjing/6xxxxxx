,balleron24z,2011-10-19T04:56Z,"By the way, guys please continue to seed this after you get it.  I don't have a lot of bandwidth and the more of you who continue to seed, it will keep it alive longer."
,balleron24z,2011-10-19T06:37Z,"Watching these, there's a lot of ""reversed"" curse words and hidden metaphors.  Kind of annoying actually.  I'd use YAMB or My MP4Box GUI to pull the aac audio out and fix it.  If anything I'll post a link to the repaired audio and that way you all can just MUX it yourselves to have the original audio.  Sorry about that.  At least the quality's good lol."
,joej191,2011-10-19T10:39Z,Thanks bro ill this seed for a week cause the shady 2.0 killed it.
,balleron24z,2011-10-21T04:11Z,I've about got the dirty versions ready.  It's just an mp4 with aac audio.  All you do is get a program like YAMB or My MP4Box GUI and MUX (Multiplex) the audio and existing video together.  it's pretty simple.
,skippuh,2011-10-22T02:16Z,Why is it all laggy and glitchy 
,joej191,2011-10-22T16:44Z,"^^^^^^^ i thought i was trippin but it is, ima youtube this,,"
,balleron24z,2011-10-25T09:09Z,"@skippuh and joej191, not sure why it's laggy.  I thought it was my PC when I watched, but the FPS is hitting like 19, so it is a lil above half.  Sorry about the framerate.  The source was clean but it was a direct file copy so not sure what happened to the FPS"
