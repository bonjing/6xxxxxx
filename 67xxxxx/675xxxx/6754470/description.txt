Hello all, been a while since I've been on here.  I know that somebody has uploaded the entire hip hop awards video.  Though I'll notice, the reso on the video is widescreen in standard definition quality.  Though I'll not mention where these came from, they are all 1080p H264 at 3500kbps bitrate, besides the Indie meets Mainstream video.  Couldn't get it in anything but 720p but still looks great.  Hope you all enjoy this.  There have been no re-encodes from the initial H264 encoding so no quality loss.  ENJOY :D
