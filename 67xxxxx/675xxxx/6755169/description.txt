Scan any document to your S60 and save it as a PDF-file or send it with e-mail or as an MMS â€“ all in just a few seconds.

No cropping or rotating needed, DocScannerâ„¢ does it for you automatically! All you need to do, is to take a photo of any document with the application and determine the options you like.
