This handy guide features security information for Windows novices and more experienced admins alike, including security basics and tools that provide advanced protection against network attacks and system failures."--TechTarget's round-up of the "Five Windows Servers books to watch for in 2011"

"Anyone faced with securing Windows systems for the first time would do well to make this book their first port of call. It's a well-balanced overview of all the facets of Windows system management that need to be addressed from a security perspective. In fact, it's a useful book for anyone, working on any platform, who needs to understand where security issues reside within corporate systems. That's because, although it is focused on Windows, and all the practical examples, screenshots and step-by-step instructions relate to that platform, the author also devotes considerable portions of the book to the conceptual groundwork.. IT practitioners who need to get to grips with security issues will find the book a valuable briefing on the most pressing issues, along with a great deal of practical, hands-on advice on how you go about putting the principles into action in a Windows environment.. this book gives you a kind of 'to do' list of features and functions that need to be addressed."--Network Security
