Allmusic Review:
As the title suggests, Car & Driver: Greatest Car Songs and Other Lost Treasures of the Road collects classic cruising songs, including Chuck Berry's "No Particular Place to Go" and the Beach Boys' "Little Deuce Coupe" and "409." Ronny & the Daytonas' "Little G.T.O.," Commander Cody & the Lost Planet Airmen's "Hot Rod Lincoln," and Jan & Dean's "Dead Man's Curve" are among the album's highlights, and Robert Mitchum's "Ballad of Thunder Road" gives the collection souped-up flair.
