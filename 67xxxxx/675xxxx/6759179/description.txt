When the entire world of music lies beneath your feet, what else would you do then to go out and explore it? Dutch talent Erik van den Boom is only 14 years old, but produces quality house muisc like he's been at it for years. This young mastermind is currently studying Physics at the university of Delft, after graduating from the gymnasium at the age of 13. When near a studio however, it's the beats that lure and the bass that gets him. Erik's dreaming big and takes a leap on winning the Nobel prize as well as fixing himself a spot amongst the producer and DJ elite of today's scene. Under his Erik Arbores moniker, he is taking the first steps in dance land. Zouk Recordings is proud to be releasing three of his creations, with 'Bliss', 'Take It' and 'Transit' reflecting a bright future for this promising talent.

While 'Take It' mixes the fine elements of electro with the progressive-house kicks and blazing synths of an oldskool blast, 'Transit' sends you on a musical journey of trancy house. Both have a strong but proggy build-up, heading towards an outrage of something absolutely maddening. 'Bliss' is the more gently, melodic track of the three-pack. A real peak-timer, taking you in with its fusion of trance and house. Bet you didn't see that coming from a 14-year old, huh?
