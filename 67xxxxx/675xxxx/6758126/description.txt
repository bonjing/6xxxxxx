Real-time physics, innovative stunts and next-generation graphics combine into a dynamic, tricked-out RC car racing experience where players twist and turn, grind and gear up, performing aerial tricks and stunts while racking up trophies and points as they race to the finish, all in an unlikely location. Set on a beautiful and tranquil Mediterranean island, the fast-moving, bumper car gameplay style transforms this calm and relaxing setting into a dynamically frenzied raceway. A high-speed mini car racing game with a distinct arcade flavor, gameplay is presented from the unique perspective of a small RC vehicle, setting out to conquer the big world. Players will enjoy outrageous driving physics and suspension as their tiny vehicles interact with full-size people and other beach dwellers along their path to victory.
