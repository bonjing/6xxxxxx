Steps fans have no reason to feel a deeper shade of blue this summer, as the Brit Award-winning boot scooters Steps are releasing their first album in ten years this autumn. Steps: The Ultimate Collection  will hit the stores on 3 October including 19 hits. All the favourites are there: â€˜Tragedyâ€™, â€˜Loveâ€™s Got a Hold Of My Heartâ€™, â€˜Deeper Shade of Blueâ€™ and â€™5,6,7,8'. And if this album werenâ€™t quite gay enough, theyâ€™ve included a bonus track: Steps taking on the legendary ABBA hit â€˜Dancing Queenâ€™.

The news comes after the announcement of a Sky Living documentary about the group revealing all about the break-up and behind-the-scenes secrets, leading many to suggest that a reunion tour canâ€™t be the last thing on their minds. Between 1997 and 2001 the band scored a remarkable 14 consecutive top ten hits, and they may be hoping to capitalise on the reunion fever that swept up the Spice Girls, Boyzone and of course Take That.

Steps have had a mixed ten years since the break-up. Ian â€˜Hâ€™ Watkins and Claire Richards attempted an ill-fated career as a duo, before Watkins retrained at the Royal Academy of Music to enter musical theatre and did a stint in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat. In news that surprised very few, he came out as gay in a 2007 interview with The Sun. Faye Tozer also followed H into the world of musical theatre with roles in Love Shack and Saucy Jack and the Space Vixens.
