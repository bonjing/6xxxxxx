More and more Americans are becoming dedicated locavores, people who prefer to eat locally grown or produced foods and who enjoy the distinctive flavors only a local harvest can deliver. The Locavoreâ€™s Kitchen invites readers to savor homegrown foods that come from the garden, the farm stand down the road, or local farmersâ€™ markets through cooking and preserving the freshest ingredients.
