Outspoken and overly critical Nishant Agarwal   
meets gorgeous new co-worker, Charu, offers his 
help, assists her financially, and they become  
close friends. His room-mates, Rajat and Vikrant
are pleased with this outcome as they already   
have girlfriends in Neha and Rhea respectively. 
But both the relationships are not as harmonious
as Rajat feels Neha is self-centered and demandi
while Rhea appears to be withdrawn and aloof.   
Missing their meetings and bar-hopping, the trio
decide to take a time-out and be by themselves.
