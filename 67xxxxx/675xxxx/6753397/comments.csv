@MikePliko & @MikePliko

This is the original, multilanguage, version.


@Green-Banana

The Mac files and some of the support files have been deleted, in order to make this download as small as possible. Of course, no files that are necessary for installation have been deleted.
The files have been packed into a .rar file to make the overall file size smaller.

It might does, but that's probably because this torrent has just been released and there are not many seeders available yet. Remember that patience is the key to success!


@surion10

Well, to be honest, I'm not 100% sure. The .app file is still there, only the Mac support (update) files have been deleted. But, if you download this, you have to make the .DMG file yourself, via your Mac. (And then open it)

Go to the exctracted download game and PASTE IT in Download\The Sims3 Pets\Support\..

Relaunch the installation.. A popup box will show up at the same spot as where it asked for the CD before.. But just type IGNORE !! And Instal will complete !

@spystyle

Then I suggest you re-read the ""Crack"" -part in the ""# Installation Guide.txt"", because you have to copy the crack to the BASE GAME's installation folder and not the expansion's installation folder. If you copy it to the wrong folder, you'll keep getting the ""Please insert Disk"" error.


@anyZZ

It's not really a must, but I recommend you do, because without it, you can not update the game in the future.
If you wish to update in the future, just download and apply the latest version of this Fix: http://games4theworld.bestgoo.com/t752-the-sims-3-ultimate-fix-should-fix-most-of-your-problems

Please try the Fixed version: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6754238

@LevivanGelder
  Please open the .rar file you downloaded using only WinRar, which can be downloaded from www.games4theworld.org . (If you use any other software than WinRar, like WinZip or 7-zip, the files will get messed up!)
When you've opened the file using WinRar, select Ã¡ll the files in it and drag & drop them to a folder on your Desktop. When the extraction is done, close the .rar file and open the folder on your Desktop. 
Now, start by reading the included ""# Installation Guide.txt"" and you should be able to get the game to work yourself. Good luck!

@LevivanGelder
Because that's where the files to start the game are located. But it's not a typo, you have to copy the crack to the base game's installation folder.

@Pancho556
Yes, fully multilanguage, just like the original game. 

@missinglink1000
If you have any Custom Content and/or Mods, delete them ALL and then try again.

@LeafGirl
Sorry, this is PC only. I don't know where to get a Mac version, but I've seen people on our Forum (www.games4theworld.bestgoo.com) getting this version to work on a Mac. (Go to the ""Mac Support"" section)

@Nio123
This is probably a bug from EA's side. The only thing you can do is to wait for EA to patch the problem/bug.

Try running without the launcher: http://games4theworld.bestgoo.com/t1212-how-to-start-the-sims-3-without-the-launcher-fix

@nicinoonoo
Please read the included ""# Installation Guide.txt""; you must open a .exe file, not a .icon file.

The game is working kinda okey.

One problem I also have is that I can
open the sims 3 from the desktop.
I have to go to the sims 3 map, game, bin and open it there. 

Is it something I can do to make it work normal?"
