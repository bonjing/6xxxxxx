This time Max and Stacy talk about the European penny drops as more banks need more bailouts while the public debt clock ticks up to $40 trillion. We also note that at least Bill Clintonâ€™s mistress never agitated for foreign wars, while the mistress of neo-con favourite, UK Sec of Defense, Liam Fox is galavanting around the world with the Minister and stoking conflict.

In the second half of the show, Max Keiser interviews Michael Betancourt about the threat that Occupy Wall Street presents to our modern form of capitalism that relies on ignorance and passivity in the population in order to operate schemes of fraud and bubbles.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
