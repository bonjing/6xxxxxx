,SLICK65,2011-10-18T19:29Z,Looks like another quality DL from VISION - before I start can anyone tell me if there are hardcoded english subs for the non-english alien speaking parts?
,system_m,2011-10-23T13:25Z,"No, subtitles are not hardcoded. This is how it should be."
,SLICK65,2011-10-25T17:54Z,system_m  - are you for real? - subtitles are meant for people who don't understand the spoken language in a movie - nobody speaks alien so of course they should be hard-coded in a quality rip the same way they are hard-coded in the release!
,r2d3m,2012-03-28T01:06Z,"Quick download. Samples provided. Great quality. The subtitles contain both English and alien dialogue. If you only want the alien dialogue, download the subtitles from another source.

Thank you for uploading."
