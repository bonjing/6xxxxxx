,andye7,2011-10-19T21:49Z,"Hi, many thanks for these.
I just wondered how come there's never any Video anymore?"
,e114612,2011-10-20T00:58Z,you are my savior!
,bdearen,2011-10-21T04:17Z,Nice Torrent as usual :)   Are you ever going to open your stie/forum back up for registration?  I am constantly searching TPB for more of your torrents.  I don't think anyone else does what you do.  Your Howard Stern torrents are PERFECT and complete.  THANKS
,bdearen,2011-10-21T04:31Z,Awesome Torrent as usual.  You always provide the most up to date flawless torrents.  There is nobody like you that constantly uploads Howard Stern torrents the day they come out.  It's AWESOME.. I LOVE YOU.  Also when are you going to open up registration on your site?  I have checked back about 100 times and it always says registration is closed.

I know some people who will give out invites if someone donates so just keep asking and maybe one of the members who uses the torrents will help."
