The first big-screen Pooh adventure from Disney animation in more than 35 years. Owl sends the whole gang -- Pooh, Tigger, Rabbit, Piglet, Kanga, Roo, and Eeyore -- on a wild quest to save Christopher Robin from an imaginary culprit. It turns out to be a very busy day for a bear who simply set out to find some hunny.
