1) In movies where you SHOULD have expericenced lagging and pixelating, you may find colory shadows traveling along the screen for short period of times. However, that phenomenon is much preferable than the otherwise.

If you are not satisfied with the result, in Vlc:

1) Chose ""Tools""
2) Chose ""Settings""
3) Press the button ""Restore Settings""

And voilÃ¡, yourÃ© back to normal state."

C:\Documents and Settings\Yourwindowsaccountname\Application Data\vlc

Excuse my ignorance. Help clarify thanks."

Choose the ""All files and folders"" option, and search for vlcrc in C:.

Replace the found file with the one from this torrent."
