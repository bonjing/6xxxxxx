Welcome to Anatolia music from Kardes TÃ¼rkÃ¼ler


KardeÅŸ TÃ¼rkÃ¼ler came into being in 1993, as a concert project by the BoÄŸaziÃ§i University Folklore Club. The concert, which aimed to interpret Anatolian folksongs based on their own cultural structure and in their original languages, was comprised of four sections: Turkish, Kurdish, Azerbaijani and Armenian.
 
The project, based on the ideal of living together in fraternity, also took a stand against the polarization and tensions which had been created among different peoples in a multicultural land.
