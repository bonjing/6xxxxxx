On Monday's Mark Levin Show: President Obama's job bill is irrelevant and needs to be defeated by the House each time it comes up for a vote. It's not a jobs bill, it's a tax bill and it would put the country in even more of an economic disaster. Class warfare needs to be confronted by the Republicans because the American people are not Marxistâ€™s. Also, President Obama is campaigning right now and we are paying the bill; he is not trying to help the economy, he is trying to campaign for his reelection. Mark gives advice to the Republican candidates - demand that President Obama and other top Democrats denounce the Wall Street protestors which includes hate groups and lawlessness.
