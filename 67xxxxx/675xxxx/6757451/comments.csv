,raven49,2011-10-20T10:43Z,will this work with skidrow release as well?
,Matinator10,2011-10-20T10:50Z,I'd say 90% chance of losing your savegame if you use this on SKIDROWs release ;)

Your saved games should be saved somewhere outside of your game install folder.
You'll most likely still have your game data when playing this version."
,Matinator10,2011-10-20T14:04Z,"Oh saves dont work at all for me, get reset to level 0 every time I start the game"

,chip211,2011-10-20T15:27Z,yeah DONT use this if you have skidrow version or your game will stop working
,Matinator10,2011-10-20T15:42Z,"I installed SKIDROW version, then copied over their crack, then installed this patch. Run as administrator and everything should work fine. Win7 64"

,NanoEntity,2011-10-21T03:37Z,"This update works for me on THETA version of the game.

Seems to be saving your progress fine, haven't encountered any problems yet."
,Tomtompro,2011-10-21T12:13Z,It seems i can connect to GameSpy and see other players online and leaderboards but it says theres a missing package with steamworks.Is there a way to play with other players like with hamachi or something?I really want to know if theres a way to do it.
,Tomtompro,2011-10-21T13:24Z,It stop at level 6...This is really annoying because i was level 11 and i got reset to level 6 when i exited the game..Pisses me off
,em0r0ckem009,2011-11-02T03:29Z,Is there by chance you'll be able to put this game in steam??? just wondering cause I desperately wan't to play this game online.
