,OmniNegro,2011-10-20T20:10Z,I hear that this makes the Skidrow version of the game unplayable. Exercise caution guys.
,id1297232,2011-10-20T20:19Z,"Confirmed, doesn't work with the SKIDROW's release."
,SkaJump,2011-10-20T20:37Z,"I don't need to install previous updates like 7.0 or 7.01r5 right?
Plus, what is it in this version that supposedly makes the game unplayable?"
,OmniNegro,2011-10-20T20:56Z,"I do not speculate often, but I can extrapolate well.

You DO need the previous updates it seems with some releases. I do not know which though.

This release does not fix some issues fixed in previous releases.

If you do not have the THETA version, I suggest avoiding this entirely."
,Matinator10,2011-10-20T22:05Z,"Works fine on SKIDROW version, but copied the ALI213 crack over first"
,NanoEntity,2011-10-21T03:33Z,"DO NOT USE THIS UPDATE!

For some reason dose not save your progress in the game, like the challenges are messed up, same for the single player campaign.

Dungeon Defenders v7.01r5
Works just fine, haven't encountered any problems yet, seems to be saving your characters just fine."
