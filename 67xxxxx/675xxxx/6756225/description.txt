A rollercoaster journey into the heart of Australiaâ€™s Indigenous relations, a hidden shame that is pushing the worldâ€™s oldest living culture to the edge. Through the stories of the Yolngu of NE Arnhem Land, the film looks at the Governmentâ€™s ongoing policies of paternalism and assimilation, examines the real issues underlying Indigenous disadvantage, and opens dialogue on ways forward that respect Aboriginal culture and dignity.
