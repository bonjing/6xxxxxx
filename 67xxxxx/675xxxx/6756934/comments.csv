,mothymandinga,2011-12-20T00:31Z,Thanks man
,spunkster,2011-12-23T02:47Z,"@tordajav - Didn't you post the same thing on another person's rip of the same album? He doesn't need to normalize anything. This is a perfect rip. I just downloaded several versions of it (all 320k), plus checked out Youtube versions of a few songs. They're all clipping just the same. 

According to 2020k, a mixing/engineering music blog that reviewed this, ""itâ€™s easy to get lost in the loudness and allow the noise from the record to in an essence, actually drown the outside noise toxins around you and drown you in itâ€™s own pollutions"". They wrote about one song, ""Sonically, itâ€™s a disgusting mess with low frequencies clashing and trying to cancel each other out due to a lack of equalizing and giving certain portions of the bass and kicks to have their own sonic wholes, instead, all combining to muddy up everything. This disaster best describes every single imperfection present throughout this Florence + The Machine presentation."" They go on about it, you can find it by googling ""2020k ceremonials"" (sorry that link's not permitted here).

Another discussion is here: http://www.gearslutz.com/board/mastering-forum/663359-florence-loudness-wars.html

Please educate yourselves before pointing fingers at an uploader for a shitty sounding recording.

Thanks for this, theLEAK!"

,ArtiLLian,2012-02-24T02:50Z,"@spunkster - @theLEAK - That has to be the most effective and detailed BURN I have read in a long time. For how much some of the cats out here do for us without trying to ""rape"" our systems, you would think they would.... think before they type. Then again it is no shock at all that they do not use that grey matter between there ears.

Thank you LEAK for all the stellar work!
