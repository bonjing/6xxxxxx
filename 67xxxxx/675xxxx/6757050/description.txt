Another HiDef 2D to 3D movie.

It's in the 1080P half side-by-side format. Video is h264 in the MKV container. Audio is AC3 5.1 @ 640kbps. Although the audio is non HD, it sounds comparable and will play on older non HD audio receivers.

You must have a player that recognizes the format. I suggest either Western Digital TV Live or Seagate GoFlex Home players. They both play just about any video format. I would steer away from using a PS3 for your playback as more and more movies are subject to the new Cinavia protection that mutes your audio and so far there is no work around this as the mark is embedded into the audio stream. You also need a TV or software that will convert a side-by-side image to the 3D image. Just about any 3D TV has this feature to display side-by-side format.

I am trying the Transformers movies for converting this weekend, if the output is good enough, I will post those.

Hope you enjoy, please leave feedback if you enjoy these conversions or not, and don't forget to seed!
