This book is suitable for undergraduate students in computer science and engineering, for students in other disciplines who have good programming skills, and for professionals.

Computer animation and graphicsâ€“once rare, complicated, and comparatively expensiveâ€“are now prevalent in everyday life from the computer screen to the movie screen. Interactive Computer Graphics: A Top-Down Approach with Shader-Based OpenGLÂ®, 6e, is the only introduction to computer graphics text for undergraduates that fully integrates OpenGL 3.1 and emphasizes application-based programming. Using C and C++, the top-down, programming-oriented approach allows for coverage of engaging 3D material early in the text so readers immediately begin to create their own 3D graphics. Low-level algorithms (for topics such as line drawing and filling polygons) are presented after readers learn to create graphics.
