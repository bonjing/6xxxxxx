Product Description: Rizzoni provides a solid overview of the electrical engineering discipline that is especially geared toward the many non-electrical engineering students who take this course. The hallmark feature of the text is its liberal use of practical applications to illustrate important principles. The applications come from every field of engineering and feature exciting technologies such as Ohio Stateâ€™s world-record setting electric car. The appeal to non-EEâ€™s is further heightened by such special features as the bookâ€™s Focus on Measurement sections, Focus on Methodology sections, and Make the Connection sidebars.
