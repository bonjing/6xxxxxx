,Almondcoconuts,2011-10-21T07:58Z,Can we get this for macs?
,Samaela,2011-10-21T12:43Z,"Sony Vegas is Windows only; sadly. 

However you can use VMWARE Fusion, such as the commenter above stated, to emulate a windows machine(although it would lag more than it usually does) or simply install windows using bootcamp)

But if you want to be on the mac part, getting a torrent of final cut pro would be your safest bet. "

,vetvijver,2011-10-22T23:30Z,I've tried running it as administrator but it still won't register. Which option do u choose? I've tried both registering online and from another computer but neither works for me...
,vetvijver,2011-10-23T01:36Z,"Never mind my last post. Bypassing the registration wasn't the problem, it turned out you need to have the latest version of Quicktime installed in order to avoid boot-up errors. Thanks uploader!"

,SWIA,2011-10-23T23:24Z,"Does anybody have an idea how to completely remove Sony Vegas 10? I can't register this because it want's an upgrade serial, not a normal serial. I really need this... Thank you!"

Get RevoUninstaller free version and use that to clear Vegas 10"
,Frenzykill,2011-10-24T09:03Z,Seed some please...
,Cerest,2011-10-24T19:54Z,"So I managed to install the program; completed the patch and managed to activate the products with the serial keys.

However, when i try to boot the program, and the initialisebar is about to become completed, I get the: ""An error occurred starting vegas pro.

Error 0x80131902 (message missing)

Failed to initialize script host.""

Got any ideas how to fix the problem? I've tried plenty of versions of Sony Vegas today.. All resulted in this error, so I am apparently missing some sort of codec or similar.

*Note* I saw someone else who had to update Quicktime for this to work. I did that, but it still won't work for me."

- Thank you for that. Unfortunately it doesn't work, or at least I have allready uninstalled the program. Even DL the pro version an searching for traces of the installation doesn't bring me anywhere.

Vegas Pro 11 want a serial from a qualifying product. (I've tried Vegas Pro 10 serials to no avail)

Question is - can't I just install vegas pro 10 again, note the serial I use, and then install 11 and enter this new one as the qualifying?

If a keygen for this problem doesn't show up I will try this. Otherwise I will use Vegas Pro 10, or reinstall OS entirely.."

Use the serials and codes in the text file to finish it off. they work"
,SWIA,2011-10-26T13:43Z,"QUOTE:

--

Unfortunately they don't, because they are for Vegas Pro 11, and the problem is apparently that Vegas Pro 11 can see that Pro 10 has been installed, so it installs itself as an upgrade. I'm going to mess with it now that I have time. If I find a solution, I will post it here of course - Should anyone else have the same problem. 

Thanks again, and you're welcome to bring any suggestions you might have."
,SWIA,2011-10-26T14:09Z,"UPDATE:

I have tried re-installing Vegas Pro 10 with a serial I then remember. Installing Pro 10 was a success (but only after patching it with Digital Insanity)

I then installed Vegas Pro 11 and when prompted for the qualifying serial, I entered this new Vegas Pro 10 one, but still, it isn't registered.

..So advise here would be:

If you allready have Vegas Pro 10, then you can forget about Pro 11, or reinstall your computer.

Btw - the first thing I did yesterday was a careful trip in to regedit and remove everything Pro 10 related (making backups simultaniously), except for plugins info (perhaps this is why I failed? - donno.)"

,Belakorr,2011-11-06T18:51Z,"Okey here's the thing for those who was in trouble registering like I was...
There's only one tiny thing nto written on the readme file which you must do, after openning the patch as admin, you must ALSO open the VEGAS APP as Admin...so then it will work and after write the 1st code the option ""register into another computer"" will appear, choose that, copy paste the 2nd and so long code and all will be fine."
,st4rk1ll3r666,2011-11-12T07:50Z,"Everything works fine, just follow instructions in the read me and remember to open both the keygen/patcher as well as vegas pro 11 as administrator during the patch process. "

,ecwfan305,2011-11-28T01:34Z,"I disconnected my router from the wall while installing it to make sure that I had no internet connection. When they asked me for the upgrade serial I used the same one that I used at the beginning of the installation which was the first key in the read me file. Then I clicked register from another computer and put in the longer serial. I also used Windows Firewall to block any inbound or outbound connections to vegas110.exe. After that I connected my router again and Sony Vegas 11 works perfectly fine.
P.S. I obviously uninstalled Sony Vegas 10 before I did this."

Everything was fine, until I upgraded to a new version (Pro 11, Build 683). Installed the upgrade, when closed the program, it asked if I'd like to stop using the trial version and want to purchase a full one.

Tried they keys from this torrent, don't work. Any thoughts?
