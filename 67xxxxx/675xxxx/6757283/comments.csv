,alejandro70,2011-10-20T21:35Z,GRACIAS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,brianscottmatthew,2011-10-21T01:57Z,"Thanks once again, I have another hard to find request for you. You filled my request for Spoons' ""Listen to the City"" awhile back and I'm hoping you can do it again for the Canadian jangle pop obscurity ""Glow"" by the band Plasterscene Replicas. This album is nowhere to be found on the internet!"
,dragonbandit314,2011-10-21T10:23Z,"As usual, many thanks. I will feel like I have lost an old friend when you retire from TPB. Cheers, T."
,smurphyzeke,2011-10-22T23:37Z,Thanks
,cheesy212,2011-10-23T20:20Z,"Awesome work!  I'll seed this and each of your rare albums as I download them, for a very long time :-) "
[V],80zforever,2011-10-26T00:38Z,"brianscottmatthew, I have only heard You Can Walk from that LP. I don't recall ever seeing a vinyl record anywhere back in the day. sounds like it was obscure even then. 

cheesy212, dragonbandit314 and smurphyzeke, thanks for taking the time and leaving comments.

cheers people"
,brianscottmatthew,2011-10-26T07:38Z,"Ah, damn... one of us has to track this one down been in contact with the band via facebook, asked for a digital copy of the LP. They are yet to respond..."
,z-nith,2011-10-26T23:58Z,"The Victims album is superb! Great stuff
brianscottmatthew, that's a clever idea to contact them on Facebook. but like a lot of other things, it can be difficult to get a responce. sometimes I contact equipment makers from the 70s if theyre still in biz looking for parts and manuals and hardly ever get a reply. Good luck!"
