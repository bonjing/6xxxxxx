My son absolutely loves this movie!
Awesome quality!"
,capricornio,2011-12-20T22:08Z,"Again: Neither of the 2 (two) ""Spanish"" tracks contain Spanish audio, it's Latin-American Spanish actually.

@patbb :

Didn't notice that, what I did notice is that at least the ""Spanish"" tracks end just when the credits start rolling. A poor job there really.

Other than that the video is really good quality and the upload is appreciated."
