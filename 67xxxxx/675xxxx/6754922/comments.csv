,taalguy,2011-10-24T21:25Z,"GUYS YOU GOTTA DISCONNECT YOUR NET CONNECTION AFTER ENTERING THE FAKE LICENSE CODE AND BEFORE YOU CLICK THE ""NEXT"" BUTTON.... otherwise it'll open up your browser and take you to a Kaspersky page which tells you all kinds of shit about the fake code you just entered...... so save yourself the trouble.... just disconnect and everything works just as sam_code4u says."
