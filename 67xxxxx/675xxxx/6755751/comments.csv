,Greene88,2011-12-19T05:51Z,"I tried that serial DFF7A-8204E-69ADE-0D5AA
on the latest Version. v5.0.0.158 and it worked. I already had the free version installed prior to trying this. I disconnected from the internet and clicked on the ""Free"" button which opens up an activation window and pasted that number in there and hit activate or whatever it said and it gave me a message that it couldnt access the server and to try again later. I left all windows open, including the one with that message and reconnected to the internet and continued from there with no problems. It went right into the setup for the Pro version, just some settings to choose and Its the full version now and everything's enabled now. Anybody else who wants to try it that way please post and say if it worked or not. I really don't think it matters which version it is. I'm sure there's other ways to do it too, I just tried it this way and it happened to work. Keep in mind I downloaded and installed the free version from their site, not from here."

After some time, the program will revert itself back to the free version, even if you have automatic updates disabled.  Apparently this means Iobit is gathering info from you whether you like it or not.

 Adding the executable to your firewall's block list may stop this from happening, otherwise repeat the process to get back to the pro version."
