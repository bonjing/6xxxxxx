Monster Trouble is a tower defense videogame developed and originally published by Magic Dream Games for the iOS platform in February 2011. The game is implemented in high quality 3D using a cartoonish graphic style inspired to the fantasy genre. In a world populated by Goblins and Ogres, the country dwellers gather to defend their houses from a horde of monsters. The gameplay is rather original compared to most other strategy games, in Monster Trouble you must first build fortifications and then you must populate the buildings with different type of defenders in the most appropriate way. Depending upon the map, enemies are coming from one or more directions and you will be taken through nine different maps and thirty different levels alternating from day to night with three level of difficulty: Easy, Medium and Hard.



Towers:
Monster Trouble offers 10 types of towers, each with unique features. However, only three towers are available for any particular map. Towers are used to support defenders or just to slow down the enemies and may be placed almost anywhere on the field. A line of towers may be created to force the land enemies to go around them, creating more strategy. Tower alone are not very effective though, you must populate them by installing one or more defender on them. Villagers are used as defenders, there are five type of villagers each with a unique power but only three are available for any particular map.



Maps:
In Monster Trouble, there are a total of nine maps you start with the first (TomÊ¼s farm) and unlock all the others as you progress through the game: GrannyÊ¼s farm, The Mill, The crossroad, GunterÊ¼s hut, The circus, The dry river, The island, The village. In The River map monsters come all from a single spawning point and must travel a long way before they reach the target. In all the other maps monster come from two or more points and it take some strategy to stop them.
