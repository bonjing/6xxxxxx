REISSUED


Hi,

After releasing the September lists I came across some other tracks that should be in there in the first place. So why not an addition to the list. Yes why not.

So i made an addition. A compilation of rock / indie tracks ready to go public. The additional list: Opportunity is what I call Bar proof.


Enjoy



Background.

This download is meant for people (like me) who hate (or have no time) going through various Indie playlists every month. Running a bar I do this every month trying to find something nice (and new) for the customers. I usually end up with three lists.

@1. Nice, clear and easy for people who like to talk while listening.
@2. A bit louder for people who are not able to talk anymore (too crowded).
@3. The ones I like myself and do not fit in one of the above categories.


VHQ (Very High Quality).

Only the best (sounding) tracks are selected. They are in 100% clean and fully labelled MP3 VBR format. This might save you some time.

Enjoy and keep the Indie spirit high (by promoting, sharing and seeding we can enjoy these songs together).
