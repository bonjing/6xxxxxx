Part of the Lord Baltimore series: Plague Ships and Cursed Bells are up on TPB already

Baltimore: A Passing Stranger was available for free on Free Comic Book Day 2011. In Golden's own words:

"We only had fourteen pages [for A Passing Stranger], but Mike and I wanted a story that would accomplish several things at once. First, though Baltimore's nemesis is a vampire, we wanted something that would show readers that there are all kinds of evils in this world. We wanted to paint a picture of what an unforgiving place the world has become, post-war, post-plague (although the plague is still ongoing). And, most of all, of course, we wanted a story that would stand on its own as a chilling horror story, while introducing Baltimore to FCBD [Free Comic Book Day] readers in a way that requires no knowledge of his history. I have to say, I love the result. The artist, Ben Stenbeck, and colorist, Dave Stewart, have outdone themselves on A Passing Stranger. It makes me very, very happy that people will have the opportunity to get this glimpse into Baltimore's world for free."
