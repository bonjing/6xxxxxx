Trying out stream recording and i got a alot of files so dont be alarmed at the actual size, because it alot of videos for the size. I haven't rendered these in any way , this is just the raw files (no watermarks) but the files are 1:1 copies since the stream was recorded(which mean they look good for the simple-minded). The sound is acting up  or something because they dont want to play the sound but whatever. I probably wont do alot of streams because even though its convenient as far as downloading, there are pain in the ass to work with afterwards. Enjoy Hoe!
