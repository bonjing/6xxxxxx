I already use tvcountdown for shows and airing dates, thepiratebay for any torrent and imdb to movies/series info. But that last part searching is new to me!

I just hope that later on I can find pt-br subs for this release.

Ow, and I will comment on a/v quality as soon as possible."
,fasterthanlight,2011-10-20T17:00Z,"You are welcome, and thank you for the positive comment.

The tip is also useful if you search for torrents via Google.

For example : To search for ""My dinner with Andre"" In Google type :

tt0082783  filetype:torrent 

Then it will search only for torrentfiles, and the IMDB code for the movie.

Information wants to be free. :)"

,fasterthanlight,2011-10-20T17:58Z,"To NiggerKnives : The quality is 720p and A/V : 10.
But There are so many fake torrents out there, so I want other people to comment on the quality, to confirm it to other downloaders.

Thank you for your comment NK, Sharing is caring,  but I think you need a hug. A big, looong and cosy one. Or maybe several hugs. :)"
,fasterthanlight,2011-10-20T18:28Z,Can anybody give me a YAAAY on my last comment. Please :) TPB is supposed to be such a friendly place.
,fasterthanlight,2011-10-20T18:45Z,Noone? Anyone? :)
,fasterthanlight,2011-10-20T18:59Z,"Well, I am allowed to try.

Have a good one, everybody. :)"
,cephas86,2011-10-20T20:18Z,"Wow this niggerknives person clearly has some major issues going on. 
All fasterthanlight put that there for is to show that he cares about peoples comments on the quality of his upload. It never said anything about what he thought of the quality of his own torrent. With that being said. You are the idiot, niggerknives.

And YAY to you fasterthanlight! Ty for upload. And ignore people like niggerknives."
,fasterthanlight,2011-10-20T20:46Z,"Thank you for the YAY cephas86. :)

But as for NiggerKnives he is probably at a lowpoint in his life.

I remember when I was in love. I met nice people eveywhere. At the store, on the bus, at work, and nice policemen and women on the streets, and so on.
When I went through my divorce, I met stupid assholes everywhere. At the store, on the bus, at work, and stupid policemen and women on the streets, and so on.

Then I realized that it was all in my attitude.

Dont knock NiggerKnives. He just need a hug. A big and loooong one, maybe several hugs in a row.

NiggerKnives I understand you. Dont give up, everything will work it out in the end. :)

THIS TOO SHALL PASS.(I'm not screaming, just encouraging in an capital way)"

The Hacker Manifesto

by
+++The Mentor+++
Written January 8, 1986

Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers. ""Teenager Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal"", ""Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering""...

Damn kids. They're all alike.

But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain, ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker? Did you ever wonder what made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?

I am a hacker, enter my world...

Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...

Damn underachiever. They're all alike.

I'm in junior high or high school. I've listened to teachers explain for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction. I understand it. ""No, Ms. Smith, I didn't show my work. I did it in my head...""

Damn kid. Probably copied it. They're all alike.

I made a discovery today. I found a computer. Wait a second, this is cool. It does what I want it to. If it makes a mistake, it's because I screwed it up. Not because it doesn't like me... Or feels threatened by me.. Or thinks I'm a smart ass.. Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...

Damn kid. All he does is play games. They're all alike.

And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is found. ""This is it... this is where I belong..."" I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to them, may never hear from them again... I know you all...

Damn kid. Tying up the phone line again. They're all alike...

You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip through were pre-chewed and tasteless. We've been dominated by sadists, or ignored by the apathetic. The few that had something to teach found us willing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert.

This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the byte. We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals. We explore... and you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.

Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for.

I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this individual, but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike. ""

Resistance is the mantra. :)"
