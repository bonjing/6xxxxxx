,froak,2011-10-18T09:46Z,steve jobs hasn't had a single unique idea in over 15 years.  all the did was take someone else idea > make a crappier version > repackage it > charge twice as much.  the only sucessful thing he did was brainwash millions into thinking he completely changed how everyone lives.
