This software helps you to downgrade your psp 6.35/6.31 FW to 6.20!!

I have uploaded this because there are many games that are not supported by 6.35 pro!! But 6.20 pro is the best pro that supports all latest games...

Simply open PSP folder, then open GAME folder and copy 'downgrader' folder in GAME folder of PSP!!!

This a very simple app, just put the official 6.20 updater in (ms0/ef0 accordingly)PSP/GAME/UPDATE, and run the downgrader, this will reboot into the 6.20 "update", and allow you to downgrade to 6.20.

You can get 6.20 firmware easily in my uplods...just have a look n u will get it!
