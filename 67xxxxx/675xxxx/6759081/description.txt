Beecher, Penna, and Bittingerâ€™s Algebra and Trigonometry is known for enabling students to â€œsee the mathâ€ through its focus on visualization and early introduction to functions. With the Fourth Edition, the authors continue to innovate by incorporating more ongoing review to help students develop their understanding and study effectively. Mid-chapter Review exercise sets have been added to give students practice in synthesizing the concepts, and new Study Summaries provide built-in tools to help them prepare for tests. The MyMathLab course (access kit required) has been expanded so that the online content is even more integrated with the textâ€™s approach, with the addition of Vocabulary, Synthesis, and Mid-chapter Review exercises from the text as well as example-based videos created by the authors.
