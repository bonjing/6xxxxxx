Im trying to use different engines to run, but i still can't complete a race.

You can try with Crossover Games! It runs perfectly, and yes, we can finish a race :-).
Crossover Games is simply to use, you have just to create a bottle (the app do this in 10 secs) and run the game!!

Search the full version on ThePirateBay!"
,gulart11,2011-10-25T00:38Z,"To use Crossover Games, you have to go to the TM United Forever.app Package Contents - then go to drive_c -  Arquivos de Programas - TM United Forever folder, and extract the files to a folder.
Then, on CO Games, choose Other Application, install by file, choose the TM United .exe file and wait a few seconds! If you did everything correctly, you will be on the game screen!!"
