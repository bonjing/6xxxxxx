Dragon is a popular New Zealand â€“ Australian rock band, they were formed in Auckland, New Zealand in January 1972 and relocated to Sydney, Australia in May 1975. They were previously led by singer Marc Hunter and are currently led by his brother bass player Todd Hunter. They performed and released material under the name Hunter in Europe and United States during 1987.

Keyboard player Paul Hewson wrote or co-wrote most of the group's hits: "April Sun in Cuba" peaked at #2 on the 1977 Australian singles chart; "Are You Old Enough?" reached #1 in 1978; and "Still in Love with You"[11] reached #15 also in 1978. The Hunter brothers with Todd's partner, Johanna Pigott, wrote "Rain" a #2 hit in 1983. The name, Dragon, came from a consultation of I Ching cards by early band vocalist Graeme Collins.

Dragon have endured tragedy and notoriety. Several band members died during their association with the band: Drummer Neil Storey of a heroin overdose in 1976, Paul Hewson of a drug overdose in 1985 and Marc Hunter of smoking related oesophageal cancer in 1998. The Stewart Royal Commission (1980â€“1983) which investigated the Mr. Asia drug syndicate obtained evidence that Dragon members were clients. The band also had a disastrous 1978 tour of USA which ended when Marc Hunter accused his Texan audience of being "faggots" and the band were pelted off stage. On 1 July 2008 the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) recognised Dragon's iconic status when they were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame.
