On the eve of his high school graduation, Will Kidman finally looks up from his books to catch the eye of the girl he's longed for the last four years - the mysterious Eliana Wynter. He's always been the shy kid, flying under the radar, but when he discovers a dark secret from his past - that he is heir to a powerful line of werewolves - he finds he has a choice to make between succumbing to his primal nature, or turning against his own, and maintaining his humanity. In order to fight the destiny of his legacy, and save Eliana - as well as himself - he must battle not only his growing blood lust but an army of fearsome beasts bent on killing him, Eliana...and then, us all.
