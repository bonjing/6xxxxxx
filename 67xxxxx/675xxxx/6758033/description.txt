â€¦ itâ€™s that ridiculous, good-time excess that keeps Look What the Cat Dragged Inâ€™scatchiest songs, especially the party anthems â€œTalk Dirty to Meâ€ and â€œI Want Action,â€ just as much fun today, if not more so.

- Steve Huey/AMG (4/5 Stars)

Look What the Cat Dragged In is the debut studio album by American glam metal band Poison, released in 1986 through the Enigma label of Capitol Records.Though not a success at first, the album steadily built momentum and peaked at #3 on The Billboard 200 on 23 May 1987 . The album spawned four singles, three of them charting successfully: â€œTalk Dirty to Meâ€, â€œI Want Actionâ€, â€œI Wonâ€™t Forget Youâ€, and â€œCry Toughâ€. The album is a prime example of the glam metal genre both musically and image-wise. The album ultimately has sold 4 million copies worldwide, one of their best-selling albums.The album was certified Gold in 1987 and 3x Multi-Platinum by the RIAA in 1990. The album has been certified by BPI silver and by CAN platinum.
Musical style

Described by Revolver Magazine as â€œoversexed, under-thought, and relentlessly funâ€, the albumâ€™s style is often described as â€œglam metalâ€ and was strongly influenced by East-Coast bands such as KISS and Aerosmith. It is a sound dominated by simple distorted power chords and catchy melodies. Reflecting a period before the bandâ€™s music began to take on the influence of Californian, Van Halen styled stadium rock, the album is characterized by more traditional heavy metal sounds.

Production and marketing

The record was described by vocalist Bret Michaels as a â€œglorified demoâ€. It was recorded at Music Grinder Studios in Los Angeles, California with producer Ric Browde in twelve days, for a cost of US $23,000, part of which was funded from the pockets of the band members and their families.

The front cover of the album featured the members of Poison at their most â€œglamâ€, with each sporting excessive make-up, thick girlish hair, and the pouting â€œkissâ€ pose which was to become a Poison trademark. The cover is often compared to MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼eâ€™s Shout at the Devil because of the similar album cover, but it also may or may not have represented a loose parody of the cover of The Beatlesâ€™ Let It Be, or perhaps more likely, Van Halenâ€™s debut album.

Themes and tracks

The albumâ€™s themes are ambition (â€œCry Toughâ€), lust (â€œI Want Actionâ€, â€œTalk Dirty to Meâ€, â€œWant Some, Need Someâ€), sexual frustration (â€œBlame It on Youâ€), love lost (â€œI Wonâ€™t Forget Youâ€), and, most importantly, anti-social behavior (â€œNo. 1 Bad Boyâ€, â€œLook What the Cat Dragged Inâ€, â€œLet Me Go to the Showâ€ and â€œPlay Dirtyâ€). â€œTalk Dirty to Meâ€ was written by guitarist C. C. DeVille prior to his joining the band. DeVille played it to Bret Michaels, Rikki Rockett and Bobby Dall during his audition for the role as the bandâ€™s guitarist. â€œTalk Dirty to Meâ€ has been covered by several bands, including Children of Bodom and Reel Big Fish. It is also included as a playable cover track in Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, with Michaels re-recording the vocals.
