  A human bone is found in the desert accidentally by a dog playing fetch with a man and his son. Grissom and Catherine assemble a team to comb the area for more bones. Back at the lab, they piece together the skeleton and determine that body was cut to pieces. From his teeth, the deceased is identified as a 70-year-old Mel Bennett. Catherine and Grissom pay a visit to his wife, who claims that her husband is at a nearby store. Sara and Warrick are called to a motel where a male stripper is found dead on the bed. The room is registered to a woman who recently threw a bachelorette party for her friend.
