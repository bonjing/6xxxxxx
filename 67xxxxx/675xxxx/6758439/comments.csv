,helgi71,2011-10-20T14:54Z,"Thanks, can you upload Batman Year One Blu ray?"
,zdude555,2011-10-20T17:12Z,Not a single 2GB  720p BRRip. Come on rippers :(
,athiest09,2011-10-20T17:19Z,@yify there is only one thing bother me y there is no 5.1 audio? other than that its so good to watch the quality of movies. if there is 5.1 audio everything will be set no need to update our collection in future for 5.1 audio. YIFY just think about it! At-least dolby surround
,athiest09,2011-10-20T17:21Z,Even its a movie to be watched in surround sound effect. So thats make me feel down![No offence]
,sell-out,2011-10-20T17:27Z,"Video acceptable 8 but Audio Bit rate  32.0 Kbps you gotta be kidding me,that is poor,come on yifi you need to up the audio to a reasonable level,not less than 96kbs or thereabouts "
[T],zeromancer,2011-10-20T17:30Z,"Too many low quality HD movies on pirate bay, this is one of them.

Here's a minus!"
[V],YIFY,2011-10-20T19:44Z,"@Trusted - zeromancer 
I never encoded and uploaded this movie for you mate, it was made for the people who wanted it. :)
"
,NarutoNamikaze,2011-10-20T21:43Z,"@ Zeromancer. you can't ask for more quality in such a small size. yes the vid is not as good as the 10 GB versions. But for guys like me who have less space, YIFY is the best uploader.

Thanks a lot YIFY

Waiting for Hangover 2 and HP DH 2"
,Shank9,2011-10-20T22:22Z,"@Osanda91 That was exactly what I was going to type. YIFI - I have no clue what it stands for but plz consider renaming yourself to YATB 'cos You Are The BEST !!!
\m/"
,Dr.Cwb,2011-10-21T10:11Z,"Thank you yify team 

I'm watching it right now
quality is good (perfect for only 750mb)

V 10/10
A 10/10
subtitle looking good :)

I can't complain (just so you guys know I'm watching it on a 42 inch LED tv), sure  quality could be better BUT still better than any DVD rip and I believe you can't have better quality with only 750 MB "
,Wave_rider,2011-11-28T14:33Z,"a/v: 8/8

For me audio seemed a bit off. Only fraction of a second, but noticeable. Video quality is decent for size. Worth checking out!"
,Mishkini,2012-01-19T14:45Z,"a/v 10/8
thanks"
,jp93,2012-02-16T10:55Z,"Thanks YIFY! Would it be possible to upload the Jurassic Park Blu-Ray special feature ""Return To Jurassic Park""? It's not available anywhere and you are the best I've seen. Seriously, not even trying to be a kiss-ass. 

I'm specifically looking for the ones dealing with 1993 Jurassic Park. I haven't upgraded to blu-ray and am not planning to just for one movie.

Thanks again!"
,vividh,2012-03-01T08:10Z,What's up with this torrent magnet link? What does it mean? I am able to download it properly but I want to know why they changed the way of downloading.
