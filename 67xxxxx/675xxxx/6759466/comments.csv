,72Suited,2011-10-24T10:44Z,Seriously do you think people use MKV? It's 2011 and you think we want an MKV? LOL
,72Suited,2011-10-24T10:46Z,"AVI, Tard!"

,MoviesR101,2011-10-24T16:12Z,"Thanks For The Great Uploads!

@ 72Suited - What the hell are you talking about? MKV is better than Avi! You don't what you are talking about.......Idiot! If you can't play this movie, then you need to download Media Player Classic! MKV has excellent quality and is always in Sync! With Avi you do not know what you are going to get?"
[V],RR-NE,2011-10-26T03:34Z,"no disrespect at all phatwarez

but i also would prefer avi, mp4

Also if some people want to transfer an mkv to their
PS3 or xbox, they cannot as those machines do not support MKV

I join my files then transfer to my ps3 in Mp4

Still great quality"
