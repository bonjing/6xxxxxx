The Science of Good and Evil: Why People Cheat, Gossip, Care, Share, and Follow the Golden Rule
by Michael Shermer

Drawing on evolutionary psychology, Skeptic publisher and Scientific American contributor Shermer argues that the sources of moral behavior can be traced scientifically to humanity\'s evolutionary origins. He contends that human morality evolved as first an individual and then a species-wide mechanism for survival. As society evolved, humans needed rules governing behavior-e.g., altruism, sympathy, reciprocity and community concern-in order to ensure survival. Shermer says that some form of the Golden Rule-\"Do unto others as you would have others do unto you\"-provides the foundation of morality in human societies. Out of this, he develops the principles of what he calls a \"provisional ethics\" that \"is neither absolute nor relative,\" that applies to most people most of the time, while allowing for \"tolerance and diversity.\"
