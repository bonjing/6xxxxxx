A new Captain Marvel prestige format 4-issue limited series from DC Comics, Shazam!: The Monster Society of Evil, written and illustrated by Jeff Smith (creator of Bone) began publication on February 7, 2007. Smith's Shazam! miniseries, in the works since 2003, is a more traditional take on the character, returning Captain Marvel to his roots with a story that updates the character's history for today's readers. It is set early on in the character's career however, as it is clearly not set in the modern day DCU. In this version, Mr. Mind resembles a small snake with a more threatening face with apparently perfect vision while wearing a modern style communicator headset. Many different monsters are shown in the Society, with the Crocodile men becoming Alligator Men.
