The supplier might be Flawless, but the rip isn't.  Overall it's very good for an HDTV RIP (no Blu-Ray has yet to be released), but there are some issues here and there.  Just before 1:53:00 there's a strange video flutter when Rose's mother is starting to be lowered in the life boat, and I believe I saw it at one other point in the movie as well.  The audio goes out of sync noticeably about 1:43:45 by a few 10ths of a second at least, and remains out of sync for a few minutes perhaps.  Nothing can be done to fix it since it's only a small portion of the movie unfortunately.

These are NOT issues with  my system.  I have multiple computers and a Patriot Box Office media player, and these issues are all identical on every device.    "
