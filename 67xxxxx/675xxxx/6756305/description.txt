OK this is the kind of shit you love me for. I have repacked Silentscape Studios\' Silent Hill 1, giving it a normal installation (I heard people had troubles with the original, and original wasn\'t the latest version, so they had to look for the patch).

Anyway. Here you get a complete, repacked Silent Hill 1 for PC, which works under Windows XP/Vista/7 (I tested), AND I wrote a trainer for the game, which gives you invulnerability and infinite ammo for all guns (tested under XP/VIsta/7 too, but you might need to disable UAC, because it blocks hotkeys sometimes).


The installation:

P.S. I actually write other trainers for games that have no cheats under the nickname \"SingleRose\" (that was inspired by my friend, she loves roses :P), and by now I have 20 trainers total. All are unique in the sense that I wrote them for games that have no (working) cheats. I\'ll be making a public release some time in the future.

------------------------------

P.P.S. I DO NOT want to hear that something is not working. I test all my stuff on multiple computers and several editions of Windows, *everything* works fine. If something is not working, the problem is on your side.

*sigh* still, report the problems. I\'m here to help, as usual. I just hope it\'s gonna be something geniune, not \"I forgot to install DirectX\" type of comments, like it\'s been with my repack of New Vegas.


My policy, however, stays the same: if you don\'t have the basic know-how or (basic) skills to make pirated stuff work on your system, BUY games.



Credit foir original game (emulated) release goes to Silentscape Studios, obviously. Great release.



And the usual warning: if you detect any viruses in my releases, throw your anti-virus out of the window and get a normal one.



I would also like to ask you not to reupload my trainer to other sources (yet) because im planning to make a public release with at least 20 trainers at once.
