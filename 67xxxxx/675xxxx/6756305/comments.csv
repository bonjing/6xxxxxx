,Iztok1967,2011-10-19T17:39Z,Thank you
,illiria,2011-10-19T17:45Z,"Btw, in the beginning of the game, you are supposed to get killed by first two monsters you encounter (in the dark alley), so turn off invulnerability for that part."
,DiMarko,2011-10-19T18:30Z,I figure I'll play this. I've listened to the Silent Hill OST collection many times over now. I guess I could actually -play- the games for once.

As long as you dont mind the graphics in this one. Silent Hill 2, 3 and 4 look ten times better. But most people believe 1-st is the best game in the series."

Thank you very much, i was thinking of requesting this from you.
Will you do the rest of the games in this series ?
And could you give a list of games that you will upload in the near future ?
Plz don't stop uploading your unique releases,we love them..........."
,elturbo9077,2011-10-19T19:35Z,"@illiria

can you please  make silent hill origins or shattered memories into like this i mean if i explain my self well by putting the emulator and game together like this in other words this game was homemade imported to pc but this uses a psx emulator instead of a pc game engine  your a cool uploader your uploads are unique "
,illiria,2011-10-19T19:39Z,"@ gunnersrock 

I can upload the rest, sure. I haven't worked on them though. Would be just a simple game-crack-trainer (not mine). you can already find that all around. Wouldn't be a ""unique"" release, but I can upload that to gather all silent stuff in one place.


My next releases... Definitely Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic games. I've put TONS of work into them. Created very good custom patches for both games that fix dozens of bugs, and include a complere high-resilution remaster of both games.

Next is gonna be Resident Evil 1-3, I think. Repacks there are not made by me (but by someone very talented, great repacks), but I wrote the trainers for these releases. So it will be the ONLY Residents 1-3 that actually have cheats (uploading trainers alone will likely be no good, coz I wrote them for these specific versions).

After that... We'll see. I guess I should release my small (but very unique) trainer collection already. You just can't find the trainers for eomulated Silent Hill, or emulated Mortal Kombat Trilogy, working trainers for Resident 1-3, or Gun Metal, or Rebel Assault, or... etc."
,illiria,2011-10-19T19:44Z,"@ elturbo9077

I can do that, but it won't be soon. Because I normally don't work with emulators, I have no real experience in configuring them properly. So I can do that - eventually - but it will take quite some time to put everything properly into a single release and thoroughly test it.

Due to the specific nature of modern games, operating system differences and game software requirements, not everyone can get even my PC releases working flawlessly, let alone emulators..."

thanks alot man take your time i will be waiting for that big day and real silent hill fans will be happy also psp version of orgins is better than the ps2 version becuase it has better graphics and can emulate it  better i ask to much right do resident evil code veronica and zero also if possible just take your time "
,illiria,2011-10-19T20:33Z,"@ elturbo9077 

I want to do Code Veronica also. Chances are, I will get to it some time soon. Already looking into it."
,elturbo9077,2011-10-19T20:43Z,"@illiria 

just in case you did not know resident evil remake was already done and it works perfectly but half of the game is fucked up

,illiria,2011-10-19T21:14Z,"@ elturbo9077

I'm not really that interested in RE1 remake. I have original game, it works flawlessly under xp/vista/7 (some guy did a GREAT repack), and I've passed RE1 seven times, and ABSOLUTELY love it. I don't want any other. :) RE1, original, is my most favorite.

I'll check the remake though."
,DiMarko,2011-10-19T21:51Z,"I don't care about graphics while playing games, half the time. I still would rather play Megaman Legends 1&2 than some of the 'Adventure' games out these days."
,illiria,2011-10-19T23:33Z,"Does the trainer work for you people? This whole torrent is primarily a test for the trainer. :) Just figured I'd throw in a game with it, since I made a repack.
Should work for everyone, since I tested it on multiple computers and every system, but I am curious to get a user feedback. Just remember, UAC in Vista/7 can get in the way of hotkeys."
,Cerebral222,2011-10-20T07:44Z,"I can verify that the trainer works perfectly, very nice job with this illiria, I would love to see the end result of Code Veronica when your finished, Cheers."
,illiria,2011-10-20T12:20Z,"@ Cerebral222

Happy to hear the trainer works great. That means I can write trainers for other emulated games, and as you know, some of them are just too hard to play on PC."
[T],gunnersrock,2011-10-20T16:32Z,"@illiria

Can you do all 3 stalker games updated to the latest version into a single repack and also with a custom installer?"
[T],gunnersrock,2011-10-20T16:34Z,Custom installer and custom autorun to select which of the 3 to install.....
,illiria,2011-10-20T17:31Z,"@ gunnersrock

I doubt it... I don't have a lot of time lately, and still a dozen projects to finish. :/

I'm making more releases lately coz I'm releasing things I've done long before, but right now I don't have enough time."
[T],gunnersrock,2011-10-20T18:45Z,"@illiria

Ok,thanks for the reply"
,Die51,2011-10-21T02:35Z,Is there anything we can do to help you get a skull? People need to know the love of your releases!
,illiria,2011-10-21T11:55Z,"@ Die51 

No idea, I have no clue how do people get skulls."
,Wowtgp,2011-10-21T22:50Z,I have shared almost all ur repack on blackcats.btw if u want to get skull then apply on superbay forum nd thanks for this nice upload
,elturbo9077,2011-10-22T07:26Z,"@illiria 

to get a skull the only way is that a mod of this site gives you one and notices you by uploading alot of torrents and people downloading from them with good reviews you will get a skull of trusted a pink one for starters then a vip or a helper if upload scene torrents you don""t need to go to some forum just keep uploading "
,StupidGamer,2011-10-22T08:41Z,Thank you so much. It took me a while to figure out how to download it but I figured it out. This is the first game I got off of here and I love it!
,illiria,2011-10-22T18:02Z,"@ StupidGamer

Thank you! I'm glad you like the game. It's a great classic game, I'm glad people have a chance to play it."
,StupidGamer,2011-10-22T21:02Z,Now just trying to get the trainer to work :)
,zacho1111,2011-11-06T21:36Z,ok im new to this and im kinda stuck i downloaded it and sent it to bit torrent and it downloaded but it has been seeding for a long time what do i do.
,nick.1,2011-11-12T11:55Z,"cool don't get me wrong but when it starts it completely stops, then it says missing files... its fine though no worries"
,nick.1,2011-11-12T12:00Z,"i figured out the problem, half of the trainer won't download"
,nick.1,2011-11-12T13:23Z,"well i got a trojan hahaha, not sure if this was your fault but everyone who wants this game do not download this torrent. "
,ballinsb,2011-12-20T22:49Z,is there a way to set the controls to a usb controller?
,knightkuyu,2012-01-14T17:28Z,Thanks for this. If possible can u upload Battlefield bad company (the first one)? Cannot find it online.
,knightkuyu,2012-01-15T06:10Z,Ignore last comment. Its only on console.
