  Ceramics are where art meets function - one of our oldest and most    
  fundamental art forms, that sits at the centre of our homes. The      
  first film in this three-part series looks at a history of domestic   
  pottery in Britain from Tudor times onwards, tracing the evolution    
  of its different techniques and styles, and examining what our pots   
  can tell us in intimate detail how preceeding generations lived and   
  saw themselves.                                                       
                                                                        
  Whether it's for celebrating birth, marriage and death (our own or    
  royal), eating and drinking or showing the world our social status,   
  ceramics contain more than just our tea or coffee - they contain      
  something of our lives, our social DNA, and reveal a lot about our    
  taste and habits as a nation. They become, in effect, snapshots in    
  clay.
