Go beyond layer 2 broadcast domains with this in-depth tour of advanced link and internetwork layer protocols, and learn how they enable you to expand to larger topologies. An ideal follow-up to Packet Guide to Core Network Protocols, this concise guide dissects several of these protocols to explain their structure and operation.

This isnâ€™t a book on packet theory. Author Bruce Hartpence built topologies in a lab as he wrote this guide, and each chapter includes several packet captures. Youâ€™ll learn about protocol classification, static vs. dynamic topologies, and reasons for installing a particular route.

This guide covers:

    * Host routingâ€”Process a routing table and learn how traffic starts out across a network
    * Static routingâ€”Build router routing tables and understand how forwarding decisions are made and processed
    * Spanning Tree Protocolâ€”Learn how this protocol is an integral part of every network containing switches
    * Virtual Local Area Networksâ€”Use VLANs to address the limitations of layer 2 networks
    * Trunkingâ€”Get an indepth look at VLAN tagging and the 802.1Q protocol
    * Routing Information Protocolâ€”Understand how this distance vector protocol works in small, modern communication networks
    * Open Shortest Path Firstâ€”Discover why convergence times of OSPF and other link state protocols are improved over distance vectors
