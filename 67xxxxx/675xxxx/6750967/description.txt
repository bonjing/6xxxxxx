Laurie Adams (Author)
Paperback: 640 pages
Publisher: McGraw-Hill Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages; 5 edition (October 15, 2010)
Language: English

Appropriate for one-semester art history surveys or historically-focused art appreciation classes, A History of Western Art, Fifth Edition, combines sound scholarship, lavish visuals, and a lively narrative to provide students with an accessible and engaging introduction to art history. Focusing on the Western canon, the text presents a compelling chronological narrative from prehistory to the present. A non-Western supplement, World Views: Topics in Non-Western Art, addresses specific areas of non-Western art and augments the Western chronology by illustrating moments of thematic relationships and cross-cultural contact.
