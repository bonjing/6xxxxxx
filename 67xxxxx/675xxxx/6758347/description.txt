Short black-and-white film is Ditvoorst's debut with which he made a staggering entrance in 1965 and for which he was greatly admired by big names like Godard, Bertolucci and Ivens. Ik kom wat later naar Madra tells the story of a conscript who is given leave to visit his wife, who has been admitted to hospital after a traffic accident. When the recruit wants to hitch a ride to Madra, he is arrested by the military police. Next, the film abandons the logical narrative structure and presents various possible narrative threads.
