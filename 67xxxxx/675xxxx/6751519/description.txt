This torrent includes the official podcast mp3s released on the www.glennbeck.com website for the radio show. It includes the "4th Hour" with Pat & Stu which is available only to subscribers (ie. it is not part of the regular radio broadcast).

Sorry for the delay today.  There was something wrong with the podcast version of the 4th hour which never was posted properly.  I kept refreshing and waiting for it, and eventually got fed up and downloaded the mp3 from the website.  As a result, the 4th hour mp3, while named correctly, will probably not integrate into iTunes properly.
