As you may have guessed, Texas Slim is from Texas and has been playing the blues for well over twenty years now and from the highly enlightening sleevenotes of Norman Darwen; we are reliably informed that he is also a well recognised guitarist playing the clubs in and around the areas of Dallas and Fort Worth. He normally plays with his band Love Machine but, here he is showcasing his more than singular guitar-slinging skills at a live recording at the Il Magazzinodi Gilgamesh, in Torino, Italy, on the Tenth, of March, this year.

Backed by the stalwart and incomparable duo of Martin Lotti; bass and Lele Zamperini; drums. This twelve number set contains a whirlwind of ferocious Texan twanginâ€™ numbers and heartfelt blues that covers a range of emotions. From the bittersweet lingering and tensely spine tingling feelings of â€œHigh Alert,â€ which, right from the start beautifully stuns you with the aching and slowburninâ€™ emotion filled guitar artistry of T.S. His rendition of Freddie Kingsâ€™ â€œSee, See Baby,â€ is a wonderful footappinâ€™ shuffler displaying his flowing and running string work, coupled with his  unique vocals which are very reminiscent of Andy Fairweather-Low combined they make for splendid foot frivolity. The raw, rocking and absolutely stinging â€œBoot Hillâ€ is T.S.â€™s tribute to the legendary Johnny Winter, make no mistake this number takes absolutely no prisoners and will strip paint! A blistering, stomping, raucous study in good old fashioned, rocking Texas Blues.
