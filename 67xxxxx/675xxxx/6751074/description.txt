                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Celebrity Coach Trip is a celebrity version of the popular Coach Trip series. 
 Different pairs of celebrities travel on the coach around Europe as it visits 
 different destinations. At the end of each day the passengers have to vote who
 they would like to leave the trip. The passengers with the most votes receive 
 a yellow card. Once you receive two yellow cards you have to leave the trip   
 and be replaced.                                                              
                                 Enjoy!
