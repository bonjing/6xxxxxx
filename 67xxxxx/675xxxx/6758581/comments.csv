[V],boobsman,2011-10-20T17:22Z,"@ shediyo, nothing its the same game. I upload to 15 / 20 different torrent sites n this hasn't been posted on most of them,  i think about the community as a whole not just TPB."
,shediyo,2011-10-20T21:32Z,thanx mate
,Master3055,2011-10-21T01:48Z,"Is it just Kinect or can u use controller also? 

Thanks Boobsman u are the man"
[V],boobsman,2011-10-21T11:55Z,"@ Master3055, this is a Kinect game and does need the sensor."
,FucHollywood,2011-10-21T15:44Z,Whoever puts up battlefield 3 first is my new hero
,shediyo,2011-10-21T23:02Z,"@boobaman,  i wanted to ask you about XGD3 , i know that what im supposed to do is truncate but it writes only 97% of the game so sometimes it doesnt work....but what about overburning? isnt it better? thanx ahead"
[V],boobsman,2011-10-21T23:46Z,"@ shediyo you cannot over burn as the 97% of the iso is already taking the full space of the dl disc. The remaining 3% is just disc padding or non essential data but would still not fit even if you could over burn, follow the xgd3 burn guides you'll be fine."
,shediyo,2011-10-24T17:33Z,"@boobsman Thanx mate for all your help and i just want to say that all of your uploads worked perfectly for now , so , thanx for that too."
