Plot

Stan Ross was a baseball superstar who turned his back on the
game years ago when he finally hit 3,000 hits. Years later,
he's now a successful, self-made entrepreneur whose many
businesses revolve around his title: Mr. 3000. But a clerical
error has proven that Stan is just short three hits of his
spectacular homerun record. Now, with time on his side and the
potential to be inducted in the Baseball Hall of Fame, Stan
must return back to the game and get back his title. But
things have changed with age, and as Stan finds out, it's not
too easy to get back into the game when he hasn't played for
years, and he's nearing 50.
