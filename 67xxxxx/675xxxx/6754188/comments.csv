Hence I have produced this easy to use file , which works on any platform given a pdf reader. Enjoy!!!"

,ramikaz,2011-10-19T16:37Z,"@gallio; Thanks for the help, but I went to Android Marketplace and tried to download SpanishDict through Gmail, but it told me that there are no Android phones associated with my account. So now I either have to figure out how to associate it or get the app from some other source.  Thanks."
