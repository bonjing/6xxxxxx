,Aerionix,2011-10-22T08:36Z,"@knightmare777

Crysis 2 had a fairly easy workaround to get into online games.  Borderlands had no problems whatsoever.  As long as the occasional game does seem to allow it, then its a valid question. 

Oh and the random capped words look like the letters written by the religious kook characters in stephen king novels.  No offence, just sayin. 

Sadly in this case, the answer is no so far.  Think I may give this one a buy tho.  Not liking the bots.  Also Have a feeling there may end up being a good community and dev support for this.  And can't beat the price.  "

For The Peeps That have No Idea what Ur talking about > By Installing DX9 on Win7/Vista It DOES NOT Overwrite Your Version Of DX11/Dx10 ,, It Only Adds The Required .dll files That The Game Needs To Play.

Why don't you go back to the bathroom, tuck your junk betwwen your legs and sing some show tunes you dilt!

The torrent does work but if you have a USB controller plugged in (in my case xbox 360), the game will not load after one use. And alot of experienced users had an issue with this. 

So yes, at first glance it would appear the torrent doesn't work but after the controller is unplugged it does. SO PLEASE DO THE WORLD A FAVOR AND PUNCH YOURSELF IN THE NADS in hopes you can never reproduce."

They're are in a dir called ""crack"" on the cd-iso you mount. 
With the image mounted open ""My computer"" and right click your virtual cd-drive and select ""open"" and find the dir."

,YellowBeard89,2012-01-06T06:35Z,"@ bravo2011 Your reading and comprehension skills need a little refreshing. Re read yellowbeard68's post - he said those who ""call torrents shit and not working"" - he didn't say anything at all about those having technical issues being stupid. Maybe learn to control those emotions a little bit and think before replying to something you aren't grasping initially. You are having technical issues - so his reply isn't even about you - is it? Kinda a touchy person...it's all about you and the guys on the football field in a huddle are probably talking about you lol - g'day"

open up yr folder to where the iso is open it with winrar take out the crack file then delete the original launcher download all the missing dlls if it asks you to....BUT!!!! now the problem is when you click on it a black screen comes up for 1 sec then goes away but i think someone has found a solution to that in earlier comments "
,crazysas,2012-04-22T02:14Z,YES!!!! all you have to do is run that physx thing in the redist folder
