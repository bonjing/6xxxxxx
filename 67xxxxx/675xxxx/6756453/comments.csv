thanks for the favor, buddy. for packaging this great collection. I had in mind something like this but I didn't have these movies. So I'm downloading them now. Will seed until 1000% on my paid-for superfast seedbox.

how about another DVD's worth of more Marvel, older movies like the Spiderman trilogy, the earlier Hulk, the X-men series? see if you can, buddy...

cheers"

http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/6497382/Marvel_Heros_Movie_Collection.6497382.TPB.torrent

Sadly, for a humongous 15+GB torrent he (she?) fails to list the contents & their quality, unlike how you've done :-(

Will check torrent and revert..."
