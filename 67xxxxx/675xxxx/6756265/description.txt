Pink Floyd's The Wall (1979) stands as one of Pink Floyd's greatest achievements,
as well of one of the greatest achievements in rock music and live concert 
production. The album spawned a tour, a film, a book of the film (now quite 
collectible), and eventually an all-star revival concert in Berlin, and finally 
in 1999 a double live album. But before The Wall was a film, a concert, or even
an album, The Wall was just an idea... an idea under construction. The Wall went
through at least two "demo" stages. The first was a crude recording of Roger 
Waters strumming his guitar and singing alone. Presented by Waters at the same 
time as another concept called The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters' first 
demo - still uncirculated even today - was deemed unlistenable by the rest of the
band, but they felt it had potential. The Hitchhiking demo was set aside, but The
Wall demo was developed further. Many writing sessions later, Pink Floyd - probably
with assistance from Bob Ezrin - recorded a second, more complete demo. The lyrics
were not polished, and neither was the music. Thankfully, lyrics like "I am a 
physician/ who can handle your condition/ like a magician" would be entirely 
discarded and rewritten before the songs were finally committed to tape in a studio,
but the rough lyrics and the risky musical experiments which appeared in that 
second demo have finally made it to the public.
