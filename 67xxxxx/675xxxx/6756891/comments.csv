,steph222,2011-10-21T01:03Z,yes i have the same problem as rob2042
,fwee288,2011-11-01T05:33Z,"agreed, good A/V but subtitles way off

Since its hardcoded I don't think you can fix it either :/"
,fwee288,2011-11-01T18:30Z,"Just finished watching.  Skip this version if you need English subs as these hardcoded ones are an entire scene off. 
So you are watching a new scene when the subs from the last scene start arriving.  Try paying attention to storyline subs from 3 minutes ago while watching a new action scene... 
Movies pretty good tho on a side note if you like the Ip Man series."
