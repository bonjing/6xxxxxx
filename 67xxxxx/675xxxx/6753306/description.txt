Release Notes
---------------

Overview:

Oblivion features a powerful combination of free-form gameplay, unprecedented
graphics, cutting edge AI, character voices by acting legends Patrick Stewart,
Sean Bean, Terrance Stamp, and Lynda Carter, and an award-winning soundtrack.
Gamers can choose to unravel Oblivion\\\'s epic narrative at their own pace or
explore the vast world in search of their own unique challenges.

With more than 30 hours of new gameplay, Shivering Isles allows you to explore
an entirely new plane of Oblivion - the realm of Sheogorath, the Daedric Prince
of Madness. Shivering Isles features a bizarre landscape split between the two
sides - Mania and Dementia - filled with vast, twisting dungeons mirroring the
roots of the trees they are buried within. Sheogorath himself looks to you to
be his champion and defend his realm and its inhabitants from destruction as
you discover all new items, ingredients, spells, and much more.

Knights of the Nine features an all-new faction and quests for noble characters
and answers many of the questions surrounding the Ayleid ruins found throughout
Oblivion. Players can join a new faction and found their own order of holy
knights - leading them into battle against a sorcerer-king and his demonic
minions while exploring massive dungeons and searching for legendary relics -
the holy armor and weapons of the Divine Crusader.
