Sorry to destroy youre thread here but I have some problems with he The Bat mail program I downloaded (youre torrent of course)

I canÂ´t get this serialregister to work.

The software says that the serial not are in the right format.
There is no instructions in the info-file so I donÂ´t know how to understand the way to apply them.  The serials in your file are in this format:

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx+xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx etc..

What does the ""+"" mean??
I tried to use the whole serie, but that doesnt work.
I also tried to only use the serial BEFORE the ""+"" and AFTER the ""+"" , but non of these attempt worked.

What shall I do?? (please)"
