If you check the page 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Criminal_Minds_episodes

You will see that it didn't air on 10/26/11
It will air on 11/02/11"
,popeye013,2011-10-31T06:44Z,"Yes, thanks alot, i also checked the Criminal Minds Facebook page and saw that CBS was holding the next episode back because of the MLB World Series game, that was rained off, how ironic, but thank you very much. "
