Brand new plugin just launched: WP Geo Attack

WP Geo Attack is the combination of a unique WordPress plugin
that offers over 10 Geo targeting options via shortcodes, fully
HTML ready area and over 20 options for how the pop up comes
and goes into the pages, paired along with not only plugin training
videos but also a series of brainstorming video sessions talking
about how different marketers can use this.

So offline marketers, affiliate marketers, CPA marketers, high
traffic website owners etc. I will be actively adding to this resource
area to improve peoples knowledge and hopefully spark creativity
in buyers to think of new ways to use this tool.
