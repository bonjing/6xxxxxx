And sorry to be too demanding but do you have Harold Robins and Arthur Hailey's collections in epub?"
,Bookeek,2011-10-18T15:48Z,"Hey sufiriz, I only clean up books that I can find online. Someone else has to have scanned them. These are all the Chase books I could find.

There are only 3 books by Harold Robbins that have been scanned... I haven't looked at Hailey yet..it takes time..be patient...:)

cheers"
