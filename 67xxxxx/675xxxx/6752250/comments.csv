It is well researched/ filmed & edited and covers key issues in a balanced manner.
In my view it deserved the Screen Awards of Western Australia (P.I.A.F) award and the A.T.O.M (Australian teachers of media) final 4 selection (Science and the environment).  
It runs for about 45 minutes and the download quality is very good. I think the information in the film has probably saved lives."
