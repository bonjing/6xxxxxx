George B. Thomas, Jr. (late) of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was a professor of mathematics for thirty-eight years; he served as the executive officer of the department for ten years and as graduate registration officer for five years. Thomas held a spot on the board of governors of the Mathematical Association of America and on the executive committee of the mathematics division of the American Society for Engineering Education. His book, Calculus and Analytic Geometry, was first published in 1951 and has since gone through multiple revisions. The text is now in its twelfth edition and continues to guide students through their calculus courses. He also co-authored monographs on mathematics, including the text Probability and Statistics.
