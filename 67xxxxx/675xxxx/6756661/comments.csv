,scheister,2011-12-21T06:12Z,"i am currently working on a massive organized archive of TTL, CMOS, information, and electronics text books to help others in the same field, nothing like having all the information you need at the push of a button. plus, if i gain the favor of karma for helping others through school on on the lab when i didnt have to, then im ok with that lol."
,0qubit1,2011-12-25T06:05Z,"Karma has been gained lol. I'm a lab assistant at my university, so I'm sure a lot of students will benefit from these. I always try to find ways to digitize everything. I mean, why else are we studying electronics??"
