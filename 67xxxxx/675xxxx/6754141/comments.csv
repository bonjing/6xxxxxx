Do you actually think i upload files without checking them first???

My #1 priority is quality all the books i upload are checked twice to see if they are complete and readable.If it's not good enough for me then it's not good enough for down loaders.

I throw out 40% of books i get because of quality issues.The copy of ""Earth Sheltered Houses'' that i have on my HD is complete,very readable and clear.Your copy must have gotten damaged during transmission that i have no control over.It happens more often to certain books than others

I can't guarantee you will get the exact same copy of the book that i have .I can only hope you will.The Internet is not perfect"

Thanks for sharing, although I doubt I'll ever build an underground lair for myself... ;-)"
