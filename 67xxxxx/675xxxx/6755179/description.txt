[ENCODERS NOTES]:        [ The Movie is a compilation of the footage made with a hand held camera by the three students who had disappeared while filming this all. The quality despite this being a BRrip aint that great owing to the not so good quality of the original footage that was used.

this is from imdb trivia : The film was originally of a much higher definition quality and was degraded deliberately to look more authentic to the time it was shot.
                           When promoting the film, the producers claimed it was real footage. Some people still believe it.
