Sean Faircloth, Director of Strategy and Policy for the US branch of the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science, discusses his new book, Attack of the Theocrats: How the Religious Right Harms Us Allâ€”and What We Can Do About It, which examines the crumbling of the United States' most cherished founding principleâ€”the wall of separation between church and stateâ€”and offers a specific and sensible plan for rebuilding the church-state wall. The book also names The Fundamentalist Fifty, current members of Congress who have made some of the most extreme theocratic statements. If they weren't so scary, they'd be funny.
