,thefan23,2011-10-20T19:31Z,If only we had linux and were able to figure out the handheld program...
,b_b0t,2011-10-21T00:33Z,"HR please say you have enough time to post your steps for video conversion and metadata editing from MKV to Apple TV compatible M4V :) This will help me (and many others) with converting and arranging my existing video library which is all HD in MKV. Thanks again for your work, my iTunes library is exclusively yours ;)"
,mstr005,2011-10-21T05:45Z,Hey HR thanks for all these movies much appreciated. Can you upload a brrip of 300 and Gladiator
[V],HolyRoses,2011-10-21T15:09Z,"@b_b0t the process is too complex I believe to do that.  It requires some advanced knowledge to effectively use.  handbrake should suffice for most users.  This program was written for myself.  I share it to the world however but I cannot provide personalized support for it.

-HR"
,b_b0t,2011-10-22T04:22Z,"Do you have a download link for the program so I can mess around with it? Just adding the ""HD"" symbol in iTunes is my aim to distinguish quality of files added. With regards to my existing library what settings should one use on Handbrake to achieve your video results?"
,AlyCatt,2011-10-22T09:54Z,"Audio goes out of sink about half-way through the movie... : / aside from that, it's pretty decent."
,madelynn,2011-10-22T17:04Z,"hey hr would you be so kind as to ul the hangover 2?

,honkyjesus,2011-11-01T06:24Z,Cinavia?
,felli_fel,2011-11-08T03:04Z,okay im not into all the net lingo so brrip means you coppied it from blue ray... or you can put it on blue ray? can you put any of your torrents on dvd?
[V],HolyRoses,2011-12-03T20:57Z,technically anything can be put on a dvd if you try hard enough.  I hear you can even put stickers on them.
,1martand,2011-12-04T01:25Z,Aarrgh Cinavia!! PS3 not having it! Is there another version HR? 
,strikerace100,2012-01-21T00:43Z,"**DO NOT DOWNLOAD***
CINAVIA PROTECTED
I DOWNLOAD TO WATCH NOT REWRITE THE DAMN THING !!!!"
,Gliktch,2012-03-19T14:52Z,"Strikerace100, why do you say ""Do Not Download""?  The Cinavia protection is an audio watermark embedded into the original Blu-Ray disc; it's nothing that can harm your computer or anything else, it's certainly not something added or deliberately included by HolyRoses (there probably aren't any copies of this movie without that watermarking), and only affects people who buy a Blu-Ray player which is crippled with protection crap.

Possible solutions?  Downgrade your PS3 firmware to v3.01 or v3.00, or watch the movie on your computer, or set up a HTPC (costs nothing if you have an old PC kicking around, and can be superior in some ways to a PS3 for this purpose), or just suck it up and quit whinging on quality torrents...  Actually, definitely do that last part - HR only puts out the best rips, and doesn't need your garbage comments muddying up the legitimate feedback.

Love your work HR, my gf and I really appreciate your efforts, especially all the great iPod format releases :)"
