,Sunil237,2011-10-18T19:40Z,"Definately not 100% DVD quality, but good enough to count as a DVD version for me. I don't download anything below R5, but as this is labelled as a DVD it got downloaded, and is good enough to watch."
,DIgitalTribe,2011-10-18T20:54Z,FINALLY I VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE SINCE I CAN REMEMBER MY SELF
,nambr9,2011-10-18T21:16Z,FAKE as every shit froggie100 puts up. I have no fucking idea what you did to get green. This is NOT a DVD rip. DVD will be released mid november ... Froggie stop this shit and dont be such attention WHORE !
,nambr9,2011-10-18T21:20Z,NOT a DVDRip !! DVD is released mid november.
,Xarvayn,2011-10-18T22:18Z,"I've downloaded a bunch of these so called DVDRips, this one's probably the best though they are all similar. It's definitely watchable, more like an R5. So for an R5: A/9 V/6."
,MrSorter,2011-10-18T22:43Z,"Thanks for the FREE up, to all the trolls go fuck yourselves. If you don't like the product put your fucking hand in your pocket and go the cinema, buy the DVD just stop fucking complaining"
,rampagekage,2011-10-19T00:06Z,"no shit the dvd comes out mid nov, all dvdrips come out b4 the real dvd release fucktard!! quit complaining, and the reason he is VIP is bcause he puts n the effort!! what have you upped dumbarse"
,rampagekage,2011-10-19T00:16Z,"why dont u assholes upload some better copies and stop bitching! duh the dvd comes out in nov, doesnt all the dvdrips come out at least 2 weeks if not longer b4 that so wait and buy it fucking cry babies"
,BlueEyedCrow,2011-10-19T01:21Z,"Thanks so much Froggie!

I've checked the sample and the quality is far superior than all previous versions on TPB and is certainly very watchable. Although, personally I think this copy's not quiet a DVD copy, however I'd say it's very close to being DVD quality.

A - 9
V - 8

- Thanks again Froggie!"
,dydog2,2011-10-19T05:58Z,I love this movie!!!
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-10-19T06:18Z,"Mislabeled !!!

Quality does not recommend this rip as  DVDRip !!

V=8/A=8

Very watchable ... but you'll have to wait for the real DVDRip !!

Thanks anyway."
,scottsasse,2011-10-19T08:15Z,"@froggie100, Thanks for the up and all but you should know better than to label this a DVDRip!! You know as well as I do that this is likely R5."
,G3n3tiX,2011-10-19T15:56Z,"@scottsasse

An R5 is a DVDRiP, so say ty, then fuck off."
,VectusKL,2011-10-19T21:29Z,"I think why everyone is getting annoyed about this is because usually DVDrips come out way before DVD releases. I mean look X-Men First class came out with a DVD rips months before it came to DVD. Its just one example, but you get the idea. This movie was released in the cinema in July, and its now only a few weeks before the DVD comes out. I personally have been waiting a long time too, as the other versions were annoying to watch after viewing at the cinema. and telling someone to go and buy the dvd when they are on Pirate bay is an irelevant or stupid comment to say to someone, when you, I and everyone here is pirating."
,VectusKL,2011-10-19T21:31Z,"and on that note, Froggie should have marked this one as R5, there is actually a difference between R5 and DVD you know...."

,thugking8,2011-10-20T03:00Z,Who gives a fuck about dvd if its a good copy download it or fuck off with ur dumb comments
,dlarrym1111,2011-10-20T09:02Z,"There is NOT a difference. A TRUE R5 is simply the region code. DVD's for sale in the retail region R5 means it was a real retail DVD made for sale in Russia and western europe. IT IS a REAL DVD. Why is it that R5's have great video, but when english is the spoken language, it is taken from a CAM and laid in sync (if the person doing this has a clue) over the Russian audio. No ones need argue with me about it, Google what R5 means in terms of movie releases on DVD and you will have millions of legit places that will explain to anyone that is interested in the truth. Don't hate the messenger. 
There also other region codes:  R2, R3, R4, R6 and other region codes. This code system makes it easy to make sure retail DVD's that are spoken in Greek for example, don't get shipped to Japan by mistake. 
Another example:
It would be a mess to get 400 cases of the DVD -LIMITLESS- that are dubbed by the studio into Chinese and they get sent to Peru. The region codes prevent this.  
R5 regions include area's in Russia. When it is Monday at 5pm here in Canada on the east coast, it is already Tuesday in a few places in Russia. Remember Russia covers like 10 or 11 time zones (almost half the surface of the planet. . . SO, a Russian uploading a DVD he bought on HIS Tuesday the way the time zones are figured, it will appear on TPB on our Monday. This makes it seem as if the R5 is an early release, but it isn't.  The difference in time zones is what makes it seem that way.  

As mentioned, the R5 designation is only a way to know what region it is supposed to be sold in. Some DVD players will NOT play DVD's with  a region code that isn't the same as the Region code of the DVD player itself. All this is old news. If there is any doubt, Wikipedia has an extensive explanation. It even has nice color coded maps of the whole world showing what region codes correspond to what countries. and it explains how the region codes in your DVD player can affect weather a given DVD will or will not play in your player. Some players are ""REGION FREE"" and will play any dvd no matter where it is from. You can even re-flash your computers DVD player with new firmware to allow it to play DVD's from regions it wasn't originally supposed to. (If you bought a used external DVD burner from EBAY for example, and it turns out it has a region code set different from where you live. If this was to happen, you would need to change or reset your DVD Player/Burner's region codes to match your area or set to ""region free"") I think a DVD player that is region R1 will play ANY DVD. "
,dlarrym1111,2011-10-21T04:55Z,"I got this downloaded in just a few hours. I also downloaded 4 other uploads to compare (5 total). THIS copy is by FAR the best. The audio is really good, and the video (IMO) Is DVD quality or there is so little difference that I am absolutely happy with it.

A-9/V-10 I haven't had time until now to watch the entire film (watched the 1st 30 or 40 mins. to get an idea of quality so I could comment on such) 
ANYWAY. 
As for my comment on the Region Codes (R5) I hope it shed some light on what that is all about. One last thing. Someone is probably saying: Well @ dlarrym1111, If your right, Why don't we see R4's or R6's or other region coded copies showing up?"", The answer is that I don't know?
I would bet some are infact mis-labeled with the assumption of it being an R5. I really can't speak to that, I don't know why. This observation in no way de-bunks my previously posted comment/info on what a region code is. As B4, don't rag on or hate the messenger, I had to learn about this at one point as well. Knowledge is Power. There are MANY Many places the speak on the subject of R5 DVD's and all the other region codes.
Hope it helped.
This upload should be the highest seeded, it is MUCH MUCH better then the one that is in that spot now.
Way to go  &  Cracking the whip on  and  in this instance!! AWESOME: ( no disrespect to  or  whcih are well respected and trusted uploaders) The mention of either of there names alone translate to Supreme Quality.
Great upload. . . . Keep it up!"
