The songs on "Human Touch" were written by Springsteen as exercises to help him cope with writer's block. It shows. If Springsteen held himself to his usual high standards, only half of these songs would've been released. Also, many of the songs sound overproduced - too many bells and whistles thrown in and not enough focus on the vocals and guitars.
That being said, lyrically, "Real World" is one of Springsteen's best songs. "I Wish I Were Blind," "Man's Job," "Human Touch," and "With Every Wish" are also excellent songs. "Roll of the Dice" is one of those songs that doesn't work too well on the album, but is great live.
