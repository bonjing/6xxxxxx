,trinidads,2011-10-20T15:06Z,Is there is something new? Like source where the monsters attack back or working skills.
,BlackEcho,2011-10-20T15:09Z,Is this legit?Really works?
,Ayukumi,2011-10-20T15:56Z,It works. But you can only create characters and walk around. Nothing more =(
,BlackEcho,2011-10-20T16:54Z,So i guess we have to wait for updated version of the server with monsters and stuff.
,Tiazi,2011-10-24T13:37Z,"Its working. Easy peasy to get it working.

But as said before:

You can only create a class and run around in a empty world.

No npc's
no monsters
no quests
no dungeons"

BUT WITH THIS IN NUMBERS 4 WHAT AM I SUPPOSE TO SEE IN THE D3 GAME PATH FOR IT TO LET ME RUN LOCAL SERVER? IS THIS SOME KIND OF HACK OR SOMETHING. CAUSE U HAVENT ANSWERED ANY1S QUESTIONS.


1. Install the Diablo 3 Client using ""Diablo-III-Beta-enUS-Setup.exe""
2. Extract ""mooext+v9.6.zip"" to any desired destination.
3. Run ""MooExt.exe""
4. Make sure the ""D3 Gamepath"" is set correctly under the tab ""D3 Launcher""
5. Go to the tab ""Mooege Updates""
6. Click ""Manual Check"" (or press F5)
7. Wait till its done.
8. Click ""Play (Local)""
9. @account/password fill in anything you desire. Username needs an @!"
,Heartofhades,2012-01-14T05:09Z,"ok i found it of info from a diff site

.Run it. Set D3 Game path(show Diablo III.exe to it). Now click Mooege updates then press F5. Wait for the update to finish. Do this update every time you run the emulator. They update the version per 6-12 hours. After the update, click Play(Local). 


OK now my question is where do i find (show Diablo III.exe to it). file i have tryed many times and different ways, all leading me to no local server access."
,ToxicBullet,2012-01-17T00:49Z,WTF everytime i try and log in its wont let me comes say Error # 5005 or something like that
,ToxicBullet,2012-01-17T15:22Z,it actually says Error #3003
