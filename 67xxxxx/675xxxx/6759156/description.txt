Hitman's Run (1999)
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0174741/

A former mob hitman, now in witness protection, is forced to come out of retirement when his family is threatened by his cohorts. He teams up with a skateboarding kid, who has a computer disk that the mob wants to get their hands on that has a list of new names for individuals in the FBI witness protection program. The list includes his dad, who separated from his mother years before and hadn't been seen since.

Eric Roberts looks kind of haggard in this pre-Dr Drew Celebrity Rehab film.  What's it about?  An hour and a half.  But someone took the trouble to email me a request and it was simple to find.
