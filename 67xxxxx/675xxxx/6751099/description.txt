This informative and practical guide to the Miller Method[registered] presents an entirely new and dynamic perspective on advancing the body organization, social, and communicative skills of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Taking a cognitive developmental systems approach that uses elevation to build body awareness and focus the children on people and objects, the Miller Method[registered] works on the premise that children with ASDs learn more effectively when their whole bodies are physically and repetitively involved in a learning process or 'system'; a completely different approach from the more traditional schoolroom arrangement in which children learn while sitting at a desk. Chapters outline the underlying principles of the Miller Method[registered] and its practical application, and cover major issues such as communication skills and social play, and day-to-day behavioural issues including tantrums, aggression, and toilet training. A chapter on research outcomes demonstrates the efficacy of the method in practice. This practical resource is essential reading for parents and professionals living and working with children with ASDs.
