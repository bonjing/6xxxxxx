We think it is the possible next catalyst 11.10
rc as the date are exactly the same than catalyst 11.10 preview 3.
All updates from previous preview 1,2,3 with new CFX ability,better support and better compatibility as well and few other minor fixes.
You won't see catalyst 11.11 in ccc either but well catalyst 11.10.
Our final thought...
Let's wait till october end so.
Btw,found another new very interesting driver for HD 6000M series from HP for most of HP laptop with this series...
Will up them asap...
cu around"
