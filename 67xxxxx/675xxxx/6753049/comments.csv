,servitka,2011-10-18T12:37Z,This is what i have been waiting for. I hope it will work. Thanks.
,jetine2,2011-10-18T14:43Z,"Blinking fixed, still lagging when the cursor moves."
,Atharol,2011-10-18T15:09Z,Thanks. SKIDROW is best!
,simen929,2011-10-18T17:33Z,I can't find the SKIDROW folder??
,asdf181,2011-10-18T18:58Z,Btw typical Avira false positive; virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=d259c642175b905a015a3d861a52ea54758b4e53b3f09bc274a3810b8de0e7bd-1318937013
,ShaH1977,2011-10-18T22:21Z,"it doesn't work
after cracking, when I start the game appears window with
""Connection failed
Invalid password"""
,asdf181,2011-10-19T00:33Z,Sounds like you didnt crack it right. Sure you copy every file from the Skidrow folder to the main?
,Silver4k,2011-10-19T00:57Z,"@ShaH1977
It's not that it doesn't work, it's that we're still waiting on a full offline mode patch, so that we might be able to have all the features, such as dynasty weapons/abilities and whatnot."
[T],alexisthebest,2011-10-19T01:26Z,"You can try this:

Creat a shortcut of Might & Magic Heroes VI.exe then add /offline at the end of Target field (example: ""C:\Program Files\Ubisoft\Might & Magic Heroes VI\Might & Magic Heroes VI.exe"" /offline) "
,dave212,2011-10-19T08:20Z,"do you install hmm6_digital_1.1.1_efigs on a ""clean"" install (V1.0) or do you need to update to C1.1 before ?"
,Protoz,2011-10-19T09:29Z,I get a message saying that this shitty game's patches are incremental & that i need to have the previous patch installed before running this. I downloaded Skidrow release why am i getting this message?
,Protoz,2011-10-19T09:48Z,nm
,luxa336,2011-10-19T10:50Z,@alexisthebest I can't do it! :S I try so many times but..I can't change anything. 
,asdf181,2011-10-19T12:14Z,"@Dave & Protos:
You can download the prophet crack, there is the other patch. I used this version after i played with Prophet + Patch and no problems."
,kubepug,2011-10-19T13:12Z,"I did all that was said and when i start the game the ubisoftgamelauncher.exe crashes ,help!"
,s3rv0,2011-10-19T16:58Z,I can't click on next mission in 1.1 patch... But it works fine in 1.0
,marty30,2011-10-19T18:08Z,"a played the tutorial campaign, beat lord Gerhard and so in finished the tutorial. I click next map on the window that appears congratulating me for my accomplishment. When I do that it takes me back to the second mission from tutorial. When I enter into the campaign it does not reconigze that i ended the prologue so the other factions are locked. Any solution???"
,rencol,2011-10-19T19:54Z,"Im not sure if this issue is caused by this patch, but after instaling it (and it works! just do it right) texture of some units (like pit lord, level 3 inferno creature) is much darker than it should be. Its annoying."
,Darceidus,2011-10-19T20:44Z,"If your game crashes after the update, delete your ProfileData file in 
My Documents/Might & Magic Heroes VI/Your_Name/

Launch the game again and it will remake the profiledata file. You'll have to click on Load Game to get back to where you were."
,skeelol,2011-10-20T01:26Z,Went from 1.1 with Prophet crack to this...you MUST add /offline to your shortcut or the launcher will not work. It's not rocket science kids. 
,arctype,2011-10-20T08:07Z,cant seem to join a multiplayer game over LAN.. its greyed out.. anyone worked this out?
,Jupiters8,2011-10-20T10:21Z,some one can put in trainer whore this version

,Kasseopea,2011-10-22T04:59Z,"Well, whats about the final campaign? Do i have to buy this game to finish it?!?"
,smoke_nl,2011-10-22T18:43Z,"works great new thx skidrow and alex for the upload

you dont need to have clean install just patch over the 1.1 patch that came out days earlyer then this 
so
-install the clean version(dont crack that one)
-patch the 1.1patch and crack that one 
-then patch 1.1.1(this one:P) and crack over the other crack 
(i just tryed to patch over the older im bit lazy but this time it is the good way:)

bevore i had some stability and colour problem's and that f*** annoying cursor but almost all is gone new and no new problems accursed for me "
,Lasurie,2011-10-22T21:12Z,"Doesnt works.

,ckies22,2011-10-26T12:02Z,do not copy past ubiorbitapi_r2_loader.dll.. its the error code 2. I guess?
,Bamboos7,2011-10-26T20:13Z,i must write a cd code? could someone help me?
,Lucifa13,2011-10-27T10:38Z,"Alternatively, find the HOMM6 directory, run Game.exe, let the autopatcher get you to 1.1.1 and then just copy over the contents of the Skidrow folder.

Works perfectly."
