-- The Great Birds Eye Peas Relaunch of 1971
-- The Harmony Hairspray Relaunch of 1973


Three short films made by Monty Python in the early 1970s which were never intended to be seen by the public, but only by the employees of Birds Eye, Harmony Hairspray and Close Up Toothpaste.

Although these industrial films are largely aimed at the staff of these companies, the information they provide is injected by a large dose of typical Python humour, and is essential viewing for all Python completists.

The quality of these films is good, but not brilliant. The rarity value of these items, however, far outweighs any concerns about video or audio quality.

With many thanks to SpinyNorman, the original ripper, for all his efforts.

Enjoy, and seed generously! :)
