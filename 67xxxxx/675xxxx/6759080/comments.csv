,simon200,2011-10-20T20:53Z,"bdcc69 your a tool
REAL!!!"
,Hilpi75,2011-10-20T20:54Z,yeah it's real but judging from the Screens it's a sub-par Cam with Asian Hard Subs...  You can always trust Uploads from Sceneline but I would wait for better version and watch the Original Movie with Kurt Russel  :)    http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084787/
,gladiatorproduction,2011-10-20T21:01Z,"downloading now , will report back with all the info soon"
,reaper85uk,2011-10-20T21:29Z,"thanks for upload , been waiting sooo long watch this movie. "
,john8611,2011-10-20T21:49Z,"@Hilpi75
  LMFAO .. ""original with curt russell""  ... omg.. cant beleive you said it"
,Chadly,2011-10-20T22:14Z,"Man it sucks unchecking all those boxes to just download the sample lol 

Thanks Sceneline, u rock :)

Sorry all if this comment went on more then once lol doesnt seem to wanna count it at the top besides comments. I know it takes a few mins to show up but the number of comments always changed. Not so this time..."
,michaelrwatson,2011-10-20T22:19Z,"How is it as far as flicker..? That's often much harder on the eyes (for me at least) than foreign subs, tilted camera, etc. "

Nobody likes a know it all but the original version is actually  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044121/"
,dickles,2011-10-20T23:04Z,"93% and moving  @ 1.1MB/s+ be  done b4 im done this comment..i is excited...been waiting for this, the orig is one of my faves...it looks like shitty quality w/subs...RARs are great but when  i see them here they sketch me out but i trust and thank sceneline!

hope its decently watchable...will seed and report"
,dickles,2011-10-20T23:09Z,awww snap...jus started it..its tilted but could be worse!  you cant expect a mint copy yet
,professorjpj,2011-10-20T23:09Z,"This REALLY looks like shit! What a waste of bandwidth.. A movie of this type needs AT LEAST screener quality, of better yet, an R5!  Anything else is a waste of time! "
,billygoat71,2011-10-20T23:44Z,"A-7 V-2 Vid is way to dark, what for better"
,michaelrwatson,2011-10-21T01:45Z,"Wow, i agree:  A7 V2 

The video is mostly just black (super-high contrast) in many indoor scenes, while many of the outdoor scenes have *terrible* flicker. I really want to see this movie, but to watch this would be to ruin it. Check out the sample before you waste the bandwidth. 

Thanks MiSTERE, but no thanx."
,dickles,2011-10-21T02:36Z,"yup,  wht a drag...when i started i was like  this is gonna  be ok...but its sooo  black  =(  i  hate to rate    it on this shitty version  but the plot itself doesnt seem as good as the orig"
,drivengreedy,2011-10-21T06:44Z,Way too dark.
,TripNine,2011-10-21T07:41Z,"To all that say its a remake, its actually  a prequel to the 1982 remake."
,tigertunes,2011-10-21T09:34Z,"Great upload but goina wait a little longer for a better copy, we dont get this in the cinema until dec 2nd bastard movie makers. Also you can watch this even if you have not seen kurt russel the thing as its a prequel and the 80,s version will carry on from the end of this. RESPECT UPLOADER !"
