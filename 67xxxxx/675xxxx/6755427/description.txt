One of the best opera's I've ever heard, the best Negro-Opera for sure.
The music is taken from conventional vinyl records, the best there was at the time: Deutsche Grammophon, so some scratches may be heard. The music is however so tremendously good, that I really had to share this. It was not found on Pirate Bay yet!

Together with this torrent comes a few pictures that was found in the songbook and the labels; anything else needed, just mention it.

Enjoy and help me seeding this beautiful music.
