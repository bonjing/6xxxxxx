Allow me to introduce you to one of "those" players. You know the one that you have never heard of, but should? Bobby is a talented leap frog of a guitar player. He's also one heck of a singer. Bobby is a bluesman aged to perfection.

13 tracks fill your ears on this release. From the title track's searing vocals, to the rockabilly, blues style of "Spanky's Twist"...the album starts off strong and ends strong as well. "Blues Medley" the last track on this album is pure blues perfection.

Here is a man who loves what he does. If you are looking for a bluesy, rock guitar man peppered with funk, look no more.
