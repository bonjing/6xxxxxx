,kbowk2,2011-10-21T05:31Z,"SPOILER of characters and plot for first 3 chapters:

I have already read the first 3 chapters.  Starts out with Phillip (the Govenor), Brian (his older brother), Peggy (his daughter (still alive)), and two of his high school firends taking over a house in Woodbury Housing Estates (rich area).  20 miles out of Atlanta for a pit stop.

They decided to bunker down for the benefit of his daughter and build a wall along the front of the house.   The place still has power and some TV reports at this stage as the crisis is in its third day.  

There are heaps of walkers wandering around a nearby a golf course but not so many in the streets for reasons unknown.

Phillip seems aggressive and is the leader but certainly not sadistic yet.  

Not a bad read and I would recommend it to anyone who is a walking dead fan (and can read books), as the first three chapters already give insite into the backstory of the governor.  The book centers more on older brother Brian and the world through his eyes at this stage. 

From flicking through the survival guides none of the other characters make it to the comic events.  But the place, Woodbury is where Rick and Co. are taken to within the comic arc so it will be interesting to see how it becomes a fortress and full of people.
