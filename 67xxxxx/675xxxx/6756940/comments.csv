[V],scene4all,2011-10-26T20:41Z,"What operating system are you using? and Are you trying to edit the host file manually? 

If your running windows 7 then right click and run the keygen as admin, then you should be able to patch the host file, or else if your trying to edit the host file manually, then you need to  first right click and run Notepad as admin, then click File > Open and go to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc and if ur not able to see any of the files then in the File name: text box type hosts and press enter, edit and save the host file."

Please continue to write up which host(s) to block in the NFO so noobs like me can do it manually.

Cheers!"
