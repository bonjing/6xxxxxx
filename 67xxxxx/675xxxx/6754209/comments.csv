,nemo..,2011-10-25T19:38Z,"ya what you said was right.it happened due to the loader changing your boot sector, fixing of your boot sector will fix the boot problem>"
,nemo..,2011-10-25T20:00Z,Thanks Thumper it worked fine and iam now runing a genuine version
,zlatantz,2011-10-25T22:21Z,"OK, so two questions. Will my Windows be updateable and will it work after installing SP1"

,Mechboys,2011-11-27T04:33Z,"Hi ThumperTM,
                       I installed the windows loader & message prompted  loader ,certificate & serial certificate installed successfully.

And it asked to restart the system for taking effect of the loader.

I restarted the system & checked for validation in Microsoft website.

The  message prompted for validation in progress & then the page was directed  to Microsoft security essentials.

Whether my windows 7 is genuine?"
,Mechboys,2011-11-27T04:34Z,Any suggestion would be greatly appreciated....
,Mechboys,2011-11-27T05:02Z,Can I update my windows?
