                progressive source ghosting. sfx were very quiet    
            and not ez to hear at end, and not added to cd.
            2nd audio is TVA so u can hear, not very loud, but  
            the sfx is the smashing of many items. tv intro 1st few             
            seconds slightly dif, was just instrumental...we used
            cd for those 2 or 3 seconds, so no audio change from
            tv to cd...just last 2 seconds from cd back to tv.
