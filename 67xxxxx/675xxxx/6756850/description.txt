A German Heavy Metal Band, formed in 1988 in Bremen. They have recorded seven Albums, and are still active. Their latest Album, â€œBack to Rootsâ€ was recorded in 2006. Unrest play Heavy Metal, that sounds that it comes straight from the eighties. 

UNREST was founded in May 1988 in Bremen (Germany). During the first three years two demo productions were recorded and numerous gig were played in the northern German area. 

In 1991 the first album Taste It was produced at the Delta-Studio Wilster (Schleswig-Holstein / Germany) which was released in 1992. 1994 the second album By the Light of the Moon was produced and was available at the shops in early 1995. First larger gigs with bands such as Rage and Skyklad followed until in 1996 the first successful tour with Iced Earth and Nevermore throughout Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands came up. Afterwards, the third CD Watch Out was produced in Osterholz-Scharmbeck (Niedersachsen / Germany). After its release in 1997 came the UNREST / SCANNER tour which led all the way to Italy. In the same year tours with W.A.S.P. and Sinner followed. In 1998, right on time for the band`s 10th anniversary, the fourth record Cold Steel Whisper was released and UNREST played at the WACKEN OPEN AIR FESTIVAL that same year. In 1999 the Restless and Live recorded was produced. It was released in 2000 followed closely by Bloody Voodoo Night which appeared in 2001. 

That same year UNREST toured the country with Dio and Sinner followed by a few concerts at several clubs in Germany until UNREST unfortunately was put into cold storage for about 3 years. In the beginning of the year 2004 al three founding members SÃ¶nke, Claus and Guido came together again just for kickstarting through anew with their two new band members AndrÃ© Neuhaus (bass) and Marco Liedtke (g.). Since that time new songs were written and several shows played just to announce their comeback impressively to the still existing fan community. Finally, in September 2006 the band signed their new record deal with Massacre-Records where the new album Back To The Roots was released on November 10th, 2006.
