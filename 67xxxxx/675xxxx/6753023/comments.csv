,sorris,2011-10-18T12:29Z,doesnt seem to work for me. after running it freezes and win7 gives back an error then the process shuts down. any help plz?
,A.T.H.K,2011-10-18T12:37Z,Error Code 2
,2si3,2011-10-18T14:29Z,"jesus !!! why ur you guys bothering with game cracks / registry modification for this game anyway ???
admit it, skidrow FAILED completely with this game since it DOSEN'T require a game crack to play it anyway 0.o.

1: clean install

2: if u downloaded update, just run the update whitout copying the crack, since u dont need it / OR  run  gu.exe  (in game folder) wich will update the game for you

3: only for those who update the game manualy need to run GU.EXE to update Ubisoft Launcher to 1.2 / if u update the game via GU.exe  than you can skip.

4: download and copy this in ubisoft game launcher folder  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6696953/Driver_San_Francisco_CRACK_Only

5: play the game (you will need to create an account but take only 10 seconds to do it)

NOTE: the DRIVER crack is NOT a game crack, it act like an UNIVERSAL GAME LAUNCHER crack for ubisoft games, with it u can play other ubisoft games without needing the actually game crack.
@ and for trolls, skidrow stolen this from russian site, if u want to give skidrow any credit, do it if he manage to make the dinasty / trails to work."
,2si3,2011-10-18T15:52Z,"even an easyer way to play it without any crack/DL

1 install
2 update via auto update
3 create a shortcut for Might & Magic Heroes VI.exe
4 add    /offline to shortcut
EX: at target   ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Might & Magic Heroes VI\Might & Magic Heroes VI.exe"" /offline
5 play"
,illrigger,2011-10-18T18:39Z,"So, does either crack allow you to use the features that Ubi disabled if you run in offline mode?  Did you guys not play enough to notice that the campaign play is neutered offline?"
,Darceidus,2011-10-19T20:34Z,"If the game crashes after you update, rename your save folder:
My Documents/Might & Magic Heroes VI to something else. Launch the game. A new save MMHVI folder will be created. Move your old save file into the new folder:
Renamed_folder/Your_name/Save
to
Might & Magic Heroes VI/Your_name/Save

the game crashes because of something going on in that folder."
,Darceidus,2011-10-20T05:54Z,"If your game crashes after the update, delete your ProfileData file in 
My Documents/Might & Magic Heroes VI/Your_Name/

Launch the game again and it will remake the profiledata file. You'll have to click on Load Game to get back to where you were and reload your Game/Video options."
,molderfox,2011-10-20T11:46Z,Works perfectly! just follow  instruction
,yaemhay,2011-10-21T19:05Z,"was searchin all day how to open and play homm6 with ubisoft luncher, and find 2si3 comment and it work,for all those who have trouble with game...."

,tejolson,2011-10-21T19:31Z,"You people need to define ""works perfectly."" Because it seems to me that it doesn't work perfectly. If I wanted offline mode, I would use the ""offline"" command in the shortcut. When I see ""works perfectly,"" I want to see dynasty weapons working. I've uninstalled both MMHVI and Ubisoft six times already and reinstalled with minor alterations involving this patch, the prophet patch, and the Driver San Fransisco patch. It usually ends up the same way, except the Driver San Fransisco is kind of different but same result."
,amb2010,2011-10-24T04:26Z,"Dynasty weapons and traits are something linked to the online Conflux server so it's pretty much safe to assume you will never get them. You're a pirate, get used to not getting the full game when they have online only lockouts on content."
,trusis0,2011-11-02T18:42Z,"Please help. I did everything what was in the video, but when i start the game, game goes in not responding and nothing is so great!"
,Kamerynn,2011-11-04T23:12Z,"Can't use the /offline command; entering that in the target field makes the target ""invalid"".  Must be vista?  Any other way to make it work?  BTW, 2si3, what you suggest is wrong... it's not as simple as just going through the normal motions as you describe since you still need a serial."
,Lexiar,2012-02-18T09:23Z,"To all who had the crashing at startup screen, i solved it in that way: 

1. Clean installation from here http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6739165/Might_and_Magic_Heroes_VI-SKIDROW
2. Download and install the update using gu.exe in game folder
3. Again download the second update (v.1.1.1 I suppose) using gu.exe in game folder (with first update it just doesn't work)
4. Replace the ""Might & Magic Heroes VI.exe"" with one cracked by PROPHET http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6741203/Might.and.Magic.Heroes.VI.Update.v1.1-PROPHET
5. Made a shortcut of this *exe, go to shortcut properties and add to the end of it's target line "" /offline"" (without quotation marks)

It seems that in my case the problem was solved by the second update, which was meant to solve the starting problems on some laptops. "
