Maybe. If it was to be uploaded only iTunes-Rip not AAC version.


@pxndxcarlos

Still compiling."
[T],theLEAK,2011-10-20T01:20Z,"Double checked, it seems iTunes doesn't have all the albums. This is probably because iTunes are not authorize to sell any AC/DC albums without their permission."
[T],theLEAK,2011-10-20T01:23Z,"@sahilravisherr

According to wikipedia:

AC/DC albums are available to download from Verizon, however AC/DC have refused to release their albums on iTunes as iTunes normally allows downloading of individual tracks and AC/DC have publicly stated ""Our...reason is that we honestly believe the songs on any of our albums belong together. If we were on iTunes, we know a certain percentage of people would only download two or three songs from the album - and we don't think that represents us musically."""

It's gonna be iTunes-Rip, which means it's 320 kbps mp3.

,tariqi,2011-10-24T18:27Z,"How is it 320kbps if it's an iTunes rip? iTunes Store gives you 256kbps AAC. It's worse to try and upconvert to 320 MP3, should've just left it alone."
[T],theLEAK,2011-10-24T18:32Z,"@northernsoul

Agreed"
[T],theLEAK,2011-10-24T18:36Z,"@tariqi

Q. How is it 320kbps?
A. Download it for yourself to see if it's 320 kbps

Q. It's worse to try and upconvert to 320 MP3
A. (1) It's not upconvert, it's converted. There's a difference. Look it up. (2) It's not worse, it's better quality. (3) It the quality itself is worse, then why are people seeding this eh?"

,ripley123,2011-10-25T21:44Z,"Do yourself a favor, please do not re-encode future m4a uploads to mp3 (just offering kind advice bud).

The way I see it is, Apple/iTunes use AAC files wrapped in an m4a container; you have re-encoded the AAC file into a higher bitrate mp3 file.  

Now whilst the information lost on the conversion is probably negligible on the resulting mp3 file, you have still compressed the file again, because that is what a 'lossy' encoder does, it compresses the file EVERY time you convert and some information would have been lost in the process.

In addition, you are adding empty space into the converted file and it is not a true 320kbps mp3 encoded file that you would have had if you converted a CD, WAV or Flac file into a 320kbps mp3 CBR file.

I would have been over the moon to DL your original m4a version of this album as you would have been offering something different to the other uploaders on TPB, and the quality would have probably been slightly better than the version you have kindly uploaded. 

To answer your earlier response to another comment, I suspect you have a lot of seeders/leechers because people see the word 'iTunes' in your title and think it's the bona-fide iTunes download without realising that the files have been re-encoded into mp3.  

Now if only you had kept the original m4a files, you would have catered for the iTunes market who like to keep all their files in 256kbps AAC.

I hope you don't take offence, I am just trying to help."

@ripley

Is there any truth to this?"
[T],theLEAK,2011-10-28T18:07Z,"@ripley123

It's funny how people like yourself complain about the things which are free but don't appreciate users who take their time to upload it. If you don't like this version, then buy it yourself. Even on the first comment it says ""Support the artist""

""I suspect you have a lot of seeders/leechers because people see the word 'iTunes' in your title and think it's the bona-fide iTunes download""
Well it is from iTunes. It was purchased but converted to mp3. The reason why this torrent has a lot of seeders and leechers is because of the quality that this version have that other torrents of the same album doesn't.



""I would have been over the moon to DL your original m4a version of this album as you would have been offering something different to the other uploaders on TPB""

Uploading iTunes Plus music on any filesharing or torrent sites such as TPB is bad. Why?

(1) Anything you buy/purchased from iTunes is DRM protected
(2) Details such as e-mail address and account name are stored on the album/songs
(3) You take the risk on being hacked since you're e-mail address is stored.
(4) If Apple Inc. sees you distrbuting/uploading files you've purchased to filesharing sites or BitTorrent sites such as TPB, there's a possibility your account will be banned. 



Some uploaders uses this method to get their source. With iTunes or other form of digital music store, uploaders don't necessary have to rely on Scene Groups.


""The way I see it is, Apple/iTunes use AAC files wrapped in an m4a container; you have re-encoded the AAC file into a higher bitrate mp3 file.""
That's what you see but in reality, it's converted not upconverted. There's a difference. Some users; won't mention name of course, upconverts files from an average 256kbps to 320kbps- That's re-encoding. 
"
,ripley123,2011-10-28T20:03Z,"If you knew anything about lossy encoders then you would know that it doesn't matter whether you are converting from one lossy format to another (aac to mp3 or vice versa) or upconverting a lossy file (aac to aac or mp3 to mp3 etc), the ENCODER for either lossy format WILL take an average of the sound wave resulting in further compression of the newly converted file, and what does compression result in? Yay, you got it, quality loss.

And you realise that there is software to remove DRM tagging?

My previous comment was only giving the facts, sorry that you have decided to get defensive."
,atryd,2011-10-29T16:06Z,Great album. Thankyou!
,mmmp9sjl,2011-10-31T15:28Z,"hmm.... i wonder how was the re-encoding done, not 100% perfect, there are pops and for example early on in the 2nd track. but thanks anyways."
