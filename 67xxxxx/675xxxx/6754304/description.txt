For the first time in franchise history, the ladies are more than just friends ??? joining the cast are two sisters, who are married to two brothers ??? and one sister-in-law, bringing a whole new level of familial drama to the table.
While family remains a priority for each of these women, their shopping, decorating, dating and even fighting are all over-the-top.
