Kill Bill Vol 2 For psp with subtitles for the japanese parts spoken in the movie.
seed please! The reason the movie file is over 1gb is because I encoded it with really high quality. Like HD in the palm of your hand, so enjoy! 

Direction For Nooby Noobs:
1.) Download U-torrent and install it:  
http://www.utorrent.com/

2.) Download this torrent, and open it in Utorrent.

3.) Open the folder and copy and paste BOTH FILES IN THE VIDEO FOLDER OF YOUR PSP.

NOTE: Make sure to place the "Kill Bill Vol. 2.thm" file inside the video folder of your psp as well. The thm file shows artwork on your psp of the movie before it's selected. It looks better. You don't have to put it if you don't want to, though.
