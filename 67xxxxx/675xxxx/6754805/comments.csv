,viking2410,2011-10-19T21:36Z,Downloading and seeding now... will this built in key be banned from microsoft because its been here?
,EiNST3iN,2011-10-20T04:10Z,"No it wont. This is actual a college release edition. I have used it since it came out at my college in 2007. I have put it on many computers without any problems. 

This is completely safe and works perfectly. "

,EiNST3iN,2011-10-20T16:57Z,"@robin33111, I am not sure why. I didn't build the install for the software so I have no clue. That is just how it was when I got ahold of it from my university. It only cost me $20 and the license key is unlimited as far as how many machines it can be downloaded on. Saved me $300 at the time. "
