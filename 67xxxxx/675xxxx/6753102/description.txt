"Ok onto the source video first .....not too bad for a cam,but had some noise,colours too strong,had
rainbow effect,camera movement at intro and a few other times...but the worse thing missing video.
Now the colours,brightness etc....we've fixed the best we could.
As for missing video,feck all we could do without another source....but intro there is 56secs missing
in the middle there is 2x cuts 1x 7secs and 1 x 3secs and the end is missing almost 1min 40 secs.
At the very start there is alot of camera movement etc....so we opted to cut it you could see anything
anyways.
Now audio....very nice cam,but due to the video missing here and there was a PITA to sync but got there
in the end.
Once synced we saved the file and remastered it in AA...cleaning it up and changing the EQ settings and then
finally remuxing to our encode. "
