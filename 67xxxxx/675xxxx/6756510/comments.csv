,therealtruth,2011-10-20T14:11Z,"So, you losers actually believe Metallica or Lou Reed give a shit what you think?

Goes back to masturbating and illegally downloading, whilst generally being losers. ;]"
,thermit69,2011-10-20T18:55Z,vad i hela HELVETET e detta för skit snälla någon döda Lou Reed
,motorkent,2011-10-20T23:19Z,fuckin great album :D awesome.
,jpuff,2011-10-21T04:00Z,"its been wonderful, I really love it, so full of emotions.

I read the other day that there are plans for live performances of the album, I hope someone thinks of the faraway people, brings a good recorder and make a torrent."
,solidus.snake,2011-10-21T12:38Z,Thank you for seeding! dl complete in just under 2min.
,bil_gr7,2011-10-21T14:10Z,"@therealtruth actually yes I believe Metallica gives a shit, because what band wouldn't care what their fans think of their albums?"
,jpuff,2011-10-22T03:01Z,"it takes a (long if youre dummy like me) while to understand the full story, which is great cause you can keep hearing it again and again.

1 Brandenburg Gate:
took me a while to understand the first part... shes new there, the background she has about it is what she has read back at the small town. first she fears the worst, then she figures out something more fit to her.
she describes the setting and about what she does, she has manage to get by.

2 The View:
pretty straight foward, is what shes about.

3 Pumping Blood:
Lulu full of adrenaline.

4 Mistress Dread:
Lulu following high emotions of what she does.

5 Iced Honey:
is not just need nor circumstance, this is the way lulu is, with all her heart.

6 Cheat on me:
Lulu bragging about herself.

7 Frustration:
someone is in love with Lulu, but hes just pathetic and cant really reach her.

8 Little Dog:
Lulu leaves the poor dude for someone better.

9 Dragon:
the poor dude looks for lulus love inside her guts, he couldnt find it, her love is an illusion.

10 Junior Dad:
I hope Im right...
Time passes and the poor dude has a kid, who ask him for the ultimate help, the poor dude is still hallucinating about lulu, only stopping when reality breaks his thoughts.
Caring for his son at the last hour vs Lulus heart.
this song makes me cry a lot.

just a dummy guide, dont take it wrong if Im mising something, this is just in case someone is having trouble figuring out the album (you need to hear it again and again)."
,slasherman,2011-10-22T18:49Z,biggest turd ever!﻿
,Werse,2011-10-25T01:35Z,Thank (god) for Megadeth!!!!
,Stormerwaffen,2011-10-28T04:24Z,"Hhahahha this is fucking bullshit!
What a crap."
,Apollokun,2011-10-29T01:06Z,"Reed's earlier ""Metal Machine Music"" is much harsher on the ears than this, actually. This is pretty good, if not a bit rough on the auditory senses, and one of the more unique colab albums I've heard from anybody, ever."
,Apollokun,2011-10-29T01:25Z,"Also: This albums is based off the ""Lulu"" plays, and the whole thing makes a lot more sense if you read the synopses of them.

Apologies for the double post."
,DoctorMadcow,2011-10-30T01:09Z,This is absolutely the worst shit ever created by man. Id rather pay to listen to St Anger played backwards than ever even acknowledge this was ever made. Jesus Christ........
,Camellita,2011-10-31T13:55Z,"Oh my God! This is great. I am so gonna buy the album! Goodbye, torrents!"
,lottar,2011-10-31T20:10Z,metallica brings another turd for their faithful fans
,amiais,2011-10-31T23:06Z,100% real mas 200% uma grande merda. A voz do Lou Reed soa a tristeza. Metallica não é isto.
,mukaas,2011-11-01T15:22Z,thx
,wormsrbad4u,2011-11-21T07:43Z,This album is awesome and really shit at the same time!
,nofear2161,2011-11-25T14:09Z,"Like Pulp Fiction, You must understand it before you love it."
,railgun1,2011-11-30T07:31Z,"Hard to listen, but not a total crap."
,suckseggs,2012-04-04T18:04Z,"Worst album metallica has ever laid their fingers on.... oh well, thanks for the upload "
