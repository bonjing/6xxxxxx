When finished loading, I'll tell if working on DS emulator for WinXP (so probably for recent versions of Windows)."

,chris-g123,2011-11-29T16:29Z,"Same problem as kreem.

Game worked fine when i updated my tt menu on my r4i card but london life just leads to a blank white screen.

Does london life require a wifi connection??"
,chris-g123,2011-11-29T16:41Z,"@loshpop and others getting an error when using cards.

Try upgrading your card firmware.

Find and download ""Retrogamefan multi cart update v6.72"" and copy the firmware for your card onto your sdcard ( ALWAYS Back up the sd card to your pc before changing file to prevent braking your card)

Although this is fairly straight forward to do, non-technical people may have issues, I cannot be held responsible for losses if you mess this up. if your not sure how to update firmware seek futher advice or leave it alone."
