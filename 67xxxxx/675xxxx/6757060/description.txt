"Guilt"

Victoria's more vulnerable side shows 
through when lingering feelings of 
guilt over her involvement in David 
Clarke's demise and an unforgivable 
rift with her daughter become too much 
to bear; Lydia returns with a vendetta 
against Emily and the Graysons that 
will soon come back to haunt her; Now 
wise to his father's transgressions and 
a duplicitous betrayal by his friend, 
Tyler, Daniel decides to make a major 
life change; and Charlotte and Declan 
find themselves in an unlikely 
predicament together.

18/Slower
Evolve...or die.

Enjoy :)
