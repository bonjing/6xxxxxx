The A-4 Skyhawk, creation of Douglas's chief engineer Ed Heineman, has become a Iiving legend. A GREAT PLANE. It is a unique aircraft in at least two respects. First, its smalI, light, simple and relatively cheap design goes completely against the trend for combat aircraft being evet larger. heavier, more compIex and more expenslve. Second, although it first flew back in 1954, it is still in front line service with some air arms today and there are very feasible plans to have it still serving into the next century. A fifty year lile span is simply not expected of a combat jet, but then the A-4 - Heinemans Hot Rod - has always exceIIed at the unexpected.

Hundreds of A-4s served aboard US Navy carriers and with the Marines. Both used it to great effect throughout the Vietnam conflict. The Navy's crack Blue Angels aerobatic team were, until recently, equipped with this small, immensely manoeuvrable aircraft. Skyhawks have been exported to Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Israel. The latter country has consistently updated its A-4s as more and more combat experience has been gained.

Now at last there is professional aviation video devoted exclusively to this unique aircraft. Superb air to air colour filming is combinod with expert commentary in a complete visual profile of the Skyhawk. GREAT PLANE, GREAT VIDEO.
