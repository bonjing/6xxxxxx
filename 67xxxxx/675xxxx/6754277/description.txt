The team are called in to investigate the death of Ray Quinn, who was killed in what 
looks like a robbery at a classic car garage. The owners, Mick and Martin Flannery, 
are keen to clear the scene so that they can open for business again, but after an 
initial investigation, Eve is convinced that there is more to the case than a robbery 
gone wrong.

Hale visits Ray's home. Ray was from a Travelling community who are very suspicious 
of the police and refuse to tell Hale anything; they say they will deal with Ray's 
death themselves. Eve and Hale later discover that a young girl, Amanda, is also 
missing and possibly in a lot of danger.

Eve must earn the trust of Ray's family by showing them that she is a scientist and 
only motivated by finding justice for Ray. If they pursue their own justice then the 
truth about what happened may remain hidden forever.
