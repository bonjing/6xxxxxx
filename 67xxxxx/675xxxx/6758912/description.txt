LYRICS:

Yes, I can see her
'Cause every girl in here wanna be her
Oh, she's a diva
I feel the same, and I wanna meet her

They say she low down
It's just a rumor, and I don't believe 'em
They say she needs to slow down
The baddest thing around town

She's nothing like a girl you've ever seen before
Nothing you can compare to your neighborhood hoe
I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl
Without being disrespectful

The way that booty movin', I can't take no more
Have to stop what I'm doin' so I can pull up close
I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl
Without being disrespectful

Damn, girl
Damn, you's a sexy bitch, a sexy bitch
Damn, you's a sexy bitch, damn, girl
Damn, you's a sexy bitch, a sexy bitch
Damn, you's a sexy bitch, damn, girl

Yes I can see her
'Cause every girl in here wanna be her
Oh, she's a diva
I feel the same, and I wanna meet her

They say she low down
It's just a rumor and I don't believe 'em
They say she needs to slow down
The baddest thing around town

She's nothing like a girl you've ever seen before
Nothing you can compare to your neighborhood hoe
I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl
Without being disrespectful

The way that booty movin', I can't take no more
Have to stop what I'm doin' so I can pull up close
I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl
Without being disrespectful

Damn, girl
Damn, you's a sexy bitch, a sexy bitch
Damn, you's a sexy bitch, damn, girl
Damn, you's a sexy bitch, a sexy bitch
Damn, you's a sexy bitch, damn girl

Damn, you's a sexy bitch, a sexy bitch
Damn, you's a sexy bitch, damn, girl
Damn, you's a sexy bitch, a sexy bitch
Damn, you's a sexy bitch, damn, you's a sexy bitch

ENJOY!
