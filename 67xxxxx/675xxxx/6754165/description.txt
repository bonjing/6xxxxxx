For as long as you can remember, youâ€™ve had a dream. Youâ€™ve longed to see your product idea come to fruition so you never have to work for anyone else again.
Stephen Key has been living this dream for 30 years. The developer of such lucrative products as Michael Jordanâ€™s WallBallÂ®, the SpinformationÂ® rotating label, and HotPicksÂ® guitar picks, he knows better than anyone how to make a great living as an entrepreneur. Key develops ideas for new products, licenses them out, collects royalty checks, and doesnâ€™t look back. You can do it, too. All you need is One Simple Idea.

In this book, Key reveals the secrets that helped him and thousands of his studentsâ€”including bestselling author Tim Ferrissâ€”turn their creativity into a passive income generator by â€œrentingâ€ an idea to a company, which takes care of R&D;, production, marketing, sales, accounting, distribution, and everything else you donâ€™t want to do.

Youâ€™ll be amazed at how simple the process of licensing an idea for profit actually is. Key explains how to:

â€¢ Keep your ideas safeâ€”without spending time and money on a patent 
â€¢ Be your own bossâ€”without formally opening a business 
â€¢ See your product go to marketâ€”without footing a dime in expenses 
â€¢ Make potentially big moneyâ€”without quitting your day job
The age-old business assumption that ideas must come from within organizations has been shattered. From global corporations to small businesses, companies have become so confident in outside entrepreneurs that licensing is now a $500 billion industry. Businesses need â€œfreelancersâ€ like Keyâ€”and youâ€”to provide creative, marketable ideas for new offerings.

With One Simple Idea, thereâ€™s no prototyping, no patents, and, best of all, no risk. You can make the system work for youâ€”rather than the other way around.

Stephen Key has successfully licensed more than 20 simple ideas that have generated billions of dollars of revenue.
