[V],wushdishmeen,2011-10-19T20:04Z,I'm seeding at 100% so I have no clue what the issue today and yesterday was.   Maybe it's TPB or the tracker fucking it up when it tries to add TPB trackers to the torrent file?
[V],wushdishmeen,2011-10-19T20:12Z,Did you guys try playing the file and seeing if it works anyway? 
[V],wushdishmeen,2011-10-19T20:18Z,"Whatever I have no idea what's wrong...  I'll seed it again then.   Here's the re-upped torrent.
