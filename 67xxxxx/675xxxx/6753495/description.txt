Willliam Clarke is considered to be one of the best blues harmonica players of all time. 

This cd captures his excitement live. If you close your eyes, it's as if you're right there. 4 of the tracks are of William Clarke's very last tour prior to his untimely death in 1996. If you're a fan of blues harmonica, this is a must.
