The first CD issue on GWR (GWR GWCD 31), which was contemporary to the LP and cassette releases, featured the 12 track setlist, with Stay Clean as track 2 and Metropolis as track 4: this was their correct order in the set. The second CD issue on Castle (CLACD 285) appeared with those 2 songs removed.

The remastered CD re-issues on Essential and Sanctuary (each a subsidiary of Castle Records) featured the 12 track setlist, claiming "Stay Clean" and "Metropolis" as bonus tracks (which they are not, given the original GWR release) and moving them to the end of the song selection.

Guitarist WÃ¼rzel is quoted in the insert of the re-mastered CD release, saying; "A lot of fans were saying that they want to hear this line-up on a live album. EVERYBODY seems to record at the Hammersmith Odeon don't they? Or the Fillmore East when that was going, or the Budokan and all those flash places. So we thought we'd do it in Finland".

Lemmy recalls that the album was a mistake and failed sales-wise, he considers it to be 'all right' but thinks it could have been better, explaining:

    we had Guy Bidmead mix it because we wanted to give him another try, mainly because he had been Vic Maile's boy and Vic was a great live mixer. After that, I think we finally figured out that Guy just wasn't Vic Maile. Don't get me wrong, though â€” after all I've said about Guy, it was only 'cause he was taking orders from us. He was too nice! Vic knew when to tell us to shut the fuck up!

To promote the album the band engaged in a tour of North America, opening for Slayer.

EMI Greece pressed a 7" vinyl called "Live in Athens", featuring "Metropolis (Acropolis)", it was shrinkwrapped to the first 1,000 copies of the NÃ¶ Sleep at All album. The songs had been taped for the Greek Antenna Metal Show, for which Lemmy retitled "Metropolis" to suit the occasion.
