Slaves and Masters is the thirteenth studio album by Deep Purple, 
and was released in 1990. This is the band's only album to feature 
singer Joe Lynn Turner, who joined the previous year 
(and was once the lead singer of Ritchie Blackmore's solo band Rainbow).
 
Before hiring Turner, the band had considered singer
Jimi Jamison of Survivor, but other obligations made him unavailable.
Hard rock-based core Purple fans thought the vocal parts ended up being a bit too melodic. 
However, Turner was still a member of the group when 
they began recording their next album in 1992.


 
The album peaked at #87 on the Billboard Charts, 
and a relatively successful 1991 tour followed in particularly Europe.
