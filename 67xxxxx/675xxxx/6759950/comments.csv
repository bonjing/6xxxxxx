Please, you have your beliefs, and we have ours.
I have christian friends and we respect each other, not like you. I hope you reorganize your behavior."

No, bro. It is not cracked. The patch just edits some .INI files to make it run in any path and also with no need to the CD.It isn't like other patches that cancels activation process or something like that."

- Yes, of course I don't have a permission, but it's a great work must be thanked for it.
- The program is published since 2003, and I had it since 2006 as a present with a magazine. So, it has already been distributed."

,Trancemasters,2011-10-27T11:40Z,Religion is the cause of all war!! Men never commit evil so fully and joyfully as when they do it for religious convictions !!!! Youâre basically killing each other to see whoâs got the better imaginary friend.
,ahmadbelaltpb,2011-10-27T14:22Z,"Do you really think this is the cause ?!!!!!
Or this is what you want to believe. I don't want to argue. Please, read well about Islam - the most merciful religion- and don't depend on what you hear or what they say. Search well and you'll find the truth."
,ahmadbelaltpb,2011-11-14T04:31Z,"Who made you all think that Islam is like what you say? OK. Say what you want and believe what you want, but take my advice and search well before that day comes when we all will have nothing except mercy of Allah. We'll meet then."
