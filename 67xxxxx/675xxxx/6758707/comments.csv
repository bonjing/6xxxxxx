,darthvla,2011-10-20T19:51Z,It works perfectly with only a click to install :p This update fix the problem of no sound!!
,ChaosSabre,2011-10-21T00:10Z,"Seems the same with all versions out there.
You can't get past level 3. If you create a char and then get to level 3 it will delete it. Don't know. Might be  just me here."
,NanoEntity,2011-10-21T03:34Z,"DO NOT USE THIS UPDATE!

For some reason dose not save your progress in the game, like the challenges are messed up, same for the single player campaign.

Dungeon Defenders v7.01r5
Works just fine, haven't encountered any problems yet, seems to be saving your characters just fine."
,darthvla,2011-10-21T10:54Z,"Do not listen to these noobs. Im on level 5 with no problems. I also can play multiplayer online. If you are having troubles why dont you try ""open as administrator""?

Im using Win7 x64 ultimate"
,eXoflow,2011-10-24T16:55Z,"lol I have a char at 7 and it works perfectly fine for me.

@NanoEntity go find yourself a new hobby, cuz obviously you aren't good enough on computers."
