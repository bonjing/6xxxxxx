On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show: Mark plays audio from NJ Governor Chris Christie where he basically sounds just like President Obama when it comes to the Occupy Wall Street protestors. Christie is barely a Republican, and definitely not a conservative. Christie, Obama and now the Democrat Party are comparing the Tea Party to the current protestors on Wall Street. Don't be fooled. You have the Tea Partiers who believe in the Constitution, freedom and liberty, and then these other protestors who have radical big government entities to them that call for a socialist system. Also, Mark discusses Israeli freed soldier Gilad Shalit and the ramifications of the prisoner swap deal that happened earlier Tuesday.
