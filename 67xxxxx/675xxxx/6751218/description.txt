Salman Khan, the darling of the masses, unleashes yet another entertainer.Bodyguard is his usual masala entertainer film, but director Siddique seems to have grown beyond Salman's limits. Bodyguard is or should have been, in effect, a simple love story but itâ€™s complicated by a number of things.

Bodyugaurd Movie Storyline

When it comes to being punctual and doing his duties perfectly, Lovely Singh [Salman Khan] is unmatchable. Taking great pride in what he does, he spares no effort in giving his everything to his profession.Lovely is summoned for an assignment of guarding Divya [Kareena Kapoor], the daughter of Sartaj Rana [Raj Babbar], a business tycoon. Lovely accompanies her to her campus, but ends up rubbing her the wrong way with his over-protective nature. She finds him to be a majorobstacle in leading a regular campus life. To throw him off-track and get him out of the way, she comes up with a 'master plan' -- that of trapping him in a fake love affair. 'Once he's smitten by the girl of his dreams and is reveling in his new-found romance, he will leave us alone and we shall be free to do our own thing
unhindered', says Divya to her friends.She becomes an anonymous admirer of his and starts hounding him, expressing her 'feelings' in
no uncertain terms. Lovely, however, proves to be a tough nut to crack and it takes quite a bit of doing from her side to penetrate his fort-like exterior. But once she succeeds in doing so, he transforms into a completely different person. Divya is triumphant and is all set to relish her regained freedom. But things take an unexpected turn when she learns a few things about Lovely. Things that she could've never even imagined. And she soon finds herself trapped in a dilemma that she's unable to resolve. And with her, soon enough, Lovely finds himself trapped in a web of lies, trickery and deceit.
