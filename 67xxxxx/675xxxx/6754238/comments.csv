,tribal86,2011-10-19T00:15Z,what's fixed??? last version worked too....
[T],Games4theworld,2011-10-19T00:20Z,"Hello,

@tribal86

It does, but since some files where missing, you'll get an ""Please insert Disk 1..."" error while installing. Though, this error can be easily fixed using this Fix: http://games4theworld.bestgoo.com/t2242-sims-3-pets-insert-disk-1-solution-till-admin-finds-one-d-recent-important

This ""Fixed"" version has these missing files and therefore will not give the ""Please insert Disk 1..."" error at all. Have fun!"
,Grappler_Master,2011-10-19T00:30Z,"I wanna know what was fixed too. 

which torrent should I download?"
,Grappler_Master,2011-10-19T00:31Z,"Oh! nvm.

thanks guys!"
,tribal86,2011-10-19T01:15Z,"oh... just that... :)

No need to mount anything, just open the .rar file using WinRAR and then read the included ""# Installation Guide.txt"" on how to install the game. Good luck!

,ChloeJones,2011-10-19T17:28Z,"@Manoeen14 and everyone having illegal issues.

You need to crack the game!! :] You aren't following the instructions to a T. You need to take what is inside of the CRACK folder and place it into your original sims 3 game/bin folder. That means you do NOT place it into the sims 3 pets game/bin folder.

Where ever you installed sims 3, the main game, you place this crack."

@wward2 & @hiimspack & @TheGameTorrent 
Please post your problem on our Forum, so we can guide you.

@SpaceJet
Better nice than evil, I guess.

@Robben87
Please use this manual patch: http://games4theworld.bestgoo.com/t1870-can-t-update-the-sims-3-to-v126-fix-updated

@Pancho556
Yes, it's the original Multilanguage download.

@spotlight-shure
No, I'm afraid not. This is the PC version.

@AnyaAmarie
This is a bug from EA's side and they need to patch it. EA knowing, this is going to take a while, I'm afraid.

@NamelessAquired
The original version was missing 2 folders, this one isn't.

@annalil08
That's what she said.

@CherryB
This might be a EA bug. I recommend waiting for a patch or try re-installation.

@nickgf
A pleasure! 

@majuska89
You copied the crack to the wrong folder. Do not copy it to Sims 3 Pets\Game\Bin, but to Sims 3\Game\Bin !

If you have any Mods and/or Custom Content or anything else downloaded and added to the game, REMOVE THEM ALL and try again.
Also try this: http://games4theworld.bestgoo.com/t857-the-sims-3-crashes-freezes-to-desktop-fix-update-8-06-2011

@DasSandmannKewXD
Please read this: http://games4theworld.bestgoo.com/t2362-sims-3-pets-crack-please-insert-disk

@Corwii
Where did you download the base game from? Was is some kind of ""Complete pack"" torrent/download?

@PaulMieux
There's no need to Mount or burn anything, just follow these instructions:

Open the .rar file you downloaded using only WinRar, which can be downloaded from www.games4theworld.org . (If you use any other software than WinRar, like WinZip or 7-zip, the files will get messed up!)
When you've opened the file using WinRar, select Ã¡ll the files in it and drag & drop them to a folder on your Desktop. When the extraction is done, close the .rar file and open the folder on your Desktop. 
Now, start by reading the included ""# Installation Guide.txt"" and you should be able to get the game to work yourself. Good luck!

,tsukami,2012-04-10T05:07Z,will this work for my bought version of the game that is patched to patch 1.33.2?
,tsukami,2012-04-12T01:53Z,"installed the expansion but having some problems.  My base game was purchased online and downloaded from the download manager.  So for some reason the only things in my game/bin file is TS3.exe and the launcher.  So the crack for pets is a TS3W.exe and doesn't replace anything.  haven't tried if it works w/o it overriding anything, bbut how come i have nothing in my program files for sims 3 but can play it fine?"
,LooneyTunesXtreme,2012-05-11T10:37Z,"so I have all expansions and stuff packs... almost. Except for the sims 3 pets. Well, downloading it right now and hoping it will work because just one more expansion and it's over. Also I have all store updates and I have the latest version of the base game: 1.33.2 something like that... "
,LooneyTunesXtreme,2012-05-13T03:20Z,finished downloading... hope it works.
