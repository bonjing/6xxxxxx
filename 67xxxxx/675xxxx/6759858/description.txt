How Does It Work?

Cookies Bomber works by allowing you to add your affiliate 
link to a Wordpress post or page within the Wordpress admin 
panel. When that post is viewed, your affiliate link is quietly 
and invisibly called in the background.

The visitor has no idea that this is happening - all they see 
is a plain text link that you add to your post. After all, 
there's no need to make your affiliate link publicly visible 
within the post any more, as the visitor to your blog has 
already been cookied.

As far as they're concerned, you've written a product review 
with no intent of financial gain, and they're ready to go through 
to the site and buy.

Cookies Bomber is very easy to use. Just upload and 
activate the plugin, then go to the Cookies Bomber settings page.

Once you're there you can add your affiliate links to as 
many posts or pages as you like.
