,nettanswe,2011-11-04T06:36Z,"Thanks, TPB is good, interesting to see things from other countries, experience culture differences - I canÂ´t understand this coupon thing, we donÂ´t have it in Sweden, whatÂ´s the point with it? Seems the shops lose money? In Sweden were I live things are on sale in the shops but no way can you buy a lot of stuff and only pay a few % of its worth. Also seems strange to buy so much as if preparing for a war, we never buy more things than we need. Takes up a lot of space too. This system is difficult for me to understand. Why??? WhatÂ´s the purpose?"

@netanswe
The answers you're seeking would take too long to type here. I would suggest doing a google on couponing and read up on it."
