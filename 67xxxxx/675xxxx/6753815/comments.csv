[T],Tyr3ll,2011-10-18T22:59Z,"argh :s
I think we need a fix then :/
Did you try to run the patch as administrator,bro ?
Well of course,on x64 edition it installs 64 edition also.
That's probably why the patch does not match or work anymore so.
really sorry dude,if i find something better i will up the fix asap

,Ripley2453,2011-10-20T21:24Z,"It installs etc, but when I try to import video it says ""H.264 codec has expired

Connect to the internet and activate""

It then says... ""Can't activate, either you're not connected to the internet or your serial is incorrect or has surpassed it's activations (Number of times it can be used)"""
,rocketman07,2011-10-21T22:02Z,"Some experience as Ripley2453, makes it useless for HD video. Bummer!"
,edzmusic,2011-10-21T22:21Z,"Hi Tyr3ll!

First of all, thanks for finding this crack! :)

A couple of thing I'd like to point out is that: 

1. This current crack only allows you to import in .MPG files (so far i've tested)

2. When you try to import in .MP4 or MPEG2 generation videos, it explains that the codec is expired and you will need to update it.

3. I checked out the the program folder, it only has a MPG(.ax) codec file.

so...

Is there a way to manually install the MPEG2 and .H264 codecs into the program folder directly instead of trying to rely on the internet update? (which is for paid users)

A alternative I thought of for the rest of you guys is to get a video converter and convert your raw sources into .MPG file to use the program while waiting for a cure by Dr. Tyr,

Hope to hear from you!

Edz"
,edzmusic,2011-10-21T22:37Z,"Update (part 1)

- I discovered that you also could import .AVI and .WMV and .MOV video files! 

so seriously guys, give Tyr his well-deserved thanks for this seriously awesome piece of software! 

A million thanks Tyr! :)) "
