"Pilot"

Will is more interested in finding the 
perfect gift for his son Nathan's 
(Jake Johnson) 13th birthday than in 
doing his job selling insurance. His 
best friend, sensitive soul Craig 
(Christopher Moynihan), still pines 
for his college ex, Lisa. Will's 
brother-in-law, Kenny (Dan Fogler), 
clamps down on his anger and asks 
himself, "What would Tobey Maguire 
do?," when his ex-wife, Brenda 
(Amanda Detmer), starts seeing a guy 
who is everything he's not and much 
better looking (Henry Simmons). After 
Craig crashes Lisa's wedding to try 
to win her back, they are all faced 
with an opportunity to "man up" and 
be like their forefathers.
