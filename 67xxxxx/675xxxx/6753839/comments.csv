[V],Vlinder.,2011-10-18T20:40Z,Thanks again Blacksam !!!!

,soupcip,2011-10-18T21:01Z,"Rukkie, so what you are saying is that you have to be a politician yourself before you can say Berlusconi is a crook, or you have to be a military person before you can condemn Adolf Hitler ? You are very intelligent it seems. Fact is, it is not HD, so we are being misguided. "

....... Source.............: Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2 2011 DVDRiP H264-MP3-sD

Format.............: DVDR ......."
,soupcip,2011-10-19T19:19Z,"TF, I disagree cos I've seen many hd conversions smaller or about 5 gigs, but my point was it cannot be HD if it is from a dvd rip. I think it's just a bit infantile to advert torrents as HD if they clearly can't be cos the source is not. There is so much confusion amongst people concerning video formats, and this kind of self indulgent advertising doesn't help."
,the_plop,2011-10-20T20:20Z,"I can not find English subs, and it looks like the dutch subs are hard coded"
[V],Mad_Parrot,2011-10-20T23:45Z,"BlackSam Bedankt voor deze geweldige post
Ondanks alle gezeur en gezever ben ik heel blij met je .

Dat gezeur en gezever is volgens mij ook allemaal onterecht , en als mensen het beter weten dan moeten ze het beter doen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Dan zien we vanzelf nieuwe namen van nieuwe TOPPERS verschijnen op The Pirate Bay.

Maar voor nu nogmaals 
BEDANKT BlackSam !!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,farahad,2011-10-20T23:51Z,"can i get a second opinion on if the subs are hard?
thanks"
,scorpNZ,2011-10-21T08:42Z,"Quality of video is worse than the 1.42gb avi i just downloaded of the same movie,ffs it doesn't even have a reasonably sharp picture,audio is ok & there are only hard coded freaky deaky dutch subs,there's no way this was ripped from a dvd more like a conversion from a avi container,don't waste your bandwidth on this torrent you'll be sorely disappointed..."
,_Yayo_,2011-10-21T21:28Z,"Freaking idiots! It says NL subs, meaning there are NONenglish subs.. bitching about the subs while the title says so just makes you an idiot."
,pazcom,2011-10-22T11:27Z,I think the dutch subs are hard coded as per previous posters comments - thanks for the upload though
,dafxf105,2011-10-22T12:40Z,Bedankt voor deze mooie up.
,the_plop,2011-10-22T18:12Z,"@_Yayo_ 
The information say
""Texted language(s):English, Dutch"" So the only person bitching about the subs are you. And it just makes you an idiot.

,burpalot,2011-10-24T16:25Z,Release date for the blu-ray is December 2. As is for the DVD. The torrent is a cam version and totally crap.
,McGhee001,2011-10-26T20:05Z,Which fuck came up with the bright idea to use this shit font? Was that supposed to be a good idea? :S
