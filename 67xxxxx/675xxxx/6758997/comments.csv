,cosmix84,2012-02-27T04:10Z,"Dear 'uploader'

Thank you so much for the upload. I've been trying to get the 'subtitles' to play along with the movie, but I just can't seem to activate it. could you pls lend me  a hand? I use the Mac Blu-Ray player. I do see the option for 'SUBTITLES'. it asks me to open the subtitles file, but after the file attached in the 'Vinnaithaandi varuvaaya' folder (that came along with the download) It just doenst appear on the screen when the movie plays. 

Anticipating your reply. Thanks"
