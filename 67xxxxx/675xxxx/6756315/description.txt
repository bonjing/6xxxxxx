I believe it has a really good story. And every scene is fun to watch... But then you go fridge-digging lol to see what kind of delicious food You YOURSELF could eat...
I recommend this movie to people who love laughing, love to see a good story development.
Really amazing anime (this is my Second Favorite to Kaichou wa Maid-sama)

Yours Sincerely,
