,pixart9,2011-10-20T13:43Z,"hey thanks man...it's very rare that the textbook I download is directly prescribed by the faculty at college. This is one of those rare occasions. 

Is this the same book as in other torrent that you've provided (that of Morris Mano)? If same, is there a significant difference in quality, given the size difference? (Just don't wish to download 177mb of the same book without much quality difference. 

Thanks"

Yes, the two books are different. But, the difference is elusive!"
