,ppahv,2011-10-20T18:43Z,What did you use to rip the CD ?
,theallian,2011-10-21T13:24Z,Does this sound a little quiet?
[V],vAin4us,2011-10-21T16:28Z,"@ppahv
I haven't ripped this myself, it's a scene release.

@theallian
Not for me."
,PepsiGuy,2011-10-21T22:52Z,"Why does this have a tag
ENCODER LAME 3.98

That would be MP3 and this is a FLAC file.
Not from lossy source, is it?"
,saturnman,2011-10-24T16:13Z,It is fine but lacks the punch of a flac
[V],vAin4us,2011-10-24T21:58Z,"@PepsiGuy

Nope."

Gtfo, you're uploading someone else's torrents

@uRabbit
Really? ALAC is not easier to use with iTunes than this...

@oussaaaa
I think something is wrong with how the file has been encoded. The spectrals come out just fine:
