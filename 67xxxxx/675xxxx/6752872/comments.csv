it is not a virus even though my f-secure is 2011 says so.
Help: 1: put off ANTIVIRUS.2: INSTALL.3: copy the patch in the installation folder."
,sholum,2011-10-21T06:15Z,"'Unable to save license data'
I know this is the fault of win7 but I don't know where that file is trying to save to so I can't do anything. 
Anyway, thank you for the torrent."
,sholum,2011-10-21T22:00Z,"I was right, windows was hiding things on its own again. Everything worked, the file showed as a virus, but I agree that if there was a virus on a torrent this new then it wouldn't show up. "

,briggs88,2011-11-06T12:50Z,I installed It And Done Everything but when i want to apply the patch it says that DT is Still Running!I Dont Know What To Do and im sure  closed everything!
,UchihaFag,2011-11-11T22:26Z,PAtch failed..... need some help here
,Greene88,2011-11-12T07:11Z,"Every time I see comment stating that the ""CRACK"" file is a virus I want to scream!!! your stupid anti-virus software is confusing itself and you so ignore it. At the same time, it detects that something IS NOT right based on what it is programmed to identify. The crack files and registration code, serial# and activation code generators ARE not harmful viruses unless the creator made it that way but that isn't the case roughly 100% of the time, especially if your source(s) can be trusted. Disable that shit as well as your internet connection when using such resources to install any, I repeat, ANY ""plunder"". ;-)"
,michigan.metal,2011-11-13T05:27Z,"Applying the patch just requires a little quickness. 

End Running Daemon Tools Processes: 

1. The easy part is ending the Daemon Tools Agent Process (DTAgent.exe).

Also: You may find that your system has a hold on the DT Gadget and : To fix this, you should download the program called ""Unlocker"" and right click that to ""unlock"" the process associated with the gadget (which is the thing on your sidebar that has all your virtual drives displayed

2. But then, what is tricky is ending the process that is running the daemon tools shell extension (DTShellHlp.exe), which should be the only process running when daemon tools is closed. The reason you cannot apply the patch is due to the fact that this process is automatically restarted (probably due to that fact that it is part of the shell menu). To get around this, you need to follow all the instructions, but when you get to actually applying the crack, you need to do this in order for it to work:


Open task manager, find DTShellHlp.exe and press END PROCESS but do NOT CONFIRM ending the process.

Then, open up the crack, and drag the confirmation box from task manager so where the confirmation button to end the process (end process"") is right over there the patch button for the crack is. You only have fractions of a second to hit the patch button after hitting the end process confirmation before the DTShellHlp.exe restarts. Failure to do so will result in a failure for the patch to be applied.

Done!

Also, after doing this, if you find that your Daemon tools Gadget (the sidebar thing with the virtual tools) will not start, just go to your install folder and double click on DT.gadget and okay the confirmation messages.

Of course, you could always just find a program that will temporarily disable the shell extension ;) lol. I'm betting that would solve the problem easier. But I have not tried that, so I do not know for a fact if that works, though in theory it should stop the shell extension process from restarting.

I admit was a little stubborn in just going ahead and doing it the cheaters way, but it ended up working! If you encounter continued problems, I suggest doing a clean install after each failure; Uninstalling DT Pro and deleting all the files inside the program files folders (and if you have other Daemon Tools folders, you might as well do that too provided you've uninstalled them too."
,EvilRiIlla,2011-11-19T07:42Z,"well i messed up. i manged to close the .exe down and then did the patch. it worked, then i kept getting a popup saying the program wouldnt work wihtout the .exe running. so i uninstalled  daemon tools, im trying to reinstall it and patch it again the right way, but it says my trial has ended and i cant re install it ....arggg"

,lrae2k,2011-12-07T20:36Z,"Im a newbie at this so I realize that people say sometimes the security software sees these downloads as a virus but they are truly not, but can someone explain why it shows up as a Trojan virus once downloaded i'm just trying to understand that's all [please nice comments or keep the info to yourself]."
,sgt.ghost,2011-12-12T01:41Z,"@lrae2k 

Cracks and Keymakers/Keygens come up as viruses on AV software because microsoft and other corporations have them or their ""behavior"" added to AV databases because they do not want people using them. A ""virus"" is simply something, such as a script program etc., that does something malicious and/or unwanted. Microsoft and other corporations consider it unwanted behavior obviously so naturally they will try and stop their use. BUT, just because it comes up as a virus does not mean it is, majority of the time, especially if they have the skull and crossbones, it will not be a virus, it will come up as a virus because of the given example above. I above this helps you. "
,SpaceCadet6969754,2011-12-14T02:31Z,"The Patch kept saying ""Patching Failed"".
But guess what? If you open the program, it says ""Paid License"".
So this must just be an error with the patcher.
Works fine."
,Suomisisu,2011-12-16T22:02Z,Fuck this virused up shit I'm just going to get Lite for fucking fre...
,shepperd,2011-12-19T05:42Z,"Let me set the Record straight to all you dumb mother fuckers who dont know how torrents work and to all you stupid fucks who think everything has a virus. EVERYTHING FROM HERE TO THE END WILL BE CAPITALIZED FOR PEOPLE WITH THE IQ OF 95 OR LESS. THIS TORRENT HAS 402 SEEDERS AT THIS MOMENT. THIS MEANS ITS IN THE TOP 5 FOR SEARCHING ""DAEMON"" SO IF 402 PEOPLE ARE STILL SEEDING HOW WOULD IT BE A VIRUS? IM SURE IF THEY DOWNLOADED IT AND GIVING IT FREELY ITS PROBABLY A NORMAL PROGRAM, YOUR JUST TOO STUPID TO KNOW HOW TO USE IT. NUMBER 2, ANYTHING THAT HAS THE WORD ""CRACK"" ""KEYGEN"" OR IN RARE CASES ""PATCH FILE"" THE VIRUS PROGRAM YOU ARE USING IS GOING TO PICK IT UP AS A THREAT BECAUSE ITS AN .EXE FILE AND THATS A BIG WORD IN VIRUS SIGNATURES. IT WILL NOT TRUST IT IF IT HAS THOSE TO THINGS AGAINST IT. SO DO NOT PREACH WHAT YOUR AV PROGRAM POPS UP WITH. YOU ALL NEED TO TRUST THIS SHIT ESPECIALLY IF YOU WANT DAEMON AND ITS GOT TRIPLE DIGIT SEEDERS SO TAKE MY ADVICE OR GET THE FUCK OFF PIRATEBAY, NO ONE LIKES NOOBS."

,NeonColors123,2011-12-27T04:43Z,"@michigan.metal

Thanks for your help it now works for me :)

To all people having trouble on the last part 

Press CTRL+ALT+DEL 

then press Task Manager 

Then go to the process tab then find ""DTShellHlp.exe""

Click on it and press end Process 

when it tells you to confirm the ending process don't touch ANYTHING yet

Now open that patch that was in the file you downloaded 

now click on patch and go find the DAEMON tools main directory (C:\Program Files\DAEMON TOOLS pro advance or C:\Program Files (x86)\DAEMON TOOLS

Click on the the .dll extension (just one click)

Now this is the tricky part go back to the task manger confirm window 

and quickly press comfirm

then press okay on the patcher 

then it will apply the patch sucessfully "

,billa18,2012-01-11T13:26Z,thx ! make sure program is not running when u applying patch
,Shaner09,2012-01-20T15:27Z,"This torrent is a repack!  It contains a file called ind.dll WHICH IS A TROJAN.  The patch is clean though.  I do not have an inferior anti-virus program.  You can take your chances or you can download the same patch and program from this torrent:

DAEMON.Tools.Pro.Advanced.4.41.0315.0262.Incl.Patch-SND by Anacondaz 

Which does not contains the ind.dll trojan file.  All of the instructions that are written here for this torrent are exactly what you should do for the torrent I just recommended.  It's too bad people have such compulsion to send out viruses."
,hateSOPAPIPA,2012-01-20T21:42Z,So I downloaded this torrent and now when I mount something and play it it says insert correct DVD or CD
,Arachne,2012-01-21T01:57Z,"Although I may have monkeyed around with this, I got the patch to work by installing the software twice.  In the first case, I renamed the the destination folder.  In the second case, I was able to apply the patch.  For whatever reason, it worked.  Now, what do I do with the first install?  I am unable to delete approximately 5 items contained within.  Since I cannot remove all, all are contained within.  I have left the destination folder with the addendum DO NOT USE.  I hope this will not leave me open to problems. Should anyone think that it will, please advise and do advise as to how I can remove the problem folder.   Thanks.  Seeding.   "
,Arachne,2012-01-21T02:10Z,"The file that I had allocated as a don't use file was able to be deleted.  The good file was copied over into an external hard drive.  Upon the removal of the bad folder, I simply inserted the good.  All is working well.  Maybe it could have been done an easier way, but at least I got it done.  I hope this helps someone else."

,sammyboblammy,2012-01-25T00:02Z,Worked perfect!  Thanks for all the hard work from the coders and reverse engineers on this project.  To everyone having problems make sure that no DT shell host is running in BG use task manager and shut that mofo down then run patch.  No problem.

,Celtic_Dragons,2012-04-02T06:12Z,"The ""virus/Trojan"" is a false positive. Just follow the instructions and it will install correctly. Only speedbump I had was ""killing"" all of the processes so the patch would work. All I had to do was restart after install and then kill any DT processes. Patch worked on first try then."
