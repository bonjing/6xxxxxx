Daemon Tools Pro Advanced 4.41.0315.0262

RELEASE INFORMATION

Releaser ............... Team SnD   Rls type .................. patch
Program name ............... Daemon Tools Pro Advanced 4.41.0315.0262
URL ............................................. www.daemon-tools.cc
Date ................. 2011 08 23   OS ....................... WinAll

RELEASE NOTES

DAEMON Tools Pro Advanced enables you to evaluate full Advanced
software functionality. Use variety of tools to work with image files,
emulate up to 32 virtual SCSI drives and 2 virtual IDE devices and much
more with advanced product possibilities. You can also burn disc images
to all types of media: CD/DVD/HD DVD or Blu-ray. All you need working
with images is in one application.

INSTALL NOTES

Step 1: Start the install using the provided installer
Step 2: Select trial installation
Step 3: Copy the patch to the installation directory
Step 4: Apply the patch (make sure no DT programs are running)
Step 5: Run the application.

Enjoy!

Information for the repackers/p2pers.

The ind.dll must be in the same folder as the installer since it
handles the emulation of the deamon tools servers for the installer.
If you remove it you WILL connect to deamon tools and retrieve a non
cracked license. This will require you to select the cracked license
upon starting DTPro.exe. (Just select a trial license and it will
work.)

Also if your inferior antivirus program detects a virus please note
that if this contained a virus it would not detect it.

PS: The emulator now spans over a 1000 lines of assembly code..
Oh and hey what's that INT 2Eh.. ;)

And and thnx for SAC for the chiptune which I so blatantly have used.

NEWS

It is hard to think that just over eight years ago Seek n Destroy had
no place in the scene, a silent unknown entity yet to be born. Today,
five years on and with over 11,500 releases to look back  on  Seek  n
Destroy are a well and truly established  team  that  have  surpassed
what many had thought would be just another  minor  team  that  would
disappear as quickly as it came. The majority of the original members
who helped to form and create Seek n Destroy have either  retired  or
moved on to other projects. What has made  Seek  n  Destroy  such  an
enjoyable team to be a part of - at any time - is that many  new  and
interesting members have come forward sharing  the  same  dreams  and
desires as those original members to help keep pushing forward Seek n
Destroy to new heights that it enjoys today. Seek n  Destroy  is  not
just a crack team it is a family and being a family  I  think  it  is
fair to say we look at each other with pride. We take  pride  knowing
that being a little bit different has made us that little bit better.

As a member once said, "Not many teams do it to learn and at the same
time try and help others. Forgive the self-righteous attitude, but  I
think its fair to say that we rock most royally".

Live the dream... Seek n Destroy... eight years bolder...

If you are interested in becoming part of SnD and have knowledge  and
coding skills for developing crack intros and/or demos we would  love
to hear from you. Positions are open for all talented people in  this
field.

We continue to look for quality crackers, keygenners  &  unpackers  -
coders who can write quality tools  and  utilities  -  demo  &  intro
coders  -  tutorial  authors  who  can  write  interesting  and  well
structured tutorials - mod/chiptune authors (.mod, .xm, etc. ) If you
think you can be part of a friendly team and help to contribute in to
a community then feel free to find us...

GREETINGS

Over the years we have come to know and  love  many  individuals  and
many teams. Some teams still stand today and some have  unfortunately
fallen to bad times. We would like to take this opportunity to  thank
and give a greeting to:  ArTeam,  CoolPHat,  CracksLatinoS,  Fixdown,
ICU, MP2k, PEDiY, Resurrection, REVENGE  Crew,  TSRh,  Unpack  China,
VDown, and all at China  Serials2K  and  the  AstaLaVista  guys. Not
forgetting, or course, the biggest greeting of all to YOU! :)

As well as webscene we also greet some 0day teams, like CORE and AiR.
