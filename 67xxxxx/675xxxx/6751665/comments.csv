it is also very low quality (looks terrible at normal dimensions ...tons of ""boxes"" visible will look really horrible on standalones)...hopefully someone else managed to capture this and make a better rip.

or perhaps catflap, you would be able to upload the source capture in VOB format? (if possible) please and thanks! 

would be greatly appreciated :)"
[V],catflap,2011-10-18T20:18Z,"there's absolutely nothing wrong with this file.

i gave a clear and precise explanation of how to play it.

i tried it on several computers, dvd players and
the media player in my 55-inch 3D HD tv. i also
streamed it wirelessly from my laptop to the tv.

it is perfect and looks perfect. no one has complained on any of the websites i posted it to.
a few hundred people have already downloaded it
in less than 24 hours.

it's not an action film or filled with ND CGI special
FX. it's an opera and it doesn't need to be larger.

there are no pixelations or ""blocks"". your problem is probably your graphic card. :)

just change the aspect ratio. DON'T use windows
media player. use vlc or gom."
[V],catflap,2011-10-18T20:34Z,"i should say that ""IF"" there are any pixelations
or ""blocks"" (i didn't see any) then it happened
during the broadcast transmission and not
as a result of my encoding and therefore can't
be corrected.

it was not broadcast on an HD channel.

i wasn't planning to encode or share this when
i recorded it, but i changed my mind. i could have
encoded it so it plays WS in windows media player
but then it would have had that annoying white
line on the top of the screen and no doubt
someone would complain about that.

so just use a better player or tablet or phone or
whatever you use and change the aspect ratio."
[T],metalcore.,2011-10-23T02:41Z,"whatever you say bro... 700mb for a file over 2 hours long? at wrong aspect ratio (i wouldnt have to change it if it were ripped properly in the first place)? very far from perfect. yes it is a really great upload, would be greater if you took the time to re-rip it proper, or if you could provide the source file, that would be even better...and i will do it myself. thanks"
[V],catflap,2011-10-23T22:44Z,"don't call me bro.

so, whatever to you, lady.

still, your'e the only one who has complained
on any of the numerous websites i posted it to
because they know enough not to complain
about something that's free, and are able to adapt
to something that's not exactly perfect.

if you have nothing nice to say, please go away
and don't come back.

so, whatever to you, lady. whatever."
[V],catflap,2011-10-23T22:47Z,"and by the way, sis...that's the end of the discussion."
,SpaceOctopus,2011-11-26T05:46Z,"*correction* I think what all of these complainers meant to say was, ""Thank you for taking your time to give us something for free, using your energy & time to put it together & uploading it, because we're either too lazy or stupid to do it ourselves, but we complain anyways. Thank you very much for doing it, regardless of how you did it & wanted to do it. It's not your fault we don't know how to read things or how to play files that are different from what we are used to."""
