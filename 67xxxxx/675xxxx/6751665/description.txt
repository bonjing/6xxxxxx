Filmmaker and former Python Terry Gilliam's smash-hit production
of Berlioz's Damnation of Faust for English National Opera has
been one of the operatic highlights of 2011.

Peter Hoare stars as Faust, with Christopher Purves as Mephistopheles,
who propels him on a rollercoaster ride through German history, ending
with the rise of Hitler and Faust's inevitable damnation.

Edward Gardner conducts the ENO Chorus and Orchestra.

HARD CODED ENGLISH SUBS...
BECAUSE OPERA IS BLOODY HARD TO UNDERSTAND
EVEN IN ENGLISH. AND ALSO BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY
DEAF AND HEARING-IMPAIRED PEOPLE WHO MISS OUT
ON A LOT OF TV SHOWS THAT DON'T HAVE SUBTITLE FILES.

THERE IS NO SUBTITLE FILE. THESE SUBS WERE RECORDED
DURING THE BROADCAST AND I DECIDED TO HAVE THEM SHOW
IN THIS FILE. THEY CANNOT BE REMOVED. IT WAS EITHER ENCODE
THE RECORDING WITH THE SUBS SHOWING OR HAVE NO SUBS AT ALL.

SEE INCLUDED SCREENSHOTS FOR EXAMPLE.

this is my own digital cable tv recording and encode.
