,NanoEntity,2011-10-22T02:58Z,Good release works great with the Updates.
,huldu,2011-10-22T09:37Z,You really need to get this release and *not* skidrow if you plan on using any of the updates. Update 7.03 will cause the skidrow release to crash on startup. 
,CaRbOnZz,2011-10-23T17:41Z,It works great. At first i couldnÂ´t save my files either and my characters would get deleted but if u run the game as a administrator it all starts to work really well. Ty for the realese and everyone make sure to update the game to its latest patch so u get the best experience possible.
,datamars,2011-10-23T19:02Z,"Do i have to download all the updates, or just the latest one?"
,NanoEntity,2011-10-24T09:49Z,"All the updates if you want to play LAN.

There is an error if you dont for some reason."

,Government10,2011-10-25T05:12Z,"I'll say this,  i normally always download EZ's torrents.  And when i downloaded his version of this game it didnt work on my machine at all.  I messed around with it for over 3 hours.  

Download's Alex's (this) version, with all the updates,  and started up right away without any problems so far.  i'm quite pleased.

Great thing is,  Vista automatically blocked the games connection to the web,  just the cherry on top.

,djxx2,2011-10-25T19:55Z,Has anybody gotten the dlc to work? Everything else works fine and can even multiplayer with update 4 installed.
,djxx2,2011-10-25T20:18Z,Thanks for the upload.  Works great.  Has anybody gotten the dlc pack to work?  That's the only issue I have had.
,xXZalissXx,2011-10-26T07:00Z,"Amazing job, everything works well. Except for I can't play ranked online. But I can play open online.  Any help?"
,TurtleXXX,2011-10-26T22:39Z,"xXZalissXx - Isn't allowed on LAN Games, besides your using a cracked file, do you really want to show that to the owners of the game on their official server? ;3"
,corxbeans,2011-10-29T20:49Z,"It seems when i was playing in ""gamespy"" and closed the game and switched to steam and ran the game my characters were gone........ I just played for like 3hrs with my brother and we lost our chars FML!!!"
,RadleyGH,2011-10-29T23:02Z,"Can't get co-op to work with my friend. We both installed this with each of the four updates in sequence. Tried using gamespy, which let us log in and see others games. We tried both a private game having the client connect via typing in username, no luck. We also tried simply hosting a custom game, neither of us can see the other.

We also tried using hamachi, which let us both ping each other and didn't complain about relays or anything, but we still couldn't see each other under Lan. We double checked ports and disabled our firewalls. It also shows the same version number for each of us (7.04).

Anyone have any ideas? The game does work fine, but we can't play together. qq"
,dubstep86,2011-10-30T08:18Z,I had nothing but problems with skidrows release of this game I am downloading this one and the 7.04 patch now if it works i will be going with THETA releases from now on. will let everyone know how it worked when im done
,Atomsk1,2011-10-30T18:03Z,Is there any way to download and play the new Halloween DLC with this release?
,em0r0ckem009,2011-11-02T03:29Z,Is there by chance you'll be able to put this game in steam??? just wondering cause I desperately wan't to play this game online.
,ardeen,2011-11-03T15:29Z,when will the next updates be released?
,pannekoek28,2012-01-09T20:04Z,"hey i downloaded this torrent and the 7.12 version, but when i open the dungeondefender.exe (the 1.8gb one), my computer stops responding and nothing happens. my virus scanner (norton) says it is a virus, so i added it to the exceptions, and redownload it (cuz he had deleted it), then i tried it again but still nothing happened. how do i get this to work?

thnx in advance :)"
