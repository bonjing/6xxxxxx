,extrach,2011-10-18T13:42Z,"sorry but not working on my 
PSP 3004 6.60Pro-B9"
,Vakura,2011-10-18T14:34Z,"im sorry to hear that it doesnt work on your psp extrach and kornmudvayne why are you even installing, data install doesnt do anything it would speed up the loading screens if you had the real game in a cd but you dont its in the memory stick so you dont really need it"
,fahronk,2011-10-18T15:42Z,"ty Vakura the info...
but need more seed or peer :)"
,Rage24,2011-10-18T17:52Z,"This doesn't work for me. When i select the game, it starts (showing the psp logo, and playing the music) and then the screen goes black- It's still lit up, but just black. I then have to select home and quit. Any solutions?"
,Vakura,2011-10-18T19:02Z,thats very odd what CFW do you have? rage24
,Rage24,2011-10-18T20:55Z,I have CFW 6.39 Pro-B8....it's not a compatability issue is it? I really wanted to play this game...
,Vakura,2011-10-18T21:41Z,"hmm... i should of said that i tested on 5.00 M33-6 to 6.20 TN's, never tested on anything above than that it might not work on that CFW, same happened to extrach sorry man."
,Rage24,2011-10-18T22:09Z,isn't there anyway you could make it work with Pro-B? alot of people use pro-b.
,Vakura,2011-10-19T00:41Z,you dont have any plugins etc on cuz that might be interfering with the game. change umd modes i guess if that doesnt work your in bad luck sorry dude
,aivesful,2011-10-19T10:38Z,thanks guys . it worked for me :))
,killua-uchiha,2011-10-20T10:21Z,"Works perfectly on M33-6    Thanks Vakura

Looking forward to it"
,Vakura,2011-10-20T12:43Z,"i usually include psp in the title just that i tottaly forgot and when i remenbered it already had some amount of ppl seeding so i just left it like that, ill include on my next uploads."

,Vakura,2011-10-24T22:42Z,"its in iso what are you talking about oliz, ppl who get the psp logo or black screen and music, change umd iso mode to sonynp if it doesnt work try m33-drive, oliz if the above fails then change to prom-3"
,Lashrom,2011-11-03T02:10Z,"For the ones that has troubles with Black screen or freezes. Use CFW 6.39 Pro. It works like a charm.

I had 6.60 Pro B10. It didn't work at the loading screen. I downgraded to 6.39 Pro B10 and now it works. Thanks Vakura! "

,Vakura,2011-11-10T23:39Z,just take the iso and place it in your memory stick iso folder you need to have a custom firmware (cracked PSP) so if dont have a custom firmware go to pspslimhacks and choose a version
,Vakura,2011-11-11T05:47Z,"srry for double post but i didnt see that you wanted step by step well first make sure you crack your psp go to the site provided in the comment above for that then folow these steps carefully
1: download the iso
2: connect your psp with cable into your pc and select USB mode on your psp
3: once connected open the folder for your psp root and make sure you have a folder named iso if you dont just create one
4: copy your iso into the iso folder
5: diconnect and play
Note: if you cant start the game post comment of what custom firmware you have."

,antanas97,2011-11-13T19:44Z,"damn. it doesnt work for me. i get a black screen with no sound and cant even press home.
i have psp 2001 soft: 6.39 ME-2

then tried disabling plugins didnt work
setting CPU clock to 333/166 also didnt work
pls help!"
,Yannis13,2011-11-13T20:13Z,"Vakura: Forget it man. Tried all you told me. Still nothing. Oh, and just a correction on my part. It doesn't only lead to a mere black screen, i can't even get in the starter screen cause the home button isn't working, have come across it in other games, too, so i just have to take the battery out. What causes this, might you know? It seems i'll have to forget about Naruto U.N.I cause i can't find any other good upload."
,Vakura,2011-11-14T02:07Z,i found a patched version of the game your free to try it Yannis and Antanas you will have folow the links in the page download patched version not the untouched iso http://www.ffinsider.net/psp-iso/naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-impact-usa.html

,antanas97,2011-11-14T21:24Z,"its still a shame i had to much stress for such a crappy game. when i looked at gameplay i thought its quite nice, but now... OMG its the same crap as 1st dbz budokai tenkaichi that was made from side-view combat to 3d"
