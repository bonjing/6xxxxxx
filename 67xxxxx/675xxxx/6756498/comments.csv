,kalsmr,2011-10-19T21:38Z,Seems like the main book was split into different books of which this one is part [Chassis and body Electronics]. Thanks a bunch for this but keep the rest coming most especially the main (complete) book. The edition of which is 6th i guess. http://www.whsmith.co.uk/Images/Products%5C748%5C780%5C9780748780822_m_f.jpg    OR    http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/1393009-L.jpg
