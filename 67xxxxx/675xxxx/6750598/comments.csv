,BoMcM,2011-10-18T12:43Z,what you mean by half?
,JOEY3D,2011-10-18T14:35Z,Hi BoMcM Half side by side means 1080 is split between both left and right image your 3dtv then makes the two images one again and you then get 1080 if you do full side by side you get 1080 on both images and your 3dtv wont support 2160 resolution which is what you would get when the two images are turned back into one hence half side by side hope this helps

Waiting for your future 3D releases..."
,endopendo,2011-10-19T09:10Z,Man....no seeds....
,Bargetti,2011-10-20T04:04Z,once my mass effect 2 finishes I will go ahead and start the download and seed.
,jonmobrien,2011-10-20T18:28Z,"Awesome, thanks Joey3D
And thanks for the 1MB block size. This is seeding so so so fast.
PS. The 1080p width is 1920. (1920x1080).
So FULL-SBS would be 3840x1080 per frame, which as you pointed out, no current TV can handle. Half-SBS is 2 x 960x1080 half-frames joined side-by-side and sent to the TV in one 1920x1080 frame.
An alternative is Half-TAB (Top and Bottom) which is 2 x 1920x540 half-frames spliced above and below each other. Technologically there is no difference in compression, SBS simply became more common. Probably because psychologically when you look at the whole frame is 2D mode you see the left-eye image squashed up on the left and the right-eye image squashed up on the right, and mentally it just ""seems right""."
,JOEY3D,2011-10-20T23:10Z,HI JONMOBRIEN YES YOU ARE CORRECT ABOUT THE RESOLUTIONS I GOT MY TWO NUMBERS THE WRONG WAY ROUND GLAD THE 1MB BLOCK SIZE HELPED IAM STILL LEARNING ABOUT UPLOADING AND MY CRAP 1.5MB DOWNLOAD AND 406KB UPLOAD SPEEDS DOESN NOT HELP BUT I STILL LIKE TO PASS ON MY WORK TO PEOPLE WHO CANT AFFORD TO BUY 3D BLURAYS AND IT SEEMS NOT A LOT CAN RIP 3D BLURAYS AT PRESENT HOPE THIS HELPS
,nihil78,2011-10-21T21:59Z,"UGH this torrent is driving me nuts. I've been trying to download it for days but I keep getting no seeders and about 700 peers! And even though I get no seeders, I'm still getting a download rate of anywhere between 1.5 kB to 200 kB! I don't understand what the problem is. 
"
,JOEY3D,2011-10-21T23:24Z,Hi Nihil78 its because its my work and i have not finished uploading the complete movie yet and when you see no seeders but are still downloading you are downloading from peers who have downloaded that block from me and then share it to other peers the seeders will shoot up when i have finished uploading it all hope this helps
,nihil78,2011-10-22T23:22Z,"Thanks for your feedback JOEY, your comment cleared up a lot of my confusion. I'm still a bit new to this so I appreciate the help! Looking forward to more of your uploads, very appreciated  : ) "

,maxor_,2011-10-23T23:58Z,Going to bokmark you :D
,soadz87,2011-10-25T17:18Z,"Great to see a 3D uploader. Keep going Joey and you will earn yourself a reputation on here :D. A quick question...is your audio in DTS or AC3 format?

I have noticed alot of people on here have LG 3D TV's which do not support DTS audio thus far. 

A little heads up, you may want to have your audio set as AC3 or in your description direct people to use Popcorn MKV Audio Converter..it is freeware to convert DTS to AC3 audio, and very easy to use.

Good work and hope to see more uploads from you in the future :)"
,JOEY3D,2011-10-25T17:41Z,Hi soadz87 the audio is ac3 i remove hd audio when i convert the movies as my samsung 3dtv is the same it does not like dts my description above is wrong the audio is ac3 its the first time ive put audio format in my description AUDIO IS AC3 hope this helps

,mikes216,2011-10-28T15:56Z,"Joey,do you know how to get subtitles to 3d mkv? 3d subtitler does not work so I bet you might have different experience. need to play these on my 3DTV. thanks"
,JOEY3D,2011-10-28T18:07Z,Mikes216 i do not add subs when i convert my films as this would use more of the little memory i have left till i get a 1tb hard drive and i do not need subs my self so never bothered i no subs are saved to there own file not converted into the movie but i dont no if 3dtvs can read this file never tryed myself again dont need them sorry hope this helps
,mikes216,2011-10-28T19:21Z,thank you Joey. it´s a real challenge. don´t need them for myself but doing an interpreter is not ideal lol. thanks buddy
,JOEY3D,2011-10-28T20:44Z,Mikes216 i will look into this as you are not the first to ask and the subs are on the blurays that i buy its just a case of me working out how to get them on the 3dtv
,menacenz,2011-11-07T10:32Z,"Thanks for this and all the work you've done on the 3d Torrents.

One thing though, when I watched this on my Samsung 3DTV via a Samsung 3D Bluray Player I have and USB plugged into that (the TV itself doesn't play many movies as it lacks the codecs but the bluray player will) the aspect ratio seemed off?

That is it was playing it in letterbox format instead of completely fullscreen and not settings I touched could change this. Other movies I've tried though such as Avatar 3D from TPB played fine in fullscreen.

I've got another users copy of Captain America so can't comment if your rip of this is the same or not.

Do you think you could check this out and if it's a rip setting rip the movies to be fullscreen at 16:9 in the future? I hate losing all that screen real estate at the top and bottom.

Thanks."
,JOEY3D,2011-11-11T19:32Z,HI MENACENZ I WILL NOT STREACH MY MOVIES AS YOU LOOSE SOME OF THE PICTURE DOING THIS I CONVERT SOME MOVIES IN FULLSCREEN IF IT IS LIKE THIS ON THE BLURAYS THAT I BUY AND AVERTAR 3D WAS MENT TO BE FULLSCREEN AS THATS HOW IT IS ON THE DISK AND YOU DONT LOOSE SOME OF THE PICTURE MOST MOVIES ARE 2.35:1 WHICH IS LETTERBOX AND THATS HOW MOST MOVIES ARE RECORDED SO SORRY IF THE MOVIE IS FULLSCREEN YOU GET FULLSCREEN IF ITS LETTERBOX YOU GET LETTERBOX HOPE THIS HELPS
