,LordReserei,2011-10-20T20:41Z,Any ETA on the 64-bit version? 
[V],RobbingHood,2011-10-20T23:38Z,"ETA 64bit crack is soon, since it's already out. Probably someone else will post it soon.

AFAIK DI 1.9 is not working for this version."

[V],RobbingHood,2011-10-27T04:21Z,"@muhu88 

That's why XP is not mentioned in the system requirements."
,scyther56,2011-10-28T10:27Z,"Installation worked perfectly and editing to. But when I try to render, the render button is dimmed and I am stuck with my project!"

cheers

,steveindigo,2011-11-12T21:54Z,"This works fabulously, as always. RobbingHood is CHAMPIONSHIP!  Clean as a whistle (but what else would you expect with the 'Hood?), follow the directions and zoom, zip!

Only question, is this update-able? Seems as though I remember an earlier version, either 9.0 or 10.0 would throw out the patch when updated...

I think they just released a new build with bug fixes...

If not updateable then...(err, ummm, ahem, nudge-nudge, hint-hint, wink-wink, asking him knowingly)... your eloquent, unpinnacled, wonderous grace, RobbingHood, I have a humble request..."
,steveindigo,2011-11-12T21:55Z,"In line with my earlier question....or, would using the patch after the update work?"
,globalwidetrekk,2011-11-16T16:26Z,"as always, you are amazing!!! thank you very very much. it works perfectly.  you are the best!"
,Tuwy,2011-12-09T22:15Z,"So, how about someone answers the question ""Where is the patch button on the patcher?""

It's a legitimate question. No we are not retarded or blind; it's not rocket science, there should be a button or something that says ""patch"" when you open the patcher, but there isn't any. 

There's an ""about"" button and an ""exit"" button that's barely visible, because it's cropped by the right side of the screen.

Basically the patcher is horrible and gets cropped, which means that some people can't see and therefor can't click on the ""patch"" button.

So would you be so kind to acknowledge this problem and come up with a solution to this? Thank you."
[V],RobbingHood,2011-12-10T00:42Z,"@Tuwy 

Obviously on a normal pc the patch button is visible.
So obviously you don't have a normal pc. 
Without knowing anything about your pc nobody will be able to help you.

When asking for help think about you attitude also, cause you're the one who needs help."
,nomad169,2011-12-23T07:26Z,"Thanks RobbingHood. as always tis is legit.

100% working. but for some reason it refuses to import flv and some mp4 (captured using a digicam) files. maybe some codec error or something. other than these two problems, everything's great. I wish I had brought a Graphics Card.

@Tuwy
Stop complaining. Patcher does not get cropped for anyone else except you. (try dragging the patch till you see all the buttons) Either you are using a display resolution lower than 474x230 or there is really some problem with your pc. The ""Patch"" button is below ""Release date"" on right of the ""Backup"" button, bottom of the application. 

RobbingHood does not have to acknowledge shit. everything is working as it should. "
,perplex51,2012-01-04T02:13Z,"doesnt extract, just freezes"
,perplex51,2012-01-04T02:19Z,it doesnt extract... just freezes
,swoodruff,2012-01-17T05:25Z,"The ""patch"" button is also missing on my patcher. I'm running 64 bit Windows 7."
,Avicci,2012-01-17T22:33Z,"Worked fine for me, probably the fastest Vegas Pro torrent I've ever went through

Nice job Robbing!"
,DukeNukem513,2012-01-20T02:12Z,"Fast download but after following all instructions I went to edit a video I had and my computer blue screened then when it rebooted I tried again the program stopped responding.
My pc specs are,
windows 7 64 bit
intel i7 2.9Ghz 
4 gigs of RAM
NVidia geforce gtx 460 graphics card
So its not my PC. Guess its cause I have 64 bit and there was only 32 bit patch?"
,nomad169,2012-01-20T05:14Z,"DukeNukem513 The patch is not a 32-bit application but the whole package is..

Dled the 64-bit vegas pro. Here's the link http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6896079/Sony_Vegas_PRO_11.0.511_64_bit_Multilanguage_with_keygen_and_pat"
,MiloXC3,2012-01-23T13:40Z,"Hi there RobbingHood.
I followed your instructions exactly and downloaded and installed everything fine, but the program is titled 'Vegas Pro 11.0 TRIAL'.

So, have I somehow just got a trial version or is it supposed to be called that?

Thanks for the fast torrent though."
,AutoDeskMaya,2012-01-26T20:07Z,Can I update to the new version?
,jorgexka,2012-01-30T21:58Z,"can't see the patch button!!!! :(   :(   :(   :(
change resolution, compatibility mode, nothing works., patch program looks cropped and no patch button on it.. any other patch solution???"
,Dino_K,2012-02-03T16:29Z,"Thank you for the great upload!
For all who can not see the patch button in the Patcher, i had the same problem, just change the symbolsize in the control panel into small and you will see the full patcher!"
,DarthAb3,2012-02-05T15:10Z,"works fine for me, thanks man!"
,Optikal_Winter,2012-02-22T05:53Z,"Please do not download this torrent!

After downloading and installing this program my computer got infected with a virus that deleted half of my hard drive. I just spent the past 3 hours recovering the most critical parts that I really need.

Please spare yourself the same fate as me and avoid this torrent!

Im actually quite appalled and hurt at this to be quite honest. Ive been downloading torrents from TPB for years and never once encountered a virus. This is the first time a torrent has done this to me and all I really wanted to do was to some video editing! :("
,nomad169,2012-02-24T10:40Z,"^^Optikal_Winter First check out the green skull. There is no such thing as virus in this torrent. I downloaded and installed it just fine. Edited some home made videos too.

You would have got that virus from somewhere else.. NOT from this torrent."
,eagledude4,2012-02-27T01:33Z,Great torrent. I've been looking for a working version of sony vegas for a while. I Highly recommend this torrent!
,youugly55,2012-03-01T13:00Z,Can you share the serial number? I badly need it. It already expired. :( and I'm doing a movie and the deadline is next week. can you please? :(

,ugamer12,2012-03-10T15:54Z,Ty so muucchhhh Robbing!!! Downloaded in 7 min and works perfectly!!!!! i luv you!!!!
,king_ace,2012-03-10T18:48Z,"Works great. But I dont take the risk to upgrade.. @RobbingHood , can we update without problems?"
,ObserverJLin,2012-03-14T23:41Z,"Dear OP.

I downloaded SVP11 32bit from sony's offical website and used the crack patch provided by you. The patch said ""Done"" so I exit patch and start SVP11 32bit but it still ask me to register. When I did that the program opened and it says ""trail version"". And when I exit the program it reminds me to buy it. Is this the way it's meant to be or is something wrong? Should I have used the installation file provided by you?"
,RomanAres,2012-03-20T12:28Z,"Really great! Works perfectly, this version is older so they can't find out it's fake either! Very nice!"
,lif3isfr33,2012-04-13T07:38Z,yo does anyone have plugins for SONY VEGAS this version to output in AVI or MP4? In addition to compressions like xvid or divx? 
,FiveeNil,2012-04-23T09:44Z,"Does it work?
- Not tried it yet but it seems like the real deal.

It is clean, any viruses?
- Nope, no viruses. 100% clean, easy to install, don't really need to fully the exact instuctions but it works. Full version as well.

Any problems?
- Nope, the crack likes two seconds. Then all you do is open up Sony Vegas Pro 11 and it's the full version. Thanks RobbingHood, love you."

,S.Hayha,2012-04-26T15:19Z,"Same issue as above. 1080p reso, there is no ""patch button"". From what I see, it seems cropped."
,Claytongp,2012-04-30T20:20Z,"These people are right, the ""Patch"" button is clipped off on some screens. Including mine, though I was able to fix it just by messing around with the .exe files. I have a fixed version of the patch. Email me at claytongalliah@gmail.com if you want it."
,MovieReviewScores,2012-05-13T08:13Z,"Very easy to install , VERY RECOMMENDED."
