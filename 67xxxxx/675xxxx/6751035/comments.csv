,Tijauna,2011-10-19T00:41Z,"Sounds dumb but...Does anyone have UT2? Like, the base package itself. Never saw a torrent for it. (only the dvd with no seeders)"
,aarque,2011-10-19T03:45Z,"Imo, UT2 is lame because of this bi-annual update - thanks a mil mickey for keeping it flowing, just the same - but between that and the brutal installation delay, takes the better part of the hour with all the patches and who knows if we can keep getting these updates or if they will even keep writing them. Granted, the traffic flow is way more authentic with UT, but who cares really? I don't, as a habit, follow AI planes around, anyway. I just want my Lufthansa's in Berlin and my Conviasa's in Buenos Aires and MyTraffic pretty much does all that, basically replacing the default AI with something believable.

Now there is a MyTraffic X 5.3b Pro, no registration key and looks pretty nice. So far I have found no sources. Anyone feeling generous?"
,Husky_65,2011-10-19T12:17Z,Thank You very much! You're the man! :-)

,fedesgs,2011-11-02T19:41Z,Thanks!!!
,rawag14,2011-11-04T04:07Z,and so i figured i need the UT2 to run it. Can someone please upload it. A rip or an ISO or wrapped installer. Anything will do. 
,mtjoeng,2011-11-08T18:20Z,"pop-up & program says:
summer 2011 schedule"
,FS_Junkie,2011-11-12T07:11Z,"Yep ... it's not the latest file :-(( I also get the installer showing it as July/Summer. After installing it I get the ""out of date"" message ... and , yes, I *do* know how to update UT2 ;-)"
,Juppie902,2011-12-26T12:58Z,"'Error checking new database'
FFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
now i gotta redownload fucking UT2.
every time i start the software now it says this error, and above it theres a window saying UT2 was just updated with a new database and needs to be restarted, no matter how much u will open/close it, the same thing will keep happening. You have been warned."
