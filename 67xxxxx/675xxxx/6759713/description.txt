ReleaseNotes:

Candlebox's 3rd album, and yet another change in direction from this band. Where "Lucy" was underproduced and had a garage feel to it, "Happy Pills" leans more towards classic hard rock, and reminds me of Aerosmith at times. Once again, it's another extremely solid and great album from Candlebox, though sadly their last. "10,000 Horses" is a good opener, a well-written catchy hard rock song. "Happy Pills" is the heaviest and angriest song on here, and is helped by an excellent dual-guitar solo, and an awesome riff. It's one of my favorites. The songs are lighter overall on this one, and acoustic guitars are used much more than on the previous C-box albums. The song in which the acoustics stand out the most is the
ballad "Sometimes", which is a very deep song with moving lyrics. It's also one of the best on here, and probably one of the best love songs I've ever heard. "A Stone's Throw Away" is a blues-based song, with some excellent lead guitar in it, it's another well-written song musically and lyrically. The other songs on here are pretty enjoyable, so overall it's a great album. In conclusion, it's got great guitarwork and great lyrics/vocals from Kevin Martin. Recommended for fans of Candlebox; and fans of hard rock (Aerosmith, Black Crowes, Zeppelin, etc.) should enjoy this as well.
