LOUIS JORDAN JIVIN WITH JORDAN
Recorded: March 29, 1939 - November 28, 1951
Released: July 30, 2002
Label: Proper Records
Format: Mp3@320

This whopping , four-disc box collects the vast majority of master takes Louis Jordan & His Tympani Five recorded for Decca in the 1940s.  it also represents Jordan's music from the late '30s to the early '50s. One can hear the grand lyric phrasing and rhythmic influence Jordan had on Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Johnny Otis, and Otis Blackwell. From "Five Guys Named Moe," "That Chick's Too Young to Fry," and "Somebody Done Changed the Lock on My Door" to "If You're So Smart How Come You Ain't Rich," "Fast Sam from Birmingham," "Baby It's Cold Outside" (with Ella), and many many more, there isn't a weak take on this set.
