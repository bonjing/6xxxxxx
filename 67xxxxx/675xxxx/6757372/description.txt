This is a 2006 documentary on HBO about the nature of blockbusters and flops.  It's got tons of interviews with stars like George Clooney and Jodie Foster, plus Hollywood executives and stuff.  (To be honest, I think it kind of sucks - it's very shallow and trite.  But I had been looking for a Torrent of it, couldn't find one, so I made one of my own.)   

It's my first ever DVD rip.  I used Handbrake and DVD43.  There's blurring at the bottom of the video for some reason, and then some horizontal slashes in the video.  If anybody can tell me how to fix this, I'd appreciate it so I don't have the problems on my future rips.  Hope you enjoy.
