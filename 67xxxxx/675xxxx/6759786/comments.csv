,CelestialElegance,2011-10-23T05:29Z,"@lrbarbarossa....Nope dude the login status can't change the file format that eztv has originally uploaded :o The only plausible reason that comes to mind is,maybe you downloaded some other torrent and mistook it for this one? o.O
PS:Just curious :p did you FINALLY get the avi?? :)"
,mustyque,2011-10-23T12:40Z,Good quality torrent. recommended.
,Mezdi,2011-10-23T21:02Z,"Episode 7 please :D!
Great quality !"
,EastLink,2011-10-26T22:04Z,"lrbarbarossa, I think I know what your problem is. It appears that Peer Media is spoofing in this torrent and seeding fake files.  Make sure your hash check is on (most new torrent clients have it on by default) and it should only download the good packets. I will also be helping to find out what IP addresses PM is using to deface torrents like this one. To start, their website is in the range 173.201.0.0-173.201.255.255. Try adding those to your IP filter, and I encourage anyone else to do the same. These thankless fags at these anti p2p companies aren't going to stop us."
,JaZzY2010,2011-10-27T10:35Z,"Geeeeeez....it doesn't matter which container it is in!! avi, mkv etc... both these containers can handle the compression's available....but mkv tends to be smaller....that said, please get a brain before you start bitching or ""educating"" others.....say thank you  or shut up ;) "

,Amenoir,2011-11-13T18:18Z,"@00Ace, possibly learn to spell ""faggot"" first. Second, you are in fact entitled to your opinion, even if it is wrong (seriously, supernatural?). Thirdly, the fact you sought this torrent out to spam means we won. GG."
,WHISK3Y,2011-12-11T10:59Z,"@00Ace 
Hey troll, learn to spell."
