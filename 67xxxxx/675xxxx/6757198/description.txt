"in june 2008 my EP 'i`m in a polaroid - where are you?' was released. making that i took my laptop, pushed the on-button in garageband and made noise. i started recording it in the fall 2007 in new york city and north of it in the beautiful catskill mountains, where i was recording on my own in this abandoned barn that was once a night club. now it`s slowly falling apart. around there, there`s also a fantastic organ: when you switch it on it sounds like a ferry slowly sailing far away in the distance.
i also met some fantastic birds. they were vinyl birds and i put them on the ep. as vinyl as they are they were really singing into with the music and they are the true stars of the ep. when not in the mountains i worked on the music in my living space or while touring â€¦"
