        Plot: 
             Det. Mack "Mac" Taylor, a dedicated and driven crime-scene investigator who
			 believes that everything is connected and everyone has a story, is a decorated
			 Marine who served in Desert Storm and dabbled in war photography. The job is his
			 life; he focuses on cases until they are solved. He and his partner, Stella
			 Bonasera, a well-traveled, well-educated detective, an orphan who flourished in
			 spite of the system, share a passion for the job. Stella is a jack-of-all-trades
			 and has an unmatched desire to find answers for the victims of violent crimes, 
			 due in part to questions about her past. They lead a team of experts through the
			 gritty and kinetic city that never sleeps. The team includes Danny Messer, an
			 investigator with an unflappable spirit and a troubled family history, which he
			 uses on the job as he blends his own set of hybrid ethics. Messer was personally
			 selected to join the team by Mac, and he attempts daily to live up to that honor
			 and responsibility. Sheldon Hawkes is the crime lab's former coroner, a
			 brilliant Ph.D. who transitioned to the field team. Joining them is Don Flack,
			 an edgy, hardcore homicide detective with a quick wit, impressive forensic 
			 insight and a long family history in law enforcement and Lindsay Monroe, a 
			 young, athletic CSI with a Midwestern work ethic who is willing to roll up her 
			 sleeves to tackle any job and rarely hints at the dark and devastating secret  
			 that originally motivated her to dedicate her life to being an investigator.   
			 Rounding out the team is lab rat Adam Ross and eccentric coroner Dr. Sid      
			 Hammerback.
