Synopsis

CHINA: A CENTURY OF REVOLUTION is a six-hour tour de force journey through the countryâ€™s most tumultuous period. First televised on PBS, this award-winning documentary series presents an astonishingly candid view of a once-secret nation with rare archival footage, insightful historical commentary and stunning eyewitness accounts from citizens who struggled through Chinaâ€™s most decisive century. CHINA IN REVOLUTION charts the countryâ€™s most violent era where decades of civil war and foreign invasions led to the bloody battle for power between Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai-shek. THE MAO YEARS examines the turbulent era of Maoâ€™s attempts to forge a â€œnew Chinaâ€ from the war-ravaged and poverty-stricken nation. Maoâ€™s death begins BORN UNDER THE RED FLAG, which follows the countryâ€™s new leadership of Deng Xiaoping and its unlikely transformation into an extraordinary hybrid of communist-centralized politics with an ever-expanding free market economy. Monumental in scope, CHINA: A CENTURY OF REVOLUTION is critical viewing for anyone interested in this increasingly powerful and globally influential country.
