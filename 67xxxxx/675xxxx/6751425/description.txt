*Blood Sympathy* (1993) [ 8 hours, CD ] .Read by Simon Williamson
PI can mean many things, but can it really mean a balding, middle-aged redundant lathe operator from a high rise in Luton, (near London)? Joe Sixsmith thinks it can. His Aunt Mirabelle thinks you'd have to be crazy to hire him, and Joe's current clients certainly fit the bill. One seems to be confessing to the brutal murder of his whole family; another thinks she's a witch. Alongside them, the two heavies who believe Joe is hiding their illicit drugs seem almost normal. In the past Reginald Hill has brought wit, style and compassion to police investigation. Now he does the same for the private sector, and -- in perhaps his greatest feat of creation -- reinvents Luton in the process.(JB)

*Born Guilty* (1995) [ 7 Hours 33 mins, Cassettes ] .Read by Simon Williamson
Hurrying out of St Monkey's church on the last Amen of the Creation, Joe Sixsmith stumbles across a boy's corpse in a cardboard box and into more trouble than he's ever known. Soon his casebook is full to bursting: retired colonial Mrs C. demands to know how the boy got there; Gallie, the Mutant from Outer Space, urges him to find the stranger nosing into her granddad's past; while Butcher, that briefest of briefs, is hellbent on digging the dirt on a deputy head's out-of-school activities. Ever valiant for truth, Joe threads his mild-mannered way through the mean streets of Luton, fighting off angry cops, demented druggies and the matchmaking machinations of his Auntie Mirabelle. But the truth he discovers does not set him free, for there's little joy in confirming that today's kids grow up so much faster than he did, and even the luckiest of them find out all too soon that they have been "born guilty".(JB)
