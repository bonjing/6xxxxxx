,Wolverine96,2011-10-21T12:40Z,"it's not work!
It  say:This disc in unreadable"
,Bak4mHell,2011-10-21T12:44Z,"@EveryOne :- Seed!!!! and yes i forgot to mention that you MUST install and Play, otherwise it wont work like john4551 said.

@john4551 :- sorry bro, not sure if i will up code veronica, its not one of my favorites, besides i am not a professional up-loader, i just upload things that are difficult to find or are not available on TPB."
,Bak4mHell,2011-10-21T12:45Z,"@Wolverine96 :- its working, burn it like a normal disc, play it on LT 2.0, Are you sure playing on LT 2.0? i did not check it on 1.9. Also you need to install it on HDD/memory device to make it work., Installation is must."
,Bak4mHell,2011-10-21T12:52Z,"@EveryOne:- Seed!!! And yes, i forgot to mention that you must install it on HDD/Memory device, USB drive, etc to play it, like john4551 pointed out. Install first then play.

@john4551 :- sorry bro, i'm not sure if i will up code veronica, its not one of my favorites.

@Wolverine96 :- are you sure you burned it at slow speed 2.4x? also i verified it on LT 2.0. Make sure your console is updated to LT 2.0 I did not check it on Lt 1.9."
,Wolverine96,2011-10-21T13:13Z,"I have LT 2.0
but not enough space!
how much space do you need?"
,Inlandjunk,2011-10-21T13:25Z,"The game works perfectly on my LT 2.0 PAL XBOX:)

Burnt it with Clone CD, no messing up with layer breaks and that kind of stuff (Clone CD does everything for me:)), installed the game on HDD and finished it:) I've had the same amount of entertainment I had a long time ago playing this fantastic game on my PS2:)

Thanks for the upload:) Btw, could you please upload Code Veronica:)?
I know you already answered this question but.....:)"
,Bak4mHell,2011-10-21T13:36Z,"@Wolverine96 :- The game needs around 4GB to install. If you don't have a HDD, do you atleast have a USB drive? or a pen drive? then use it to install the game and play. Also, i am expecting that you are doing this on a PAL console."
,Bak4mHell,2011-10-21T13:38Z,"@Inlandjunk :- can you or someone else let me know when is code veronica out?, i'll try if its available.. but no guarantees, just, i'll try...."
,Patkos96,2011-10-21T19:44Z,thanks man!

,sam00700,2011-11-01T09:51Z,"Okay, so anyone can confirm if this one can be burned to a disc in wave 2 format and then installed to a FLASH DRIVE?"
,hanfi,2011-11-03T20:17Z,"Tried to play the game, didn't work ""disc unreadable"". Came back here to complain, and read that you have to install it to play. Did that and now its working fine. Thank you very much for this game, sadly the controls are complete shit."
,Barghetti,2011-11-15T21:40Z,anyone know if you can just extract it onto an external HDD?
,shade1122,2011-12-13T21:18Z,how do you know if your xbox is pal?
,Daky1001,2012-02-23T20:19Z,"Thx,works great,but you should've wrote that install is a must.
@shade1122 If you bought it in Europe it's probably PAL."
