Formed in 1997, Coldplay â€“ comprised of Guy Berryman (bass), Jonny Buckland (lead guitar), Will Champion (drums), and Chris Martin (vocals, guitar, keyboards) â€“ released two EPs, The Safety and Brothers and Sisters, before signing with Parlophone in 1999. Three additional EPs (The Blue Room, Shiver and Yellow) followed before their landmark debut album, Parachutes, which was released in 2000. With the exquisite opening bars of â€œYellow,â€ Coldplay claimed a legion of fans worldwide and, with each successive album, the band has broken new ground both artistically and commercially.

Coldplay's fifth studio album, Mylo Xyloto (pronounced my-lo zy-letoe), will be released in the U.S. on October 24th by Capitol Records. Produced by Markus Dravs, Daniel Green and Rik Simpson, with enoxification and additional composition by Brian Eno, Mylo Xyloto follows 2008's Viva La Vida, which charted at No. 1 in 36 countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom.
