Those who believe that traditional blues is dead, they need to be introduced to Eric Lindell. His new album Cazadero is his sixth album since 2006. The blues singer and guitarist hit the music scene by signing with Alligator Records, one of the most well known and respect blues record labels in the country. Since his first album in 2006 he has since released a new album every year but one, though he fixed that by releasing two in just one year.
