Synopsis: WinRAR is a powerful archive manager. It can backup your data and 
reduce the size of email attachments, decompress RAR, ZIP and other files 
downloaded from Internet and create new archives in RAR and ZIP file format. 

How to Extract: Extract "self-extracting" EXE to desired folder, launch 
"WinRARPortable.exe". 

64-bit: Launch "WinRAR64Portable.exe".

Notes: 
* includes integrated "Imagination 3" Theme. WinRAR's default theme is so bland 
and ugly to look at. (refer to screenshot) 
* this version is truly stealth.
* PortableAppz has a version posted but like many of his apps., it leaves trash
in the registry and uses the standard theme.

How to Re-use:
* I did not enforce CRC-check on this launcher thus allows re-using. 
* Why would you want to reuse? for future updates by WinRAR

1. Extract WinRAR installer with 7-Zip
2. Copy/paste into "App" folder
3. Select "Yes" when prompted whether to replace existing files
4. That's it.. 

* Do not delete the files in "App", just Paste right over it.. because there are
files that must remain.
