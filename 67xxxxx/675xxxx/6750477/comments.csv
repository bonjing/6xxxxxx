,Ajulka,2011-10-17T16:55Z,"PS: link od I-Love-Quinta možná funguje, ale potřebujete heslo, který získáte na stránce za 50,-Kč, to už si radši počkám do offic. vydání a stáhnu si to potom..."
,GEE776,2011-10-17T17:10Z,"@szarkus
Why would you give a fake link? Seriously? It only takes 2 seconds to look at it and see that it is not a real link.

It's quite weird how no one has received the game early :S"
,GEE776,2011-10-17T17:14Z,"Also, seeing as the DEMO for Sims 3 Pets is 1.5GB (ish) I doubt that other one is real... Although, it might be, eh, I don't know :L"
,GEE776,2011-10-17T17:33Z,"Just thought I would tell everyone, Sims 3 Pets (EVEN THE PC VERSION) is 6GB, so any other one is fake, I checked on the Sims website :)"
,I-Love-Quinta,2011-10-17T18:04Z,im downloading one of 3.07 gb but i think its worth tto try because there isnt an other download yet. :P
