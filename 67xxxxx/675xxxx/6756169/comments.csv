,the_devious,2011-10-20T09:31Z,"This should be N-U-K-E-D. The video is bleeding off in the last 9 rows of pixels. This glitch was also present in METiS' previous release.
Come on guys, you only have to use your eyes. At time of writing, the only way to get faultless video with DTS audio is to mux the video from e.g. the FLAWL3SS release, with the DTS audio from this METiS release."
,the_devious,2011-10-20T10:52Z,"UPDATE.
The bleeding occurs only in my KMPlayer, but not in VLC Player. I don't have this issue with any other video, so I'm not sure what's going on. In any case, the soft focus of the METiS release is overdone IMHO. The FLAWL3SS release has much higher edge sharpness, so I'm still going with FLAWL3SS video and METiS DTS audio.
Thanks."
