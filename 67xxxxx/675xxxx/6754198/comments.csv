,foodlib,2011-10-22T23:05Z,"Bone u mostly rule and much thx for all you've ul'd...that said, this is a good copy if you like korean street vendor bootlegs. Much better than a cam rip, but I couldn't handle 5 minutes of this pixelated mess. I'm spoiled on what bone usually drops, I guess. The audio sounded great though..."
