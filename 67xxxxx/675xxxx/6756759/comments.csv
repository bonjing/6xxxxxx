I am just confused because the picture shows all 3 games... :)"

Again another that dose not know his/her games. This is Age of Empires 3! You also seem to not know your expansions as well. So I will indulge you ignorance. 

Age of Empires 3 contains three campaigns which it shows in the picture! The the expansions are not with this one! Also if I included the expansion I would have said in the title tag and Description and I would have used the cover picture that shows them all together."

[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-12-28T00:02Z,@critiqueofseeders - The game works on XP and vista and win 7 systems and others have stated. If you follow the instructions in the description to the letter the game will work! If not you are doing something wrong! (To those who are having issues with win 7 I can not help you)
