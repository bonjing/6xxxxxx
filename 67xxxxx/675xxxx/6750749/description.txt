I've turned this into a screensaver movie for my macmini.
I've included the screensaver movie engine & the actual time lapse video.

Follow the Save Hollywood instructions to install and then choose the time lapse video from the save hollywood screensaver..

OSX 10.4x to 10.5x
DOES NOT work with OSX 10.6x , 10.7x,  although there are other screensavers out there.

i.e Voop or xbmoviesaver amongst a few.

WINDOWS USERS.

I think Windows can use movies as screensavers with its propriety screen saver in the control panel..
