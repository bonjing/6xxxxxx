They only have two releases so far, but other torrents didn't have the bonus tracks, so here they are, deluxe/bonus track versions of both albums. As always, 320, 500x500 album art, complete/accurate ID3's.

..and I don't normally do track listings because you can see torrent contents when download, but anyway
