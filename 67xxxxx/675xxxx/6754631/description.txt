John Tavener - Funeral Canticle


This is the first song played in the movie The Tree of Life, it isn't on the official OST so I decided to track down a FLAC version (trust me, that wasn't easy) and put it online.

So here it is in all its glory, for you to enjoy. 

This is the full (23:55) version.


Kudos to Epsil for helping out *big time*! You're the greatest, girl. &lt;3
