Date: 2011.10

Director: Steven Brill

Plot:
Homeless veteran Bob 'Drillbit' Taylor manages to enjoy life anyhow and even saves some cash for
his dream, an 'all-paid' move to Alaska, even if that may take many years. His dream comes within
reach when clever nerd Wade, has fat friend Ryan 'T-dog' and cocky shrimp Jim, all new to junior
high-school, are bullied so badly by emancipated Filkins and his buddies that they advertise for
a bodyguard. Only Drillbit seems affordable and not crazy, so he's hired and drains their
pocket-money and home content. He's clueless how to protect them but gives them (bogus) self-defense
classes.
