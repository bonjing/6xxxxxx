The Imposter[2010][DVDRip]


Who will believe The Imposter?

Christian rock's hottest band, Grand_design is heading to the top. Unfortunately, lead singer Johnny C (Kevin Max of dcTalk) is heading straight down. His wife and band mates (including Jeff Deyo, former lead singer of SONICFLOOd) find out that after singing about Jesus at concerts, he's living for himself off the stage.

Losing his family and fame sends him on a downward spiral. Stripped of all the accessories of stardom, Johnny C begins a journey back home to find out if his shattered marriage can be put back together. He's coached by his mentor Proff (played by Kerry Livgren of the band Kansas) and a crazy homeless man (Tom Wright of World Trade Center, Barbershop), but will it be enough and in time to turn his life around?
