,shrifty,2011-10-29T04:49Z,"First of all, thanks for the maps!  I did notice an error initially when trying to install.

After extracting the file, the folder ""City Navigator South America NT 2012.30.gmap"" needs to be renamed to ""City Navigator Brazil NT 2012.30.gmap"".

Flawless after this minor change."
