Mega Breakdown: Navy Tanker
In the intense glare of the Texas sun, a team of demolition experts attempt to cut down and recycle the Navy's "first and finest fast attack oiler," the U.S.S. Savannah AOR-4. This tough tanker ran fuel between the ships of the fleet for over 20 years. But now, she's making her final voyage to ESCO Marine, a sprawling scrap yard in the Southern most tip of Texas. Here, she'll be stripped down, gutted out and recycled. But the "Savy Sue" comes with an awful lot of challenges for ESCO owner Richard Jaross and his team. Asbestos, PCBs, and a decade of neglect make this once proud tanker one big mess.
