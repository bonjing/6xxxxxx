PLOT:


Ang Babae sa Septic Tank chronicles a day in the life of three ambitious, 
passionate but misguided filmmakers as they set out to do a quick pre-prod at Starbucks, 
a courtesy call to their lead actress, Eugene Domingo, and an ocular inspection of their filmâ€™s 
major location, the Payatas dumpsite. Director Rainier, Producer Bingbong and Production 
Assistant Jocelyn are well-to-do, well-educated film school graduates who are dead set on 
making an Oscar worthy film. They believe they have a winning script, the energy and the 
drive to make their dreams come true. Like most filmmakers they know, they have devised a 
screenplay that will show the real essence of our culture: poverty. In the course of one day, 
they brainstorm and exhaust all possible treatment of their 
project: the story of Mila (Eugene Domingo), a mother from the slums, 
who out of desperation to survive, has sold her child to a pedophile. 
As they discuss the possible executions of the story, the movie-within-a-movie gets 
reborn in Jocelynâ€™s imagination several times. As a gritty no frills neo-realist film, 
as a glossy musical, as an over-the-top melodrama and as a docu drama using non-actors. 
For their last task of the day, they visit the dumpsite for the first time. 
As filmmakers gunning for authenticity, they get excited with the â€beautyâ€ of the squalor 
around them. Soon enough, they are faced with reality as they come face to face with the real 
effects of their chosen subject. Babae sa Septic Tank is a comedy about misguided ambitions, 
the art of making art and the romanticization of poverty.
