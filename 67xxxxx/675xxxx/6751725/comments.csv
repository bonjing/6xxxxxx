,fastestone,2011-10-22T01:49Z,"Windowsguru, Ihave a question about the windows firewall, It is disabled by default and cannot be turned on, or it says it is at coustom settings. What is reason for this.
The install went great, used a spare drive to test with, all looks and feels quick and responsive, was not worried about activation as I was going to change key to mine if all worked well.
Another question about the usb tool as it would not use the iso disk one or 2 to send to usb stick, but burned with Power ISO and ran fine.
1. More thing in next version if firewall is working would it be possibe to have in one large ISO to send to a 16 Gig usb stick, to avoid wasting DVD's in the future.
Awesome job Loooks amazing and so many cool looking theme's to choose from...
By the way I have seeded to 150 %, Have reinstalled my current OS and will seed if firewall issue can be fixed...Or there is a good reason to have off ? :(   .... :)....Thanks"
,windowsguru44,2011-10-22T02:32Z,Just go into services and turn on firewall service I disable it so apps all install silent without firewall causing popups. I then use Comodo  or Zone Alarm
,fastestone,2011-10-22T05:56Z,"Just checked back to post that it was turned off in services, you beet me to it tho...
Any instructions on how to convert this into one ISO that could be extracted to a usb stick ?

Thanks for the reply WindowsGuru..."
,windowsguru44,2011-10-22T22:45Z,"The usb 3rd disk just copy contents to hard drive
its not meant to be read only as the Live apps need hard drive space to launch. "
,fastestone,2011-10-23T05:50Z,"Understood about disk 3, would still be great to have 1 iso and combine disc 1 and 2, and to install from usb flash drive.
This is Great release     | |   "
,windowsguru44,2011-10-23T06:07Z,For next one I will make usb install possible
,fastestone,2011-10-29T05:10Z,"Hey Windows guru do you have a pack of post sp1 upadates that you could serve up. I have the sp1 Enterprize release and with it all up to date from my original enterprize sp1 install I have some 60 updates, would be great to have a pack of the post sp1 updates to slipstream myself.

,windowsguru44,2011-10-29T17:15Z,"Ofcourse when SP2 is out
