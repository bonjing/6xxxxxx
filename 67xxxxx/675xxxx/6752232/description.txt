An argument over the jukebox at a Mexican restaurant ends with two men dead in 
Greensboro, North Carolina. The killer belongs to the notorious transnational 
gang MS-13. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrest and deport 
many criminal gang members who are not U.S. citizens. But is deportation 
defeating MS-13? Or just making it stronger? And how did a gang that started 
in Los Angeles in the mid-80s end up responsible for the murder of two 
innocent men in North Carolina?
