Excellent quality, as always -

Apparently horizon91 isn't aware that you chose to move the majority of your work to a site that doesn't allow trolls. 

While I didn't take advantage of the invite you offered to the folks who appreciate your talent for great quality in a small mp4, I understand why you left. I do have you bookmarked here at PB and will continue to check back every week.
Best wishes.."

Mostly very good quality for the size, though a little smudgy in special-effects shots (like V's nose). Appreciate it more if the credits were intact .OR. the description alerted to both the cut and the truncated runtime. Thanks."

,Fangular,2011-10-22T11:48Z,"Hi 2040.. I've tried to follow you to your new home but I just can't seem to figure it out, so am just going to leave my request here instead and hope that you drop in occasionally!

I was wondering if you were able to upload 'Work of Art' this season? TvTeam and one or two others uploaded the first episode of season 2, but then none of them seem to be uploading any more episodes.. anyway, I don't know if you have access to the show or you're familiar with it (if you can, you should check it out - it's an interesting show!) but if it was at all possible, I'd be thrilled if you could upload the episodes this season as they become available.

Regardless, thank you for everything - I understand why you've pretty much left PirateBay, but you are sorely missed!

Cheers,
O"

BTW, waiting here for my response, after I am for months on SU is, let say, like waiting for rain drop in Sahara, a waste of time... as was my time spent on TPB, dealing with all crazies and lunatics right here..."
,Bidsness,2011-10-24T10:37Z,"Thankyou so much.. If you could bring this movie Magonia (2001), it will be great.. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285689/"
,Bidsness,2011-10-24T10:40Z,"And I am not yet at the new place.. I will be there soon. But if you do read this here, try considering it."

,.Dev,2011-11-23T11:22Z,@twentyforty: can u plz upload fringe season 3 complete in ur small size format plz. or just seed the episodes. anyone option regarding this req will be appreciated...........!!!! plz help............!!!!
[V],twentyforty,2011-12-11T16:43Z,"@neeru: SU is fine. Clean place. Light-fast download. No Hit&Run as much as I have here what was the main reason why I migrated there. No lunatics.  They are shot down at sight - that's only thing ""missing"" there. I seed there non-stop over 1000 of my torrents just there. And take care about nice people ratios.

@.Dev: Read above, please. I invited everyone who have asked and dropped me an e-mail with his address."
