,michaelrwatson,2011-10-19T01:12Z,"Hey REBORN & .BONE: What's wrong with you? This should be 700MB (at most), not 1.4GB--*especially* since it's a cam. There is no noticeable diff in quality between 700MB and 1.4GB, *especially* with this short of a movie. Even if this were a DVDrip, 700MB (or less for x264). Get a clue please. Thanks. "
