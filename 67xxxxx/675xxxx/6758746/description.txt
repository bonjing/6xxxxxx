This was obtained as a 13CD offering of Time Life Music Classic country hits.
There were more than a few duplicates we found, and the bitrates 
were 128k to 192k across the board. 

Ive added many selections, upgraded most of the significant selections to 320k
with some 256k or 192k although you will find some 128k in the remaining
selections - they still sound great and fit into an ipod just nice.

Some I converted from CD at full stereo while several came from flac files too.

Although it was meant to be all 1941-1975 renditions, some newer songs and
or versions are in here for sure! But who's complain around here! All in a great
cause - thank you!
