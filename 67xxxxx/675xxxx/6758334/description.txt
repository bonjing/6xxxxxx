Jurassic CSI
In Jurassic CSI, dino detective Dr. Phil Manning launches a fullscale investigation to unearth how dinosaurs really looked and lived. Jurassic CSI goes into the minds, under the skin and inside the bones of the biggest, most impressive beasts ever to walk the planet.
In this six-part series, Dr. Manning doesn't stick to convention or even his own discipline on his perpetual quest to expand what we know about dinosaurs. With privileged access to some of the world's most sophisticated technologies from crime scene 3D mapping technology to an image machine one million times stronger than a chest X-ray Jurassic CSI challenges long held assumptions and poses radical questions about our understanding of dinosaurs.
