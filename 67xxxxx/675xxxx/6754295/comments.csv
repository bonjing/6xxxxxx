4.2e Softmod - CFG USB Loader.
Try using PIMPMYWII to reload Ios's. Running game using default IOS 248"
,macca3-16,2011-11-09T08:51Z,"I dl this game when it was first available through a different p2p search engine, it must have been the same file because I too found it to freeze continually, im just wondering as my Wii was only recently modded, does anyone know if they have had to upgrade their softmod for new games to run properly???"
,bartch25,2011-11-16T22:21Z,"Ik heb ook al van alles geprobeerd, geen enkele usb loader werkt goed. Gelukkig heb ik ook een hardmod (Drivekey) en hij werkt hierop prima! (Alleen als ik hem low-speed op een Verbatim-R dvd brand.) Wel een aanrader hoor! Erg leuk spel."
,bartch25,2011-11-16T22:23Z,"I will repeat my answer in English too ;) 
No usb loader is working, i tested some of them..But i also have a hardmod (Drivekey) and the game works good with it, but I have to burn onto a Verbatim -R (at low speed). Nice game! Thanks!"
,bartch25,2011-11-16T22:25Z,Works with Drivekey! (burn it lowspeed on Verbatim-R!)
