This torrent includes the official podcast mp3s released on the www.glennbeck.com website for the radio show. It includes the "4th Hour" with Pat & Stu which is available only to subscribers (ie. it is not part of the regular radio broadcast).

Regarding yesterday's 4th hour: It is STILL not available either on the podcast subscription (it doesn't download - just a placeholder) or on the website.  I didn't listen to the show live yesterday, so maybe Pat & Stu got up to something they don't want available for download.  Anyway, it remains unavailable today. If it comes up later this week, I will post it. (Now *I* really want to hear what they did yesterday!)
