,MrMain68,2011-10-25T11:12Z,"First off, thanks dude, exceptional job you're doing here, I hope and pray you'll go all the way. Just one question: there are no Colin McRae games yet in your torrents, can we expect to see them later? Not pressuring you, just wandering. Thanks again man."
,MrMain68,2011-10-25T11:15Z,"Oh and yeah, gonna seed the shit out of your torrents, least I can do."

Thanx for the support,and they will keep coming ;)"
