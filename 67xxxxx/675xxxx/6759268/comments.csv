,JawDroppinDroopBallz,2011-10-24T21:10Z,So I gather everyone else is stuck on 99.6% also??? Seen as there has been no seeds... this needs to be deleted it's dead...
,Compupaq,2011-11-08T05:39Z,"It doesn't need to be deleted, the torrent's only three weeks old.  We just need a seeder..."
,chuangzu,2011-12-05T11:31Z,"I can see on utorrent there is one seeder in brackets 0(1), what does that mean any idea?"
,chuangzu,2011-12-05T11:38Z,"Seeds displays the number of seeds you are connected to. The second number is the number of known seeds in the peer cache collected from the tracker, DHT, and PEX. The number in the parentheses is the number of seeds reported by the tracker scrape. 

What is a tracker scrape?

Does this mean that there is a seed connected to the swarm but just on a different node to us?"
,chuangzu,2011-12-05T11:39Z,"scrape:
The grabbing of statistics (number of seeds and peers) from a tracker regarding a specific swarm."
,UltraMoose,2011-12-17T01:25Z,"This torrent is dead, do not bother leeching it because it will stop at 99.6%.

Download the english dubbed version there before it gets taken down. Then you can remux the audio track into Mazui's version if you desire. (Which is why we're all trying to get this torrent anyway isn't it?) 

This copy is appalling otherwise. The picture is poor: possibly upscaled from DVD (fake 720p) 2:3 pulldown has been applied. I.e. 24fps --> 29.970fps - the animation is jerky, plus the subs aren't as good as Mazui. Just stop downloading this at once."
