Sentimental Journey - Ladies of Song Vols 1&II
+improved song selections 320k (musicfromrizzo)

We took this 2 volume offering of Capitol Records "Sentimental Journey -
Ladies of Song" series and added some great tracks while dropping a few
that weren't quite up to standard in respect of the overall offering
which now looks quite edifying and well worth the download by relative
comparison too certainly! It now has 60 songs rather than 51 as in the original

Enjoy some great oldies once more!
