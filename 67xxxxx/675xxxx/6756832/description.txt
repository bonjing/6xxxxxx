The final episode explores dinosaurs' extraordinary ability to survive. 
Featured dinosaurs include the bizarre magyarosaurus, which lived in the 
shadow of the biggest flying animal - hatzegopteryx - and showed an amazing 
adaptation to island life; and the weird nothronychus, a carnivore that gave 
up meat eating.

This astonishing capacity to evolve into ever more diverse and bizarre forms 
meant that dinosaurs not only spread throughout the world, but also dominated 
life upon it for more than 160 million years. It was only an unprecedented 
extraterrestrial event that finally saw the end of planet dinosaur.
