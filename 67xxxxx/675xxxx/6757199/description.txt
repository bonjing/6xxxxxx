The Power of Shazam! is a 1994 hardcover graphic novel, written and painted by Jerry Ordway for DC Comics. The 96-page story, depicting the revamped origins of former Fawcett Comics superhero Captain Marvel, was followed by an ongoing series, also titled The Power of Shazam!, which ran from 1995 to 1999.

I'll be uling the actual series sometime soon.  Although this weekend and early next week will be dedicated to the original Static Shock series by Milestone.

Enjoy and Seed
