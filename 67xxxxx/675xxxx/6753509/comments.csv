,illwrath,2011-10-19T11:41Z,No pinhead. Fake pinhead. Fuck this turgid piece of shit.
,Sunil237,2011-10-19T12:22Z,"3.4 on imdb.... fuck this, pretty much nothing scores this low."
,ashen77,2011-10-19T16:46Z,an insult to the Hellraiser name.
,kotikuja,2011-10-19T17:20Z,"yeah right, i'll pass :/"
,whatever89,2011-10-19T21:19Z,this isn't Doug Bradley playing Pinhead just so people know. The  trailer for this looked horrible. Honestly I refused to watch anymore after #5 was so bad. 
,ikilledsuperman,2011-10-20T01:13Z,"WOW movie reviews from people that know nothing is what I see here. I think I can watch trailers,reviews myself! it would be nice to know wat pic quailty was like or umm oh IDK sound quality, is it realy english spoken language these would all B far more usefull than wat some 3rd grade child thinks of the flick itself. comment on wat matters & do so AFTER you dl the torrent. LEVE THE REVIEWS TO Siskel & Ebert. OR SHUT UP."
,prrspack,2011-10-20T04:07Z,"Seriously, video quality, sound, etc...I don't want your review, and you shouldn't want mine, other than the former go troll elsewhere..."
,zorenzo,2011-10-20T04:43Z,not worth downloading. download at ur own risk

,SOULREAPERDRAGON,2011-12-09T19:05Z,HELLRAISER  it is all about Clive Barker I LOVE YOU
,jcrpost,2012-02-09T06:52Z,"Keep in mind, the y were about to lose rights to Hellraiser, hence the rushed film. Hopefully the long discussed reboot will be worth it. It's always been up and down with Hellraiser. 1 and 2 were amazing, 3 was bad with cheesy pseudo cenobites, 4 was ok,, it had potential, and started strong.. then got retarded in space, 5 was great (I think, the one with the bad cop chasing the ""Engineer"") and had a good story. 6 was so so, I still can't make since of 7 (Deader) I don't even think I've made it through that one paying attention and 8 wasn't even a Hellraiser movie. 

Here's hoping the reboot will bring something good, and for the love of god either have Doug Bradley or no pinhead at all!

I'm gonna watch just to see how bad it is..."
,teamholmez86,2012-05-25T20:27Z,"what the fuck did i just watch ???????? WTF is this piece of shiyt !! this isnt hellraiser that we no and love, its just some dude in a bad halloween costume  !!! lmao :) but thanks for the upload thoe HeroMaster ! :O) great quality
