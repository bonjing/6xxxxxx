Very warm loving movie I would say. The typical recipe, build great, timing perfect, some funny elements and of course a cherry on the cake. Absolutely must see when you want to clear the mind from all daily nasty things, it absorbed me totally. The chemistry between the actors is breath taken, so Scott did not lie one word about that. Then Cassidy, yeah what is there more to say. I cannot describe it in words but will try. She makes the job a craft and every time in anything she plays, she becomes and is that person, never the same. That keeps surprising me and is a joyful ride, out of my live and into the characters. Anywayssss, must see movie.
