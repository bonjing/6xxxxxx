,Ced,2011-10-17T19:16Z,"Come on Coldplay, Rihanna? :( Might as well ask Britney to join, a cheap commercial trick (Princess of China is already in the trashcan)
But apart from that a pretty good album.
Thanks!!!"

,lyly26,2011-10-18T12:54Z,thanks thanks thanks!! :D
,zamszowy,2011-10-18T19:36Z,What @atndigcrk said.
[V],trfkad,2011-10-18T20:52Z,"Well, I'm not going to be politically correct this time.
If a so-called-scene release group wants its tag on a torrent, well they can came here and upload it; if they will be the first, they will have respect and thanks, even from me. 
But I will not give this kind of respect to people who share their (good) work only among themselves; that's why i don't like the ""scene"", that's why i don't like private trackers too.
I know that many of you guys don't agree with me, but i'm an old-school-bastard, i know what i'm doing, and i'm not going to change idea about it, doesn't matter what other people think. 
e quanno ce vÃ² ce vÃ²  ;)"

,2ch.so,2011-11-13T11:04Z,"          Энергичней, чем все прошлые альбомы. Больше «электронщины», чем обычно. Неплохо.
          It’s more energetic then previous albums, and more electonic sounds appeared. Rather good."
,icanexplain,2011-11-29T21:22Z,Thank you!! Good upload
,Ropower,2011-12-07T10:51Z,"Coldplay has so much potential, if only they would do their own thing instead of listening to idiot producers who's only interest is to make money. Overall I would rate this album a 3/10, one or two good songs and the rest are garbage.. this coming from a very big Coldplay fan!"
,guitargamer,2011-12-18T16:41Z,"yes i agree...probably the worst album they made...music is like truth...and here we can see that they just get rich and "" LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME I AM A STAR"" and they just cant develop music as they did before...very very bad album, isnt a matter of opinion is just the way it is, very sad coldplay...get a job"
,joeblowjack,2011-12-20T02:42Z,great album thanks for the upload

,ngiri,2012-01-03T04:16Z,"You should be ashamed of yourself!
To put this kind of filth in the public domain is sick.
Coldplay should be banned."

,Bass_Buddy,2012-01-09T05:30Z,"@ngiri 

You should be ashamed of yourself too, for being a complete asshole to people who actually like Coldplay. To even say something like that is sick. You should go back into your closet and eat your douche nozzles."
