Valentine Warner Eats... - S01 - The 60's






Chef and passionate food lover Valentine Warner turns back the clock to the Swinging Sixties and discovers which dishes were being eaten at home, and at the increasing number of restaurants cropping up on high streets across Britain during the era. 

Through archive footage and face-to-face interviews with the people who were cooking and eating food at the time - the home cooks, dinner party hostesses, school dinner ladies and restaurateurs - Valentine asks if the food we were eating back then really was as bad as everyone remembers, or if the food revolution taking place was sowing the seeds of a nation of food lovers. 

To put his theories to the test, Valentine recreates some of the most iconic and infamous dishes of the decade in his 1960s-themed kitchen. From savoury faves such as cheese straws, avocado & prawn cocktail and quiche Lorraine to delectable desserts such as baked Alaska and Black Forest gateau, it's in Valentine's hands to decide whether the food he's made really has stood the test of time or if it's best left in the past.
