Groove Armada are an English electronic music duo from London, England comprising Andy Cato and Tom Findlay. They are perhaps best known for their singles "I See You Baby" and "Superstylin'".

Groove Armada first formed in the mid-1990s after they had been introduced by Cato's girlfriend and soon started their own club, also called Groove Armada, after a '70s discothÃ¨que

Goodbye Country (Hello Nightclub) is their third studio album . It was released on 11 September 2001 on the Jive Electro record label. The title of the album was meant to differentiate it from the band's previous album, Vertigo, as being more upbeat and less chill-out.

The album features several guest vocalists, including Jeru the Damaja in "Suntoucher", MC M.A.D. in "Superstylin'", Tim Hutton in "Drifted", "Tuning In", and "Join Hands", Richie Havens in "Little by Little" and "Healing", Celetia Martin in "My Friend", Rachael Brown in "Lazy Moon", and Kriminul in "Raisin' the Stakes". The Urban Soul Orchestra appears in "Edge Hill".

The track "Likwid" is a bonus track available only in the enhanced edition.
