,ole_olsen32,2012-01-08T21:35Z,"Download was fast and the game/key worked perfectly.  However, it should be noted that this game has a lot of random bugs.  An hour into the game, a piece from a puzzle that I was working on disappeared when I clicked on it.  Now I can't finish the puzzle or progress in the game.  Several other users have experienced this same glitch as well as many others.  Your best bet is to just pay up and get the patches from Big Fish.  "
,seevee1969,2012-04-29T06:41Z,"There is a delibeRate progress blocking bug built into this game (google ""blue lantern"" bug).  Version 1.2 of this game should not have this bug, available elsewhere on TPB. "
