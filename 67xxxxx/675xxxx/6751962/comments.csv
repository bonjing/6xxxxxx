,DJ411,2011-10-20T18:47Z,"How is this episode 5? What tv episode guide are you following? cause IMDb said this is Ep4 The Runaway and Ep5 is  Bylaw that airs on 31 October 2011

So confusing!@"
,toneloc78,2011-10-20T21:15Z,"The problem seems to be that Fox and IMDB are labeling Genesis as episode 1, while Sky1 is separating it into part 1 and part 2.  
I mistakenly downloaded the wrong episode twice before realizing why the numbers were off."
,pow.r.pop,2011-10-21T18:44Z,"Shit Show.

So stupid I think I retarded myself by watching it.

I just want to see them all ripped to shreds by a Dinosaur  "
,kithylin,2011-10-24T03:38Z,"@japhater & @kakanman: MKV is the defacto-standard now for all high-definition movies, videos, and tv shows transmitted on torrents. it's 5000x superior to AVI in every single way (read the wikipedia pages if you're confused) and people stopped using AVI in like, 2005.

The biggest difference is... mkv supports 5.1, 6.1, and 7.1 channel audio, however AVI only supports 2 channel stereo."
,little_arab,2011-10-24T17:37Z,So is this 4 - The Runaway or 5 - Bylaw?
,nandos421,2011-10-27T02:58Z,Where is ep 6? :(

,gloteron,2011-11-03T20:21Z,Thanks :)))
,prince__vlad,2011-11-08T15:21Z,thx a lot!
,Goldfire1986,2011-11-15T05:11Z,"@kithylin, AVI can support 5.1 with AC3 -.- No idea why you think it's only 2 channel.

The biggest differences between AVI and MKV is the support for H.264/AVC, muxed subtitles and multiple audio support as well as chapters.

Where on earth did you get your information from?"
