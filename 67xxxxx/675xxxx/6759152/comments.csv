,Djcole,2011-10-20T22:17Z,"hey whiteylion85.
i think this one could be the real thing?"
,TrustedQualityRatings,2011-10-20T22:25Z,"Well that was kind of ignorent. I don't think you should be allowed to download, I think some one should be a banner on Pirate Bay.

I will agree though, RAR files are a huge pain in the butt and I hate them alot but I won't go on like this jerk as I am thankful for the Up in the first place."
,gladiatorproduction,2011-10-20T22:35Z,"its the real thing , fairly dark but still watchable"
,podkayne,2011-10-20T22:37Z,Knobends that are frightened of rar files especially when they are listed by 1 of the biggest and most reliable up loaders on the net should be raped to death by rabid chimps. Yes we have all downloaded fake crap both in video file format and separated into rar files. thats what you get for downloading from unkown users. Not from Scenebalance who are 1 of the biggest tv and film up loaders on thepiratebay. You could always pay to see it or to buy the dvd if it upsets you that much.  Raped to death by rabid chimps then raped some more for good luck you moaning shit..
,naynjosh,2011-10-20T22:54Z,"it is legit as its packaged correctly with a proper description, sample and an nfo file. Having to unrar a file isnt so damn hard, thanks for this :)"
,namorax2,2011-10-21T00:21Z,"why do you think rar files are a huge pain in the butt? you just right click, pick extract here, and wait 10 seconds...

much as I hate all the scenespammers, they are always legit even if they are shit quality"
,sarsapil,2011-10-21T00:53Z,"Says 3 seeders, I am downloading and there IS NO SEEDER (0) and coming down very slowly, why upload something you are no going to feed? "
,ILLvatu,2011-10-21T02:01Z,You fucking idiots! unpacking a rar. file is so fucking easy a monkey can do it. Unless your PC is a pile of crap it only a minute to unpack. FYI you can download winrar here too! It will unpack many many forms of compression! Fucking noobs.
