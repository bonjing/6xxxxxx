Alison Weir's ebooks currently available are of variable quality and from what I have checked thus far this would appear to be proper epub files.

I have some brand new historical ebooks (retail quality) which a friend has kindly lent me after removing the drm in calibre. The format is mobi and I will be uploading them shortly.

Hope you can find something of interest.

Regards
Neil"

I spent a some time online looking for Alison Weir books...the best quality stuff ""seems"" to have been removed...empty links...I hope someone out there re-posts. 

Rosie...will have what I can find of A Fraser soon. Very little of Starkey available.

thanks for sharing your books Neil
