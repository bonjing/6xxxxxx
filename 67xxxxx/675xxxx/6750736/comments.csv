,bonnievilleangel,2011-10-18T00:21Z,"I d/l it yesterday from a more reliable source, it's 695MB.  This looks a bit suss..."
,awinahe,2011-10-18T01:19Z,"guys, you can trust this uploader... Charlesfire22 always uploads small files and always of good and great quality... I'm one of his fan since he started uploading. Of course when it's a cam, don't expect dvd!"
,ArtieT,2011-10-20T12:13Z,"bonnieville, please don't make presumptions like 'from a more reliable source'. If you haven't d/l it, you don't know, so keep your uninformed suspicions to yourself! Also read up on 'H264' codec - it has far better compression than your 'reliable' copy's xvid codec (it is used on Blu-ray encodes), and because of that Charles has used it here to give a similar quality in a smaller size. He's done this for many encodes, all of which are fine. Why not check his history, as you should have before posting...?"

With a name like that, i surmise ye are a biker who loves classic Triumph's, prospect, HA with colours or a wannabe, so brother, i will be nice.

ArtieT & awinahe are correct, and if encoded with Quark, the file could be even smaller and same quality as an XviD encode.

Codec is COmpression/DECompression, where players have codecs relevant to encodes which contain a lot of the information which is included in a raw .avi files (Is why raw .avi are so large.), but are elements of file data which are same in every file and also contain, as mentioned, decompression data relevant to the compressor algorithm employed, be that XviD, DivX, h264 MP4, whatever, all the main file information found in a raw .avi which isn't unique to different files, is actaully in the codec, so what data people need to download in order to view a file, is significantly reduced into a basic shell identifying which compressor algorithm has been employed which the player reads when file is loaded for viewing and very compressed video data, because all the main information is contained in the player codec, not the file.

To view, you need a player with relevant codecs, which with these means a codec pack, such as K-Lite, which are free, as well as a suitable player such as VLC or Media Player Classic for instance.

Here's links to those.

K-Lite, you'll only require basic or standard which contains Media Player Classic and a few extras...

VLC - Video LAN Player...

VLC has ability to play most files without a codec pack, but still install the basic codec pack at least.
Small files are good, Fair Use Policies, are FUP's, bandwidth is bandwidth and time is time, not everybody has DSL or Ethernet broadband, some are still on 56k dial ups, smaller files mean less bandwidth and less time to download for everybody, easier for those with slow connections to access files in shorter time to large files, also take up less hard drive space or more files can be burnt to each optical disk, DVD/CD.

Small files are a win/win for everybody, except it seems the Xbox whingers who can't play MP4's, admittedly, older DVD players won't play these either, but all PC's etc will do.
