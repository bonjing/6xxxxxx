,spevman,2011-10-21T01:14Z,"The pre-air is a webrip of the episode off a password protected section of the NBC website.  Links were sent to the site for people who subscribed to the shows Twitter feed.  Look up what pre-air means:

Pre-air episodes are those leaked to the net, the term never refers to something actually broadcast and TV Rage ain't gonna have info for pre-airs because they're not scheduled broadcasts or predictable in their release..."

,s3xt0y,2011-10-22T06:50Z,"@podkayne I couldn't get into game of thrones either, alot of shows are weak story line lots of sex these days."
,99jay88,2011-10-22T08:44Z,I have downloaded this and watched it.  It is the real deal.  It's a good show too.  Pretty creepy.
,spevman,2011-10-22T10:58Z,"@oithatguyoi:  Thanks.  I transcoded the original FLV file to an xvid encoded AVI file (I finally found an efficient and reliable way to get a good encode out of an flv source file).  I was so excited to be able to see this early.  A friend who isn't as computer savvy told me about the preview NBC was offering on their website vie subscribing to the show's Twitter feed.  I'm all a bit misty eyed as I see the file fully making the rounds to all the torrent sites as well as to the many direct download sites I visit every day.  I've now been published on Mukki.tv and RLSLOG...the latter of which even said ""P2P group KPM released a webrip for the pilot of NBCâ€™s new series â€œ Grimmâ€. Airdate is October 28.""

My initials are KPM and someone flattetred me by calling me a P2P release group!  LOL!  I'm just glad I could contribute in some small way to the global entertainment network.  The most notable other thing I'm known for is rips of ""The Janice Dickinson Modeling Agency"" on Oxygen Network!"
,margrave,2011-10-22T19:23Z,the sound gets way off sync any chance someone can fix it?
,DeltaPan,2011-10-22T20:13Z,"I'm downloading smaller elsewhere.

But to sound issue above. 
Use VLC media player, go into the ""Tools"" drop menu, top left hand of player U.I., in player, select ""Track Synchronisation"" and where the box says Video/Audio - ""Advance of audio over video:"".
[ http://www.free-codecs.com/download/VideoLAN.htm ]

Increase, or decrease by two increments (Milliseconds) or more if needed, box will stay on top so can watch faces and speech, whatever, to discern if audio track compensated enough before completing and closing tab.
[I find usual is increase but some are drease, average is two increments but have found a couple have been more in decrease, if  audio track snaps back at some point, just return sync' adjust back to 0.000.]

Standard out of sync countermeasure.

Peace. : )"
,DeltaPan,2011-10-22T20:25Z,"Oh, and shuttle back, curser on file progress bar and move back, scroll wheel reverse, whatever, to catch up on any missed playback while adjusting any out of sync' files.

Obviously, if ye restart from beginning, send stop/start command, ye'll have to adjust sync' again.

Peace. : )"
