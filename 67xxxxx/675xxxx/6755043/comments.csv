its extremly easy to disable subtitles, with just a few clicks of your mouse, do a little reading if your not sure how. VLC is the best media player and to disable subs in VLC click VIDEO - SUBTITLE TRACK - DISABLE, 

thanks for these high quality rips "
,bryentheartist,2011-10-20T16:05Z,i burn these to dvd so not so easy! why put subs on english show with english subs any how? 
,Rosechu,2011-10-20T20:58Z,"bryen, just don't download the subs file if they bother you.  Did you think that perhaps people with hard of hearing like to download Shameless too?"
,bryentheartist,2011-10-21T06:55Z,where can i get it without subs please:)
,BoonesFerry,2011-10-21T07:50Z,"@bryentheartist   What app/program are you using to burn the .mkv file to dvd?

For example: I use an app called ConverXtoDVD and I can disable/remove the subtitle stream using the setup options so that there are NO subtitles burned to the dvd. I'm guessing that your app also capable of this. Or when playing the DVD on your DVD player look for the subtitle on/off setting or find the subtitle button on the DVD remote control. 

p.s. You're being an ungreatful little prick. You should educate yourself on the use of your DVD burning app. Even though you are being a prick I am willing to try and help. If you tell me what app you are using to burn the mkv to dvd then I will try to find a setting within the app that will allow you to burn to dvd without the subtitles. "
