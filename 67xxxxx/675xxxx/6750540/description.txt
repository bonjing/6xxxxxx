Desperate for Answers

On Dec. 21, 1997, University of Colorado senior Susannah Chase was brutally beaten and left for dead in an alleyway just blocks from her home. After eight years, the case is cold and remains unsolved. Desperate to find answers, Susannah's family asks detectives to reach out to two gifted psychics who work quietly with police departments around the country - Pam Coranado and Laurie Campbell. Can these two women use their exceptional skills to re-examine the case and provide new clues to point police in new directions? Can they actually "sense" murder? The pilot follows our two psychics as they work with the Boulder, Colo., police department.
