        Release Notes:
        ______________________________________________________________________________

        The Lab, NRK's mix series devoted to the world's most cutting edge
        DJs and forward thinking sounds, returns this Autumn with an
        instalment compiled and mixed by undoubtedly one of the scene's most
        talented, charismatic and brightest stars.

        Hailing from the suburbs of Detroit, Seth Troxler has made an
        incredible journey over the last few years, from the local DJ spots
        at DetroitÃ†s The Works club and behind the counter service at the
        famous Melodies & Memories record store, to the most top drawer
        nights and clubs across the world, such as Fabric, Panorama Bar,
        DC10, The Rex et al. With a youthful enthusiasm and leftfield charm,
        Seth has become a huge favourite of clubbers and party freaks, so
        much so that he was voted the 3rd most popular DJ in Resident
        Advisor's poll for 2010. But behind the public perception of
        Troxler, he is seriously dedicated and passionate about quality
        underground electronic music, taking giant leaps with his latest
        Visionquest project, a collective of friends and fellow artists such
        as Ryan Crosson, Shaun Reeves and Lee Curtis. His productions and
        collaborations with esteemed artists like Deetron, Matthew Dear and
        Tiefschwarz, and labels like Crosstown Rebels, Circus Company, Wolf
        & Lamb and Wagon Repair show an artist deeply in tune with the
        cutting edge electronic music that endeavours to push the envelopes
        of dance music.

        It may be a cliche, but Troxler's The Lab definitely has to be heard
        to be believed, his talents are evident as he effortlessly blends
        many different styles but always keeping a strong continuity and
        sounding like no other DJ on the planet right now.

        And so onto the music, and it is here that Troxler really excels on
        this double mix project. Disc One is a decidedly deep affair,
        opening up with the smooth and atmospheric sounds of Hatikvan and
        Bearweasel, before finding a solid and luscious groove with tracks
        from David Alvarado, Lindstrom, Tommy Bones and Dinky.  The vibe
        starts to get a little freaky with the classic DBX/Moritz Von Oswald
        collaboration 'City On the Edge Of Forever' which in turn sends the
        mix journey to more minimal experimentation and a tougher mood,
        ushering in some great music from Daze Maxim, DJ Qu and David
        Durango and closing the half with the psychedelic sounds of
        Masomenos.

        Disc Two picks up right where the first left off, and a little skit
        featuring techno legend Kenny Larkin captured on a telephone call
        introduces a mind boggling segue of tracks that effortlessly  blends
        ultra deep minimalism, dubby low slung vocal tracks, freeform jazz
        workouts, otherworldly and psychedelic electronics and cowboys &
        Indians inspired tech-house (check Und's Rodeo, truly magnificent
        fun!).  Amongst the forward thinking producers featured here include
        Ricardo Villalobos & Martin, Deniz Kurtel, Oni Ayhun and Ryan
        Crosson.  Disc Two is probably where Troxler would position himself
        in, say , a DC10 Ibiza set, and the music gets bigger and more
        panoramic as the mix takes in some immense music from Dinky,
        Lawrence, Chaim and Superpitcher.  The set ends suitably with a rare
        Andrew Weatherall mix of Radioactive Man, and a superb, as yet
        unreleased, Visionquest new signing from Dinky.

        Troxler truly adopts the brief of The Lab, and experiments with many
        records, creating a thing of beauty and definitely a mix that will
        stand the test of time.
