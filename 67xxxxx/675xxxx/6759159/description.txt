   7 couples are brought together by chance.   
   They will face each other's past, present   
   and future."A happy couple is happy in the  
   same way while an unhappy couple is unhappy 
   in its own way"- Leo Tolstoy. Basically a   
   drama, movie breaks down a number of        
   stereotypes prevalent in our society. No    
   emotion is ever pure. No right is totally   
   right. No truth is whole truth. There is    
   always some negativity to it. There are     
   always some shades to it. There are always  
   some shades of grey.
