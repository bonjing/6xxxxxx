World of Warcraft 2.4.3 TBC enUS client torrent for Tru-WoW, the Strictly Blizzlike Server
Uploaded and initially seeded by Kedama (with some help from Cloros)

This client is pre-installed. It requires absolutely NO patching or installing (Aside from moving it to the folder of your choice).

Steps to play:
1. Make an account at www.Tru-WoW.com
2. Execute WoW.exe in this folder (NOT LAUNCHER.EXE)
3. Accept the terms of the EULA.
4. Write in the info for the account you created.
5. Play!



I've also included a quick way to delete your cache folder. Inside the folder, there is a file called "DelCache.bat". Executing this will clear out your cache folder simply and easily. Make a shortcut to it on your desktop for easy access.

Please seed and keep this going!
