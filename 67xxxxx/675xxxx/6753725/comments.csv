,ChRoNo16,2012-01-07T04:51Z,Virus found in Launcher.exe  Whats the deal here?
,Kedama,2012-01-13T04:10Z,"@ChRoNo16 What antivirus are you using? Id recommend scanning it with other antiviruses before proclaiming it as a virus automatically. And when your antivirus detects a virus, it isnt ALWAYS a virus. Anyways, you tecnically dont even need launcher.exe, you can safely delete that and the game will work just fine."

2mb/s.

no problems with launcher.exe at all

Server is the best, just like playing retail when it was good

A++++"
,guimontag,2012-01-20T21:56Z,"For the people having problems, you need to use Wow.exe NOT launcher.exe.

actually just delete launcher.exe, its useless"
,Squittlez,2012-01-27T03:32Z,Best Burning Crusade server i've played on. 
,bood3e,2012-02-06T18:49Z,Yo smolderforge.com is the shit. It's the best working 2.4.3 server with high population.
