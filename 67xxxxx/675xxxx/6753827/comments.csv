,TheLagosChap,2011-11-20T15:20Z,"Yes, looks like, according to tv.com, the episode 6 is missing in this torrent:

Season 2, Episode 6 â Aired: 7/13/2011
Are There Parallel Universes?

?"
,LJE111,2011-11-23T19:07Z,Also missing ep 11... there were 11 episodes in season 2 and this only goes through ep 9.

,beliha1,2012-01-05T17:46Z,"This is 720p! :) 

To the uploader: you should always mark your HD videos with the tag 720p or 1080p, because some people - like me - only download HD documentaries!!

Thanks!"
,Zirown,2012-01-22T21:39Z,"""Are There Parallel Universes"" was actually a part of another series called ""Curiosity"" where Morgan Freeman hosted that particular episode."
,indyaries,2012-03-04T21:01Z,"The link to The Science Channel only shows 9 episodes for Season 2.  Thanks, uploader!!

,thekentman,2012-04-27T22:40Z,Is it HD?
,cybercar,2012-05-29T06:00Z,"Thanks dude, all in 720p :)"
,zencoder,2012-06-01T08:57Z,"Great Copy Thanks for Uploading.  Just remember this is entertainment, not education.  For instance the God Helmet in Season 1 Episode 1 ... just doesn't work.  Legitimate scientists have tried to replicate his results and found the helmet does absolutely nothing.  Its just the power of suggestion and sensory deprivation at work.   :("
