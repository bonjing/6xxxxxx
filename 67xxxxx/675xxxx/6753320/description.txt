The Definitive Bing Crosby collection 320k CD (remastered) (musicfromrizzo)

Remastered from original recordings this is billed as a definitive
collection of Bing Crosby songs for a single CD offering. Theres
certainly some truth to that however we have 5Gigs of Crosby mp3
to sort through before we offer a comprehensive enough collection
for his most serious fans. Enjoy this great man's singing too
