Description:
A little baby was abandoned by his parents, and one fine day a dragon found a cradle near his door. He took the helpless creature into his home, raised it and taught it his wisdom and his magic. When the little Roszondas grew up, he learned how to use the dragon magic against the evil creatures populating the land. He was a brave warrior, but in one of his battles he was killed. His soul found a reincarnation, and this reincarnation is you. You find your tower invaded by zombies and other awful creatures. You have to fight the evil once again.

Bonus content: music, patch.
To emphasize the dark and mysterious scene of "Gorasul: Legacy of the Dragon", two songs of the Middle-Ages band Corvus Corax have been implemented in the game due to a co-op with Falcone Music. The songs Die Klage and Filii Neidhardi are from Corvus Corax' actual CD.
