,aParadox,2011-10-30T23:35Z,Thanks!  I love rifftrax.
,pigpen123a,2011-11-30T20:13Z,"Well I DON'T love jerico_cane, .... there are a bunch of stupid audio additions that add nothing to the story, ... the intended added humor fails miserably! There must be at least ONE decent unaltered version on PB !!"
,stimpj,2011-12-01T09:47Z,"^ lmao, douche bag"
,pigpen123a,2011-12-02T03:35Z,"Partial retraction of my harsh critique: according to his note there is a second sound track which, after converting the file to DVD is selectable. Still, the buffoonish one is the default one sad to say. So it's a qualified ""thanks anyway"" and please go play elsewhere. "
,TheShizknitt,2011-12-02T04:35Z,"Yikes. You're an idiot, PIGPEN. 

Let me explain it for you: RIFFTRAX means there is going to be commentary that RIFFS the movie. You don't like it because you're apparently not that smart. If you were as intelligent as you were attempting to make yourself sound in your overly unnecessary comment, you would have made the observation that you were not downloading the file you were looking for. 

Oh well, c'est la vie."
,pigpen123a,2011-12-02T17:34Z,"Right then Shiz, your attempt at flaming will reinforce my warning to others considering D/L of this complication, ... that being done I'm gone bye-bye "
,jericho_cane,2011-12-06T23:22Z,This complication will delight many users who *aren't* barely sentient retards :)
,deejayc02,2011-12-12T03:43Z,the audio is replace with some random voice-overs...crap.
,jericho_cane,2011-12-13T08:48Z,^ case in point
,7f1pd0,2012-01-21T00:14Z,"Are you people new?  Rifftrax - google it.  Jeez.

Also, learn to maybe read the torrent descriptions before downloading.  I know, it's a lot to ask, but put in that extra effort before throwing a hissy fit.

THANK YOU FOR THE RIFFTRAX, btw :)"
