Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was released at an important moment in film history -- namely, the last moment when actor Rupert Grint (aka Ron Weasley) could say "I will definitely be in two more films." There is a version of this movie thatâ€™s about a prince who accidentally donated half his blood in a drive at work, and Harry Potter keeps chasing that guy and saying "Hey, you donated too much blood, come back here you dang Half-Blood Prince!" Unfortunately that version exists only in the mind of a stoned guy who read the title and collapsed in such a giggle fit that it took three Best Buy employees to drag him out of the store.

Mike, Kevin, and Bill put on their favorite "Dumbledore 4 Life" and "Albus will NEVER die" t-shirts for this one; please savor their exquisite heartbreak and join them for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince!
