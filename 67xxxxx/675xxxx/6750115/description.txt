The.Walking.Dead.S02E01.What.Lies.Ahead.480p.WEB-DL.x264-mSD [MKV 519MB]

[/b][/color] The Walking Dead is an American post-apocalyptic horror television series developed for television by Frank Darabont and based on the ongoing comic book series, The Walking Dead, by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore and Charlie Adlard.
The Walking Dead tells the story of the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse; it follows a small group of survivors, traveling across the desolate United States in search of a new home away from the shuffling hordes of the undead (or "walkers"). The group is led by Rick Grimes, who was a sheriff's deputy in a small Georgia town before the zombie outbreak.
As their situation grows more hazardous, the group's desperation to survive pushes them to the brink of insanity.
At every turn they are faced with the unbearable horrors that come from having the dead walk again, the changing dynamic of their group, as well as facing hostility from the scattered remains of a struggling human populace who are focused on their own survival, now that the structures of global society have collapsed.
