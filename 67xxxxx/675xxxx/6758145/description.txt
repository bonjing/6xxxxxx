OpenELEC 1.0 Released
Written by Stephan Raue

After more than two years of constant development and a year of open beta testing, the team of the OpenELEC Project are pleased to announce OpenELEC Version 1.0
OpenELEC LogoOpenELEC is an embedded Linux distribution that aims to allow people to use their Home Theatre PC (HTPC) in the same manner as any other device attached to your TV - like a DVD player or Sky box. Turn on your box, and OpenELEC is ready and waiting in less than 10 seconds - as fast as some DVD players. A simple remote control is all you will need. On top of that, one need not worry about updating OpenELEC, as the software will self-update automatically when connected to the Internet and an update is available. Installing OpenELEC takes less than 5 minutes and requires zero Linux experience. After that, one need merely add oneâ€™s media files and preferred addons, and OpenELEC will 'just work.'
