He has also recorded three solo albums with the Jim Cuddy Band, which features musicians Bazil Donovan, Colin Cripps, Joel Anderson, Anne Lindsay and Gavin Brown. Guest performers include Cripps' wife Kathleen Edwards, former Weeping Tile member Sarah Harmer, and Wilco's Jeff Tweedy.

Jim is married to Canadian actress Rena Polley.[1] They have three children: Devin (born 1987), Emma (born 1988), and Sam (born 1992).

His brother Loftus Cuddy was a Conservative candidate for the riding of Toronto-Danforth in the 2004 Canadian federal election.[1]

Jim Cuddy attended North Toronto Collegiate Institute for high school. He also went to Upper Canada College.

In the 2004 edition of Canada Reads, Cuddy advocated for Guy Vanderhaeghe's novel The Last Crossing, which won the competition. In the 2007 edition of Canada Reads, an "all-star" competition pitting the five winning advocates from previous years against each other, Cuddy returned to champion Timothy Taylor's novel Stanley Park.
