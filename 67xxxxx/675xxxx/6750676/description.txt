While still in his teens in the mid 1990s, Jonny Lang exploded onto the national scene with a combination of highly developed blues guitar chops and a powerful voice that rivaled some musicians more than twice his age. And that was just the beginning. Fifteen years and a half-dozen studio albums later, he has evolved into a seasoned musician and a road-savvy showman capable of delivering powerful live performances on his home soil and just about every other continent on the globe.

On April 20, 2010 Concord Records captures that passion and energy with the release of Live at the Ryman, Lang's first record since 2006's Turn Around, which earned him a GrammyÂ® Award for Best Gospel Album. Recorded at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee, in the summer of 2008, Live at the Ryman, Lang's first-ever live recording, offers a compelling glimpse of a young guitarist at the height of his creative powers, yet still open to exploring the depth and range of the blues and its relationship to R&B;, soul, rock, gospel, funk and so may other emotionally riveting forms of music.

Backed by the five-man crew of guitarist/vocalist Sonny Thompson, keyboardist Tommy Barbarella, bassist Jim Anton, drummer Barry Alexander and percussionist/vocalist Jason Eskridge, Lang burns through a dozen songs first heard on studio albums dating back to 1997. This time, though, the songs heat up in the kind of pressure-cooker setting that can only take shape in the vibrant Nashville club scene.
