,JGrnly,2011-11-01T19:08Z,"@""Grim Reaper"" why bother commenting when all it reveals is how much of a whiney shit you are? Go suck your mummy's tit.

Thanks catflap. I will happily take a manageable 700mb over several gigs of ""HD"" anytime.

[V],catflap,2011-11-02T04:42Z,"it's labeled correctly because it was
recorded from the BBC-HD channel

anyway, scene rules apply ONLY to
scene members. i'm not in the scene
and i don't adhere to scene rules.

nuking can only be done by scene members
for scene releases only.

as i'm not in the scene and do not adhere
to scene rules, none of my files can
ever be nuked by anyone, or for any reason.

stupid n00bs think they have a clue. they don't.
when they have more than 15 years of
p2p experience (as I have); when 
they have a decade as a VIP or MOD
on several p2pwebsites (as I do); and
when they have years of tech, p2p, multimedia
journalism (provable - as I do) then i might
care what they say.

maybe. but probably not.

@JGrnly:
it's very good, but a little weird. :)"
