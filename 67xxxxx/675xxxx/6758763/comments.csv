i always thought the same time. i mean, as i would watch the show most of the time, all i could think was how well it would fit as a comic, in structure, comic timing, everything.  

aww fuck it, ill just buy the rights and write it myself. it'll be ""chew"" in art style and classic  pushing daisies detective style in story. can't wait"
