Automotive Technology: Principles, Diagnosis, and Service, Fourth Edition, meets the needs for a comprehensive book that covers all eight areas of automotive service, plus the soft skills and tool knowledge that must also be taught.  Because many automotive systems are intertwined, presenting all systems together in one text makes it easier for the student to see how they are all connected.  Topics are divided into 133 short chapters, which makes it easier for instructors and students to learn and master the content.
