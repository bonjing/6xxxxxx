The CD is called The Platters All Time Greatest Hits and its remastered
as well as 320k thank goodness

Ive just been improving on the tracks in another 4CD collection of oldies
I'm posting soon and am finding tracks that need to be upgraded, and 
that's how I came across this offering of the Platters which certainly
includes any songs of theirs we use in the multi CD sets of Oldies we 
will make available of as we go along.
