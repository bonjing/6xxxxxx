I always prefer a 'complete' pack as it is tidier and takes up less space on utorrent, so much appreciated by myself and by those who are too lazy to even thank you for your efforts.

Take care
Neil"
[V],neil1966hardy,2011-10-20T20:15Z,PS. The quality is top draw!

My torrents are created so even a weekly post of an episode you will end up with 1 folder with all 6 eps inside.

Far better to keep a tidy PC and only have 1 torrent to seed rather than 6 "
