Top tourist attractions, department stores, your very own homeâ€”no place is safe from bedbugs. Are you prepared if they strike?
Donâ€™t let the bed bugs bite! Spot them early. Take Action. And get on with your life. This is a must have handbook for every homeowner, renter, landlord, and traveler.
Bed bugs were believed to have been eradicated by DDT and organophosphates in the 1950s, but they are now reaching epidemic levels. Some cities have seen a 1000% increase in bed bug infestations in the last year. 

Exterminators were unprepared for the resurgence of these tiny pests and the public is now scrambling for information on how they spread and how to get rid of them. The Bed Bug Book has the answers. Based on years of hands on experience, a bed bug expert tells you how to spot bed bugs in your home, hotel, or on the go (they look like poppy seeds), how to identify a bed bug bite (itâ€™s not a mosquito bite, sorry), and most importantly, the steps you must take to get rid of these pests. How do you detect them? How do you choose a Pest Management Company? How much will it cost? Includes 104 essential things to know about bed bugs, handy tips for travelers (hotels are a common hideout for these critters), advice on buying vintage and second hand goods, what to expect when the exterminators come, and how to protect yourself against future infestations (bed bug-proof covers are now available for many mattresses). Includes first hand case studies of bed bug encounters by the author. Includes green methods and environmentally-friendly solutions.
Remember, bed bugs can affect anyoneâ€”from newborns to the elderly, everyone is at risk. 50 color illustrations
