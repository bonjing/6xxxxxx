ReleaseNotes:

Candlebox's self-titled debut starts off with the thunderous drumbeats of "Don't You" to get the listener ready for a wonderful ride through the slow to fast, soft to loud songs that encompass Kevin Martin's raw, spine tingling vocals along with Peter Klett's brilliant and distinct guitar work. Next is "Change", which is a great break-up song (from personal experience), followed by the anti-drug anthem "You". "Far-behind" is a classic whose lyrics are many times taken for granted. "Arrow" is a flat out rocker with heavy guitars. "Rain", all 6:58 min, shows the bands musical range, that includes a funky-groove complimented by Martin's singing style and some screeching guitar solos. The CD wraps up perfectly with two amazing acoustic songs, "Cover Me" and "He Calls Home". "Cover Me" starts off with a great
acoustic riff and then totally explodes into the chorus. "He Calls Home" is a bit softer with a circling chorus. Just when you think the song is over, Kevin Martin's voice soars for one more minute to wrap up the album.
