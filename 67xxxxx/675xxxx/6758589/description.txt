Here's a video of Loverboy, live in Vancouver, around 1983.  Enjoy!

Technical: torrent is a rip of a VHS tape.  It's coded to a single file, DivX compatible, 640x480, about 1kbps, with MP3 audio.  The tape was NTSC with 3:2 pulldown so, inverse telecine was applied and the resulting framerate is 23.976 fps (no worries - file will play fine in mPlayer, DivX player, Windows Media Player with DivX codec installed, etc).  JPG scans of the front and back tape covers are also included.
