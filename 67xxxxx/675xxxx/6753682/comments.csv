,geetard,2011-10-22T03:57Z,"I also had that problem. I think it's due to the fact you probably already had a prior version installed and the old license key is still kept in the registry.

Simply uninstall VisualSVN, go to regedit and inside HCU delete the VisualSVN tree. Re-install it, re-apply the crack and you should be fine!"
