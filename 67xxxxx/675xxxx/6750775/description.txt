 Bhagat was born in British India during     
 the year 1908. As a child he witnessed      
 numerous atrocities committed on fellow     
 Indians by their British rulers, who came   
 to trade under the guise of the East India  
 Company, but ended up controlling most of   
 the nation, and permitting tyrants such as  
 General Dyer to massacre thousands of       
 innocent men, women and children in         
 Jallianwala Baug. As a child he was         
 impressed by Mohandas K. Gandhi,
