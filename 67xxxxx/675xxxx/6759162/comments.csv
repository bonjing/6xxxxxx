[V],mirogster,2011-10-28T00:11Z, @Masterzilla Converting flv sucks. It's like trying to  make from mp3 68 kbps some nice flac or ogg =just undoable. Flv is lossy compression :( 
[V],Masterzilla,2011-10-28T01:57Z,"Just check them out, did the 2 passes, upgraded audio a bit and it looks pretty nice. It will be up in 2 mins :)"
