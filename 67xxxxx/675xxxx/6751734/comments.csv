,unRheal,2011-11-01T05:39Z,"as toneloc78 over on eztv's S01E05 720p said:
The problem seems to be that Fox and IMDB are labeling Genesis as episode 1, while Sky1 is separating it into part 1 and part 2.

So arguing about it won't help if yer both right, depending on what station you watch. Maybe people should start including the episode TITLE too? ;) "
