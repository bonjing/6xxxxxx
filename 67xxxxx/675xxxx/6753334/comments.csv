,HARV3ST,2011-10-24T12:43Z,"Can confirm that this works, using it at the moment to dodge the Battlefield 3 region lock -- previously it said October 27th but now thanks to this i have selected a S.Korean IP address and it says 25th at 4am. Thank you, Platinum Hide IP! Will pay for this when i have money."
,panchonini,2011-10-31T18:58Z,"Thanks for this,I've just downloaded it and it seems to work, however as far as getting back in to block sites all the ip's i have tried the site says have been registered as spam and so will not work. any one have any suggestions?"
,beto69slb,2011-11-16T13:30Z,Hi All . All these programs Works fine...BUT..Thers a Big Problem..I Have 50 megas conect FIRBE and ALL this programs makes Computers Internet Extremely SLOW! Some Pages dont even open because of slow speed! Useless! 
,TBear420,2011-12-17T18:36Z,"Works great, internet speed barely slowed.. if you're having internet speed problems try upgrading your service from minimum 500kbs to a 1.5M cheap ass "
,TBear420,2011-12-18T05:31Z,"to make a correction to my semi asinine comment earlier: i checked a few of the IPs against the blacklists and found several of the designated IPs to be associated as spam for the more than most of them. 
 Solution, choose another location lol problem solved?"
