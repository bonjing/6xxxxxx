,Yamaha145,2011-12-13T17:20Z,"Hey Slick thx for everything you do you keep us all up to date. I was just hoping you might be able to get the  The Great Outdoors 10 (2011)... Anyways, thanks a ton man!"
,slicknick610,2012-01-11T22:48Z,I didn't buy Great Outdoors 10 and idk if I will. It is the same as the Moto: Inside the Outdoors and it has less footage. If I did buy it idk if I am posting DVDrips anymore. I have kind of grown a conscience about them. These guys like Troy Adamitis work hard on them and I feel bad.
