In The Adventures of Tintin: The Game, play as Tintin, the intrepid
reporter and hero of the action-packed movie The Adventures of Tintin
directed by Steven Spielberg. Developed in close collaboration with the
filmmaking team, the video game offers an authentic immersion into the
movie's enchanting environments and characters

Players will experience non-stop action and adventure as they investigate
the mystery of a lifetime that may lead them to one of the greatest sunken
treasures. But the quest won't be easy and players will need to join forces
with the quick-witted dog Snowy and the grumpy Captain Haddock to beat
greedy art collectors, kooky arms dealers, and other crooks to reveal the
truth behind the Secret of the Unicorn ship

Play as Tintin, Snowy, Captain Haddock or three other unlockable
characters, each with their own personality and skills

Travel the world and discover more than 20 environments from the movie
and beyond, such as Captain Haddock's ship the Karaboudjan, the moonlit
deserts of the northern Sahara, the exotic city of Bagghar, and more

Play solo and relive major moments of the movie through a variety of
gameplay, from platforming to sword fighting to flying a plane

Share the fun in 2-player co-op mode: play together with your friends
to help solve the mysteries! Experiment with your characters' new skills
collect treasures, earn disguises and unlock new maps

Compete in Challenge Mode: For a little extra competition, play against
AI in specific challenges

More than 20 hours of gameplay

Pilot a plane through a rumbling tempest, drive a side-car in desert
canyons, swim through underwater caves, sword-fight a 17th century knight
and solve puzzles on the trail of an incredible treasure, and more! Plus
play in the present and past as you discover various clues from Captain
Haddock's ancestors

Play the game adventure with your whole body or through intuitive
gestures using PLAYSTATION MOVE or KINECT. The game can also be enjoyed
without the Playstation Move motion controller or the Kinect sensor

Developed in close collaboration with the filmmaking team for over a
year and a half, the video game features high-quality graphics
environments, characters and gameplay in line with the movie's innovative
graphics and production"
