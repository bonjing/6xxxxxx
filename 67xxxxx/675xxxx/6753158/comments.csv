,I-Love-Quinta,2011-10-18T14:50Z,"@nic-h sometimes you'll have to copy the crack to the sims 3 original folder and not to the sims 3 pets folder, but i dont know. I havent downloaded it yet"

,cocoaphonic,2011-10-18T16:17Z,"It's legit; I got it to install fine, and start up with the new loading screens and everything.

However, once I got to the city-selection screen, it says that my disc can't be verified, that I should contact tech support, and shut down my game.

Now, this might be because I did not install Origin when the option came up... if not, it's a problem with the crack, although I can't see what; if the crack itself had been broken, my game wouldn't have started at all, right?"
,cocoaphonic,2011-10-18T16:19Z,"In any case, I'm going to re-install it WITH Origin (ugh) to see if that fixes it."

,sparky2706,2011-10-18T17:57Z,"The reason its so slow is that people are downloading and not seeding, there was 4 seeds at one point however now thankfully its getting up to speed, phew!! :D"
,sparky2706,2011-10-18T17:59Z,For everyone who is downloading this and using the crack i will be purchasing this game myself when it comes out here on the 20 or 21st i believe and ill upload a mini disc image for everyone so they dont have to use those god awful cracks :D
,Green-Banana,2011-10-18T18:03Z,"Well they can't seed it if they can't download it, otherwise they have nothing to share.  There are plenty of peers, the problem is not enough connections are opening among each users.  "
,chantal4191,2011-10-18T18:04Z,"Why is it so slow ?? This is the only torrent who is getting sooooo slow ... It is not a problem of my computer ... How is this possible ?

,cocoaphonic,2011-10-18T19:16Z,"Okay, I installed it with my internet off as someone suggested, and it worked just fine! Going to see if I can still play it with my internet connection turned on after installing. Either way, I'll notify you guys."

,TehSalade,2011-10-18T19:21Z,"Well, I have a piss poor connection. My internet provider says I'm getting the highest speed yet at most I get is 120 Mbs. Right now my speed is 4.3 Mbs, with the max of 25.4mbs. and....ooooh it jumped to 58.9. If it stays at this I'll have it done in a couple of days....but I doubt it"
,Kisaro,2011-10-18T19:35Z,"i found the legit solution.
be sure that you put the crack in your normal The Sims 3 Folder and not in the pets folder!"

,Green-Banana,2011-10-18T19:45Z,"Eh...I'm not apt to believe my ETA right now.  It says I have to wait a week, yet I have a pretty good DL speed right now at approz 150 kbs (it fluctuates, but usually the ETA keeps up).  "
,mrskirs,2011-10-18T19:53Z,"@Kazehaya Well, I did. I know it didn't last more than an hour and a half. After 2 hours I was seeding for all of you, I still am.

,mrskirs,2011-10-18T19:58Z,"For people who have problems running the game, remember you have to put the crack in the BASE game folder, not in the expansion folder. I solved this problem thanks to the explanations of Games4theworld..."

When you're installing it, it will ask for a serial key, a key generator is inside of the .iso you just mounted, it's in the folder FAIRLIGHT, when you're done installing, you go to the same FAIRLIGHT folder, and you go inside the folder inside it and inside that is another folder and you go in that too (forgot what they're called, but theres only one folder)
In there there are two files, copy them and paste them in
C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\Bin
Don't copy them in the pets folder, just the normal sims folder.

And when that's all done you can just unmount the .iso and delete it or seed it, you also have to have your internet off when it's installing.

First just recrack the game and see if this fixes your crashes if not you now have to reinstall the game I know it stinks but this is the only way to fix it make sure all the sims 3 pet stuff is deleted including registry before reinstalling move the custom content ( I rar mine then delete my mod folder and then I can easily restore my mods)then check generation to make sure its working correctly then reinstall pets check game first then move custom content see if this works I myself would test this but still have 5-6 hours left I know the sims 3 has some odd bug with this and with every expansion you are suppose to move the custom content before

1.Make sure you have something to mount the file. I suggest magic disk.... 
http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-magicdisc-overview.htm?=mdisc_hlp106
2. Run Magicdisk. Icon will show up on task bar. right click it, set number of drivers to atleast one. rightcick magicdisk again, click virtual cd/dvd-rom and browse for the file flt-ts3p which you just downloaded...
3.it should have an autorun window that pops up...
4.go through the installation process
5. Keygen is in Fairlight folder. which you can find by opening your computer folder and looking for your virtual drive you just created...right click that and open.
6.After installed get the file in Fairlight-game-bin and move them to C:-Programs Files(86x)-Electronic Arts-Sims 3-GAme-Bin
copy and replace is always what i do....




I hope this helps.....i am not sure if this torrent even works because i have yet to get past the autorun window. but if you are luckier than me just follow my steps and vola'"
,masterjedi170,2011-10-19T19:41Z,"I am download at a  good speed so let me discuss few things with you.

For all of those that never mounted or w.e reason you can use daemon tools or poweriso.  What we mean about mounting is that we use a fake made up drive to mount the game on to the drive.  In other words we are trying to tell the computer we have a cd.  

For those that haven't installed, please dont download ea manager.  It should not be downloaded no matter what.  It will ask you again before you start the game.  Click cancel!

As i said in other torrents, i have downloaded the sims 3 from pirate bay and i was able to download all of the expansion up to date till now.  I dont remember which sims i downloaded but there is one working.  Also the previous expansion back asked me for cd verification.  All i did is mount the sims ambitions using poweriso and it let me played the game fine.  I personally dont like cracking the game and i dont mind mounting the game everytime i have to play.

Once again i want to thank you all the seeders and please dont get greedy to those that dont seed.  While you play seed for us, thats the only way you can say thank you for the torrent.  Happy playing!"

You need to get rid of any Mods, Custom Content and other downloads before installing a new expansion pack. You can replace them after installing the pack.

If that doesn't fix anything, delete the Caches in your Sims 3 folder in your My Documents."

Ok so for those people yes you have to have the sims 3 game before you install this.  Lets call the sims 3 base since its the main game.  The rest are expansion packs such as this one and others on pirate bay.  Whatever you do please do not download ea manager.  Its going to be asking a lot and  probably be checked mark for you to install it.  Uncheck it or cancel it.  
Ea manager is a program that  checks for updates and anything install that is extra.  Which is why if you want to install other expansion packs it must not be install.

In other expansion packs they may ask please provide ""the sims 3 *****"" (*any expansion) to install updates.  If any errors come up or it says your version isn't compatible i suggest you download another Sims 3. "
,masterjedi170,2011-10-21T02:22Z,"I am finally done with the downloading.  So this works 100% and its fun.  When you install games i highly reccomend you disconnecting the internet.  Once you do that i did install Origin, just testing it to see if it will block me.  So far its not giving me any problem and i did not crack the game!  All i did is mount it and it works.  Like i said previous i never crack games, all i do is mount i dont mind doing that.  Ill see for a while happy simming!"
,lazzybum,2011-10-21T02:24Z,"[[[FAQ]]] 

Q: Do you need TS3 Base game?
A: Yes. All Expansion Packs will need the base game. Therefore you can't play this alone.

Q: I get the ""Disc Authorization Failure"" message.
A: The Game Folder that you need to replace is the Sims 3 Folder, not Sims 3 Pets Folder. I made this mistake xD

Q: How to mount?
A: I used Daemon Tools Lite. There are tutorials out there if you are new to torrents.

Q: Is this legit? Does it work?
A: Yes! I just installed. DL took 2 in a half hours.

Q: Wheres the Keygen/Fairlight Folder?
A: I use PowerISO to see what is inside the ISO file. It is always located in the ISO file.

Q: SEED MAOR PLZ?!!
A: stfu. This is not helping but spamming the comments section."

,ttena,2011-10-21T17:56Z,"Okay, I have a great new laptop with a high quality graphics card but the game kept crashing wheneever I tried to choose a household and start playing. 
I searched around everywhere to find a solution and tried several things, it finally helped.
1. If you installed The Sims 3 Pets Demo, get rid of it. It's the major cause for crashing as I've heard. 
2. Reinstall your full game as well after getting rid of the demo
3. Try the game. If it still crashes after removing Pets Demo, try deleting all mods and caches in your game folder in your documents (My Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 3 etc by default if I'm correct)
4. Try the game again. In the future, be sure to download mods that are updated for the new patch. You can search for The Sims 3 Overwatch mod, it's updated for the last patch. It helps with the game performance. If it still crashes, try..
5. DEP list. You can find it under your control panel/system/advanced settings/performance settings/data execution prevention. Set it to ""Turn on DEP for all programs and services except... etc"" and add all your sims exe files (not only base game, but also the expansion packs) to the list below.
6. Also, I don't know if that actually helped or not but try playing in windowed mode as the last solution

I hope you'll all get it to work eventually!"

But then having uninstalled and re-installed 5 times, my boyfriend helped me and it took him literally 2 minutes to fix my problem. He opened the torrent and open daemon tools, even though I told him theres nothing to mount so I couldn't figure out WHY the game kept saying I was missing a disc, anyways, he opened daemon tools and MOUNTED the rar file, the whole thing, not extracted or anything, and it worked..

If you're receiving a ""Disc Authorization"" Error:  
1. Extract and open up the installation folder
2. Open up the ""Fairlight"" folder and copy all the contents in that folder
3. For PC users, open up ""My Computer"" then your (C:) Drive
4. Open up ""Program Files"" and look for ""Electronic Arts"" (Default saving destination, it may be different depending on where you saved it when you downloaded the original ""Sims 3"")
5. Open the ""The Sims 3"" folder and paste the contents.

If all went well during installation, then the error should be gone :)  Enjoy!"

,essieU,2011-11-03T19:10Z,"PPL WHO HAVE ISSUES WITH VALIDATION OF GAME: if you get an error that says that the game cannot be authenticated, you're missing a step:
1. copy the contents from the fairlight folder
2. go to your desktop. right click your sims 3 icon and select 'open file location' 
3. it should take you to the bin file of the sims 3. go up to the top of the screen where u type in urls/commands and click 'the sims 3' or if you can't do that, just delete part of the url, stopping before 'the sims 3'. 
4. you should see a screen that says caches, game, gamedata, support, etc.  that's where you're supposed to paste in the fairlight info.
5. it should work. hope this helps!"
,N1190,2011-11-03T21:02Z,"For anyone having CD Key issues:
Search for the FFF EAGames Keygen. It will even give you keys for games that aren't included with the keygen. 

For anyone having cracking/cd issues:
1. DO NOT CRACK THE GAME AFTER INSTALLING. ^_^ Go to GameCopyWorld and download the Fixed Image for the most recent expansion you have installed. (Probably Pets. Just search for it)
2. Google ""Sims 3 Patch Downloader."" Run it and allow it to install any missing updates for the packs you've installed.
3. Mount the fixed image before you play.
4. Play

Simple enough right? When you use a fixed image instead of a crack to play the game you can keep up to date on the official patches without having to recrack for every patch you install. 

Also for those of you who like mods, try out AwesomeMod for the Sims 3. There is even an option with AwesomeMod to disable CD checks which completely removes the purpose of cracking or using the mini-images. Good Luck!"

,N1190,2011-11-08T09:21Z,"@heyydaniii
What they tend to do is release the expansion when most of the small details and actions you can do are untested for bugs. They do this because they can get the game out faster and its cheaper but also they suddenly have hundreds of thousands of testers out there ready to send them bug reports. I'd just suggest you wait for the expansion to get a patch or to so they can iron out some of the bugs. "

A lot of people are complaining about how to get all the Sims 3 working together so I thought this may help - I used Daemon Tools Lite to mount the images - unzipped with winrar when necessary - installed, using the keygen provided* and updated and applied cracks and patches when advised, these are generally found on opening your computer > right clicking the iso you can see loaded into your BD-ROM Drive > Open/Explore and locating the folder that shouldnt be there ie: fairlight/razor1911 etc this is also where you will find most keygens. 
I installed all perfectly on my laptop first time, also installed the base game and the Pets expansion on both of my nieces laptops, working perfectly, although one has the pets graphic issues where they have weird chins and legs! If anyone knows a fix to this please help :)

,reneevee,2012-01-08T11:13Z,"IÂ´m pretty much of a noob with this, but I figured it out and it works just great, yay! Thanks! :D
@ssilenc: you need to mount the .iso and choose the option to show the files in the folder. When you do this, you will see the fairlight folder (which holds the crack and keygen), instead of the fairlight.nfo file. Hope this helps!"

,chris9772,2012-04-29T17:41Z,"FOR EVERYBODY GETTING THE ""DISC AUTHORIZATION FAILURE"" ERROR READ THIS:

i spent about a week wondering what the hell was wrong with it.... you cannot use daemon tools to mount the disc after installing it, dunno about the orginal but it does not work if you use daemon tools to mount the expansion packs... i always got the failure!

what you gotta do to resolve this problem is simple, you can use daemon tools to install the game and expansions but you must close daemon tools after (make sure it is deffo closed) and then use the program powerISO which is the same as daeomon tools but runs undetected, therefore you can play :) it works!"

,aeristilheartly,2012-05-22T21:41Z,"ALRIGHT listen up here people who are having problems, this is what you do!!!!

Make sure you have DAEMON TOOLS!
This is what you mount to, you can download Daemon Tools Lite for FREE at the download website.


Unrar/unzip everything and mount into your daemon tools when instructed.
Some DO NOT NEED DAEMON TOOLS!  In this case, just open the SETUP application and run it.


Install in THIS order.


!!!!!!!DO NOT CRACK ANYTHING!!!!!!!!

THIS IS KEY! 

If you crack ANYTHING during your installs you will make it so NONE of them work and you might even have problems REMOVING them as they won't even UNINSTALL correctly


UPDATE WHEN ASKED
it won't hurt and you cannot move on unless you allow the update in EACH install!
