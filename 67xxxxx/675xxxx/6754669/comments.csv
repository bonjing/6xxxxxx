,Stick_Figure,2011-10-22T05:10Z,"Is it sad that I actually have your torrent page saved as a bookmark on my browser?

I appreciate all the time and effort you sacrifice to upload all these wonderful torrents. I know that a lot of people make requests, but I was hoping that you would try and get some of the classics going, such as the Back to the Future trilogy? Just a thought.

Thanks again for the uploads. Keep 'em coming!"
