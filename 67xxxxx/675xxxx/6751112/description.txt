                The Man Who Never Was. Part 1.
                Children's drama series from the makers of Doctor
                Who, following the adventures of investigative
                journalist Sarah Jane Smith. Joseph Serf has launched
                his new SerfBoard, the must-have computer that no one
                can resist owning. Intrigued, Sarah Jane takes Luke
                and Sky to investigate what is so compelling about
                Serf and his business. Meanwhile Clyde and Rani take
                a SerfBoard to pieces, suspecting alien technology
                may be the answer. Everyone wants the brand new
                SerfBoard - and why not? What could be so dangerous
                about a computer?
