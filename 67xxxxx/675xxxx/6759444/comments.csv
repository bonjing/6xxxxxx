[T],thetorrentlord,2011-10-21T00:55Z,Someone needs to hold this group or the individual posters accountable  for all the files that they stop seeding at 90+% and leaving the rest of us stuck with nothing. Example (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6744076) This is a common problem with this group. Does no one else care?
[T],thetorrentlord,2011-10-22T01:24Z,That torrent was only posted 6 days ago. You should be able to seed longer than that or at least till there are a couple of seeders.
