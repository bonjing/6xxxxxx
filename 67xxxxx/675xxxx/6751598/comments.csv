,ironymon,2011-11-29T18:41Z,"What a crappy plot.. i don't see how any respectable dude would watch this shit, only gay and girl material, i doubt about the girls also."
,Rzi,2011-11-30T18:05Z,audio is on the left speaker more on all of these bdrips but not on dvdrips. have to change to mono or it's a pain in the ass to listen 
,sputnikwood,2011-12-09T11:42Z,"Like previously said, the audio is leaning to the left speaker. Will have to use VLC with its mono audio feature.

V:9 A:8 (use mono)"
,sputnikwood,2011-12-09T11:45Z,"After further listening, I think the ripper/program sent the center channel audio to the left channel. The music soundtrack plays in both L/R speakers."

,ytq,2012-04-09T20:52Z,thanks
,schlierkamp,2012-05-30T08:46Z,"ty extremezone. I haven't played it yet, but I thought the trailer looked good when I saw it in theaters a long time ago.

p.s. to all: people who say ""gay this"" and ""girly that"", in essence people that are stereotypical and racist, is usually because they have low education and are narrow-minded. I'm not gay and I'm not girly, but I can appreciate a movie for what it is. good acting and well direction."
