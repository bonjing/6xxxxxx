The Busy Coder's Guide to Advanced Android Development picks up where its predecessor left off, covering yet more topics of interest to the professional Android application developer. If you need to use sensors, create home screen widgets, play back media, take pictures with the camera, or implement sophisticated services, this book will be a helpful guide. With all sample source code available for download from the CommonsWare Web site -- as are the samples from all of CommonsWare's Android books -- you can try out the book examples yourself and continue your education further. CommonsWare even has a support Google Group for readers, to help answer questions about the book materials and examples.
