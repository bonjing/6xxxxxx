,elektrostatisk,2011-10-20T22:44Z,Why not upload the flac?
,musicfromrizzo,2011-10-20T23:12Z,efficiency!
[V],Kitlope,2011-10-21T04:15Z,this is an mp3 not a flac. Next time put it in the right category.
,musicfromrizzo,2011-10-21T05:26Z,I dint place it in flac - I simply said it was FROM flac - read  carefully eh
[V],Kitlope,2011-10-21T07:23Z,"This is the FLAC category and this isn't a flac. It's an mp3. If you would have left it as a flac instead of coding it to an mp3 then it would be acceptable. Every mp3 on the entire internet can come from a flac... so should we spam up this flac category with mp3 files?

Do you not comprehend?"
,musicfromrizzo,2011-10-21T07:37Z,"listen, I didnt put it into flac OK?!
the option doesnt even appear when posting
capiche? Please do not belabour - move on

Ive emailed the folks there to fix their error"
,g8aso,2011-10-21T07:40Z,"Type:Audio > FLAC
not if it is MP3, wrong catagory.

You also might consider using Dual Channel to encode in mext time as mp3 stereo isn't true stereo, it's much better than joint stereo, but only dual channe (dual stereo)l has separate left and right channels."
,musicfromrizzo,2011-10-21T07:51Z,"the posting went in under music. There is no designation n that area for flac versus mp3 - as such Ive never had to specify that I use only mp3s

There is a different category altogether called flac which appears as an option just as movies or music - but that doesn't make sense to me. If its flac music rather than mp3 music - its still music and that's where the distinction should appear. most converters provide a choice between stereo and joint stereo. I use full stereo only - unless I come across the material in joint stereo in which case I tend to go along as almost everything Ive found on the net is invariably joint stereo including many if not most of the most current torrents posted on this board and everywhere as a result "
,Geinstein,2011-10-21T10:03Z,"Forget about this posting, go to http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6354387/Joe_Cocker_-_Unchain_My_Heart_%28FLAC%29 instead for the full album. I don't see the use in posting single tracks anyway especially when the track is available on a CD album. Post the full album instead!"
,musicfromrizzo,2011-10-21T12:50Z,thats your own view and its isnt mine own
[V],Kitlope,2011-10-21T14:19Z,"Reading your last post I've come to the conclusion that you don't even understand the difference between a flac and a mp3.

All your other mp3 torrents are correctly put into music category, since 99% of users use mp3. Flac is a niche market and somehow your mp3 torrent made it into the flac category, most likely by an accidental click of your mouse.

It's not the niggest of deal but your justification of a mp3 in the flac category is troubling. The truth is it could be reported and either deleted or moved into the appropriate cat.

And please, I come to this flac cat to browse for FLAC files... not mp3's."
[V],Kitlope,2011-10-21T14:23Z,* oops. Meant to say biggest. Can't edit either. My bad.
,musicfromrizzo,2011-10-21T15:06Z,kitlope - read my lips - I posted this into music - someone moved it into flac - now if you cant accept that his discussion is moot ok? ciao!
[V],Kitlope,2011-10-21T15:38Z,"Why didn't you say it was moved?

Probably moved because you had flac in the title and whoever moved it didn't double check to see what kind of file it was.

Anyhoo, moot indeed. hopefully it doesn't happen again."
,musicfromrizzo,2011-10-21T16:28Z,I agree thank you
