What Bill Cooper talks about is highly interesting - as you'd have expected from Bill. His lecture is almost three hours long. Bill talks about the history of the mystery schools and its hidden secrets, and how the illuminati want to take over the world and to what degree they've already done so. This looks like Bill's final warning to the British people. Then Bill outlines the symbols on the one-Dollar bill in much detail. Bill also discusses the famous Zapruder film showing the final moments of JFK's life. And finally Bill unmasks the so called "ozone hole" including the "ozone layer" as a huge fraud, comparable only to the well known global warming swindle. It is quite amazing to what degree the luciferian elite have deceived the unsuspecting and naive population of this poor planet.
