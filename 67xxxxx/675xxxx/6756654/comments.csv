Background on the series:  A mysterious event happens across the globe that results in 90% of the population dying within one year through starvation and disease. Electricity, gun powder, cars, all the things that make modern life possible stop working. These books could have come across as grim, but the author focuses on how humans band together and not only survive, but thrive in this new world they find themselves in. The books contain classic fantasy elements, but the setting and the characters are not. They are your friends and neighbors and is set in towns you live and work in.

Those that survive The Change (as the event becomes known) band together in small, isolated groups and form new, surprising cultures. After living through the horrors of those early days, people push their immediate past into the land of myths and mine myths for ways to reinvent their lives. A professor of medieval history and his SCA friends use feudal England as a model for a new society. It turns out being handy with a sword is valuable in a world where guns no longer work. A soldier turned devout monk is elevated to Abbot and the abbey becomes a fortress to guard the flock from roving bands of cannibals. Teenagers infatuated with Tolkin grow into serious scouts and caravan guards as the Dundain Rangers. Iowa, due to its ability to feed its population, becomes the most powerful area left in the old United States. Bib overalls and a feed cap become the dress of the upper class and Farmer is a title of respect. An Army officer in Boise dreams of holding the United States together and preserving the Constitution, but instead recreates the Roman Legions. A pseudo-Celtic clan is formed in Oregon when a community coalesces around a Wiccan coven with a Bard and powerful witch as a High Priestess. The Lakota once again follow the ways and Gods of their ancestors and the buffalo number in the millions.

 Tears of the Sun takes place 25 years (and 7 books) after The Change. The main hero, Rudi Mackenzie, has fulfilled his quest to find the fabled Sword of the Lady, but now he has a war to fight and win. The maxim â€œAs above, so belowâ€ is lived out as the Gods â€“ all of them â€“ walk the earth and weigh in on the war. After all, the fight is really Theirs being played out among men. The book follows the leaders of the Dundain Rangers as they plan a daring rescue in the very heart of enemy territory and goes back in time a bit to cover the events happening back in the newly formed High Kingdom of Montival (formerly the NE Untied States and parts of the Midwest). Much needed information is filled in and the plot action helps advance the series, but it isnâ€™t the action scenes that steal the show in Tears of the Sun â€“ itâ€™s the death of a main character and the development of another.

The death, a heroic act worthy of the character, is both shocking and anti-climatic. This seems contradictory - and it is, until you read the book. The effect of her death on those around her is hinted at, and may be profound and have far reaching consequences. But that is for another day (and another book) to explore.

The real treat for fans of the series is the developing and deepening of some of the more interesting characters. Tiphaine dâ€™Ath, Grand Constable of the PPA (Portland Protectorate Association â€“ a kingdom formed by SCA buffs), gets some love and attention from the author. I was happy to see her move past just being a two-dimensional, cold as ice, killer dyke in previous books and gain a stable relationship, but this book lets us see more of her internal workings. She has an extended and complex family that she enjoys nurturing. Old enemies become respected friendsâ€¦or at least allies. Most interesting of all, Tiphaine, a staunch atheist, begins to develop a spiri"
