,doggie015,2011-10-19T03:25Z,"Thanks... But I will not be downloading until a free trainer is released for it so I do not have to sign up with the cheathappens ""unlimited"" bullshit site to get a trainer for it."
,SteXDudE,2011-10-19T04:31Z,"@doggie015 why do you need a trainer?
play the game the way its meant to be played 
(im ati user btw)...."
,klord2010,2011-10-19T05:19Z,"@resi10
Are you sure? Many sites suggest that you need original DXHR."
,The4X3R,2011-10-19T06:06Z,Original game DXHR required!
,OmniNegro,2011-10-19T07:13Z,"Look at everything under the ""Features"" in the NFO. It is clearly an addon. It adds NEW stuff. It is not standalone. 

I do not see the humor resi10, but on this site I should just tell you to GFY or something. This is an addon people. You still need the original game.

If I had to guess, I would say that this works with Skidrow's release, and may work with others. If not, let others know. Someone has to be the test monkey."
,Vvornth,2011-10-19T08:27Z,"@OmniNegro
You're wrong, I tested it now without the original and it worked.
So this is a standalone ppl, have a great day! :)"

,Sirnizz,2011-10-19T12:24Z,my comment disapear..
,klord2010,2011-10-19T12:39Z,"@Sirnizz
It worked as if it's stand-alone so you don't need a legitmate or not what so ever copy of original dxhr."
,Sirnizz,2011-10-19T12:51Z,"Thanks.

I didn't know who to trust in this war comment.

Standalone/not standalone.

,Cyrez60659,2011-10-19T20:34Z,"Lol @ all the people saying you need the original. This is a standalone DLC. No original required, and it works 100% fine."

,The4X3R,2011-10-20T08:37Z,"Sorry people, I was wrong.
IT'S STANDALIONE"
,ronnie1003,2011-10-20T11:33Z,"Works like a charm!! Though I have the game (SKIDROW version) installed on my system, it loads in a different window of its own with no access to the DXHR game data or menu. So I guess it will work as a stand alone as well! Cheers!!"
,Free888,2011-10-20T13:01Z,Crashes at launch for me ...
,Nexus289,2011-10-20T14:05Z,Yea mines crashing at launch. Anyone know why?
[T],swebarb,2011-10-20T16:07Z,getting a 0xc0000005 error on launch after applying crack.. weird.. i have installed all the files needed.
,SentiNel090,2011-10-20T17:21Z,Crashes on startup for me too. Something to do with Secur32.dll...
,TairyHesticles,2011-10-20T19:03Z,Great torrent. Would download again. A +++++
,Cyrez60659,2011-10-20T19:04Z,"^Agreed, awesome work. Could you please upload Minerva's Den for BioShock 2? I can't even buy it 'cos they don't sell it in shops."
,Brisk_,2011-10-21T02:44Z,can someone tell me where the crack files are it only downloads a iso and nfo for me 
,Zelkiel60,2011-10-21T04:57Z,"The game doesnt work. Crash on startup with ""A problem has occurred"" error like Deus Ex Human Revolution Skidrow. I'm using Windows Vista 32bits. Can someone help me please ?"
,Zelkiel60,2011-10-21T05:02Z,"I have a solution for Windows 32 bits users:

- Download Payday The Heist RELOADED release.
- Copy the ""steam_rld.ini"" & ""steam_api.dll from Payday The Heist crack to the file where you have install Deus Ex Human Revolution: The Missing Link
- Enjoy !"

[T],swebarb,2011-10-21T12:12Z,"@ Zelkiel60

just tryied this now, it does nothing im afraid :( it seems the game launches i see teh dxhtml.exe in the task manager for about 10 seconds then nothing, no error message or anything.. Why the fuck hasnt anyone proper this shitrow crap they really cant crack things for shit theese days."
,truthy,2011-10-21T13:57Z,"mhm maybe I'm one of the lucky ones - for me it works perfectly. Win7 x86, 4 GB Ram, GTX 285. the main game too btw - not a single crash."
,mguk,2011-10-21T16:53Z,Well I too have had no luck and I tried swapping Steam .dll files with those from the SHITROW torrent and no luck. Tried updating DirectX etc as well but I think its too early to blame Skidrow for this it could well be a problem with the actual game
,xpc21,2011-10-21T17:16Z,"Hi!

I have Windows 7 32bit and setup file crash. I have already try compatibility mode and doesnt work neither. Any ideias?"
[T],swebarb,2011-10-21T18:04Z,"OK i have the fix!

apply the skidrow crack first then overwrite with steam_rld.ini & steam_api.dll from Payday The Heist crack from reloaded.

works for me now 100%. "
,Nexus289,2011-10-21T21:29Z,"Zelkiel60's and Swebarb's suggestions worked perfectly, fixed the crash at startup.
-copy the skidrow crack to the installation folder.
-Go to http://wwwfilesoniccom/file/2680978354/Payday.The.Heist-RELOADED.Crack.Only.rar (so you guys dont have to dl the whole game :D)
-Copy the steam_api.dll and the steam_rld.ini to the same folder.
-Enjoy! :D"
,Nexus289,2011-10-21T21:30Z,Also make sure you add the dots to the link.
,mguk,2011-10-21T23:20Z,Can you give us the link again please Nexus289 I added the . after www but the link still isnt working

Good job"
,mguk,2011-10-21T23:48Z,Duh! Then another before the .com and its working!! Brilliant job Nexus. Well done
,gnt500,2011-10-22T14:09Z,interesting question.. is there a way to merge this with the original game so that you can play from the start of the story all the way threw to the end and be able to play this when it's suppose to come into the story?
,razor0512,2011-10-22T16:26Z,Should I install this in the same directory as the original game?
,aashiqskb,2011-10-22T17:07Z,"@gnt500 u cannot merge this dlc with the original one....
but wat i did is,i played the original game again till the part were we hide in a cargo in the belltower docks and then started playing this dlc. so it feels like a single story. after completing the dlc i will continue with the original one...."
,onizeus,2011-10-23T00:55Z,"Hey, I used the crack and the heist files. The game loads, but whenever I choose ""New Game"" it crashes.
Any ideas?"
,Zengust,2011-10-23T10:30Z,"Everything in perfect order, thanks:)"
,Alex2715,2011-10-24T11:44Z,"Hi, can anyone tell me where the skidrow crack for this game is?"
,Metalprofi666,2011-10-24T13:38Z,"it crashes every 5-10 minutes. And i just bought my 590gtx graphic card :(
Any ideas why?"
,stephon_,2011-10-24T15:36Z,works nice... thanks :)
,Diabolic91,2011-10-24T23:51Z,"@Nexus289
the link still isnt working "
,baracas,2011-10-25T03:56Z,I can't believe they charged money for this.  It wasn't even close to a single chapter.  Not even half.
[T],swebarb,2011-10-26T12:37Z,Um what? people are saying they are into 5hours and more i would say that is preety good for dlc usually its not more then an hour or more..
,MrE159357,2011-10-26T22:57Z,"But this is not DLC, as that requires the original game.  This is a mini version of the game, that they could not even be bothered to tie into the main game.  You do not get to use what you find in this addon, so what is the point?  It is nothing more than an example of what the original game should have been like (proper level design & graphics).  

Thanks for the share.  

It would be worth buying if it were actually tied into the game.  I agree, that pausing your regular game, and playing this one at the correct point, is the only way to enjoy this."
,pretttt1,2011-10-27T04:20Z,"Works fine. But, I did not need any files from the other torrents mentioned above. Working fine for now.

Thanks to uploader and seeders!"
[T],swebarb,2011-10-27T13:17Z,"@ MrE159357 

wtf are u smoking dude? this is a standalone addon with improved graphics, new dialogue, characters etc. It does not require the original to run it is for people that want to discover what happend when he was gone on the boat 3 days."
,memento_171,2011-10-28T17:32Z,"hey everyone I downloaded the missing link, and i extracted it, but another rar.file appeared and I dont know the password, If someone can please help me, thx. "

[T],ServiusTheBear,2012-01-09T23:08Z,"@doggie015 - Right I am a long time user of CH and I respect there work and there own time they put in so. I payed a one time fee for life time unlimited! Now If you do not like the fact you can not get a trainer for free then wait for some one to make a free trainer! Which will no doubt infect your system. CH provides top quality in trainers! If you do not want that then fine. Go some where else! I will not stand for brainless buffoons who will besmirch the CH name!

@Brisk_ - Right I have heard your type of questions over and over by millions others. You will find it on the ISO! Look properly before asking.

Right ok Downloaded in 1 hour hoped it would have been quicker. Now the fix that was stated with the adding of the two files worked. Note. The trainer from CH dose not find the game! Due to the cracK!"
[T],ServiusTheBear,2012-01-10T21:31Z,Edit - The CH trainer works. Just helps when you use the right one! lol 
,Seckzy,2012-01-14T01:24Z,works perfectly. i dont see how this fits into the plot of the full game though..
