Huw Wheldon Lecture 2011 with Bettany Hughes:
TV - Modern Father of History

Bettany Hughes uses the 2011 Huw Wheldon
Memorial Lecture to argue that history on
television is thriving and enjoying a new
golden age. She explores why programme
makers should look to the ancients for
inspiration, how television can become an
active player in the historical process
itself and why people are looking to the
past to help navigate a complex modern world.
