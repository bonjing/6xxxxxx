,spitfire486,2011-10-19T11:03Z,"Thank you for your continued work, although the commentating in spanish is quite exciting, do you have these in english?"
[V],Nepotu,2011-10-19T11:52Z,"@m00sa: Before the ""fucking shit""-ing, use your brain and find a proper codec and/or a proper player for mkv files. You think that I have a pink skull for nothing?
@spitfire 486: Sorry but I can upload in every international language. I selected the best quality of video. And other thing. The english commentators use to be very apathetics. The latin blood is different."
,guychris,2011-10-20T10:05Z,Thanks  for  this.  You  are  right  the  Spanish  commentary  gives  it  some  spice.  Don't  need  to  understand  it  can  see.
