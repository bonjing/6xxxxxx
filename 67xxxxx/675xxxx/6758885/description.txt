  Grissom receives a video tape from an inmate called Frank Damon who is on trial for the arson which resulted in his wife and son's death. On the tape, Damon claims that he is innocent and asks Grissom to help him. Grissom agrees to re-examine the evidence, despite knowing that this will anger Ecklie who originally worked on the case. Nick and Catherine, meanwhile, work on the case of a young man found shot in the head inside his car.
