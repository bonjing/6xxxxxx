Here's a rip of a VHS tape.

It's coded to a single DivX file, 640x480, with MP3 audio.  Scans of the front and back covers are also included.

This is the classic lineup, including Gary Richrath.  REO was a fun band to see live - always entertaining and often cheap (compared to others).  I think I never spent more than $10 going to an REO show.  Well worth it.  Enjoy!
