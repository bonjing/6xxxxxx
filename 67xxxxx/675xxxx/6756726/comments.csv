P.S.

Can you ( F1 or someone else ) upload T.S. Eliot's book, ""Notes towards the Definition of Culture""? I am a teacher of English here in Romania, and my daughter who is a student in the English department needs this for some exams! It is simply unfindable! Please help!
Thanks in advance!"

TPB upload not working. Try this:
ifile it/jb1l0y4"
,th-mach,2011-10-20T04:32Z,No luck adding the torrent. No luck putting a download link in a comment. Ah well. I'll try against tomorrow.
,th-mach,2011-10-20T04:33Z,"Oh so NOW the old comment appears!! TPB is pretty weird sometimes. Add a dot after ""ifile"" obviously."

Argh!!! What have you done mate? That book you are providing has two parts: ""The Idea of a Christian Society"" and ""Notes towards the Definition of Culture"".
Aimier_59 was asking for ""Notes towards the Definition of Culture"". You've splitted the book (or something) and removed the required part :("
,Aimier_59,2011-10-21T11:41Z,"Well, never mind this or that! The important element in the issue is that I am still waiting for the book to be uploaded! And I do hope to help my daughter to read it for her exams! Thank again!"
[V],_F1_,2011-10-21T14:12Z,In that case I assure you to upload the complete book ... :)
[V],_F1_,2011-10-21T14:40Z,"OK. Here is the complete book:
