I do so agree, i was hoping for more duct tape myths/tests :)"
,duckch,2011-10-20T13:34Z,Mythbusters are runing low on myth's myth's are something you lock for in the historybooks not internet which have been the case several episode now. Plus duct tape for the third time! they are repeating themselves.

,Ruby5,2011-10-20T14:23Z,"As long as Kari is on, who cares what myth they test.
I love duct tape!!!!!"
,duckch,2011-10-20T16:17Z,Sorry about the dubbelpost something wrong when you write comments here i always get a error message.The episode is not bad but you now how it's going to end and therefore it's not so exating.

,Obakazan,2011-10-20T17:12Z,"@duckch Actually, they have always been taking myths from the internet."
,ThomasJones19,2011-10-21T00:39Z,"If you think you have better myths for them test, submit them to them! If not, stfu, ever since the series has been running they have done myths mainly from word of mouth, local research and their own curiosity from things that have happened in the past, only reason they take ideas off the internet is because of how vast of a resource it is, and how accessible it is for them! It's the 3rd Duct Tape episode in 9 series? Not exactly running out of ideas if it's only the 3rd episode of the hundreds they have done..."
,SexyGoat,2011-10-21T00:51Z,"I love how people are bitching about a new Mythbusters, if you don't like it, don't watch it, or download it, don't comment.

Go rewatch Walk in a Straight line if you're that fucking disappointed."
,ThomasJones19,2011-10-21T16:18Z,"I agree with @SexyGoat, never thought I'd be agreeing with a SexyGoat... xD"
,duckch,2011-10-22T16:48Z,"Obakazan yes i now that but now every episod is internet that or internet this just becase some stupid kid can't understand that most of this thingas are fake.
of course you can build a plane from duct tape you can build a boing 747 if you have enough duct tape.
