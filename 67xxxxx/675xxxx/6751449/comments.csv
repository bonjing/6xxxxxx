[V],HobbitGamez,2011-10-20T00:06Z,"@whiteboy85

Everything you need is already on this page. The site I linked to gives extremely simple steps to follow to prepare your Wii to play games:

http://sites.google.com/site/completesg/home

It is important to follow the steps in order. Begin on the page that says ""START HERE ->"" and continue on to each tab to the right. If you still find it too complex and beyond your comprehension, I suggest you buy some Apple products and accessorize them with Angry Birds paraphernalia. Or take up a stamp collection."
,vinnylima,2011-10-22T04:57Z,Any chance of upload of the Target/Zellers edition?
[V],HobbitGamez,2011-10-23T02:21Z,"@vinnylima

Not just yet, but possibly in a few days."
[T],ctang,2011-10-24T03:11Z,"ok this game has to be a jap game because i have to have neogamma force the video to the same as the wii...i.e. force the frames per second of the game to the fps of the console...that only happens when a game is not the same region as the console and the console is a USA console...i have had no other problems with any other USA game but this so called USA game

but that being said...i take nothing away from this upload because i got it working...just a heads up for others

by the way, you can tell the fps is messed up when the color is really messed up...almost looks black and white

thanks though, fiance loves it and that is all that matters :)

Actually you are right, technically this title is ""region free,"" and not NTSC-U. It is the only format that exists for the Best But Exlusive Editions of Just Dance 2 & Just Dance 3 however, and will always work on an NTSC-U console, which was why I uploaded it."
,guyyoung28,2011-10-24T19:36Z,"this works on softmod wii via gecko disc loader and is a pal version, thanks"
,vinnylima,2011-10-25T17:41Z,"Works perfectly on USB Loader GX. THE GAME IS REGION FREE, as confirmed by Wii Backup Manager. The loader identifies the game as PAL for some reason, but this was released on freakin' Best Buy, which means it can't be European. Thanks a lot for another great upload, HobbitGamez."
,Hansei,2011-10-29T10:42Z,Works perfectly thanks!
,xamorex,2011-11-03T10:27Z,hi. what type of disc should I use if i want to burn it?
,i_reckoner,2011-11-03T21:32Z,"@HobbitGamez
Hey m8, tnx for the file! I got a question though:
How come the ""inner"" file's name got a ""Y"" instead of the usual ""E"", placing that it's an official NTSC file? I mean, the loaders or backup managers say it's a PAL version. It's weird since it also happened with Just Dance 2, file name had the ""Y"" instead of the ""E"".
If u get to know any info, please let me know! :)"
[V],HobbitGamez,2011-11-03T22:55Z,"@i_reckoner

because it is region free, as mentioned above. It is the only region that exists for the two games."
,TunaD,2011-11-27T20:09Z,"Thanks for this! It's working fine for me, but for some reason there's no color in the game at all. I'm sure this isn't normal. Is there any way to fix it? It's not a big deal, but the game would be a little more fun and easier to play with color."
,JJ7878,2011-12-23T14:00Z,I'm not sure if anyone else has the problem but the game has no color when i use it. It's black and white and some of the songs don't work either.
,mtlycru,2012-01-03T08:09Z,"I think it's funny that the same issues are stated multiple times (Why is my game black and white? Why does the description say NTSC but the game doesn't play correctly? Why does Wii Back up manager say it PAL but it is uploaded as NTSC?). If you look at the other comments, you may see your question already asked AND answered. You came into this page because the title was a game you were looking for so you obviously know how to read, try doing that with the other posted comments before asking a question that, again, may have already been asked/answered."
[V],HobbitGamez,2012-01-06T01:51Z,"@TunaD & JJ7878

Usually forcing a different region in your USB loader will fix the black & white problem. If it is a hardmod I don't know what advice to give you other than softmod it.

If that fails, try a different loader. Worked fine for me with USB Loader GX, even tested all the songs."
,Mishwack,2012-01-27T04:29Z,"This game is 'NTSC' (but will also work in PAL or other region).
Why? Just think about it: Sold only on AMERICA (but people who knows that its FREE REGION buy it online to Europe or other).

Sorry my english.
Psst, Just Dance 3 Target Exclusive is hard to get. I think I will purchase it original and dump it for myself..."
,nccustom,2012-02-01T04:52Z,"if you are Loading this with 

USB Loader GX 
Click on the Game, Go to Settings, Click on Game Load, Set Video Mode to Force NTSC.

WiiFlow
Click on the Game, Click the Gear next to the Red X, Set Video Mode to NTSC.

For some reason this game says NTSC but I'm Guessing it's PAL version because you have to Force it when playing before Forcing it, it was playing in Black in White after Forcing it I got Color in the Game.... Other then this the Game is Great and works Perfect my daughter is gonna love it thanks man..... :D"
[V],HobbitTunez,2012-02-25T01:20Z,"@nccustom

It is not PAL. it is region free."
