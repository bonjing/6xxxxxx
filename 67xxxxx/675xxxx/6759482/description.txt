1. Burn/mount and install

2. If the game asks to update, do so.

3. Once you are asked for a key, enter one of these keys or use the fairlight keygen flt-ts3p.exe

57D5-NW4N-CS8H-EGP5-QFLT
GA6E-DV1D-RT47-EPG8-KFLT
1LFP-NX2A-FG3X-27YK-PFLT

4. Finish game installation, Origin install is not necessary.

5. To crack the game, you can either place the contents of Crack A into "C:\Users\*USERNAME*\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3" or place the contents of Crack B to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game"

Crack A is a NoCD mod which DOES NOT need to be replaced after every update, but requires you to use a shortcut to TS3W.exe in C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\Bin You MUST launch using TS3W.exe and you will get an error if you use the launcher

Crack B patches the game's executable and will need to be replaced with every new update. It needs to be placed in the The Sims 3 directory, not the The Sims 3 Pets directory.
