,macca747,2011-10-31T14:58Z,How do I get rid of Subs & I have a prob getting sound to play through TV - using media player classic
,ninline,2011-11-02T01:03Z,I use VLC to play the movie on my computer.  You can go to the menu in VLC and select video and the submenu subtitle track under that where you can select the subtitle track you want or disable it altogether.  I cant say for media player classic as I've never used it. My WD TV live media box also lets me disable subtitle tracks.  This doesn't work for those files that have subtitles on the movie itself hard coded.  Fortunately that's getting rarer these days particularly with mkv files.
