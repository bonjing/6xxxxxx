,QuePensa,2011-10-21T16:31Z,"great work, good quality, but unfortunately there is an error/corruption on video at 43m56s and if I add my dubbed audio on this version, it gets out of sync at this point: 500ms. "
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-10-21T17:12Z,"Sorry, but I've seen this ripp of mine head-to-tale without freezing or blocking on PC , TV HD with Media player and Media Player Standalone !

 Excepting a ... little glitch due to the  source at 43:52 min!!!

Enjoy, if you can.


Sorry for that !!"
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-11-09T21:20Z,"So ...no any other complaints. 
Just the dubbed audio [external audio !!] out of sync ??

I think so: it's OK."

,vivatpb5776,2011-11-29T09:14Z,"I concur with QuePensa. There is a video glitch at around 43:52. This occurs during the scene where Dumbo drinks the beer-tainted water. The glitch is small and does not affect the overall movie quality.

I have never heard of a FULL SCREEN 720p video file. After doing some quick research, it does appear that there is such a thing as a 720p movie in a full screen aspect ratio (4:3).

I cannot speak on the subtitle issue since I had no need to use it. Thank you uploader."
