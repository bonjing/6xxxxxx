,redhillunited,2011-10-20T11:07Z,"So, when in the game when you are asked to update game I click yes, than exit the game and crack it?"

yup, just like it says in the install notes.
update the game (in game), then close the game to copy the crack over."
,fredfitta,2011-10-20T14:04Z,I downloaded and installed the first version of FIFA Manager 12 that came up on this site: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6748513/FIFA_MANAGER_12_CLONEDVD_ENG__TOMEK116_Sonuyos . That version was installed by just extracting the files with winrar or similiar which means that the game is not registered in the computers registry. This of course leads to me not being able to do the auto-update within the game since the update can't find the game on the drive. The question is if there is a stand-alone install of the update where I get to choose install path?

there's probably a standalone updater but i didnt see one in a quick search.

I'm not a fan of Sonuyosro's uploads.."
