Legendary Crooners 6CD 320k remastered plus bonus tracks (musicfromrizzo)

We obtained this 6CD set around and found a similar offering posting
already on a torrent. What we did instead is to improve on the set with
appropriate file naming conventions for ease of integrating into your existing
libraries, added mp3 tags and images as appropriate and even improved on some
of the mp3 file versions with what we have in our library of the same title
and artist.

In addition we have some great added bonus tracks - the intent being to give a
great start into great music of old fashioned sensibilities to men and women who
yearn for the sensibilities that once were taken for granted. That we cherished
and protected our weak, our families and we showed genuine compassionate care
and a passionate desire for what it is we call romantic love and meaningful
intimacy. Music like this helps bring it all back so i ask you switch channels
from whatever you are now involved with and help spread the joy with this
offering instead! With thanks!

We have significant postings of Libraries already in place for Dean Martin
Perry Como, Mario Lanza and Vic Damone through the 100 hits legends series,
and we are doing the same with Bing Crosby soon although it will be even more
large in size as much of his content is obscure on the net despite being great
for the maintenance and replenishment of the Irish spirit around the states
especially - hope you will join with us on that score equally.

We have a great offering too of Frank Sinatra here along with Duets specials.
We will have even more soon in certain. PS Vic Damone is not to be missed out on
as well.

Then again there are some other relatively obscure great talents that were
once big names in this business and they are in a separate folder with some
of the best and most lovely sounds you could want to hear. How a bout a revival
and a renaissance eh! it all starts here with your desire to improve our world
to what it once used to be more of!

Thanks much indeed one and all!
