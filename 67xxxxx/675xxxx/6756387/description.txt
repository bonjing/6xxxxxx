Insomnium is a melodic death metal band from Joensuu, Finland, whose music also reveals links to other, neighboring metallic subgenres like doom, melancholy, and dark metal. Originally formed in 1997, the group released a pair of demos in 1999 and 2000 before signing a contract with Englands Candlelight Records, and making their full-length debut via 2002s In the Halls of Awaiting CD. Two additional albums - Since the Day It All Came Down, Above the Weeping World and Across the Dark - have since followed, in 2004, 2006 and 2009 respectively, and not only confirmed Insomniums enduring passion for their chosen musical style, but also their stable lineup consisting of Niilo SevÃ¤nen (bass/vocals), Ville Friman (guitar), Ville VÃ¤nni (guitar), and Markus Hirvonen (drums).
