http://www.logotv.com/shows/the_a_list_dallas/season_1/series.jhtml"
,JerryGyan,2011-10-19T04:51Z,"Wow an A-List episode in HD? Awesome, pleeease keep it up! :)"
,huhnchen,2011-10-19T05:06Z,"A=10
V=10

jart92 - Thank you, thank you, thank you! If there's any way that you can upload episode 1, then I'd really appreciate it!"
,jart92,2011-10-19T05:49Z,"sorry i dont have episode 1 :( i will try to get it if i can, but you can stream it from logotv.com for now (someone posted a link above). maybe someone with a screen capture program and some editing skillz could get a low quality screen capture from streaming it and then upload that :/"
,zahur,2011-10-19T22:15Z,"Oh no, more trash - thank you!"
,BoonesFerry,2011-10-21T03:23Z,"I've tried a couple apps that capture/record rmtp streams from many websites, however, the apps I have do not work with logotv.com. 
I know there are apps that can capture/record a selectable region of your screen and save as a video file but I don't know which one's are free and contain no adware/spyware. 
Any suggestions?"
