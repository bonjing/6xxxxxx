[b]Thx Hive

CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D


Source: LTW

thx

Encode:

same as on hangover, the LTW file looks better than the upscale pre dvd-r, but was lots more work to do.
Mostly dark scenes as on part 1, and colourless.
Firstly i removed some noise and cut the movie in parts. 
daylight, darkness and dawn scenes needed different settings. colours needed fixing too, brightened all dark scenes up a lot to let you see more of the movie, daylight scenes only slightly changed when needed. sharpness also very slightly.
all in all very watchable now


here is a LTW comparison:
