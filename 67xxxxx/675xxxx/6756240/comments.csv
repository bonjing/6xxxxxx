Great job - smaller than my upload to."
,chomos_potas,2011-10-19T18:36Z,"smaller than yours but I bet languages are missing.
fuck! "
,jdog90000,2011-10-19T18:53Z,"i know with cracked games it just about always doesn't but since it's a main component i have to ask, does the multiplayer work? "
,randomkillen,2011-10-19T21:38Z,Seeda tack! efter ja e klar seedar ja genom natten! full uppladdning med 100/100! gogo!
,demmone,2011-10-19T22:40Z,"I got the Mp to work i did this 
when you press the icon on the desktop it will show Exit game Play Configure. I press Configure and then at the bottom it says Online platfrom  Gamespy or Steam i picked Gamespy there started the game the press online play made my ch logged in on my fake/old Gamespy account and started to play online"
,Netarangi,2011-10-19T22:43Z,"Multiplayer COULD work, as you can choose gamespy for the multiplayer, Gamespy haven't been really known for their security on cracked games."
,NineToesXD,2011-10-19T23:08Z,"Crash upon trying to launch the .exe
Any help!?? :/"
,uberownager,2011-10-19T23:08Z,Does the multiplayer trough steam work with this?
,DevlinXIII,2011-10-20T01:32Z,Crashes at launch !? really ? *sigh*
,No-Vacancy,2011-10-20T01:32Z,"My game won't start and I have done all the things that the install notes says.
Any ideas ?"
,DevlinXIII,2011-10-20T01:52Z,"No idea what's wrong and why it crashes at start, already installed twice, also tried using gamespy instead of steam but no use."
,Jackjoe500,2011-10-20T03:12Z,Same boat won't start. First Rage and now this man devs are getting shitty.
,swiz119,2011-10-20T05:12Z,Has anyone managed to figure out the crashing issue at start up??
,Tomtompro,2011-10-20T05:19Z,"Steam Error, Application load error.

As i can see i'm not alone.


SKIDROW SUCKS!"
,swiz119,2011-10-20T05:20Z,Anyone figure out a fix for the the crashing at start up?? or possibly another location to get a working download?
,Whobuysgames,2011-10-20T07:35Z,Extremezone's release worked fine for me. this seems identical and pointless tbh
[V],.Dude.,2011-10-20T10:28Z,Whobuysgames: i find your comment pointless as i uploaded this torrent two hours b4 him.
,caki.deki,2011-10-20T11:09Z,Crashes too. Does this thing work actually?
,Matinator10,2011-10-20T11:22Z,"Try installing the prerequisites and copy over the crack. The devs are pro, you guys just cant even install something. Fail."
,karlosss999,2011-10-20T15:37Z,"works perfect for me. And the gamespy-enabled mp seems to run well too... 

the ranked-mp gamemode requires a steam key and is probably uncracable...

still make sure you have all the pre-requisites, can find them in the redist folder if game fails to install those at launch. if you cant get that far make sure edited the Skidrow.ini file in game folder. the player name part that is. beyond that can be of no help. my copy installed flawlessly and went running after 2nd bootup..."
,ogipower,2011-10-20T16:42Z,"Application load error 5:00000065434

HELP MEE :(((("
,acereblythe,2011-10-20T19:06Z,"It works! :D For those having errors, maybe you forgot to crack it? All I did was;
1)Extract it all.
2)Use ultraiso to install it.
3)Crack it.
4)Open from desktop it will install stuff..
5)Open it again and it works!

But then I try playing it, my character doesn't save, is it suppose to be happening? :O"
,darthvla,2011-10-20T20:05Z,"I dont recommend this unless SKIDROW releases the 7.02 update, because it has a no sound bug with sound cards 7.1 Also it is impossible to me to save settings or make the joypad 360 to work"
,saadawan23,2011-10-21T09:02Z,"replace * to .

,darthvla,2011-10-21T12:27Z,"For ppl who cant save their progress.... try launching the game ""open as administrator""...."
,acereblythe,2011-10-21T19:03Z,"Scratch my comment earlier on, I somehow get the saving thing to work. Woohoo~!!"
,acereblythe,2011-10-21T21:27Z,Any news on working patch for this DD from 7 to 7.03? :O
,yellowbeard68,2011-10-23T12:08Z,"@tomtompro

Stupid people, (like yourself) sucks.

;-)"
,TurtleXXX,2011-10-26T22:35Z,When is SKIDROW planning their updates? or should I go download Theta. Will I lose my character >_
