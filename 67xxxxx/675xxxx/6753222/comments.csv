,cena316,2011-10-25T08:10Z,Many thanks for this matey & saw these guys last year in sheffield England. I've been to many rock gigs but never laughed as much as when i seen these guys. They are fuckin halarious & well worth the money to go watch. Will be looking for tour dates for next year & hopefully they will do Manchester Academy or Manchester Apollo :-)
