Rhyme Asylum are a Hip-Hop group hailing from London, United Kingdom comprising of music artists:  Possessed, Psiklone & Skirmish. â€˜RAâ€™ are focused on bringing back classic â€œBoom Bapâ€ hip-hop, accompanied by advanced and thought provoking, vivid lyricism. 

Originating from the infamous Deal Real open mic sessions between 2004 and 2005 (but initially formed by Possessed and Skirmish in 2002), Rhyme Asylumâ€™s music rippled through the Hip-Hop community; both in their native country and internationally with equal distinction.The group have appeared live on Pyro Radio and Conspiracy Worldwide Radio; and received airplay on BBC 1Xtra (Sarah Love\'s UK Spotlight), Kiss FM, Choice FM, Life FM, Sensei FM, Suspect Packages and many moreâ€¦  

Possessed and â€˜RAâ€™ affiliate Reain (aka Whashisface), reached the Grand Final of the â€˜Jump Off: World Rap Championshipsâ€™, in Las Vegas, 2006. In addition, RA members have freestyled live on BBC 1Xtra, BBC Asian Network, Choice FM, Diesel FM and Kiss FM.

The group has toured all over the United Kingdom: London, Brighton, Manchester, Newcastle, Southampton, Ipswich, Nottingham, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff and more. More recently they supported the legendary Dilated Peoples in Hamburg, Germany.

Rhyme Asylum\'s most recent self-released project \'Solitary Confinement\' released April 23rd and features Ill Bill, Crooked I, Reain and DarkStar.  Plus heavyweight production from all over the globe from: Engineer, Al\'Tarba, The Returners, Chemo, Hirolla, Profound, DJ Butcher, Think and Ill Fated. The album is 18 tracks long (no skits), photography was handled by RomanyWG - a truly incredible urbexer/photographer in a real abandoned mental asylum; plus in-house graphic design by Psiklone.

Vinylism.de has recently released a selection of 8 tracks taken from the album on a limited edition 12\" vinyl.  The record was professionally mastered by Walter Coehlo - a reputable sound engineer with an impressive portfolio.  The project has been aptly named \'Solitary Confinement: The Overdose EP\'.
