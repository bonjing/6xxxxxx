Schools of ethics in Western philosophy can be divided, very roughly, into three sorts. The first, drawing on the work of Aristotle, holds that the virtues (such as justice, charity, and generosity) are dispositions to act in ways that benefit both the person possessing them and that personâ€™s society. The second, defended particularly by Kant, makes the concept of duty central to morality: humans are bound, from a knowledge of their duty as rational beings, to obey the categorical imperative to respect other rational beings. Thirdly, utilitarianism asserts that the guiding principle of conduct should be the greatest happiness or benefit of the greatest number.

The authors of the above book have stated that they are not ""responsible for any unethical or criminal choices you may make using the methodologies and tools we describe"". So too sum up - it is ethical for these authors to use un-ethical methodologies in an attempt to discover how hackers act. What a load of rubbish. Every single human-being in the world believes their ethics and morality are the right ones to hold. I hold to my belief that the torrent scene occupies the high-ground on the utilitarianism principle stated above - that the tools, knowledge and potential to improve the whole of humanity should be available to all without qualification or restriction.
