Plot:
John Milton is up against the clock: Jonah King, the leader of a Satanic cult, has murdered
Milton's daughter and kidnapped her baby. In three days, King and his followers will sacrifice
the child at midnight. Milton picks up the trail in Oklahoma as well as rescuing a waitress named
Piper from her brutal, two-timing fianc. There are odd things about Milton: his driver's license
is out of date, he has a very strange gun, and he's being pursued by a man in a suit who carries

things together on the fly as they close in on King.
