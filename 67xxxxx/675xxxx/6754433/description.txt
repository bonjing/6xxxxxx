Some sources say this DVD bonus originally aired on Ford Television Theatre. Others say the Decision series. This version calls it "Barbara Stanwyck Presents" , maybe because she hosts this episode. Whatever the series, it was also an anthology with different guests each week and it was filmed in 1958.

Guest Stars --- Barbara Stanwyck, Jeff Morrow, and Trevor Bardette.
