Discription



Presented By Mark Kielar

Logos is pleased to offer the CrossTV/Word Pictures video series A Workman Approved By God as our newest addition to the Libronix video library. Using the Libronix Digital Library System, with incorporated video capabilities, this 16-part series is accessible for study and reference. The video book series utilizes the same tagging techniques featured in our electronic book collections, so it fits seamlessly into your existing library, adding a new tool in your study of Hermeneutics and biblical interpretation.

How can you determine whether someone is correctly interpreting Godâ€™s Word? In a day and age when there are over 1000 Christian Denominations, and literally thousands of cults, (and everybody seems to have a different interpretation of scripture), thatâ€™s not an insignificant question. So how do you know? In a word: Hermeneutics. Which is just a fancy word for the science of biblical interpretation. And as Hank Hannegraaff, President of C.R.E. (a group dedicated to challenging cultic and heretical teaching) put it: â€œThe best antidote to heretical teaching is a good hermeneutical training.â€

This download contains the sessions 1-4 of the 16 part series.

This is dedicated to my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.


The Entire Collection can be found here: 

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.


RAPtURE (My transportation outta here).

The Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe That The Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)

In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed..

"And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.

"Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...

May Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed Long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.
