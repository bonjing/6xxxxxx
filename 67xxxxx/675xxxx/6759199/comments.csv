2. Burn or mount the image.

the game online, block this in your firewall to prevent this.
4. Copy files over from /Crack dir
5. Play the game

,dryving,2011-10-25T00:31Z,"If your anti virus will not let you install or run the crack, then you need to add the file to your exceptions list for your antivirus.  In AVG you add exceptions under tools/Advanced Settings
click on ""potentially unwanted programs"" toward the bottom of the list on the left & add the file as an exception on the right.  You may be able to do this by a context menu when right-clicking on the file itself, but this has never worked for me.  You may also need to temporarily disable your anti-virus software in order to copy the file where you want it in the first place depending on your software.

4. Copy files over from /Crack dir

There is no crack dir file/folder  Its renamed to something else if it even existed.   The torrent came with 3 things.  A picture.  A systems information, and the zip file.  No where in any of that is a crack folder.   


So now lets talk about installation.   

3. Install, enter any serial when asked. The game will then try to activate
the game online, block this in your firewall to prevent this.   

I did everything it asked and it kept failing me over and over and over and over again.  


Seriously uploader, you steal the guys file seed it out to what 20 people, write up a generic instruction manual that doesn't work for those that are trying to figure this out, because if someone even remotely hints to how to do this, they are slammed around like a pinata, and yet you sit back and get the glory?  

You could at least spend a few minutes writing up an actual instruction direction that works.  This is the 3rd game I have attempted of yours to follow the directions, and not once have any of the files you said been in folders you claim they where in.  "
,Nextna,2011-10-30T04:16Z,How I did: I just inverted the order - I replaced the original (CitiesXL_2012.exe) and then inserted the serial 111-222-333-444 or whatever to see what happens. My setup window crashed but the game is running without any problems LOL!
,tron011,2011-10-30T09:27Z,"so this is how i did it easy as!

1. Install game

2.disconnect from the internet

3.enter random serial i did 1111-2222-3333-4444-5555

4.it will ask for activation dont worry ignor it and 

5.disable your antivirus 

6.go in to the image (disk) get the crack and the rld.dll file and copy to where you saved your game 

then you should be away if any issues email me at chris.a.ryan2009@gmail.com"

4. start the game clicking on the .exe file. "
,yellowbeard68,2011-11-02T08:49Z,"Another great upload by extremezone. I've been on here for many years and have yet to have a torrent not work by extremezone. Thanks again! 

It's funny how files work for those who know what they are doing (like myself) and ""doesn't"" work for others. It's also funny how people b*tch about something not working and blaming the uploader. Installation is as easy as riding a bicycle...I would love to help out those who honestly want it...but reading all the whining gets old. Take the time to learn about mounting ISO files and locating the folder with the crack first before shouting off to those of us that know what we are doing how ignorant or lazy you are. Almost every torrent out there follows the same basic setup...only a few have slight variations."

Now, here's the tricky part.  You have to find the directory on your mac.  The folder and files will be hidden, so you need to change that setting. (Google that if you don't know how.)

For me, it was under: User -> (Hidden folder) Library -> CrossOver Games --> and so forth.

Then, boom, just copy and paste the files, and you're all set to run.

,awesomepig,2012-02-19T11:05Z,"extremezone Is a trusted uploader and I do so myself but my AVG detects the crack as a virus. It doesnt let me copy. However, I disabled my AVG to copy it. Played the game a few times, until recently my AVG did an automatic scan and saw the game as a threat.. bleh."
,Underride,2012-03-03T23:41Z,"Ya, Avg picked it up as a virus. More annoying, avg asks me every 30 seconds what I want to do with the threat. I keep clicking ignore, but it always comes back.. ug, changing virus scanners.   I'm un-installing it now to see if it will work. lol really hope its not a real virus :)"
,LgcFnc,2012-03-13T10:13Z,"Thanks for the torrent extremezone! Works perfectly... what a shame the game UI is so unpolished and shit. 

Or maybe I've come to expect too much from SimCity. "
,enterthehole,2012-03-30T19:50Z,"Worked perfectly Win7 64. Have to disable AV when you want to play.
To the guy saying about the shortcuts: Copy / Paste worked rather than Drag/Drop

Thanks EZ !"

,b055r055,2012-04-01T15:09Z,"hey guys, i'm new to this whole  utorrent thing and i wanted to ask, what does it mean for something to be seeding??"
,Crocidolite,2012-04-01T19:48Z,"somebody help? I couldn't move the exe in the crack folder over so I found a download with it in, it was a rinrar, so I put that in installation folder extracted, now I have both of the files that were in the crack folder, in the installation folder, but when I attempt to run the crack exe to play the game it says : Windows cannot access the specified device, path or file. you may not have the correct permissions to access the item.

I am the system admin and have full control over it, I have been attempting to find a soloution for around 9 hours now, and are close to giving up. somebody help please, thanks.

note : Windows Vista.

I've tried several things like some guy said to click the unblock button which is under the advanced button under properties, but there is no unblock button. I've tried loads of other things. so yeah, any help greatly appreciated, want to play this game!"
,skannerz,2012-04-02T04:06Z,this needs a serial key..................... so clearly the game is useless
,skannerz,2012-04-02T04:10Z,and there is no crack
,skannerz,2012-04-02T04:16Z,the game is useless it has no serial in the files and no crack in the files
,Vayzeee,2012-04-11T16:05Z,"All of you guys whine WAY too much. If you can't do it, you just can't, face it. However if you can follow some simple directions then go ahead and try mine:

1) Install the torrent of course.
2) Now right click on the torrent and click on ""Open Containing Folder""
3) From there, extract all of the DVD files out of the .iso.
4) From there mount the image in Daemon Tools or something similar, and click on ""Autorun.exe""
5) Now wait for all the DVD's to install 1 - 5.
6) After that it may ask for a serial, so right click on your windows bar, or whatever we call it :)
7) Now click on ""Start Task Manager""
8) End the setup.exe process and it should end the setup from there.
9) Now, go to ""Computer"", ""Focus Home Interactive"", and copy the files from the ""Crack"" folder into that folder. NOTE: Do NOT copy the folder itself, open the Crack folder and copy both the ""Cities XL 2012"" file and the ""rld.dll"" file, and paste it and replace all files it asks you to. From there double click on the Cities XL 2012 link, and the game should load.
If it doesn't load, then you either misplaced a step, or your computer version/OS may be different from mine, and you may need alternate instructions. "

,jcry_14,2012-05-09T00:42Z,It runs fine but when I reached 900k citizen it lags as hell. I got AMD phenom II black x6 core and gtx 460 2gb and 12gb ram.
,Chrisk08,2012-05-11T01:06Z,Does anyone know if the crack works in Ubuntu 12.04? I know the games works fine in wine but my friend couldn't figure out the crack and now I'm trying again. Any help would be awesome. If anyone can figure it out and it's different then the windows instructions then please include though too. Thanks
