This book provides an up-to-date and comprehensive account of aromatic chemistry. A series of chapters describes the synthesis and reactions of the major functional derivatives of benzene and the more common polycyclic systems. The concepts of aromaticity and the mechanism of aromatic substitution are discussed, as is the use of metals in the synthesis of aromatic compounds. Throughout, emphasis is placed on mechanisms. Worked problems and questions are provided to aid understanding.

In addition to providing material required by an undergraduate studying chemistry, Aromatic Chemistry is also ideal for industrial chemists seeking to update their knowledge of this important aspect of chemistry.
