,Brainsnack,2011-10-19T13:29Z,"Thanks to extremezone and MAXSPEED. The quality definitely isn't as good as I've come to expect from MAX, but it could be watchable for many up to some screen sizes.

A/7
V/7   (Dark and grainy. Quality varies depending on screen size; on a 42"" screen it would score about a 6, maybe less.)

BOTTOM LINE:

If you're going into this file hoping for a smooth experience like i.e. Cars 2 (video-wise, the movie itself wasn't too great) or any other recent movie, you're going to be disappointed. But if you're used to watching stuff in not so great quality, like cams or TS, than this will be very watchable for sure."

awesome torrent though! sample looks good. a-9 v-9"
,snowbirds,2011-12-02T03:57Z,"Please people, just rate the Audio and Video quality based on the the Audio and Video quality.

Don't rate it based on your personal feelings for the uploader.  That doesn't help anyone.  

If you are in love with the uploader, write him a poem or something.

And for those people who write negative comments about an uploader because you don't like the quality, you're being rude.  Comment on quality and keep your emotions out of it, because, like so many people say, it's free.

For those of you who are constantly whining about the people who leave negative comments, don't you realize that you are doing the same thing they're doing?  Here's an idea: practice what you preach.  Give it a try!

Thank you to Extremezone for being an awesome uploader!  [even though you're not always totally honest about the quality]

And thanks to that core group who write very useful A/V ratings, so I know whether to download or not."
,nazgull2k10,2011-12-02T22:59Z,"Its the same as every other Harry Potter movie..  everyone else does all the work, Harry barely lifts a finger, and gets all the credit.

Even the ""epic"" final battle is a total joke.. they run around in circles, then fly around in circles, then someone ELSE (again..) kills the snake and bad guy goes gimp.. enabling a 5 year old to beat him.

Weak ass ending to a weak ass movie series.  Thank god its over."

,ironymon,2011-12-08T09:45Z,"Kinda disappointed, I wanted the fight to be ""bloody hell"" type lol. Instead ""The one who must not be named"" VOLDEMORT just turned into confetti. The fights were alright but even with 2 part movie they failed to get every detail, they even made it worse than single part movie. Everything went so fast in part 2 it was one scene after another, not a single character got enough screen time despite the movie being split into two parts, they shouldve shot this once and right 1 movie 3 or more hours not 2 parts. As for twilight copycat bitch, it's not even worth watching, fuckin teen movies. Upload 10 V 10 A 10 M 7 STORY 10."
