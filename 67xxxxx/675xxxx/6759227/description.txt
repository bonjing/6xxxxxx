One man becomes a deadly strike force in this crackling action-thriller starring new martial-arts sensation Jeff Speakman.
Speakman plays a drifter and kenpo karate expert who returns home to discover his mentor has been murdered by a ruthless drug lord.
Determined to avenge the killing, he must contend with the cop assigned to the case - his long estranged brother.
Caught between the arm of the law and his own code of honour, Speakman heads toward a final showdown with a sadistic assasin.

Please note, this film has been transferred from Laserdisc, so picture quality is not as good as a DVD, but should be better than the VHS transfers.
Also I've taken some care to encode the film at a reasonable bitrate so it shouldn't be ruined by compression artifacts.
