Krazy Kart Racing game Hints:
â€¢ Red bells give you random weapons while blue bells always give you a speed boost. Consider the layout of the track ahead of you as well as your position in the race and select which bell to go for accordingly.
â€¢ If you are having problems completing a race, try it out with different characters. Some courses are made for high-speed, some are not.
â€¢ Save your boosts for the optimal moment. Sometimes you will be able to clear obstacles that would otherwise be impossible. Itâ€™s quicker to go over something than around it.
â€¢ If you have trouble staying on course try using Robbie the Rabbit. Heâ€™s a bit slow but easiest to control.
