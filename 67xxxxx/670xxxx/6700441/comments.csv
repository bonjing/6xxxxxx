,LuigiVuoto,2011-09-28T15:53Z,"I saw Triple-H do Richard III with the Royal Shakespeare Company and it was magnificent.  He was also great on Broadway in Hairspray singing the part of Link.

This should be another Oscar contending performance from the great Triple-H.

Thank you, extremezone.  "
,Tomstoon,2011-09-28T17:46Z,"Thanks uploader!

Great quality.
Although was hoping to see more action from Triple H in the film, but isn't as bad as i thought it would be! "
,y3n007,2011-09-28T19:30Z,Hahahaha Triple H I pass on this one.....you know I do not know whhy all this wrestlers even though they did plenty of acting while wrestling they still cannot act in movies......
,cole90,2011-09-28T21:19Z,"I want ""Inside Out"" (Directed by Taylor Rummell)
comedy, but I cant find  not this shit "
,Balthesaur,2011-09-28T23:28Z,"Judging by the bio, this movie sounds a bit like The Condemned, with Steve Austin. Wrestlers know they are in a dying 'sport' and are branching out to do movies. 

Meh, the Condemned wasn't bad...   will give this one a look.

I won't comment on the quality; with Extremezone, you are never disappointed! Viva la awesome"

Fuckin' letdown.... There is only a 20sec fight scene in the whole movie so dun be fooled by Triple H on the cover..... and Triple doesn't even shoot a single bullet in the whole movie.... 
Its kinda all messed up story which won't even make sense at a point near the ending.... "
,ashen77,2011-09-30T02:28Z,"what a pile of STEAMING shit! Having said that, he's a better actor then Hulk Hogan... and look at how many movies that cunts been in. I wonder if its possible to commit genocide to wrestlers? I'm fairly sure if Hitler had been around for WWF those poor Jewish folks wouldnt of looked so bad. Turn the ovens back on boys!! we're back in business!"
,the-dude1982,2011-09-30T21:57Z,"LOL i dont know why so much complaining from guys.....But at least give it credit to HHH that he's entertaining unlike that yabba dabba fruit loops bitch John The Cocksucker Cena.
And i know you guys will say HHH used to be like Cena,but HHH was from the attitude era along with some of those legends who're alive or dead yet Cena will never be a legend,cause he'll & still be remembered as DOUCHEBAGER"
