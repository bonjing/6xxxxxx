Jour de FÃªte [1949]
Black and white & color version.

NOTE: The movie was originally filmed in both black-and-white and Thomson-
color, an early and untried color film process. In using both formats, Tati
feared that Thomson-color might not be practicable, a concern that proved well-
founded after the Thomson firm went bankrupt before the film could be
processed. Tati then released the black-and-white version (which features
occasional short bursts of colour, hand-coloured by Tati directly onto the
frames). In 1995, new technology allowed the restoration of the color copy,
which was finished and released by Tati's daughter Sophie Tatischeff
and cinematographer FranÃ§ois Ede.


Jour de fÃªte tells the story of an inept and easily distracted French mailman
who frequently interrupts his duties to converse with the local inhabitants,
as well as inspect the traveling fair that has come to his small community.
Influenced by too much wine and a newsreel account of rapid transportation
methods used by the United States postal system, he goes to hilarious
lengths to speed the delivery of mail while aboard his bicycle.
