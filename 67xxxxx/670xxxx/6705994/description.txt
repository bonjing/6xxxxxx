 Gok's Clothes Roadshow sees Gok taking to the streets as he takes his show on 
 the road in an effort to teach women how to dress based on their body-shape.  
                                                                               
 Gok travels to Liverpool, where with just a budget of 50 to create an entire 
 outfit, he attempts to give three women a makeover. His team of road-testers  
 put coloured skinny jeans through their paces.                                
                                                                               
                                 Enjoy!
