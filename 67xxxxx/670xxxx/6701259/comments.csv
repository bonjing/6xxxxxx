Program was trying to execute IMFT.exe from my /temp folder (which AVG flagged as a trojan) so I quarantined it. Tried it again and this time it flagged setup.exe as malware. Decided to allow just for the hell of it and nothing happened--it just quit. I assume it's crashing when it can't find IMFT. Tried running other relevant EXEs on the disc and all close without a word except for the primary MSI which crashes after telling me I need to use setup.exe to install the game.

So yeah, I have no doubt the game can be isntalled, but my computer was telling me I had to o.k. a trojan to do it."
