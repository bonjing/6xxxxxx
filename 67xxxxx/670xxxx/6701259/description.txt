Rome: Total Warâ„¢ is the next generation of epic strategy games covering the period of Rome's expansion into an empire from 273BC to 14AD. 

There was nothing inevitable about Rome's eventual greatness. It was the most successful of a group of Italian city-states that owed much of their culture to Greek invaders. Rome had succeeded in dominating the nearby cities, but the relationship was uneasy for generations, and there had been rebellions by subjugated neighbours. By 273 BC, however, Rome was mighty enough to challenge Carthage for supremacy in the Mediterranean. It was to fight three long and bloody wars against the Carthaginians and their allies, each time managing to expand Roman influence as a result. 

The Punic Wars (from "Poeni", the name the enemy used for themselves) did not always go well for Rome. Hannibal, for example, took a Carthaginian army all the way from Spain, over the Alps and then rampaged across Italy. He seemed unstoppable. But in each war - and even facing a military genius like Hannibal - Rome managed to turn the strategic situation to her advantage. Carthage was eventually entirely crushed, the city was demolished and the fields were sown with salt. Rome was equally merciless with other neighbours when opposed.
