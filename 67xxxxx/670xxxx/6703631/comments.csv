,Pimbax,2011-09-26T22:31Z,"Ye, i didnt tested yet.

But this release is from ALI213.. So it should work i think."
,blokovi,2011-09-26T22:36Z,just dl the game if you wanted......im not downloading game for now because im not sure its fake or not
,RasherX,2011-09-26T22:36Z,"Fake... ALI's Repack has 9.27 GB.. I'm downloading it from his official website...

SO THIS IS FAKE!"
,RasherX,2011-09-26T22:38Z,"Sorry.. I'm wrong... my bad... this is 5Gb becouse it has no Crack+Patch... the other wiht 9GB has both of themm

so so sorry this is ok.. but you need the crack"
,Kewelll,2011-09-26T22:45Z,"It's legit, I think. At least Ali213 has released two different (working) versions, and the size of this torrent matches the size of the first release. "
,Piccy997,2011-09-26T22:48Z,Is it possible to play career and tournament mode? or its still unavailable ? ;S
,gameover93,2011-09-26T22:53Z,fake or no ? Please say no ;d

,zlatan1101,2011-09-26T22:57Z,how are we suppose to play it if there is no crack or patch?
,zlatan1101,2011-09-26T23:01Z,where can I find the torrent with the crack and patch? Im downloadin this one and it says its gonna take like 5 days to download it
,zlatan1101,2011-09-26T23:03Z,anyone has a torrent with crack?
,Piccy997,2011-09-26T23:05Z,"Is this release:

working and not fake and can you play career and tournament mode? anyone downloaded it be4?"
,zlatan1101,2011-09-26T23:08Z,people seed!!!!!
,Pimbax,2011-09-26T23:10Z,"I cant find the ""Crack only""

Download and see it for yourself."
,Dominick123,2011-09-26T23:11Z,"What Is Ali's Official Website So I Can Download From it instead?! , Someone Answer Please!!!"
,zlatan1101,2011-09-26T23:11Z,Im downloadin that one u posted right now. I dont know. I doubt it's real coz the game release is tomorrow
,zlatan1101,2011-09-26T23:12Z,just google this FIFA.12.Incl.Patch1.Muiti13.Digital.Deluxe.Edition-ALI213
,zlatan1101,2011-09-26T23:13Z,google it FIFA.12.Incl.Patch1.Muiti13.Digital.Deluxe.Edition-ALI213
,Pimbax,2011-09-26T23:13Z,"And answering to RasherX.

I seriously doubt that any crack would be so big.

The deluxe edition may have other bonus.. I dont know. But i doubt that those plus 4gb are actualy the crack itself.

I really doubt."
,SV9Pato,2011-09-26T23:16Z,RasherX where can I get the ali213 working official english version with crack 
,Pimbax,2011-09-26T23:17Z,"Btw, i can easily upload this file ""[NetShowBT]【09.27.11】[FIFA.12.Incl.Patch1.Muiti13.Digital.Deluxe.Edition-ALI213]""

I simply dont know if its worthy or if i am actualy desrespecting any Scene group or uploader.

So.. Sorry."
,zlatan1101,2011-09-26T23:18Z,cant wait to play the game
,Dominick123,2011-09-26T23:21Z,Can Somebody PLEASE Tell Me Where To Download The Game & Crack From Now ?!!!
,zlatan1101,2011-09-26T23:21Z,I really doubt that the crack has 4 GB. I dont know what 2 say. 
,Dominick123,2011-09-26T23:23Z,"@Pimbax - Does The File ""[NetShowBT]【09.27.11】[FIFA.12.Incl.Patch1.Muiti13.Digital.Deluxe.Edition-ALI213]"" Contain The Game & Crack?"
,zlatan1101,2011-09-26T23:24Z,"can anyone tell, should we download this torrent or the other one with 9GB??? "
,zlatan1101,2011-09-26T23:26Z,why is this uploaded if it has no crack in it?
,Pimbax,2011-09-26T23:28Z,"@Dominick123

I really dont know, but i actually dont see why ALI213 would upload even a Repack with so many versions out there without a crack.

Sorry, cant help you man. :X"
,Dominick123,2011-09-26T23:30Z,"I Think I'm Just Going To Download The 9gb Torrent  Hope It Contains A Crack

&@Pimbax- Oh Ok Thanks Anyways Man."
,zlatan1101,2011-09-26T23:32Z,"@Pimbax- does this really work, did you try it out?"
,Sheevz0r,2011-09-26T23:37Z,Pimbax - so can you actually tell what the difference is between this release and the 9 gb deluxe version? is this missing something important ? cutscenes / game modes etc?
,Dominick123,2011-09-26T23:39Z,"I Have Found This File "" [NetShowBT] [09.24.11] [FIFA.12] [FIFA 12 PC English the official version] "" ..which is 7.7 Gb ; Seems Good To Me But Idk?"
,Dominick123,2011-09-26T23:43Z,Why So Many Leechers?
,Pimbax,2011-09-26T23:45Z,It has already some seeders.. So.
,zlatan1101,2011-09-26T23:46Z,that is what I'm wondering as well. What is the difference between those 2 torrents????
,Dominick123,2011-09-26T23:47Z,.
,Dope.,2011-09-26T23:48Z,Can't wait to play this game. Think I'm going to wait for the RELOADED release though.

^ That Is The File Info .. Can Anyone Tell If It Contains Crack Or Not?"
,zlatan1101,2011-09-26T23:51Z,did anyone manage this one to download it?
,zlatan1101,2011-09-26T23:53Z,"@Dominick - I think the game is already installed, so you got just to play it. I dont think that a upload of 9.3 GB is the whole game. I suppose, just download and play, no installation"
,zlatan1101,2011-09-27T00:02Z,I dont get it what for is this bin file and only 12MB big in this torrent?
,info0,2011-09-27T00:05Z,"9.3GB version contains the crack. ALI213 is Chinese guy.

If anyone has fast speed to upload it... :("
,Dominick123,2011-09-27T00:09Z,@info0 - are you 100% sure it contains the crack?
,zlatan1101,2011-09-27T00:13Z,there are almost no seeders for the 9 GB version
,zlatan1101,2011-09-27T00:20Z,the download is so sloooowww
,Dominick123,2011-09-27T00:21Z,Wow That's Ass .. Does Anybody Know If The 9Gb version Contains The Crack To Play All Modes??!!
,zlatan1101,2011-09-27T00:22Z,Did anyone download this torrent and tried it out? My connection is so slow 
,zlatan1101,2011-09-27T00:25Z,"I managed to download 4% and opened the zipped file, I dont see any folder named crack or similar"
,Dominick123,2011-09-27T00:26Z,@grainkain90 - can you play all modes?
,zlatan1101,2011-09-27T00:27Z,@Realazio - yes I am ex yu :))) @grainkain is the game working????
,zlatan1101,2011-09-27T00:33Z,is it working?
,zlatan1101,2011-09-27T00:34Z,I knew it! I guess the 9GB version is with crack then
,zlatan1101,2011-09-27T00:36Z,@Realazion - Bosna i Hercegovina here :))) so the game doesnt work
,Dominick123,2011-09-27T00:42Z,Does Anyone Know If 9Gb Contains Crac So I Can Download It?
,info0,2011-09-27T00:42Z,"Yes I am 100% sure. Checked their forums. Saying the crack will be available ~8 their time. Which is now.

And ALI 9.3GB release definitely works for us (all modes unlocked), Chinese guys must still wait (30.09) as game uses some SONY DADC protection or something :(."
,zlatan1101,2011-09-27T00:42Z,"So this is the game without crack, I knew it, so I wonder if its worth to download that 9GB version"
,zlatan1101,2011-09-27T00:44Z,@Info0 - why did he uploaded this shit on his website because it doesnt work!
,Dominick123,2011-09-27T00:45Z,?
,Dominick123,2011-09-27T00:47Z,So Should I Download The 9Gb one?
,zlatan1101,2011-09-27T00:47Z,I hope this version with 9GB works
,zlatan1101,2011-09-27T00:49Z,thnx Info0 i really hope it works. Could someone seed there I got only 3 seeders
,Piccy997,2011-09-27T00:51Z,"i'm croatian, too :D and i just downloading this 9gb version, hope it works with no problems :D and hope it allows you to play career and tournament mode :D"
,zlatan1101,2011-09-27T00:53Z,I think EA Sports are making it almost inpossible to crack the game normally like it used to be thats why the crack is so big or modified. I dont really know. I dont really give a shit bout it unless the game is working and the players have eyes :)
,Dominick123,2011-09-27T00:54Z,@info0 - aree all modes available?
,zlatan1101,2011-09-27T01:00Z,someone should upload the other torrent with 9GB
,Sheevz0r,2011-09-27T01:14Z,I just hope info0 isnt just some advertiser of chinese torrents....=-] couldnt make heads or tails out of their forums even after translation
,joonkimdds,2011-09-27T01:14Z,Where can u guys find 9gb? cuz i can't find.
,Dominick123,2011-09-27T01:17Z,@Piccy997 - did it work & Contain all game modes?

,bloodred125,2011-09-27T03:46Z,"just wait people seriously. Screw downloading anything that doesnt have the career mode, the ONLY mode thats good playing single player."
,mikeben86,2011-09-27T04:11Z,I just don't understand why you guys can't wait two days til the disc comes out cause we'll have a copy with a no-dvd crack in no time.
,zamuray,2011-09-27T04:47Z,I have the solution for the crack......buy the key...its only 20 bucks or less.
,clownfifa,2011-09-27T07:06Z,damn dont download waith few more days and download real torrent damn --.--
,zlatan1101,2011-09-27T07:57Z,"I knew it, all fucked up. Just wait people, someone will post the real torrent today"
,zlatan1101,2011-09-27T08:14Z,I dont know how somebody can be so stupid and post on his website the torrent which is not working. I dont understand people. 
,zlatan1101,2011-09-27T08:21Z,"guys, btarena hasnt annoucned any fifa yet, so just wait there I think during the day its gonna show up there"
,Mr0life,2011-09-27T08:45Z,"The game is already out in Poland but it's impossible to install before the official release (30.09, 1am) so a regular no-dvd crack wouldn't help right now anyway. You can't even install it from the original DVD, lol >.>"
,d3rut4,2011-09-27T08:53Z,the problem is the  SONY DADC ... the game is surely working if you can pass through this shit ckecking.
,zlatan1101,2011-09-27T09:17Z,"I dont think the game is out, Europe 29th sep and NA 27th sep so just wait untill today bout 4pm I hope someone is gonna load it up "
,Kewelll,2011-09-27T09:50Z,"It's not officially released in Europe yet, but Fifa 12 is available in some stores already. A friend of mine is playing the PS3 version as we speak, actually. The PC version is far more problematic due to the relese date control, and there are parts of the installation which remain partly crypted until it passes the Sony DADC. I'm no expert of cracking games (= I don't understand the process at all), but I'd assume that soon as somone has his installation/ .exe file encrypted in NA, we can expect a proper crack."
,Mr0life,2011-09-27T09:50Z,"@Zlatan
It's already in some stores in Poland but it's impossible to install untill 30.09. I'm afraid we'll have to wait until then :l"
,zlatan1101,2011-09-27T10:46Z,okay! I hope someone from NA is gonna post a torrent file so we can download it
,zlatan1101,2011-09-27T11:00Z,does anyone know how the website eurozone with torrent go?
,Millerdis100,2011-09-27T11:24Z,"Search from google: FIFA 12 [MULTI5] [PCDVD] [NO SCENE]

it's okay. I will confirm later if i get this working."
,info0,2011-09-27T11:58Z,"Yup the Ali 9.3GB didn't work for me either :(.

It's a shame some people are playing PC version now in North America and Hong Kong/Taiwan! Why is EU screwed up ;("
