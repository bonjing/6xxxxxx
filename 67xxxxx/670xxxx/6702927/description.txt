Storyline:

During the Second World War, onboard a small insignificant ship in the U.S. Pacific Fleet, an event occurs unlike any that 
the United States Navy has ever experianced. A Ship's Captain is removed from his command by his Executive Officer in an 
apparent outright act of mutiny. As the trial of the mutineers unfold, it is then learned that the Captain of the ship was 
mentally unstable, perhaps even insane. The Navy must then decide: was the Caine Mutiny a criminal act? Or an act of 
courage to save a ship from destruction at the hands of her Captain.

*I don't take requests because I don't have time and everyone will fill the comment section with them instead of commenting about quality and other tehnical specs of the movies or say thanks.Thank you for understanding!
*For best performance I suggest you use KMPlayer(find it with google) for playback
*These movies were made especially for PC and they don't play on a PS3.If you want to re-encode for PS3 or test for other devices be my guests.
*I'll ask everybody to stop with the "it doesn't work","it's out of sync" comments because I tested the movies before I uploaded them and they work fine.
