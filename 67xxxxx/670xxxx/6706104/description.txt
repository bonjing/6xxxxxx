Synopsis:
-----------

35 "Hard Target"   TBA 693-035 

Rex goes to Hong Kong, China (by sneaking through Breach's portals) to help Tuck, Sqwydd, 
Cricket and Circe to stop Quarry, who was freed from Providence prison by Breach 
(which was difficult because they were in an area in which Breach's powers were having interference), 
as Van Kleiss has a proposition for Quarry and his unique abilities. Meanwhile, Rex is having really 
uncomfortable difficulties with Circe being a fully welcomed fourth member of his former gang. 
Elsewhere (while Breach follows Rex and kidnaps Circe), Providence forces are under attack by 
Quarry using an incredibly strong and powerful mysterious weapon called a molecular destabilzer. 
Rex goes to stop him before he completely destroys Providence. Quarry uses the molecular destabilizer 
to disintegrate Rex's active nanites and plans to sell the molecular destabilizer in order to get 
immunity from even Van Kleiss. Fortunately, the Omega-One Nanite's self-replicating function 
continues to supply him with more and more nanites and make a new build (a smaller set of the Smack 
Hands but capable of making super-energized molecular energy shields). With the new build, 
Rex was able to redirect the destabilizer's blast unto itself and destroy it. Then, Rex was 
able to negotiate with Breach (she was still following Rex) into a deal: Breach releases 
Circe from her private dimension and Rex not only doesn't tell Van Kleiss of this adventure
(Rex managed to get a recording of Quarry and Breach's conversation, during which she told him everything), 
but Breach gets to blame this entire crime on Quarry(something Breach was happy about but Quarry was in disagreement).
