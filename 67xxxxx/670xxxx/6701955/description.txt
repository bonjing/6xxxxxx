Notes:

Bobby Ray Simmons, Jr. (born November 15, 1988), also known by his stage name B.o.B, is an American rapper, singer-songwriter and record producer. He is currently signed under the labels of Grand Hustle Records, Rebel Rock Entertainment, and Atlantic Records. He was born on November 15, 1988 in Winston-Salem, North Carolina but grew up in Decatur, Georgia. Although his parents wanted him to continue his education, Simmons decided in sixth grade that he wanted to pursue a music career. His father, a pastor, disapproved of his son\\\'s choices until he realized that Simmons was using music as a form of therapy and a creative outlet. B.o.B first began to gain major recognition at the start of 2007, and has rapidly escalated his popularity via various singles such as \\\"Airplanes\\\" (featuring Hayley Williamsâ€‹) and \\\"Nothin\\\' on You\\\" (featuring Bruno Mars), and his debut album, The Adventures of Bobby Ray, released on April 27, 2010. He has officially declared his upcoming album 90% done, although its title remains TBA.

Comments:

Scanned for viruses using Kaspersky 2011, BitDefender 2011, and Norton Security Suite 2009 for the hell of it: results were negative.
I literally spent weeks painstakingly amassing all of B.o.B\\\'s personal work and collaborations into one single discography. Each song has full metadata, each album has all album artwork available, and the discography has all the mixtapes, ep\\\'s and albums he\\\'s ever produced. I wounldn\\\'t do this if I didn\\\'t love you all (and, of course, B.o.B)--so don\\\'t be a hater (but still leave comments).

Fun Facts:

B.o.B played the trumpet in his school band from elementary school through high school.
