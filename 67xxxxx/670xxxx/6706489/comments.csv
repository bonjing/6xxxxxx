,Ludwig55,2011-09-28T09:30Z,"Hello,

whoever took those pics started to whip away colours out of his pics with Virginia today. It's unprofessional in the third or fourth degree to pose a pale white skinned girl in white clothes in front of a white background! There are two (or three) black points moving in a white rectangle called ""photo"", 'cause of Virginia's black hair and boots. This is not ""no contrast"", this is ""nothing"". Please, please stop producing camouflage pics like this! Ella, Sandra, and Virginia deserved to be seen on their photos! (I'm still angry about the photographer, so sorry about those harsh words.)

Thank You and three cheers to WMI for his great work (and of course +1)!

Greetings
Ludwig55"

,tobydog22,2011-09-29T22:56Z,"I haven't been here in awhile. I see you're still still clamoring over these girls. I personally don't think they're all that hot. Just average women who look like everyday housewives. They're not ugly, just average. Instead of making a fuss over average, why not put some pressure on Newstar and Tinymodels. Diana/Amber has turned 18 and is of ""legal"" age now, and I suspect, a few others
on these sites. With a couple of exceptions, in my
opinion, Tinymodels/Newstar girls are 10 times more appealing than Fame Girls AND with far more sophisticated photographers. Pictures of 18 year old Diana and others should be posted here and their studios pressured to do topless and nudes. Now THAT is something I could sink my uhh...teeth into!!"
[T],webmodelsindex,2011-09-29T23:29Z,"Newstar Diana only updates once a week, compared to Fame-Girls updating 3 times a week, which gives you more bang for your buck. The Fame-Girls models also have slips and such, which some people like.

But the main reason is because the Fame-Girls site clearly states that the models are all over the age of 18. Newstar Diana doesn't have that posted, and therefor can't be posted here because there is no way to prove she is over 18.

Personally however, I don't really like Diana. She just doesn't appeal to me. Though Virginia and Ella, I do like.

Tell you what. When Diana steps up her game, when her photos become more than a clothing catalog, and her site clearly posts that shes over 18, then I'll start posting her here. Deal? :P"
,tobydog22,2011-09-30T08:28Z,"webmodelsindex,
First, let me thank you for your speedy response  to my comments, and then for your diligent posting of these girls each and every week. Your hard work is appreciated! 
Technically, Diana updates twice a week because
Diana and Amber are the same girl. Also Fame-Girls only have three models updating once a week each, whereas Newstar/Tinymodels have many, many more with at least one updating every day of the week.
When I mentioned putting pressure on Newstar/ Tinymodels, I wasn't implying YOU should do it (You do enough by yourself already). I was implying that we girl lovers should demand from  all of them more ""bang for the buck"" as you put it.
I agree with you and understand that these sites
have to post a disclaimer of over 18 in order to be posted here but as I said Diana IS over 18 and I suspect several other Newstar/ Tinymodels are also. The real reason they don't publish up-to-date
photos is because of the backlog of of photo sets they have on hand. To illustrate, let me ask ""How long does it take for a zit to heal?""Two weeks, tops? One of the Newstar models developed a zit seven months ago and the new sets that are coming out weekly still shows the zit! That shows that long after a model reaches maturity, they will still sell us the underage nn stuff unless we quit buying. That's what Fame-girls did until sales lagged, but now I think they are weaving in some of the underage sets to perpetuate the site.
Newstar/Tinymodels filter in some gorgeous slips sometimes and get away with it. I guess that's why they're called ""slips""
You don't have to make a deal with me wmi, because I know you'll always do your best! You're 
gold around here.
By the way, my favorite fame girl is Ella. Her new set (166) has just posted and since I LLLOOOOVE
pussy, this is going to be my favorite set thus far.
That ""THING"" looks to be too high to be a tampon string. I hope it's not a clit ring though. I think that cheapens a girl. Looks to me to just be a peice of lint that's hanging on for dear life! So much for the photographer not paying attention to detail!"
