,CrownMeKing,2012-04-21T20:59Z,"Did not work for me. It loads on a USB drive, however, I cannot install it because it's incompatible with my mobo drivers.
I tried burning it to a DVDR and installing it and I get a ""not a bootable disk"" error."
,dark4m,2012-04-22T07:25Z,"Dear mate
I think you have burnd it as a data dvd
if so it would not be a bootable like that
you need to burn it a with an imige burner like burn iso imege to dvd
using one of the iso apps...
hope it  will solv your  problim.
take care..."

sillytoad
you welcome 
MueenHasan
1st u can hit shift+ctrl+escape to get the task maniger
2nd random crashes is mostly  a hardware matter if it still hapins
after a clean format  & the best start is clean the CPU cooling  aeria from the  long time  use if it is an old computer 
it works for me most of the time
or if u dont know how to do it get some help
hope works for u eather
you all have a good times
