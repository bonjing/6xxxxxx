,au55ies2,2011-10-02T02:06Z,"Firstly, thanks to all involved in producing this file.
However, this has a non-standard VBR audio stream of less than 128kbps, using ""Writing Application: Lavf53.2.0"", according to MediaInfo.
This audio will not play on some hardware media players, including PopcornHour. It can be fixed by remuxing with say, AviDemux, but it's a PITA.
To LOL encoders, only some of you are doing this. Could you please use another app, such as transcode-1.0.6, that doesn't cause this problem, as was used for Ep 1.   
Once again, thanks."
