Description:
============

            This world consists of two dimensions joined as one, like a mirror. The first is the world in which the humans live, Assiah. The other is the world of demons, Gehenna. Ordinarily, travel between the two, and indeed any kind of contact between the two, is impossible. However the demons can pass over into this world by possessing anything that exist within it. Satan the god of demons, but there's one thing that he doesn't have, and that's a substance in the human world that is powerful enough to contain him!! For that purpose he created Rin, his son from a human woman, but will his son agree to his plans? Or will he become something else...? An exorcist?

Episode List and Details:
=========================

01 	"The Devil Resides in Human Souls"

Rin Okumura is a teenager with a natural gift to get himself in trouble. Despite that he tries his best to meet the expectations of his twin brother Yukio and Priest Shiro Fujimoto, who acts as their guardian, until he finally learns about the dark secret behind his origin. 

02 	"Gehenna Gate"

Fujimoto and his companions try their best to protect Rin from the demons who are after him, but Fujimoto ends up being possessed by Satan, the most powerful of the demons and Rin's father. Seeing his guardian taking his own life to protect him, Rin decides to fight back by unlocking his demonic powers, even though he knows that by doing so he will not be able to live as a human anymore. 

03 	"Brothers"

As part of his training to become an Exorcist, Rin gets himself enrolled at the True Cross Academy by the school chairman, Mephisto Pheles. On his first day of classes, Rin becomes shocked to know that Yukio not only always knew about his secret, but also is already a graduated Exorcist and will be one of his teachers. 

04 	"The Garden of Amahara"

Yukio sets out to the school's Exorcist-only shop to stock on some supplies along with Rin. There they find that the owner's daughter, Shiemi Moriyama, is being afflicted by a demon that dwells in her family's garden and, to save her life, they confront it by themselves. 

05 	"A Boy from the Cursed Temple"

Having Shiemi as a new classmate, Rin's total disregard for classes brings forth the anger of another classmate of his, Ryuji Suguro, aka "Bon". After learning of Bon's story, Rin finds that they have more in common than he would like to admit. 

06 	"The Phantom Chef"

Rin and Yukio find that Ukobach, a cooking familiar (appointed by Mephisto Pheles to aid them), is responsible for the meals that are prepared for both of them each day. They also learn how Ukobach can be dangerous when someone disrespects his cooking. 

07 	"A Flock of Plovers"

Eager to make new friendships, Shiemi asks her classmate Izumo Kamiki to be her friend and she pretends to agree, but Rin soon realizes Izumo is just taking advantage of Shiemi's kindness instead. Later, the students are reunited at the old dormitory to take part in the Esquire exam, where a ghoul attacks Izumo and her friend Paku by surprise and it's up to Rin and Shiemi to protect them. 

08 	"Now a Certain Man Was Sick..."

Still troubled after her friend Paku decides to leave the Exorcist lessons, Kamiki gets involved in a fight with Bon and the entire class end up punished by Yukio. Just after Yukio leaves for a mission, the students are attacked and cornered by the same ghoul from yesterday. While trying to help the others, Rin learns that the monster was sent by Igor Neuhaus, one of his teachers who wanted to confirm that he is the son of Satan. 

09 	"Memories"

Mephisto Pheles reveals to the students that the ghoul attack was actually part of the Esquire exam and how they dealt with the threat will count as part of their evaluation. Yukio confronts Neuhaus about his reasons to force Rin to use his demonic powers during the exam and he claims that all he did was under Mephisto's orders. However, it does not take much for Yukio to realize Neuhaus' real intentions.

Father Shiro's familiar, Kuro, goes berserk after hearing that its master has died. Yukio is summoned to deal with it and Rin tags along with him despite his objections.

Uploader Notes:
===============
                  The size of the files are very small and anyone will surely think that this is very bad quality. Well, it is not. Speedy Joe's files are all 'mp4' format and so the videos are good even in small files. If you ask me, I would give this a rating of 10 in Audio and 8 in Video. For best results, use VLC Player.
