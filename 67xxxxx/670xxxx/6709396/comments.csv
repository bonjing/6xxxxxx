It also make me think of one gangster movie where a guy is with a criminal in a car and he is forced to take a pill. Was he a comedian or sth? If he didn't behave, the criminal would get dangerously agitated. I remember Dave Chapelle making a parody sketch about it ""Ima have to slap a bitch ..."" when he was at the Hooker ""ATM""s. Pretty funny.... but I don't remember the name of that movie ..."
,killyourself,2011-10-01T00:37Z,@lordquad I think you might've dreamt that.. haha
,lordquad,2011-10-03T23:52Z,"No it's not a dream, Dave Chapelle made a parody sketch about it a few years ago, the name was ""Dave Chapelle with Wayne Brady"". For some reason I cannot submit lilnks here but you can for example look up video zkwTzy7T_Lw on youtube, or search for Dave Chappelle and Wayne Brady.

This was just a parody sketch, the question however is what is it a parody of? The original movie is very much real but the name of that movie has totally escaped my memory."
