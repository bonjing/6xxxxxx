,jvezirian,2011-09-30T11:05Z,Hey how do you get this to play full screen?
[T],DjAligator14,2011-09-30T12:08Z,when you enter the game it appears a window with configuration. Choose full screen.
,Bromium,2011-09-30T17:34Z,"I've been having the same issue with full screen. It doesn't matter if that box is checked or not it still plays in a window. 

Not that I'm complaining over a free game like. :P"
[T],DjAligator14,2011-09-30T21:16Z,try alt+enter. For me it works good.
,labcio,2011-10-02T11:59Z,"If you`ve got Win 7 64-bit, run the launcher as administrator to run the game properly. Then the full screen problem disappears, as well as other problems."
,Bromium,2011-10-02T15:48Z,"Haha, setting the launcher to open as admin worked (Windows 7, not 64bit). Thanks for that man. :)"
