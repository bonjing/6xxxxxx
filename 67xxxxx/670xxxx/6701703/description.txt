This is the Robot Chicken Star Wars Trilogy. I re-edited it so that it is almost completely in chronological order. It is now a full length movie. All 3 are from retail sources that I own. If you don't have these dvd's, you should. The shifting aspect ratio is how it is supposed to be. Make sure you watch it til the very end ;) Hope you enjoy!!!
