The Black Eyed Peas
Greatest Hits (2009)




The Black Eyed Peas transcended hip-hop to become one of the most commercially successful pop groups of the 2000s. Their career began modestly, with a pair of albums inspired by the positive-minded likes of A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul. After adding Fergie, the groupâ€™s pop instincts reached full flight. Ignited by the Top Ten hit â€œWhere Is the Love?â€ and the Grammy-winning party anthem â€œLetâ€™s Get It Started,â€ the group scored three multi-platinum albums in 2003â€™s Elephunk, 2005â€™s Monkey Business, and 2009â€™s The E.N.D. (Energy Never Dies). While still connected to hip-hop, the groupâ€™s sound turned toward dance-pop -- a savvy move that transformed them from a cult act to a mainstream phenomenon.
