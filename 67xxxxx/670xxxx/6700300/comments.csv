,dbuploader,2011-09-26T16:24Z,"Tiny picture, so:
v: 5/10

Probably good for an xvid, but bad compared to 264.

Anyone seen an x264 release of this movie? Can't find any."
,fg1011224,2011-09-26T21:08Z,"Excellent quality. I can't hear audio though. Can anyone explain to me why I cant hear any of extremezone's uploads' audio? Other's uploads I can hear fine, but not any from extremezone. I am playing in Windows Media Player."

,rza3rdwrld,2011-09-27T07:21Z,do you guys really think the uploader reads the comments and takes requests? smh
,Jessejames05,2011-09-27T10:38Z,Thanks for all the great Movies you have uploaded. The quality is SUPERB. Can I just ask one question and maybe someone else can answer it.....what application/software do you use to rip these Movies? I have tried various applications like CloneDVD Mobile and Magic DVD Ripper and Daniusoft Video Converter Ultimate.....all haven't given me the quality of picture and the smaller size that you achieve ....mine tend to be grainy and slightly pixelated. Obviously I'm not using the application you are using.....so can you help me.....please?
