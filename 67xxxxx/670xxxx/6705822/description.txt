Foundations of Programming Fundamentals
Author: Simon Allardice
Foundations of Programming: Fundamentals provides the core
knowledge to begin programming in any language. Simon Allardice
uses JavaScript to explore the core syntax of a programming
language, and shows how to write and execute your first
application and understand what s going on under the hood. The
course covers creating small programs to explore conditions
loops, variables, and expressions; working with different kinds
of data and seeing how they affect memory; writing modular code;
and how to debug, all using different approaches to constructing
software applications

Finally, the course compares how code is written in several
different languages, the libraries and frameworks that have
grown around them, and the reasons to choose each one

Topics include:

* Writing source code
* Understanding compiled and interpreted languages
* Requesting input
* Working with numbers, characters, strings, and operators
* Writing conditional code
* Making the code modular
* Writing loops
* Finding patterns in strings
* Working with arrays and collections
* Adopting a programming style
* Reading and writing to various locations
* Debugging
* Managing memory usage
* Learning about other languages
