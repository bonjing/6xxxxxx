Product Description
Odin Zeus McGaffer is back, and more offensive than ever. The highly anticipated follow up to Does God Get Diarrhea? is finally here in all of its disgusting glory. Dive into McGaffer's twisted mind where nothing is sacred and no subject is taboo. Jesus Is Lard offers a slightly different view of religion with hysterical commentary, comedic perspectives, and outrageous artwork. Far from mainstream, this book is sure to offend just about everyone and force the religious to face the absurdities of their claims. It's a swift kick below the belt and a one-way ticket to Hell for those who rest eyes upon this blasphemous text. Warning: This book contains graphic content, foul language, and reason. All of which may be hazardous to your health.

About the Author
Odin Zeus McGaffer was born of a virgin on December 25th over 2,000 years ago. Much of his life remains a mystery, but crackpot theologians believe that he was a virgin carpenter with communist tendencies. McGaffer was murdered by his loving father, rose from the dead, and came back to Earth to consume large quantities of beer and fried cheese sticks. Although there is no solid evidence that supports the claims made in this biography, it cannot be disproven. Therefore you should believe this biography, in it's entirety, without good reason or justification.
