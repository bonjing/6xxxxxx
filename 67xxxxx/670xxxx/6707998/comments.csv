You would be my hero :]

,willyiam,2011-10-11T02:07Z,English dubbed is at episode 100 at the moment. Where does season 5 stop at again? Wasn't it 99? I don't really know but just thought I should let you know. Dubs are in episode 100 right now.

,firefox1121,2011-10-28T07:03Z,"Hey I haven't finished downloading your 4 seasons you have yet but id just like to give you a preemptive thanks because i don't see enough in the comments. Your the only one on PB to upload them season, everyone else is doing it by episode and you make it very easy. Thanks again and judging from the screenshot you posted and other comments im sure the quality will be good.  One question though, How bout that comment on season 1 from that guy that said there was a trojan in episode 17? whats that about?"
,Pixels1080,2011-10-28T16:32Z,"@ firefox1121 

first of all Thanks man , and about the comment in season 1 torrent am sure that all my files are clean,if you think Ep 17 is infected with some kind of trojan do not download to protect your self other wise its your call anyway. i just deliver"
