Description E01:
Justin Rowlatt and Anita Rani embark on an epic road trip
around India, navigating chaotic cities and rural bywaters
to discover how a booming car industry is helping to fuel
the country's massive economic growth. Setting off from
Delhi in opposite directions, they have three weeks to
reach Chennai in the south, where they will meet up at
the centre of India's car industry, dubbed the Detroit of
Asia.For her trip Anita is driving a spanking new Indian
made 4x4 across some of the country's thousands of
miles of new motorways to discover a modern India
unrecognisable from 20 years ago. Justin is heading east
in a very different vehicle - a clapped out Hindustan
Ambassador, the iconic symbol of an older India. On the
way he investigates the darker side of this economic
revolution - how pollution is choking the cities and how
hundreds of millions of people are still locked in poverty,
seeming cut off from the huge wealth being generated.
Two journeys full of colour and chaos, glamour and grime,
illustrating what some people think is the birth of a new
super power.

Description E02:
In the conclusion to the two-part documentary, Anita
Rani reaches Mumbai, home to Bollywood stars and site
of some of the world's largest slums, before experiencing
Bangalore's night-life. Justin Rowlatt witnesses the
potential effects of fossil-fuel usage on a delicate
ecosystem, and meets a tribe taking on the car industry
over aluminium-rich, sacred mountains. The pair aim to
finish their journey at the mega-port of Chennai, hoping
their vehicles will survive the final part of the trek.
