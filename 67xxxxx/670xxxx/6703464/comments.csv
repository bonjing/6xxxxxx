To those of you who get that rld.dll error when you try to start, simply EXCLUDE your PES folder, both the one where you have the ISO image and the one you've installed the game and it'll work.

The only problem is that it won't updated to version 1.01 and downloading patch doesn't help because I can't find a crack for version 1.01 of this game.

,solutioN-Ghost,2011-10-18T12:43Z,"Good news ! Found a solution for pes2012.exe has stopped working when come to Avatar :

The point is that you need to:

1. Install PESEdit patch : from pes patch website

2. Once installed you should run the config.exe file AS AN ADMINISTRATOR (C:\Program Files\KONAMI\Pro Evolution Soccer 2012\kitserver\confix.exe) and set-up the following parameters:

*enable aspect ration correction---->Automatic
*enforcecustom resolution-----> set the *resolution you want eg. 1280x720
*enforce picture quality---------> set it to medium or high or low depending on the speed of your computer and the graphical properties
then change the tab to LOD configuration in the screen that is just open. Tick the boxes for PLAYERS(gameplay) and set all the slide bars to the minimu(100.110) then do the same for the box REFEREES(Gameplay).

3.Click on save and close the tab. Now open run the application named manager (also AS AN ADMINISTRATOR) and then just click on ATTACH. Now just go and play PES 2012 but note RUN IT AS AN ADMINISTRATOR."

No, it doesn't effect the location you install your game. It can be anywhere. After you've install the patch and done what I ask you to do in the previous comment, run the game. if it still give you crash in creating an avatar, do the following : right-click pes2012.exe and click Troubleshoot Compatibility. After that, make sure it chooses run this program in compatibility mode for Windows XP (Service Pack 2). Yours may be different or the same.

I'm gonna list down this step-by-step and assuming you're using Windows 7 or Vista. First, download the new patch PESEdit 2.0.1 and install it before reading this guide.

1. Do it again and run them all as Administrator. Run the ""config"" :

Tick Enable aspect ration correction : Automatic
Tick Enable custom resolution : 640x480
Tick Enforce picture quality : Medium

2. Click the next tab ""LOD configuration"" :

Tick all boxes and set it all to the lowest (100.110)

3. Click save and now run ""manager"" as Administrator too, and click Attach. Usually this is automatically done but just in case it hasn't been attached. Exit.

4. Now right-click pes2012.exe and click Properties, under tab Compatibility : 

Tick Run this program in compatibility mode for:
- Choose Windows XP (Service Pack 2) or 3. If it is not available, you'll have to download the drivers from Microsoft. Finally click Apply and OK

5. Now run the game and you'll be able to get through past the Avatar thing. After going to the main menu, exit the game and run again the ""config"" as Admnistrator and finally, under LOD Configuration, untick all boxes to reset it to default. Now run the game and start playing."

I'm gonna list down this step-by-step and assuming you're using Windows 7 or Vista. First, download the new patch PESEdit 2.3 and install it before reading this guide.

1. Do it again and run them all as Administrator. Run the ""config"" :

Tick Enable aspect ration correction : Automatic
Tick Enable custom resolution : 640x480
Tick Enforce picture quality : Medium

2. Click the next tab ""LOD configuration"" :

Tick all boxes and set it all to the lowest (100.110)

3. Click save and now run ""manager"" as Administrator too, and click Attach. Usually this is automatically done but just in case it hasn't been attached. Exit.

4. Now right-click pes2012.exe and click Properties, under tab Compatibility :

Tick Run this program in compatibility mode for:
- Choose Windows XP (Service Pack 2) or 3. If it is not available, you'll have to download the drivers from Microsoft. Finally click Apply and OK

5. Now run the game and you'll be able to get through past the Avatar thing. After going to the main menu, exit the game and run again the ""config"" as Admnistrator and finally, under LOD Configuration, untick all boxes to reset it to default. Now run the game and start playing. "
,solutioN-Ghost,2011-11-29T08:01Z,"@olaswag

P.S - you can find the ""config"" and ""manager"" .exe at where you install PES 2012 and under folder kitserver"

Ok so here goes the screenshots. It's in order. Install PESEdit 2012 Patch 2.6 now.

http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56957.jpg

Open PES 2012 folder and open ""kitserver"" and open config.exe as ADMINISTRATOR

http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56959.jpg

Follow these settings

http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56960.jpg

Tick all and Slide all the S3 to slide all S1,S2,S3 to the minimum to save time :) Finally, SAVE.

http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56961.jpg

Now open manager.exe as ADMINISTRATOR and click Attach. Usually it is automatically attach-ed but just in case like mine not yet attach-ed

http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56962.jpg

SUCCESS!

http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56963.jpg

Now right-click pes2012.exe and click Properties and follow those. Usually no need but just in case.

http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56964.jpg

Now open settings.exe and follow those settings. Screen mode is in Window mode. IMPORTANT!!

http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56965.jpg

Now finally run PES 2012 and as you can see I was able to create my avatar. :)

http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56966.jpg

Now you can edit your Avatar in any way you like, just like mine, cool ! :D But it was in the lowest quality, look at my Avatar's face, it is sol blur! But hang on, it ain't over yet

http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56969.jpg
http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56970.jpg

Now quit your PES 2012 and go back to your PES 2012 and go to ""kitserver"" and open config.exe as ADMINISTRATOR

http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56971.jpg

Simply untick all of them and SAVE !

http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56972.jpg

Now you're ready to play or edit your blur Avatar ! Run the game and go to Personal Data Settings and click your data and you can see your cool Avatar in a better quality like mine above :b

http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56973.jpg

You can even edit your Appearance and other stuffs too !

Now testing the game. Exhibition, my team Liverpool vs Man Utd

http://postimg.com/image/57000/photo-56975.jpg

Game's working fine ! That's it !

NOTE : Every PESEdit 2012 Patch that is released, you need to delete the folder ""kitserver"" before installing, that's why you're going to repeat the above steps on config.exe again ! Have fun"

I tried to run it in different compatibility modes too. Same problem

I normally run into this http://postimg.com/image/58000/photo-57136.jpg pop up when I launch the game. In PES2011 & 2010, I have that response, but I'd just click 'ignore', and it'd run smoothly.

This is the avatar freezing/closing stage http://postimg.com/image/58000/photo-57138.jpg

I checked the 'specifications' tab in 'settings.exe' and saw this http://postimg.com/image/58000/photo-57140.jpg 

I guess my GPU is incompatible at all. But thats supposed to be the job of the crack. I really don't wna have to touch the interior of my laptop (upgrading the VRAM).

You didn't enforce the picture quality to Medium. Change it and try it again.

Nah it's not about your GPU or anything as long as it still can handle it. Mine also the same which is OK, OK, Unable, Unable and I can play it.

Yup there is a save file on ""My Documents"" , ""KONAMI"" folder. I delete that folder so I can create a new save file and new avatar to post that screenshots for you. Now I've already created it, I can upload the save file if you want to.

But I recommend you to try change the settings on config.exe and enforce picture quality to Medium first before that

Both torrents are the same btw so no need to worry"

Thanks a million...I will try to enforce the picture quality to medium. I just thought that the lowest possible settings should be used, at least to overcome the high graphics usage the avatar creation needs to use. 

I also think you should upload the savefile please. Thanks.

Simply untick all of them and SAVE !

NOTE: You must always enforce picture quality to Medium from config.exe to play, otherwise if you play Champions League or other League/Cup, it will hang and eventually crash."

C:\Program Files\KONAMI\Pro Evolution Soccer 2012

sorry for this but its my first download."
,solutioN-Ghost,2012-01-12T16:00Z,"@nonbattie

That's correct. Make sure you put in pes2012.exe as well as rld.dll. Already?"
,fine_wine,2012-01-12T17:45Z,"Yeah its working now...I can't really recall what I did, but I didn't use the savefile! Thanks a lot solutioN-Ghost"
,fine_wine,2012-01-12T17:52Z,"Oh, I was trying to do somethings with PS2 and PC games, I tried to use a PS 2 emulator to play a PS2 game on my PC, but the emulator needed directx9.0c to work with its graphics plugin. So I downloaded and installed it. Then I figured that could've been the problem with my graphics. I then tried the whole installation of PES2012 again using the 2.6PESEdit patch and it worked. Only thing is my graphics card cannot handle the game in full screen, so I put a custom resolution in window mode...


So either directx9.0c was my saviour, or following the steps strictly and carefully was. After I installed directx, the ps2 emulator worked well.


I can now use PES2012.

@vizzarii

If you mean multiplayer as in 2 or more players playing in one PC, then it is possible, just use USB Controller. But if you mean multiplayer as in ""online"" which is most commonly asked question on ThePirateBay about this, you can't. Buy the original game from KONAMI then you can play multiplayer online ^_^"
