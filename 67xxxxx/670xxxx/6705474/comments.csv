The 9/26 Colbert Report was great as well. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6704320

It was a one-hour special with an extended performance by Radiohead."

,eeuropean2000,2011-09-28T09:21Z,"Just a question if anyone knows.  This file downloaded very quickly, I copied it onto a hard disc and linked it to my TV set (a lot bigger than the computer monitor), and three our four minutes in, the video simply froze and would go no further.  That's been happening more and more recently.  Anyone know what might be the problem?  Thanks in advance!"
