Peter Gunn is the epitome of the cool private investigator.  More dapper than most of those in the classic film noir tradition, he is a regular patron at his girlfriend Edie's jazz club.  This is the 1967 revival of the original series as a movie.  The only returning cast are Craig Stevens himself, and the memorable background music by the great composer Henry Mancini.
