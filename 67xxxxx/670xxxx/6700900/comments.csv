,Kaimweir,2011-09-26T07:20Z,"I was looking forward to this weeks download, but then I say the file-size and I thought ""there's no way 1080p would be only 437mb?"" And from the other comments it seems that I am right, so I would really appreciate if you could upload in the same quality as last week. Thanks for uploading though!"
,TorrentGuy96,2011-09-26T17:06Z,"Sorry about the quality change, I didnt realise it when I uploaded, I'll check their mkv from now on

Heres the actual 1080p upload :)
