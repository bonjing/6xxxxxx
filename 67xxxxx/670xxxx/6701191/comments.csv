,praveenkpf25,2011-09-25T22:37Z,download slowly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,brutal_product,2011-09-26T02:22Z,"The major changes include:

- Fixed a bug where all sound would sometimes cut out when the map changes
- Various crash fixes for server and client
- Client performance optimizations
- Single Player Fix - fixed ""double music"" playing when loading the game from a checkpoint
- Added the ability to enable webadmin through the commandline. This will allow you to override what is in the ini files, thus fixing up any issues with inis getting overwritten by updates. To enable webadmin via the commandline add EnableWebAdmin=True to the ""?"" separated commandline parameters. To set the webadmin port add WebAdminPort= to the ""?"" separated commandline parameters."

,SteXDudE,2011-09-26T03:45Z,"Thx, working fine"
,goingmad1,2011-09-26T17:49Z,So we still can't make lan games with bots with this? Too bad because game is not apparently worth a buy for me. After few maps I got bored. First game is much better. Old and dated but better.

Anyone got their hands on a trainer yet? Impossible to find free as far as I can tell."
,Vertutame,2011-10-08T16:46Z,"it's not hard game,you don't have to use a trainer.
if you really need to cheat,try Cheat Engine."
,Deeceness,2011-10-28T23:57Z,"HELP!!
