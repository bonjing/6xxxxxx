,nannigan,2011-11-13T17:37Z,"For some reason the songs don't save toďťż where I sent them (Documents> Spotify Recordings), They go to some file in the hard drive under Dojotech. And when I go to play them or drop them into iTunes, It does nothing. So I imported it into Audacity and it showed that nothing had recorded, it was just 3 minutes of silence. Any help?"
