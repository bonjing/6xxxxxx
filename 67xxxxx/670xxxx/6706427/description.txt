This was the Russian Anaglyph Print, that was a HUGE 7.52 GB file.  The first thing that I did was get this file down to smaller workable size.  Then I had to strip off the Russian Soundtrack and add an English Dolbly Digital 5.1 Soundtrack to this Print.  The Print itself was pretty much flawless, so-to-speak.  But, I did tweak it a little bit.  I brightened it, by running it through a Brighness Filter.  I did this because when viewing 3-D prints, we have to add glasses, and that darkens the print, when viewing it.  I figured that by adding some brightness to it, that it would enhance the viewing experience.  Personally, I like it.  Please note: It takes Magenta and Green glasses to view this print (Like the ones found in retail copies of Coraline or Journey to the Center of the Earth).

Also, I placed Chapter Marks in place.

After Downloading this file, simply use your DVD file burning software (i.e. Nero Burning ROM) to burn to a DVD to view this on any player.

ENJOY!
