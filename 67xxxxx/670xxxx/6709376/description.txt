Neil goes underground to begin planning his fight back against the Fades and as Paul's
terrifying visions continue, Neil takes him to see an ancient Fade, who foresees Paul's
importance in the looming battle. Realising how high the stakes have become, Paul decides
the upcoming school ball will be his big goodbye to his old life. Meanwhile, DC Armstrong
