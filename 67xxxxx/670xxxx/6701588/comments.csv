,Call-Me-Kenneth,2011-11-17T01:24Z,"How the fuck could this have a virus if it only has MP3 files, JPGs and a few inis? 

why cant ppl stop using shit antivirus software and stop being so stupid?

this is a great collection, its even arranged in release order with the extras separated (so you can remove them when you copy to your collection, if you want to.) 

tags are proper and sound quality is more than enought for it being a pirate copy. :D 

tnx for the share."
