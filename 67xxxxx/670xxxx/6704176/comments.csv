this show is underrated.
at first the characters didn't really work that well together but this show is getting good.
and thanks VTV of course."
,liccleminkey4170,2011-09-27T10:34Z,thank you! :)
,1dissident,2011-09-27T12:57Z,"thank you :)

@joo-loved-it 

I agree... I was a little hesitant on this one after the pilot, but persistence has paid off.  This show has definitely gotten better as the season has progressed.  Gary is by far my favourite character - gotta love someone with no filter from their brain to their mouth ;)"

I thought the same, I think it's a great show and I've been here each Tuesday to download the latest. Just hope it doesn't get cancelled.

@VTV

Thanks once again!"

,mikrovision,2011-09-28T04:52Z,I agree. I wasn't into this show at first. The writers tweaked the characters and some excellent special guests began to appear. It's good!

,hiddensight,2011-09-29T00:23Z,"Anyone want to upload a Torrent of All the episodes in one file ? I don't want to clog and clutter my screen with 11 files that could easily be done in one. I'd do it, but I'm not good at hiding myself"

,canuckspud,2011-10-04T01:44Z,"I agree with joo i enjoy the originality of Alphas as well as the characters.  It has been getting better and better in quality.  Gary is definitely my favorite.
Thank you VTV for the up load."
,Nukecell,2011-10-08T09:29Z,S2 was signed for Alphas as well as S3 of Warehouse 13. The 2 best shows on syfy

,KISMO3,2011-10-11T17:58Z,What has happened to episode 12?
,11western,2011-10-14T04:42Z,"@kismo3, 12 is part of 11. 
To all others with this thought about Gary, I'd like to meet him, imagine playing a guy with autism and act like that so in character, I think he's an awesome actor!!! I see a great career ahead!!"
,Enki54,2011-10-21T16:47Z,"Damn, what an ending =). I hope there's a continuation on Alphas, they can't stop now... O.o"
