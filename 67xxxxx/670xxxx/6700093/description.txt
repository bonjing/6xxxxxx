Moon Knight 1-5 collected (series ongoing).  Moon Knight has been rebooted this year with his move to LA while he works as a producer on the hit show, "Legends of the Khonshu."  His split personalities have morphed into Spiderman, Wolverine and Captain America while his older ones are gone.
It seems like Marvel is trying to make this reboot accessible to new fans so if you've never picked up Moon Knight before take a look now.
The current storyline features Echo, Ultron and Moon Knight's search for the new LA Kingpin.
All thanks to the original scanners, uploaders and seeders
