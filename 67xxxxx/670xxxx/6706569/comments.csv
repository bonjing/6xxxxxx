Guess for the rest of us that translates to ...put on combat boots, spend some time at the shooting-skeet range and brush up on local state laws relating to riots, supression of riots, looters, suppression of looters...   In most U.S. states it is legal to SHOOT rioters and looters and spelled out in staute form...   Dead looters-rioters can't testify!!"
