at one point the 2 men are in the middle of a forest and they are discussing how they could starve to death before they reach civilization.

apparently hunting and gathering are unheard of skills in medieval times... lol.

that is just one of the nonstop ridiculously bad acting and script jobs that makes up this train-wreck of a movie."
