"Trust"

Emily sets her sights on her next 
target, Bill Harmon, a wealthy hedge 
funds manager and trusted family friend 
who testified in the trial that 
wrongfully convicted her father. She 
uses her connection with Nolan to her 
benefit, unbeknownst to him, and also 
manages to go on her very first date 
with Daniel. Meanwhile, Victoria's 
suspicions about Emily grow and she 
starts digging to find out a little 
more about this new arrival to the 
Hamptons. And the situation over at the 
Stowaway Tavern gets even more dire for 
the Porter men.

18/Slower
Evolve...or die.

Enjoy :)
