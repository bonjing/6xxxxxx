,inyafase,2012-01-02T21:28Z,"This really is one of the best PDF collections of the Harry Potter books. This version is from Scholastic. Comes with bookmarks that are recognized in Acrobat too. Has an excellent font as well. The illustrations on the covers are by David Saylor.

The magnet link that duffyrabbit provided includes these Scholastic PDFs as well as those from Bloomsbury."

,Coldblackice,2012-04-14T08:24Z,"Wow, I gotta say -- I initially rolled my eyes that you advertised your torrent on someone else's. But alas, I'm glad you did, because the quality on these are unrivaled!!

Brilliant job! Bookmarks, selectable text, illustrations and all! "
