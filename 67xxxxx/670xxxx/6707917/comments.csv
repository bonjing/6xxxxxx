[V],bestec1234,2011-09-29T12:22Z,greeney.... can you reseed http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6472198/ATK_Hairy_Natalie_-_10_Sets ...?  I have all of those pics but when I try to re-seed it doesn't work for some reason.  TIA!  
[V],bestec1234,2011-09-29T13:32Z,"Actually, it appears that the reason I can't seed is because my versions of the files are slightly bigger.  Instead, I'll prepare a new torrent from what I have.  It'll be about 10 hours from now, 19:30 TPB time, before I can get to that.

Back to our regularly scheduled Daijah comments...
(you, me and skullmanwoopt should exchange email addresses so we can coordinate. :)  "

Natalie is seeding now and for a few more days.

Sorry, the first Daijah torrent was somehow defective, so I created another one. It is ONE compilation, not two."
