I mean my upload speed is low, so i can't leave this torrent for new ones unless i  see here some other seeders."
,splurme,2011-12-14T04:44Z,"Hey alume,

I created an account just to say thanks. I've been looking for this show for five years, literally. If you can please upload the remaining seasons. I'll seed forever. Well, at least until the planet stops spinning. Thanks again."
,spohc,2012-03-17T20:47Z,You've got my support.  I'll be sure to seed this for as long as I can.  If you also have season 2 I'd appreciate it!
