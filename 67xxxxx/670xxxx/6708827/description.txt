From the Infowars web site ::

On the Wednesday edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with investigative journalist Wayne Madsen about the Occupy Wall Street protests now closing in on week two, the announcement by Iran that it may position warships off the U.S. coast, and Facebook's Big Brother posture as it follows users of the social network in their travels around the web. Madsen is a former Washington D.C.-based author, columnist, and investigative journalist specializing in intelligence and international affairs. 

Alex also covers the latest news, including Jesse Ventura's offer to run in 2012 with GOP nomination hopeful Ron Paul.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
