,LosmiJ4U,2011-10-02T21:53Z,THERE ARE NO NEW TRANSFERS! IT'S FAKE YOU MOTHERFUCKER!
,LosmiJ4U,2011-10-02T21:54Z,AND DON'T HIDE MY COMMENTS ASSHOLE!
,pireasC,2011-10-02T23:13Z,"@LosmiJ4U It's not fake, all .Dude. uploads is 100% legit. My advice to you: if these torrents don't satisfy you, go buy the game. If you don't have enough money, stop complaining. Stop being an annoying piece of shit, you brat."
,LosmiJ4U,2011-10-03T01:18Z,I was always downloading from Dude's torrents but I have problem with this...there are no new transfers...and this can't be my mistake..there's somethning wrong with this torrent and I just ask for help...if he can't help-it's fake
,pireasC,2011-10-03T12:39Z,"@LosmiJ4U That's a wrong way to put it. Does the game work? Yes. Is it not PES 2012? Yes it is. Therefore it's not fake. You can't say that it's a fake just because there are no new transfers. As I said before, go buy the real game and have it all patched up so you will have your wonderful transfers. This must be the first version of PES that has been released, so they haven't updated the newest transfers yet. Wait for a cracked patch, or edit it yourself."
,pireasC,2011-10-03T12:53Z,"@LosmiJ4U Does it work? Yes. Is it not PES 2012? Yes it is. Therefore it is not fake. You can't call it a fake just because it doesn't have the newest transfers. This must be the first release of PES so they don't have the transfers and some other stuff updated. So as I said earlier, go buy the game and have it patched all up so you can have your wonderful transfers. Or just wait for a cracked patch. After all, it is still free. Be more grateful to these people who provide us these torrents to us for FREE. "
