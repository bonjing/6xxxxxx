,RMJ13,2011-09-27T20:05Z,"just a heads up this DEMO don,t have lan, it only works on windows 7 this is one map that is 32 players which works today,and a 64 player version which isn,t working yet I got my key this morning,
and it is DEDICATED server's of course.

you have to use EA's new Origin, which is a steam CLONE to play this !

Graphic,s are much better then BF2, the game play has a few bugs Bullets go through rocks!"

,cheami,2011-09-29T07:19Z,"To clarify, nothing is zipped in this torrent. I'm assuming you just copy the contents into the folder directory you mentioned and it should be good? Speaking in preparation for OPEN beta and not CLOSED beta."
,dipam,2011-09-29T08:10Z,"i have core 2 duo e 7200 2.53 ghz,2gb ddr2 ram, 1gb geforce 9400gt......can i run it without lags???"

"".Dude. at 2011-09-27 17:13 CET:
Damn,i was about to upload this one.huh :P
Well,i have downloaded it so i will upload it nw,lol :)""

Why on earth does it need to be uploaded more than once, You could have uploaded a different torrent people want. Some people baffle me :)"
,Whippy123,2011-09-29T12:13Z,"But either way... Thanks for the upload, looking forward to the crack being released today (fingers crossed)"
,Whippy123,2011-09-29T12:23Z,"@anuzbitt cheers for the link mate :)

So that makes this torrent completely pointless, as a crack will not be needed to play the beta, because it goes OPEN in just over an hour, so EVERYONE can play for FREE WITHOUT crack, do yourselves a favour and click http://www.bf3timer.com/ all information about the open beta is on there :)"
,huggeyface,2011-09-29T12:55Z,"@Whippy123
Clearly you're a little slow in the head.
This torrent is for the people that want to download the beta before it releases, instead of when the beta is released, then downloading it.

Derp."
,anuzbitt,2011-09-29T13:16Z,nothing yet grrrr .... and the timers gone 
[T],alexisthebest,2011-09-29T13:16Z,"Hah. i'm so late on this. I was gonna upload this.

,asdf181,2011-09-29T17:02Z,Lots of german players have problem getting their keys due to verification system beeing down. Also Origin servers are down so we cant start the download. Hope this will spare me my time when i get the key finally :)

,Dimmis80,2011-09-29T21:34Z,"Hey guys.I have a problem with ""Origin"".I forgot my pasword witch that use to log in so i use the option from origin to retrieve my pasword.They sent me an E-Mail with a number that i use with ""Origin"" and i put in the number so i could retrieve my pasword.The next step was to put a new pasword in the form and i do that.But the thing is that when i do that i get a message from ""Origin"" an Error that the service ""Find your pasword"" have a problem and to try later..I looked at the suport for ""Origin"" but i did not find anything about this problem.The thing is that if i can't log in with the damn ""Origin"" i can't play the beta and stuff.So anyone with the same problem or someone who can tell me about a solution or even a link that says about that problem it could be much apreciated..Thanks in Advance guys. "
,Dimmis80,2011-09-30T00:13Z,Nevermind guys i found it.A bit of advise.If anyone had the same problem with me to have forgot his-her pasword don't try to retrieve it from origin form but go to WWW.battlefield.com\battlefield3\1\beta and in the section that u got to download the beta then retrieve your pasword.It worked from there and not from Origin..!
,RanY2jith,2011-10-01T02:19Z,"I don't see the point.

Go download Orgin
Go to free games
Select Battlefield Beta and download and install 

Play! 

Why ask people to seed when there is a free FTP hanging on your head?"

,Lotnic,2011-10-01T21:49Z,"For everybody who have problems with this torrent: 
Just go to Origin and download it there. Got max download speed at 2.2 MB/second - downloaded it half an hour or so. It's that easy. You need origin to play the game anyway"
,DeadNoob,2011-10-02T14:15Z,o Well i got a reason to download this in germany 4 example ea lets you download it only from 23:00 to 6:00 -.-
