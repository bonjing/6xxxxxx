thanks eztv!"
,bartman2589,2011-09-27T06:25Z,"According to myepisodes.com & tvrage.com Episodes 1 & 2 aired on the same day back to back.  I'm wondering if this is actually only Ep. 1, or if it is in fact Ep. 1 & 2.  The file size seems to indicate that it is both 1 & 2, if so it should probably be renamed to indicate that fact.  Also, Thanks for providing this."
,tvd_damon,2011-09-27T06:27Z,thanks eztv!!
,DJfwa,2011-09-27T06:54Z,"@700mb, I'm gonna guess it's both episodes"

,joo-loved-it,2011-09-27T08:33Z,"could someone please give a rating on the show.

,luke444,2011-09-27T09:06Z,can someone confirm it is actually ep 1 and 2? or just a long pilot?
,sams88,2011-09-27T09:10Z,Thank you very much EZTV :D
,WoundedWolfgirl,2011-09-27T09:22Z,"@luke444, I think it's just a long pilot, not episodes 1 and 2.

,luke444,2011-09-27T10:02Z,@woundedwolfgirl - thanking you very much :)
,twilight_nexus,2011-09-27T10:18Z,show is 7/10 for me... nothing special but a fun ride. and it promises to get better (story-wise)
,TheSageM,2011-09-27T10:29Z,EZTV: you're my one and only!

Thanks eztv for the good work!
as for the show itself, its the biggest piece of shit ever produced for television, with the lame story and the worst, and might i add most unatractive cast you'd ever have to see. AVOID AT ALL COST!!!"
,DickDickstein,2011-09-27T17:41Z,"OK guys I'll be a bit lenient on the show for now, but I would say that if you watched shows such as The Event, Flash Forward, etc. you should expect about the same level of quality.

This show isn't ""great"", and it never will be on the level of a cable show, or anywhere near something like Lost was. The writing and the acting aren't there for that. The CGI is not very good either. 

This is another one of those shows that you watch as a fun cheesy sci-fi. Nothing more. Don't expect Breakign Bad here. It has annoying stereotypical teens on it. Stupid characters. Illogical science. The first episode is packed full of stuff and they don't really make much of a mystery of anything. 

That being said it has dinosaurs, time travel, and other weird shit."
,csabaxb,2011-09-27T17:51Z,"Fast download for me, 2 episodes, A-9, V-8.5, thanx for the up. Now i seeding with 5 Mb. Hope i help for few hours."
,FMyLife0,2011-09-27T18:07Z,Have to agree at least partly with the comment above. They have without any doubt thrown lots of money on vfx and landscapes only to save a bunch on the cast and script...pitty..lost potential. Ill give it 5/10.
,Erik_O,2011-09-27T19:19Z,please upload ep 2!!!
,dantel89,2011-09-27T19:46Z,"Hey guys, episodes 1 and 2 are Genesis Part 1 and Genesis Part 2, so technically, this is the first two episodes that aired back-to-back. These two episodes also served as the pilot, which is the reason for it being back-to-back/so long. Thanks, eztv! You never disappoint."
,koba25,2011-09-27T20:28Z,Thanks eztv!!!
,Dilldog,2011-09-27T23:04Z,"Great show!

8/10"
,poada1975,2011-09-28T01:39Z,Truly awful. 1hr 25m you wont get back.
,xniggler,2011-09-28T02:59Z,"it's about as good as stargate atlantis...
so ok..."
,xniggler,2011-09-28T03:03Z,"i just wish the americans would give the money to some other countries to make the shows...
same old military crap...so last century..."
,Jasson2,2011-09-28T08:10Z,i always have trusted anything by this mate to be of good quality.. i've DL'ed alot from him... in fact he's one i just search on TPB for things
,Allinuse,2011-09-28T11:26Z,"lol @ thinking eztv is one person.
Double lol @ writing tenks."

,Jack0ff,2011-09-30T22:44Z,"fell asleep twice waiting for a dinosaur. finally saw em and got interested for 2 more mins then realized this show just sucks :( dialogue is lame, plot is boring & and the acting is the worst. cg dinos are the only reason to watch."
,Pendaws,2011-10-01T00:11Z,Thanks :)
,AndyM11,2011-10-01T15:41Z,Trailer was crazy. Thought it was going to be an amazing series. I was wrong.
,Holeraw,2011-10-01T17:34Z,thanks eztv!!! :)
,Robert237,2011-10-02T19:44Z,"@xniggler If the ""americans"" would let other countries do their tv shows, 1. They would fucken suck ass and 2. It would be a waste of money because no one would watch. "
,asgardasgard,2011-10-05T14:34Z,"Oh Guess what, made in Australia. With Dick american producers. That explains the crap. Good pictures crap script."
,Kaqanikudc,2011-10-05T23:49Z,"Thanks very much man, is very good quality
and download speed is very fast...!"
,Zeptinune,2011-10-09T10:40Z,"624x352 ? That's a patheticly small resolution for such a good show as this...

Seriously. I'll take nothing less than 720p..."

,dYhA85s,2011-10-13T05:25Z,"now that was a truly crap pilot, sure won't bother with this series again, but thanks anyway"
,HiroPro2,2011-10-19T03:01Z,"The Episode numbers are totally outta whack!

The two hour opener should be called S01E01a and S01E01b

people have called the second half of episode one episode two totally screwing up the episode numbers...

Hasn't anyone noticed this in 5 episodes !!!!"
[V],matimike,2011-10-21T04:16Z,thanks
,JesterVae,2011-10-23T13:36Z,"So I've watched all possible episodes until the next episode (which is actually episode 5, check the OFFICIAL page of the show).

Far as reviews go, I'm going to watch for now, but I'm not very interested. I'm mostly just killing time between Dexter and The Walking Dead. As stated before, the acting is a little off, the plots are simple and unbelievably cliched.

This show has a Disney feel to me. Not that I'm hatin' on Disney, but it's clearly aiming for a slightly higher demographic than tweens.

Without giving any spoilers, for those who choose to invest in the show, everything happens way too fast, way too easily, and it gives me no sense of struggle, nor does it allow for any attachment to the characters. 5 hours in and I don't give a crap about any of them.

Also, the dinosaurs are not nearly terrifying enough. For 50 million, they should have hired better writers instead of set designers and computer nerds."
,anto543,2011-10-27T06:45Z,"I've watched all the available episodes as of the current date, and I can safely say that it's well worth your time to watch.

7/10 acting
9/10 set/cgi
8/10 plot/story
8.5/10 overall.

Just my little mini review."
,mohiergauth,2011-10-27T22:31Z,"Would be nice if you people did some spell checking. It's hard to be taken seriously, when your spelling is atrocious. This goes for about 70% of you ""Nerds"", get it together, seriously. "
