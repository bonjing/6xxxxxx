,jartyk,2011-09-27T10:38Z,"Thz
It fixed the problem I had in the black.box rip from (dude), (movies no picture, only sound).."
,SrPoKer,2011-09-27T12:32Z,"Ok i test,but 2,1Go is much!!!,the game rip 3Go"
,thegorbster,2011-09-27T14:05Z,"as i said SrPoKer ...
all i have done is taken the FMV from the full install and copied them to make a torrent..
i do not and have not ever said i was a ripper of any sorts and was gonna alter the videos..
the simple thing is..  if you don't want the videos , don't download them...simple"
,Sidran,2011-09-28T01:29Z,"thegorbster and jartyk save the day.
Thanks guys"
,Metalprofi666,2011-09-28T22:45Z,"a simple questions guys? the game works great but it seems i cannot play it with my Logitech Rumblepad 2, i mean, i can accelerate, brake..but CANNOT FIND THE STEERING WHEEL...any help ? i cannot turn left, right..i can look left and right but not turn :("
,ubiASH,2011-09-29T05:09Z,"not working guys,this is same shit,dont download"
,thegorbster,2011-09-29T11:02Z,"@ubiASH 
are you retarded?
'this is same shit'? would you like to explain what is the same shit?
if you put these FULL videos in the correct folder , you get to see the FULL fmv as and when it plays..
if you haven't managed to put them in the correct folder i suggest you go back to licking windows ya moron!!!"
,thegorbster,2011-09-29T11:03Z,"@Metalprofi666
I have same pad and i found using Xpadder is the answer...
you can bind any key to any joypad direction,button.
have fun :) "
,Metalprofi666,2011-09-29T14:56Z,"@thegorbster
then can you tell me what to do after you install??"
,thegorbster,2011-09-29T16:37Z,"If you could read you would not need to know any more info as i have given it all in the description...
Download these VIDEOS and copy/paste them into the folder that you installed the game...
EG. c:\Driver San Francisco\Common\fmv
it will over-write the current folder called 'cinematics'.. and then when you play you have ALL fmv playing..."
,thegorbster,2011-09-29T16:38Z,"@Metal
after you install the game choose keys option and then just alt-tab out of game to set required key to set to which ever button you want it for.."
,thegorbster,2011-09-29T16:41Z,"@Metal
ingame set the controls to something like the arrow buttons for steering and accel,brake..
then go into Xpadder config and just click on the button you want to use as accel/brake or steering and put in relevant arrow button..
do that for all required buttons , might take you 10 mins or so to setup but then is flawless  :)
msg me back if you can't get it to work :)"
,Metalprofi666,2011-09-29T17:55Z,"@thegorbster 
you are the MAN...thank you buddy..owe you big time :) piece of cake n thnx 2 u"
,thegorbster,2011-09-29T21:03Z,"no worries buddy ;)
enjoy the game xD"
,BLAQKOXYGEN,2011-09-29T21:07Z,I don't have a common folder in my folder for driver in my documents. Only a Skidrow folder and a temp folder. Should I create a common/mv folder in there?
,MakMan06,2011-09-29T23:06Z,"Download this instead:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6709655/Driver.San.Francisco.MOVIE.FIX-KaOs

It's smaller and they use a seedbox so it will be MUCH faster. I went 1/4 the way throught thegorbster's torrent at 14kB/s!"
,thegorbster,2011-09-30T00:03Z,"well i can't help it if people don't seed sry :(
i've seeded over 30gb on this and having a few night off from seeding to actually game for a bit.."
,thegorbster,2011-09-30T00:04Z,"@blaqk
it's not in my docs mate , it's the directory where it was installed to  ;)
EG. c:\Driver San Francisco\Common\fmv"
,.Tanner.,2011-09-30T02:38Z,"This didn't work with Skidrow's release. Copied the cinematic file over, still get cut sound and black screen during cutscenes in the prologue. :|"
,JudgeIronFist,2011-09-30T05:42Z,People can you please seed? People are seeding too so why can't you do it? I'm seeding too!
,thegorbster,2011-09-30T06:48Z,"@judge.. i've started seeding again , and can see 16 ppl also doing it..
i'm going 450K/s my max i hope it helps ya matey :D"
,thegorbster,2011-09-30T06:51Z,"@tanner... i can't say anything about skidrow's release , but i know this works fine on TPTB and DUDE's rip...and tbh skidrow's was a full release.. not a rip , so i'm guessing th prob might be ur end !!"
,JudgeIronFist,2011-09-30T08:13Z,@Gorbster: Thanks. LOL but the seeders shown on mine is like 9(27) and the peers are like 11(71). Thanks anyway! Appreciated! :D
