these are the videos from Driver:SF some of which didn't work in TPTB rip
all i have done is take them from the original install and paste them to where ever installed the game..  EG. c:\Driver San Francisco\Common\fmv

I have tried and this works fine , only for those who have issues about not seeing some of the FMV :D
