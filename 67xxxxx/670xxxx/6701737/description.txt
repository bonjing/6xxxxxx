There some real treats on here such as Robert Goulet doing "My love
forgive me) made famous by Al Martino and Vic Damone Its a 2CD
set with some nicer picks overall than what you would usually find
this way as the compilations often include some wrong picks or
generally excessive filler material as it were.

enjoy this great offering
