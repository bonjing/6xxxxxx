,Tweak076,2011-09-26T11:38Z,"It's a good torrent!
But where is the rest of the show? 
Running time is 1 hour and 2 minutes. This show was way longer. Not showed on tv?"
,Tweak076,2011-09-26T12:20Z,"I'm sorry! Where are my manners....
Thanx 4 the upload!"
,zmech13,2011-09-26T19:02Z,"@Tweak076 It appears to be the complete show as broadcast on Comedy Central, minus the commercials. There will probably be a DVD rip sometime in the future that will be longer."
