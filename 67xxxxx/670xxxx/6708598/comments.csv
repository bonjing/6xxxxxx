,Thundernail,2011-10-03T19:07Z,"@blaha38 Let me try. 

Thank you for uploading this piece of shit RARed file and stealing all the seeds from other, very good, non-rared torrents. Thank you."

It's one tiny step to un-rar the file.

""stealing all the seeds from other, very good, non-rared torrents""

Really? Please do show me the 'very good' 720p torrent of this episode that this torrent is stealing seeds from.. funny, seems that this is the only one! 

Stop making shit up, appreciate the fact that someone has put in some effort to give this to you for free and stop bitching about the extra 10 seconds it will take you to unrar the file.

I bet you're American, that country is getting so lazy, people used to just sit on the couch and do nothing, now you are so lazy you can't even move your mouse enough to click a file and un-rar it!"

Why RAR it when it don't compress? And when I unrar it I also have to delete the RAR files. And why the hell RAR it in 20 files? Also the fodlername starts on [www.Speed.Cd], so I can't alphabetically list my files anymore, I need to search for them. 

And I am not an American, but I share your opinion on them.

btw,
BOYCOTT Speed.Cd!"
