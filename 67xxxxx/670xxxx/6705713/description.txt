This is my updated ToaD Dicog, so please, let my other one die. This includes the 2009 spec ed.'s of the 1st three albums. I removed (most of) the duplicate content. I have also since found more stuff I did not have previously, mostly acoustic versions, some did not seem to have a home, so I just put them with the album the original is from. Added a few singles, and the 2011 ...The Truth Is. Only missing 1 song, which is "Lowlife (Acoustic)" iTunes pre-order track only, if you have it, or know where to find it, please post a link in comments. Oh, and this is all 320.

Just like my other torrents 500x500 art, proper ID3's and again, 320
