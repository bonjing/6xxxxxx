To foil his plan for world domination, wrestling superheroes El Santo and Blue Demon battle the mad Dr. Halder and his army of reanimated monsters.

This has got to be, of all the Santo films I have seen. The most unintentionally funny one yet. This thing makes something by Ed Wood look like "Gone With The Wind" The only way it could have been funnier is if it was dubbed.
