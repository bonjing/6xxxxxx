The Grass is Singing

From BBC Radio 4 Extra. Written by Doris Lessing; Full-cast dramatisation starring Alison Pettitt, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Miles Anderson, Andrew Scott and Nicholas Beveney; Dramatised by Tina Pepler.

A white farmer, Dick Turner, is passionate about his land; however, his wife Mary is utterly fatigued and frustrated by the relentless heat and grinding poverty. Her thoughts often drift to her previous existence in town, where she enjoyed a career and an active social life.

Mary becomes increasingly discontented, particularly when she realizes that Dick is, fundamentally, incompetent. Much of her aggression is taken out on a succession of black servants, who find it impossible to satisfy her demands.

Eventually she develops an obsession with a houseboy called Moses, and a tragedy unfolds.
