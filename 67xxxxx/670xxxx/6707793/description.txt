'Simon Werner a Disparu' is Sonic Youth's OST to Fabrice Gobert's film of the same name. We've not checked the movie yet so couldn't comment on the relationship between sound and image, but taken as the standalone album it's intended to be, the group have created a vividly cinematic sonic experience. "In Spring 2010 Sonic Youth gathered at their Echo Canyon West studio in Hoboken, New Jersey to watch the rushes of a new film, 'Simon Werner a Disparu', by French director Fabrice Gobert. The band spent the following few weeks recording music which was then shaped as needed to fit the various scenes of the film. For this release, rather than present the abbreviated clips of music as used in the film, the band went back in the autumn to the original tapes and re-organized the various pieces for this original soundtrack release, sometimes montaging multiple tracks together, other times extending cues into new sonic realms."
