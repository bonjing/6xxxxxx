,Back.To.Extreme,2011-09-28T22:28Z,Fifa 2011??? In gamepad is fifa 11 config
,Pimbax,2011-09-28T23:24Z,And then? It works.. Dumbass.
,jonskue123,2011-09-29T01:02Z,Yeah thanks it works. Only problem is it turns off the autosave / intro and my own profiles. There's 5 profiles and all of them are called displayname00 01 02 03 and 04. Can't owerwrite/delete them. Can you fix this too?
,Pimbax,2011-09-29T01:04Z,"To fix that problem just delete all the files from the Fifa12 folder in My documents and also delete the rna.ini file.

Enjoy."
,Pimbax,2011-09-29T01:05Z,"If you're having any problems, just post here."
,jonskue123,2011-09-29T01:33Z,"Yeah that works, might want to put it in the upload notes. Cheers quality upload."
,Pimbax,2011-09-29T01:37Z,"I hope people read the comments.

But thanks man :-)

Support is apreciated."
,local313talent,2011-09-29T03:57Z,had the same problem as jonskue123 (gamepad worked) the deleted Fifa12 folder and rna.ini file and it stopped working
,sohigh1,2011-09-29T09:59Z,I have a ps3 controller everything works except for the Arrows and the R3 AND L3 which are the clicks one the analogs everything is configured in the fifaconfig but i cant seem to change anything on the x360.exe why is that ?
,Rennot,2011-09-29T17:57Z,I'm dutch and I have a problem. When a copy the RNA file.. I can't choose a language anymore. Can you fix the rna file?
,Pimbax,2011-09-29T19:04Z,"Nope.. For all of you, you can delete the Rna file, its not necessary for the gamepad!"
,Rennot,2011-09-29T19:38Z,"That's the problem. If I delete the file, the game will keep the problem. The fifaconfig file is from FIFA11, so I can't use that."
,loverod,2011-09-29T20:15Z,fifa 12 key. if anybody knows it post it plz plz dying to play the game
,Pimbax,2011-09-29T23:33Z,"Well.. Guys, do this.

Go to the fifa11 config.. Configurate the buttons and stuff.

Then, go to my documents, Fifa 11, and copy the file ""buttonDataSetup.ini"" to the game folder of Fifa 12.

Capiche?

I hope theres not any doubt after this.

:-)

But.. If you still need help, dont be afraid to comment."
,horsburge,2011-09-30T14:27Z,"Hey it doesn work for me...
I can config the controler in the file x360ce the buttons work but I can't calibrate the joystics they wont work cuz I dont know the axis perameters and the ""record"" option doesn't work...
FIFA11 config doesn't work for me fo some reason I donno why maybe cuz I messed with the x360 it overrules is..donno...HELP"
,Rennot,2011-09-30T15:02Z,"There is no change when I copy the Buttondate file. I'm sorry friend, but it doesn't work on my pc. 

The problem is the rna file. If I copy this into the Fifa12 map, i cant choose a language or playerprofile. If I delete the file, de game will have the problem that de controllers buttons dont match."

,Pimbax,2011-10-01T10:23Z,"For those having problems, try to delete all the files from the Fifa 12 folder on my documents and restart the game.

If not, delete the rna file and then say something."
,joh97r,2011-10-01T14:08Z,"Hi, I downloaded fifa 12, and gamepad fix is just perfect but fifa 12 is telling me all the time that cannot connect to EA servers, so is this normal, or how can I connect to EA servers?"
