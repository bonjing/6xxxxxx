Fifa 12 Gamepad fix

For those who use generic controllers or PS2 adaptors..

Or for those who simply the game crashes because of the controller.

Simply extract the files to the "Game" folder of Fifa 12.

If the controllers buttons dont match.. Simply configure "x360ce.exe" or "fifaconfig" in the Gamepad folder.

Enjoy.. And this works 100%.

It was made and tested by me.
