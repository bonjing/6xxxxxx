,ADaemonIsBorn,2011-09-27T16:07Z,"Awesome, thanks."

Advise: If u want a nice surrounded sound, dont watch this movie. The rip pretty much doesnt have any bass quality in it, but the picture is really good."
,kovacz,2011-09-27T18:25Z,"Sorry, watch this movie but not this rip. :)"
,dragonballz,2011-09-27T20:16Z,"Thanks but we need a 400mb 720p MKV version!!111
Pecko/froggie100 are you listening?"
,Phatfish,2011-09-27T22:10Z,"A/V - The sound sucks. Video is bad but watchable. Like a really bad R5. 

M - So so. Entertaining up til about the last 10 min or so. Then it goes to poop. Pity really, a better ending and the movie would have been pretty alright. "
,fatbeer,2011-09-28T02:36Z,"Aspect ratio is slightly out, its slightly streched to compensate for the cropped portion of video. An easy fix in VLC, but forget it if you wanted to watch this on a media player. Watch the sample first before downloading."
,madvrx,2011-09-28T14:23Z,hey bone love your torrents they never disappoint question how come there no r5 or dvdrip of the hangover 2 can you see if you can find one and can you help me find a classic called the fan with wesley snipes all of them on here have hard coded subs thank you
,5amjr,2011-09-29T01:58Z,"Thats 8 uploaders doing this same 'hdrip', pity none of them realised maybe their integrity goes in the bin uploading a file grainy like vhs while keeping the HD in the title.
And the tools dying to type "" Its free "" can suck my dick!"
,Chadly,2011-09-29T20:42Z,"lol @ 5amjr

Does the HD in this files name really mean horrible definition instead of high definition? lol"
,5amjr,2011-09-30T05:01Z,"I know, the individuality has gone! In the past you DL a few to check the difference in quality and pick the best to watch, but now most of the torrents on each page are the same rips just re-uploaded!"
,banneddogg,2011-10-06T17:04Z,"I swear Bone, sometimes I don't know why you bother (apart from the fact you actually like U/L films so people who want to see them real quick and not wait for the cinema can). THEN ALL YOU GET IS oooh its bad sound/pic, i cant watch it, it wasn't worth watching. Well here's a thought for all the Bone and the other (real) U/L's who do a brilliant job. SAVE YOUR MONEY YOU SPEND ON A WEB CONNECTION AND THE TIME SPENT SENDING MESSAGES PUTTING PEOPLE DOWN JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO YOUR SELF, AND GO THE THE CINEMA AND WATCH IT THERE FOR $/ÂŁ40-50 WHAT EVER IT IS NOW.   "
,banneddogg,2011-10-06T17:10Z,And allways RAPID speeds :)
,trust-no.1,2011-10-18T12:15Z,poor quality 
,beam0080,2011-11-05T11:25Z,"just a quick question, why is it that people complain about the quality of a rip or otherwise? this would be a very different case if we had to pay for these movies."
,dirtbag84,2011-12-11T20:44Z,terrible movie!bad still very funny!the monsters were hilarius.that was a hard lesson not to watch katie holmes or tom cruise movie again!stay away!warning!
