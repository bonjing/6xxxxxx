,avrumi,2011-09-27T01:41Z,"@fippmeister @anthonylovesmods the setup puts a compress file called ""nfs.uha"" in the ""all programs"" folder after doing that it just runs the command and it just uncompressed all files to a folder called ""Need For Speed Hot Pursuit 2""   so shut the fuck up and look for your self.
