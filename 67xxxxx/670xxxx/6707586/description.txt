Saves the Day complete their self-discovery-themed trilogy - preceded by 2006s provocative Sound the Alarm and the quieter Under the Boards a year later - with Daybreak. Whether by design or due to the intervening years and lineup changes, Daybreak sets itself apart from the rest of the trilogy with its sense of optimism and simultaneously forward- and backward-looking perspective. The album starts on an epic note, with a ten-minute, five-part opening track in the contemporary rock opera vein of Green Days American Idiot, revisiting various points in Saves the Days career. This concept carries through the rest of Daybreak, showing the band at their most mature - the last half of the album takes a more straight-ahead alt-rock turn than they have previously approached - and embracing experimentation. Daybreak is successful on two levels: in the way it touches on the best elements of Saves the Days past works, its a welcome entry point for new listeners; and with its freshness, it assures established fans that the band is still invigorated after going at it for over a decade.
