,iridis_alpha,2011-09-26T11:34Z,"the audio was out of sync on the other versions, this version is fine.

there are also reports that this isnt the finished movie and its a workprint, because there is missing CGI and music, I havent seen the movie in the cinema so I cant confirm this, I hope one of the shipmates of PB can."
