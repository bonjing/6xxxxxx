Is ""feeding a cute bird"" really the best torrent posting title you could come up with for this large collection of army training manuals?"

,MySecrets,2011-10-08T20:32Z,"One can track the IP addresses in the swarm, and try to determine if one user has a habit of downloading sensitive content.

Some users download very many ebooks, including the stuff that people might be watching. To weed those people out, you can upload a bunch of fake torrents about ""explosive"" orgasms and see if those heavy users can be tricked into snatching it. People with bad English or automated crawlers that snatch based on keywords related to bomb making, poisons, infrastructure, criminality, etc. will fall for it by trying to download the fake stuff while ignoring the military manuals with an innocuous name.

If it works, you then have a better list of people of interest."
