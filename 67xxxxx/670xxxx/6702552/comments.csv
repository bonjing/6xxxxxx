  politics sometimes makes 4 crazy bedfellows, thats reality.  i wrote this so he could perhaps see that we in ontario care deeply about this stuff.  Universal health care that is not universal or equitably distributed is a sad joke.  pouring money into places that do not use it properly is imbecilic.  for me i can only really get medical assistance that is worth anything if i end up in a hospital.  I do not have good health care here(if u have no family doctor).  

re:obama

seemed ok, b4 election.  however, he really does seem to be beholden to interests other than those of the populace he is supposed to be serving.  i cannot comment on the jewish people except to say there is a reason the are in israel(palestine) .  they do not want to be killed like animals by the millions ever again.  that makes sense for sure.  however, private roads for settlers in occupied territories and building fences will only aggravate the situation. 

thanks for your input.\\

not every white man out there is garbage either, i love everybody nomatter what their origin.  ""foreigners"" are far more interesting to me because many have real lives that are difficult, not some joke where everybody wants everything and they want in now.  good things come to those who wait.  my point exactly regarding walk in clinics-they cannot really help you, why do any of us bother going.  re allocate funding so we can all have a doctor.  furthermore, this is the most equitable solution for doctors- the could rest assured they do not have to provide what they all know to be inferior and exceedingly expensive services if they were assured a better living in the first place.  i can never be made at someone for say stealing bread to feed his family but what is it all really for?  i suspect the MDs who use this silly system to enrich themselves will never really be happy anyway.  you gotta ask yourself ""to what end?"" ie what is a couple hundred k a year extra really going to do?  will your family love you more?  are you a ""better"" person because you have a fancy car?  that is for everyone to figure out themselves.

sorry, i get wound up and preach like an idiot.
