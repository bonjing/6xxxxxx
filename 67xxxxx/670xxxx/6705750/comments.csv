I hate to add my request to all the others I've seen but I have looked for months for Katherine Kurtz e-books.
She has the Camber Trilogy (Camber of Culdi, Saint Camber and Camber the Heretic)
Also the Heirs of Camber Trilogy (Harrowing of Gwynedd, King Javanâ€™s Year and Bastard Prince)
Also the Deryni trilogy (Deryni Rising, Deryni Checkmate and High Deryni)
The King Kelson trilogy (Bishop's Heir, King's Justice, and Quest for Saint Camber)
The The Childe Morgan Trilogy (In the Kings Service, Childe Morgan and one yet to come)
Also Misc books: Deryni Archives (Short Stories), Deryni Magic (A Grimoire) , Codex Derynianus (with Rob Reginald) , King Kelson's Bride , and Deryni Tales (Short stories) 

You would think with all these titles she has and fans that I wouldve been able to find something out there so as to not only enjoy these books on my shelf but also on my reader

thanks if you can do anything!!!!"
