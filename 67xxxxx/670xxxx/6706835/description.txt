WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE (2ND EDITION) (ENGLISH)


SETUP:

01 - BURN THE ISO IMAGE TO DISC (I USED NERO BURNING ROM) (NERO 10)

02 - INSERT YOUR NEWLY BURNT CD INTO YOUR CD/DVD DRIVE (IN MOST CASES, D:) AND RUN SETUP (INSTALL)

03 - AFTER INSTALLATION, DOUBLE CLICK THE " WWTBAM 2nd Edition " (DESKTOP SHORTCUT) AND THE GAME WILL PLAY


NOTE:  YOU MUST HAVE THE CD INSERTED FOR THE GAME TO PLAY, TRIED ALL THE " NO-CD PATCH " AND IT DID FCUK ALL

BUT LIKE I SAID..... KEEP THE DISC INSERTED WHENEVER YOU WANT TO PLAY THE GAME AND YOU'LL HAVE NO PROBLEMS



UNLIKE THE OTHER " ATTEMPTS " BY VARIOUS UPLOADERS ON HERE...... THIS ACTUALY WORKS 


(PROVIDED THE CD IS INSERTED EVERYTIME YOU WANT TO PLAY IT)


WOULD YOU EXPECT TO WATCH A DVD WITHOUT THE DVD BEEN IN THE DVD PLAYER ???? EXACTLY..... IF IT AINT BROKE, DON'T TRY AND FIX IT !!!!



" IF " ANYONE HAS A " WORKING " NO-CD PATCH, THE LINK WOULD BE GREAT !!! 


FAILING THAT...... KEEP THE CD INSERTED WHEN YOU WANT TO PLAY THE GAME





SEED TODAY FOR OTHERS IF YOU WANT OTHERS TO SEED FOR YOU TOMORROW !!!!
