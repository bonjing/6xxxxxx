Learn the foundations of our Bible. Learn the Bible from a Hebrew mindset. Our Lord Jesus(his greek name) was called Yeshua(which means salvation) by everyone that lived in his time. To know Yeshua, we must understand that he loved the Torah. Yeshua came to fulfill the Torah not destroy Torah.

The Bible was originally written in Hebrew and later translated into Greek. There is much to be learned by what was lost in translation. Yeshua wants everyone to know him. If you want to learn truth. This is a good place to start.
