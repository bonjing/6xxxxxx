Movie - Thriller

When Beatriz picks up her husband Luis from the sanatorium, she is not quite sure if she should believe his psychiatristâ€™s pronouncement that he is fully cured. Her usually churlish, academic husband is suddenly friendly and cooperative, even willing to take a trip to Brazilâ€™s beaches. When their cat Donatello disappears, Beatriz's suspicions lead her to question her own sanity. The tension is on high throughout in Carlos Sorinâ€™s latest feature, The Cat Vanishes.
