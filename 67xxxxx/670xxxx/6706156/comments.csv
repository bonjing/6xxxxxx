this torrent is working 100% !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,NIKHILRAJPUROHIT,2011-12-12T08:00Z,"@ spapanass 

its easy, man,

Plug-in your Gamepad (make sure u have a gamepad with analogues)
Open the emulator, then go to config>controllers>pad 1
then press buttons on right side

(I mean click on start button, then press start on your gamepad, by this it will recognize keys on your gamepad, and like this, configure your gamepad fully)

Sorry for my bad english"

there is a setup in extracted folder, after clicking on it, command prompt will appear, enter Y then press ""enter"" and after some minutes u r done !!!!!!

it will install it in same folder, there will be some shortcuts, like god of war normal, god of war 25% speed etc.

I played with god of war+100% speed shortcut, worked like a charm."

,masterofstealth,2012-05-16T18:06Z,"ok, I've figured it out. 4 ny other noobs, u need 2 open the emulator, click system nd then click reboot CDVCD."
,soulcreation2,2012-06-02T00:33Z,"Ok real simple ppl here are the settings you need if your running slow
goto emulator settings and goto speed hacks enable all then turn bothe cycling rates up to 3
under video settings you need to use either dx 10 or 11 then native d3d resolution you should be able to run good after that"
