,djlilpp,2011-09-28T22:22Z,"not just this week! Gunning, you da man! since the beginning of the New 52, i've been getting all of your releases."
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-28T22:24Z,Vuze is showing me 13 Seeds 1000 Leechers - more people on Teen Titans than Superman???
[V],GunningHawk90,2011-09-28T22:47Z,"@Mr.Downtown, I'm a bit surprised too. Apparently, people don't think much of the new Man of Steel :-/"
,xenoFLASH,2011-09-28T22:57Z,It's all about Kid Flash. Right?

,garouterry,2011-09-29T15:30Z,"Yup yup. See, we were all too skeptical and for what? ;) hahaha... we just love our classic heroes but by and large, all of the releases have been terrific. Can't wait for all new #2s!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-30T19:34Z,I really liked this - only reading it for Red Robin (miss that series) but I like how they tied it directly to Superboy #1
,zeuslogan,2011-10-04T00:57Z,Can't agree more with what everyone else has been saying GunninHawk.  You and MirrorMaster have been bringing it large.  Keep up the great uploads.
