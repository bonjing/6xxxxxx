,anujeith,2011-10-04T05:41Z,"hey LISTEN ALL >>> THIS IS VERY IMORTANT 
after extract the addons ... do not directly copy paste them to the fifa directory ////  
first open the extracted folders for ex : there is a file chants in folder chants ... you have to copy this file instead and pass them accordingly like -

1. Copy the chant folder and paste it to ---> (...\Game\audiodata\crowdlogic\)
 2. Copy the ''en_us'' files and paste them to the ''Game'' folder.
 3. Run the game, and you will have English commentary and the fans chanting. 


note / 1st open the extracted folders and then copy paste the files into fifa directory .. and then your commentory will work
THANX/ worked with me :)"

,anujeith,2011-10-04T20:26Z,you can change your keyboard bindings only in game .. there is an option(controller) in game settings .. you have to choose Rt  to select keyboard control option .. im not sure about the option but i changed my controls precisely by doing this .. for eg: D= shoot from space =shoot
