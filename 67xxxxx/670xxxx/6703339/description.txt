    'Bobby Fischer Against the World' is the first documentary feature to    
    explore the tragic and bizarre life of the late chess master Bobby       
    Fischer. The drama of Bobby Fischer's career was undeniable, from his    
    troubled childhood, to his rock star status as World Champion and        
    Cold War icon, to his life as a fugitive on the run. This film           
    explores one of the most infamous and mysterious characters of the       
    20th century.
