Format your usb to NTFS and it should work then."
,luc2211,2011-09-25T17:09Z,"75% and waiting !!! Someone please talk about the A/V quality, i´ll soon it´s complete.

You need to format your thumb driver with NTFS file system!! FAT or FAT32 don´t recognize files bigger than 4.0 Gb. 
Sorry my english, thanks a lot for the upload."

Your pendrive it's FAT32 system file. The maximum possible size for a file on a FAT32 volume is 4 GB minus 1 byte or 4 294 967 295 (232−1) bytes."

HDD FAT 32 TO NTFS

,maggot_corpse,2011-09-25T17:19Z,"format your usb into NTFS, 'cuz FAT32 can read no more than 4 gb."
,ZenRhino,2011-09-25T18:03Z,Why is this 4.1 Gb when I see other 720p versions at 5.37 or slightly bigger?
,alissonpc,2011-09-25T19:28Z,"So much seeds and trackers count but the download speed it's crap... KEEP SEEDING, this is (as the description) the file that have better quality."
