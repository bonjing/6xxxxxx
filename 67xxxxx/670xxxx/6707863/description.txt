PopChar is a utility application that lets you insert special characters, accented letters, umlauts, etc. from all installed fonts into your documents. You never need to search for and remember keystrokes any longer. Just pop up the PopChar window, click the desired character, and the character appears in your current document.

If a font contains Unicode characters, you can see all of them, neatly arranged in the standard Unicode categories.
