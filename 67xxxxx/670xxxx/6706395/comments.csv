,Vault_Master,2011-10-19T18:51Z,"Open in VLC media player and increase the playback speed up to 1.1x and its perfectly fine. When the original uploader rendered the film, he somehow made it play back at a slower rate."
,Vault_Master,2011-10-19T18:53Z,"Wait... nope, nevermind. The audio is just plain shitty. haha"
,patronanejo,2011-10-20T17:58Z,"The sound is up to the standard of the original. This is a documentary that contains an abundance of secondary-source video--including period film; home-made material of varying quality; and TV clips of wide-ranging vintage and -condition.

A higher-budget production might have devoted greater resources to cleaning up the sound to a more homogeneous standard--at least paid for the rights to the opening clip from the ""Daily Show"" (instead of settling for a ""fair use"" handy-cam recording).

If you judge the audio by the primary material, it sounds like they got a little too excited at having access to an Eventide Harmonizer and an Aphex Aural Exciter. Even the big studios will release movies with over-separated stereo on occasion."
