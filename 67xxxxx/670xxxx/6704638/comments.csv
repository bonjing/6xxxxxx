[T],Tyr3ll,2011-09-29T05:39Z,"Well few users have reported this issue,true !
you are not this only one so.
However i don't have or get this specific problem.
Suggest you to take a look on the setting option
of your ccc,there is something who might help you to resolve this issue,but not sure anyway.
really sorry for you bro :/
suggest to revert back or :
to the second catalyst 11.9 ogl 4.2 preview version or to latest and newer catalyst 11.9 released yesterday now.
