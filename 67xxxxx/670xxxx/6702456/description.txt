Original Release Date: 2007 
Label: JSP Records
Formast:Flac

Buddy Guy, one of the greatest blues performers there has ever been, professionally recorded performing in front of his home audience, his neighbours, friends and fellow musicians in his own club which was very much situated in the Chicago ghetto.This is thought to be the only commercially recorded album cut in a Southside club, rather than the tourist crowd Northside clubs where other live blues recordings have been made. It was a great night, with Buddy at the absolute peak of his powers - stunningly powerful and inventive guitar and impassioned vocals -and an impressive accompanying band
