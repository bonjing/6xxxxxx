so how does this turn out? and what is the bit rate and quality and demensions and resolution? is it 320*260 is it 50000*8444 is it 1280*1080? what is it? what is the audio quality bitrate? is it 320kbps? is it 1024kbps? 

was it originally 320px wide and then stretched to 720? if so that would make it pixelated, and thats not what we want. "
