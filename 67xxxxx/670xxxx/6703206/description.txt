This is Windows 8 Developer Preview     X 32  V. 6.2   Build 8102
.... in .... VMware image " Version 8 " ______  will not run on VMware 7 or earlier.

-
I made this image, because VMware 8 installed on Windows 7 ... will not intall W 8
because of the issue of the Easy install. So I installed it
on the Physical drive, and converted it to a Virtual machine.

After you extract then, guide the VMware program to the folder
and it will see the the file to open Windows 8 Developer Preview.



About this VMwar image:

   Most important setting are the ... Memory size ...The DVD or CD drive letter,
   and how many processors . My labtop has 4 GH memory ... to keep the host, and the
   Guest stabel I use only 1024 of the 4. Delete the Floopy drive if no need for it.
   ...... Leave the rest as they are.
