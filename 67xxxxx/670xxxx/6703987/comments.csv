or 80:29
or about 25:9

'widest' screen i think i've seen. if you don't mind the screen bezels in the way, this would suit a 3 monitor setup!

the downside to this aspect ratio, only 464 vertical pixels @720p - which is LESS than 480 (as a SD scene standard). 1080p version will get you 696.

fantastic film, fantastic blu-ray transfer."
