Reviewers Comments
This story is about a man that takes care of / works for an older man. The old man's eye is like a vulture's eye. The eye vexes the other man. The eye drives the other man so crazy that it urges him to .........(you will have to listen to the story to find out). The story takes place in the old man's very old and creaky house.

I think that Edgar Allan Poe is a really great author. He completely mastered the style that he wanted to achieve. His style is somewhat of a creepy, cold feeling one. A coldness that grasps you while you read it. While you read his stories, you really can feel the creepy sense in each one. It's a great style of writing that doesn't always appeal to everyone, but it's still a great style to accomplish, and he did it very, very well. 

Enjoy and Seed!!
