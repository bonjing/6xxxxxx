After releasing a handful of singles and songs in 2010 and 2011 that were nothing short of brilliant, expectations were high for the first album from the Scottish noise pop group Veronica Falls. Their early work showed a band that had a perfect formula figured out: take noisy, quickly strummed guitars, add propulsive basslines and simple but powerful drums, and layer sweetly sung female lead vocals and rich backing vocals over the top of insanely catchy songs about love and death. The self-titled album proves that they have mastered it and then some. Despite a difficult recording process that had them ditch almost all of the results of two weeks work in a pro studio in favor of songs done live in three days in less fancy digs, the album sounds effortless and truly organic in the best sense of the word, like four people blending together to make one perfectly formed sound.
