And for which firmware is this ok? Do I have to update?"

,Roni404,2011-10-16T16:23Z,"Wouldn't recommend this for anyone before i tried it myself to be honest. I had the old flash for my hitatchi and was not able to play this game without updating. So instead i connected to xbox live and updated manually without a cd, to mu suprise the flash was still intact and the game works without any problem. So if you own a ""Hitatchi Xbox"" and know how to flash an xbox at home without any cost, give it a shot. Thanks for the game fatfreddy33!"
,Roni404,2011-10-16T16:25Z,Sidenote** Do not update if you don't want to take the risk of losing the flash! I guess i was just lucky.
,gotmachine,2011-10-19T17:26Z,"hi, 

can someone confirm is the hitachi lt + 1.9 sufficient to play this game on LIVE no problems when stealth patched 

or is lt + 1.91 needed

ie, does it matter if i have 1.9 or 1.91 if i intend to connect online (assuming i stealth patch it correctly of course)"
,gotmachine,2011-10-22T04:16Z,can anyone confirm this please so i can decide to download or not
,asianluffy,2011-10-23T05:03Z,i'm suprised this game did not become an annoying XDG3 security game
,gotmachine,2011-10-25T03:58Z,"i found out for myself, 

game works perfectly and so does LIVE

thanks a lot"
,TimWithaT,2012-03-20T21:54Z,fuck you fredfreddy i wasted a cd because of you dickface.
