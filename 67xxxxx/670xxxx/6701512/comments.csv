And for which firmware is this ok? Do I have to update?"

,Julosz,2011-09-29T13:44Z,If I insert the game it asks me to update... My current dashboard is 2.0.13146.0. I believe it's flashed with ixtreme 1.9. Does anyone know what to do?

,aslan248,2011-09-29T18:19Z,@Julosz...there is a game update of about 4mb when you play the game first.This is updating the player ratings and squad ratings.You dont have to do that update if ya dont want to.Just stay logged out of xbl and it wont ask for it.If you buy the game from a store it asks you to do this update as well.
