,dbit35,2011-09-26T23:52Z,thank you
,JWBly,2011-09-27T00:00Z,"I echo that sentiment, WillKane.  Thank you SO MUCH for bringing EIB to us every day.  I still think Erie, PA (unfortunately, my hometown) is the biggest market in the USA that does NOT have a Rush station.  :(  Our station dumped Rush two years ago for DENNIS MILLER (!), and when that tanked they went to Glenn Beck."
,BrianB420,2011-09-27T00:58Z,"Thanks a lot for bringing us Rush...Still wondering what happened to Jwhitt, though. 

Oh, and JWBly, even though it's not on an Erie station exactly, you can still pick it up from somewhere can't you? I think it would be pretty hard to find a place nationwide where you can't get a station. And I enjoy Rush AND Dennis every day. They're both great in their own way."
,JWBly,2011-09-27T01:43Z,"Brian, on a good day we CAN hear Rush on the Detroit blowtorch WJR coming across Lake Erie.  But it's unreliable due to the distance.  I still maintain that Erie, Pennsylvania is the largest market in the USA that has no available Rush station.  Which sucks - big time!  Guys like jwhitt and now WillKane have made life a lot nicer for us here.  Thanks again!"
