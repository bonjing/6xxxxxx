I uploaded this along with season 2 but it said it was seeding but no-one seemed to be able to get any of it, so try again and putting it up as 2 separate torrents.  If this starts seeding okay I will put season 2 up straight away.


Season 1 dvd rip

720 x 480
Avi - Divx
Data Rate - 1270 kbps
AC3 - Sound

The quality is about as good as it gets considering it's an old TV series probably recorded at the studio on tape and not in any way a high definition.

Enjoy
