  Summary:
==============================================================================
                                                     
  Aboard a boat in the clear waters surrounding the paradise island nation 
  of Palau, twenty strangers from different walks of life eagerly await the 
  chance to outwit, outplay and outlast each other in pursuit of the coveted 
  million-dollar prize. Out at sea, Survivors are shocked to learn that the 
  game has already begun as the first male and female castaways to reach the 
  beach will claim early Immunity. Surprised they aren't even divided into 
  tribes yet, the twenty Survivors immediately paddle their large outrigger 
  toward the beach that will serve as their camp as the game begins!
