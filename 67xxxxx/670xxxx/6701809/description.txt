Special DVD features include a Sing-a-long option, band biographies, Dolby Digital Stereo and a chapter search by songs.

Led by the radical and charismatic punk poet Jello Biafra, the Dead Kennedys are one of America's seminal punk bands. One of the most influential political punk bands, DK took a stance against the American government, capitalism, and of course, corporate rock. THE EARLY YEARS LIVE brings the viewer back to the band's beginnings, compiling live footage from 1978 to 1981. Filmed at various locations, including Berkeley's Sproul Plaza and Target Studios, these performances feature much of the material off of the 1978 FRESH FRUIT FOR ROTTING VEGETABLES record.
