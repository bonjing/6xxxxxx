Colin Murray introduces highlights of the day's Premier League game between 
Queens Park Rangers and Aston Villa. QPR won promotion from the Championship 
last season, so this will be Villa's first top-flight game away to Rangers for 16 years. 
The London club made a terrible start to life in the Premier League, suffering a 4-0 
home defeat to Bolton, but since then manager Neil Warnock has brought in several 
experienced players, including ex-Villa full-back Luke Young and former Newcastle 
midfielder Joey Barton. Villa lost two of their best players in the close season, 
with Ashley Young sold to Manchester United and Stewart Downing departing to Liverpool. 
However, new manager Alex McLeish can still count on the predatory skills of England 
striker Darren Bent, along with new summer signing Charles N'Zogbia. With analysis 
from guests Alan Shearer and Robbie Savage.
