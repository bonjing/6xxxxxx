Jo Jo Zep and the Falcons were an Australian band that featured singer/songwriter Joe Camilleri. The band was active in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and had several Australian chart hits during that time, including "Hit and Run", "Shape I'm In" and "All I Wanna Do". The Falcons dissolved in 1981 and the group's biggest Australian hit, 1982's "Taxi Mary", as well as the New Zealand top ten hit "Walk On By", were both credited simply to Jo Jo Zep.

The late 1970s line up of Jo Jo Zep and The Falcons reunited in 2001, and released a new album in 2003.
