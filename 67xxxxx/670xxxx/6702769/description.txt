For many years Ive had the luxery of working in many different enviroments, with different producers, great musicians and songwriters. All these meetings has developed me as an artist and given me so many wonderful experiences and memories. It feels really special to me, to collect some of the songs from these meetings in a box. All these songs, have in their own special way a great meaning to me. I feel humbled that you hold this box in your hand and that my label let me collect all my favourite singles and stories and top it off with a long time dream - a live album. It is in my mind a generous box that I hope will be my dear and loyal listeners collection of their favourite songs and memories. Its also a great presentation of my music for a new audience! You all inspire me more than you know! Thanks for being there.

Love Jill.

NÃ¤r Jill Johnson summerar sin makalÃ¶sa karriÃ¤r fram till idag gÃ¶r hon det med besked! I en unik och exklusiv samlingsbox ger hon oss hela tre album pÃ¥ en gÃ¥ng! Ett med alla hitsen samlade samt fyra helt nyinspelade spÃ¥r varav en duett med ingen mindre Ã¤n Chip Taylor! Album nummer tvÃ¥ innehÃ¥ller de lite mer okÃ¤nda spÃ¥ren frÃ¥n tidigare skivor. Den tredje skivan Ã¤r en liveinspelning ifrÃ¥n den utsÃ¥lda konserthusturnen Music Row och den finns endast tillgÃ¤nglig i denna 3CD-box. Att Jill tilhÃ¶r det absoluta toppskiktet av Sveriges artister rÃ¥der det inga tvivel om och genom den hÃ¤r fantastiska samlingsboxen befÃ¤ster hon sin stÃ¤llning med rÃ¥ge! Kort och gott den optimala boxen fÃ¶r alla som Ã¤lskar Jill!
