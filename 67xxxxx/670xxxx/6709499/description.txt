Storyline

The telepathy between identical twins: conventional Caroline lives with her dad and is engaged; Lisa is hard-drinking, devil-may-care, living in London as a high-class call girl. Caroline has horrid dreams of Lisa dying, so she flies to London to help. To find out what befell Lisa, Caroline submerges herself in Lisa's dangerous milieu, seeking help from an East Indian cabby who loved Lisa, and continuing to have dreams and visions. Then, while staying in Lisa's flat, wearing Lisa's clothes, and avoiding her own fiance, who has followed her over from the States, Caroline follows her instincts to confront what did happen in her sister's last minutes of life.
