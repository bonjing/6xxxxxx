,.Tanner.,2011-09-30T02:35Z,"I swear to god. Every single release has broken cutscenes.

They play normally for sound for a bit, then then sound stops and it goes to blackscreen/showing nothing but concrete.

Let's see if this fixes it. :|"

No, still doesn't work for me. Tried the Blackbox fix, still nothing. 

I then even got a .bik player to see if it's the movie files themselves, but they work fine in the player(The CGI parts, not the ingame rendered sections ofcourse) but the CGI portions are broken in the game itself for me."
