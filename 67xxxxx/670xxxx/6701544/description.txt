Release Notes:

Here we are with another release to share with all....... Abduction 2011 TS XViD - ViSUALiSE 

sourced seemd abit poor at the start but does get better as movie proceeds on after 5 - 10 mins

Played with the colors, sharpen'd, denoised and ran some other filters through this
to get this looking nice for every one

Hope you all Enjoy This Release........
