Allmusic Review:
An enduring singles band in the mid- to late '70s, America managed to combine the sweeter edges of the Eagles and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young into an accessible, middle of the road California sound which, if it wasn't exactly innovative, always sounded refreshingly bright coming out of the car speakers. This set is pretty brief but still manages to collect America's biggest hits, including "A Horse with No Name," "Tin Man," "Lonely People," and "Ventura Highway." Hardcore fans will find this ten-track collection woefully short, while casual listeners may well find it just right.
