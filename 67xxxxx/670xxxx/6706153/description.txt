Almost all incidences of cheating, theft, fraud, or loss can be detected through the surveillance of critical transactions, audit observations, and reviews of key metrics. Providing proven-techniques for detecting and mitigating the ever-evolving threats to casino security, this book covers the core skills, knowledge, and techniques needed to protect casino assets, guests, and employees.

Drawing on the authorsâ€™ six decades of combined experience in the industry, Casino Security and Gaming Surveillance identifies the most common threats to casino security and provides specific solutions for addressing these threats. From physical security and security management to table and gaming surveillance, it details numerous best practice techniques, strategies, and tactics, in addition to the metrics required to effectively monitor operations.

The authors highlight valuable investigation tools, including interview techniques and evidence gathering. They also cover IOU patrol, tri-shot coverage, surveillance audits, threat analysis, card counting, game protection techniques, playersâ€™ club theft and fraud, surveillance standard operating procedures, nightclub and bar security, as well as surveillance training.

Complete with a glossary of gaming terms and a resource-rich appendix that includes helpful forms, this book covers everything surveillance and security professionals need to know to avoid high-profile incidents, costly compliance violations and damage to property and revenue.

Itâ€™s professionals like Al and Derk who personify the professionalism that is crucial when establishing and operating modern casino security and surveillance departments. This book will quickly become the Bible for any security and surveillance officer.
