,djlilpp,2011-09-29T04:37Z,"yeah, what the hell! why doesn't it load in comicsrack? almost all of the comics wowcabbage put up today don't work! Aquaman, Superman, Hawkman and Justice League Dark are all a big ol' X. those were literally the ones i was excited for today! the only one i got to enjoy that i had wanted to was the new Green Lantern..."
,xenoFLASH,2011-09-29T07:38Z,Glad I use cdisplay. Thank you. :)
[T],wowcabbage,2011-09-29T08:25Z,"@djlilpp
Suck it up and use Cdisplay.
Don't bother thanking me for my time will you.

I will release my comics in cbz format from now on, seeing as some people are too lazy to use Cdisplay as an alternative when needed.

And to every one who thanks me: you are more than welcome."

,djlilpp,2011-09-29T23:45Z,"@wowcabbage
i appreciate the effort, seriously i do, but when none  of the comics work there's a problem. i didn't say it was something you did, i specifically said ComicsRack was just showing a big X."
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-30T19:00Z,"Ive had the same issue and when i check online these files should all be slightly bigger - when i re-download then from my sources they work fine. 

That being said - there is no point as this comic sucks. Thanks for cancelling Zatanna and watering her down with all these magical losers DC ... >:( "
