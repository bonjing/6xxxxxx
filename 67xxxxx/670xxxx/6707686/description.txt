Following some bad-many would say unforgivable-choices as Twilight, Angel needed to hide away and wallow in his guilt. But with a little TLC-courtesy of his only remaining ally, Faith, Angel is back to fighting the good fight and taking demons down one by one. With the Watcher files at their disposal, Angel comes up with the ultimate plan for redemption.
