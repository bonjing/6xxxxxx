PC Health Advisor provides you with the information and power to make your computer a peak performer. With its advanced features you can optimize your system and tweak how your resources are used. For example, the Startup Manager prunes the number of programs that launch when you turn on your computer. When these unnecessary programs are trying to run when things are just getting started, they steal resources that could be best used elsewhere and cause slow startup times.

This is just one reason why PC Health Advisor is the ultimate computer optimization tool. The program solves dozens of common problems and gives you the tools and information to optimize and fine-tune as much as you need. Don't put up with a slow computer, and don't worry about figuring out countless computer tools. With PC Health Advisor, you've got a solution for every problem, all in one.
