,Moitas,2011-09-26T06:15Z,Is this real? Size and number of files seems odd to me...
,LEVEL_99,2011-09-26T06:22Z,"it is real, anybody know why it was 549mb before, now it's only 220mb? "
,enectrixx,2011-09-26T15:35Z,"I can confirm it's real. Pretty good quality too. No idea why it's only 222 mb, but hey, I'm not gonna complain."
[T],trialNerror,2011-09-26T20:44Z,"The file size for 720p videos will fluctuate as the rules for scene cappers changed earlier this year.  

No longer are they required to hit that typical file size of 550mb for half hour or 1.09gb for one hour long broadcasts.

Instead, they use CRF, Constant Rate Factor, x264's best single-pass encoding method.

I'm not scene (capper or fashion [bleh]) but should get with the program and start using this method for my 720p's.

XviD rules have not changed so those are still going to be 175mb or 350mb.  However, I wouldn't be surprised if those rules change sometime within the next few months."
,watermelonseeds,2011-09-26T22:01Z,"Is it still the same quality as the 550megas versions?  Also, why is this torrent in .rar files... what the fuck, it's 222mb and he puts it in .rars"
,watermelonseeds,2011-09-26T22:03Z,If you want to download it in one file instead of multiple rars use this torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6701872/Family.Guy.S10E01.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION
,Xyfer117,2011-09-27T00:14Z,Great file thanks
,Mr_Gamer,2011-09-28T17:00Z,"Is there some new Codec out? The files used to be about 500MB for a 20 minute episode, is it some new form/better variant for x264, possibly a progressive/alternating bitrate codec (as in MP3/OGG)? I would really like to know, since before I knew I got full HD."
,Mr_Gamer,2011-09-28T17:04Z,"Oops. Should have read the above comments. Now I know. It is kind of like Variable Bit-Rate for MP3/OGG, except in x264 video-format with ""Constant Rate Factor"" instead. Good thing the scene went over to more reason instead of tradition. :)"
,Mr_Gamer,2011-09-28T17:17Z,"@trialNerror: I don't know why they bother with DivX/XviD anymore, especially now that x264 (in MKV-Container) is so much smaller. The only reason x264 isn't used by EVERYONE is that some STILL don't know what an *.MKV is and stick to ""good old *.AVI"". It isn't only The Scene that should go over to reason instead of tradition."
