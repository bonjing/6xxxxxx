But, how do i change my cd-key? It's invalid and i cant change it, so i can play online "

,ZankmanJack,2012-01-02T21:45Z,"Is this a version with autoinstaller?
Don't get this, when a new patch comes out you won't be able to update... 
You can't go online and the files are messed up in the folder, so you can't manually patch it.
Confirm this, though, if possible."

You simply can't play online on battle.net if you don't have the game. If you want to, buy WC3 and TFT."
