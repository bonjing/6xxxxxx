,netrek,2011-09-27T06:08Z,extremezone you rock! any idea when r5/screener will be available for Fright Night 2011?
,Jessejames05,2011-09-27T10:36Z,Thanks for all the great Movies you have uploaded. The quality is SUPERB. Can I just ask one question and maybe someone else can answer it.....what application/software do you use to rip these Movies? I have tried various applications like CloneDVD Mobile and Magic DVD Ripper and Daniusoft Video Converter Ultimate.....all have given me the quality of picture and the smaller size that you achieve ....mine tend to be grainy and slightly pixelated. Obviously I'm not using the application you are using.....so can you help me.....please? 
[V],extremezone,2011-09-27T13:12Z,netrek when will be available i will upload it
,selamhaci,2011-09-27T15:27Z,"I need help people; i'm looking for any kind of subtitle for this film (for timestamps). Anyone?

Thanks for the amazing movie btw. and for who dont like lars von trier movies; go watch pokemon or other shit like that. this is art"
,phattsao,2011-09-27T19:33Z,"Kirsten gets topless about 1 hour 20 minutes into the movie.

Otherwise this has to be the single most boring film in recorded history.  A better title might have been ""Watching Paint Dry - The Movie""."

,patisallano,2011-09-29T22:56Z,"Thanks for upload, but to see another Lars Von Boring movie has been allowed to be produced in times of economical crisis, is really really sad.

Was very impressed with the acting, superb.

A very good film. Not a happy one though. Guess the clue is in the title?

,_Saint,2011-10-05T16:40Z,"Thank you for sharing extremezone. Great upload.
This movie uses a language that might not be familiar to some, thus the negative comments.
Good movie within it's aesthetic. Remember, it's about characters, not actions. "

It's a great movie, but not for everybody. The pace is slow and methodical, and if your not into that, then you are better off not bothering. :)"
,bodgg77,2011-10-06T03:34Z,"OK Quality, a blurred line at top of the picture but otherwise good

nice film, i enjoy these slow burners, cannot deal with the usual hollywood fare

,ChimChimtheOmni88,2011-10-06T13:32Z,"I've just started seeing these spammers recently, and they're very bad at what they do. They post the same clearly scripted line under different names on fucking everything. What kind of retards do they think we are? As for the critics, I can't really argue against them cuz I haven't seen the movie yet. And for the record, I kinda liked Antichrist. Yeah, sure, it was fucked up, but it wasn't horrible."

,st0gey,2011-10-09T08:59Z,"Thanks EZ

A/9
V/9

M/7.5

This is beautifully shot, tightly scripted and exceedingly well-acted little masterpiece from Danish auteur, Lars Von Trier. It explores the themes of futility, depression, loneliness and ultimately, the meaninglessness of existence. 

Not a happy story then, but well worth a look if you've ever pondered such things or indeed if you're the pondering kind. Like most great stories it requires a little patience and some thought so, its very easy to see why it doesn't appeal to the average U.S. Pirate-Bay simpleton.  

There's a very good review here:http://www.musicvita.com/music-freak/movies/8661-film-review-melancholia.html

That stunning piece of music used throughout the movie can be found here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4554138/Richard_Wagner_-_Tristan_und_Isolde_-_Bayreuth_1966

,Psynaut00,2011-10-09T23:11Z,"I have never logged in just to warn people not to watch a movie, but this movie is awful.  Pointless, slow, the entire first half had nothing to do with the second half, which was still a godawful waste of an hour all by itself.  Save yourself from the misery and pass this one up.  Tree of Life was 100 times better than this, if you want to watch a pointless, slow, meandering piece of shit movie."
,Psynaut00,2011-10-09T23:17Z,"Also, for all the people that write about how deep and meaningful this movie is, that is only true in the Emo sense that is a self absorbed, self-important, exploration of depression and self-absorption.  There is nothing deep or meaningful in this movie.  You will not coma away from it with any profound insights about how to live your life, or how to understand any mysteries of your existence.  If you want to wallow in two plus hours of misery, than this one is for you."

Although not for the action-packed-movie-fans,  judge for yourself, it can be worth it, even the uneasy long scenes.

,cetl,2011-10-16T00:23Z,I get really upset that you base the rating of the movie on how hot Kirsten Dunst is. Men are fucking pigs!
,strontkegel16,2011-10-16T17:20Z,"-=Thank for the upload=-

Do not let yourself be fooled by the word ""sci-fi""

The whole movie is basically about a wedding going not according to plan.

Add 25 minutes of artsy stuff no average person can enjoy, and you have this movie."

,varilthes,2011-10-18T15:22Z,"Art is just like the many different opinions on whether or not Ms. Dunst is hot, very subjective. Cross section 50 people and the results of who finds Kirsten attractive and the ones who dont will be different, maybe by alot, maybe by a little. But the point is that people have difference of opinions on things that in the end are accredited by just that, opinions. So there forth keep your G0D D@MN opinions of whether the movie is good or not to your selves.
