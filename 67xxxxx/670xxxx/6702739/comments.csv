Can you upload a Hard Disk to be able to stock all your oldies!
Many thanks"

Right now a 2TB hard disk to plug into your
computer for extra storage goes for a song
as they say!

 Even Ipods now store so much
more for so little money.

We can change the world by changing what we
have to listen to - and good old fashioned music is one key way to go.

with thanks - Michael Rizzo
