A mysterious masked figure, Magnus, interrupts all television broadcasts to announce the on-air kidnapping of an actress. As his men make off with their victim, Magnus warns of a jewelry store theft which he will broadcast the following week.

In his cave hideout, Magnus explains to the kidnapped starlet that he had been scorned by her mother, years before. Now rich from dealing arms on the black market, he's out for revenge.

Santo is brought into the case, as is reporter/singer Gerardo Reyes, who had been performing on TV at the time of Magnus' initial broadcast. Working loosely with Reyes (who we learn is also a police agent in his spare time), Santo moves to investigate Magnus and block a second, planned kidnapping.
