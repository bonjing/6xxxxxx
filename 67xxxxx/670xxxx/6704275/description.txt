another fresh new beta build from today : september 27
as usual still as beta stage and still under development.
not official yet and delivered for internal-personal testing purpose only.
As it is still a beta,you might get possible crash or failure in certain conditions but not forcibly anyway.
Don't forget to delete your setting options and cache every time before installing any new version,indeed.

All feedback will still be welcome as well.

enjoy

Wish you get or have a very nice day

best regards
