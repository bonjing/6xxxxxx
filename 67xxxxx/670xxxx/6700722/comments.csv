I use ADOBE ACROBAT X (10.1.1) PRO

I don't know if some of my books are compatible with earlier versions of Acrobat

All my books can be viewed\read with the version i use

If you want you can download it from here :)

[T],dynstab2,2011-09-25T16:39Z,"@bigbluesea  Files not fully compliant to a PDF Version 1.x standard will _not_ display correctly in any Adobe product (Reader, Acrobat, Design,...). Non-compliance is treated as a potential security breach (e.g. virus embedding) and the non-compliant editing will be ignored and display as an anomaly. Many files from Cengage Learning/Brooks Cole, McGraw-hill, Pearson and Wiley (in decreasing order of occurences, in my experience) are non-compliant. Among display anomalies: Objects in the form of figures/paragraphs/footnotes not displaying completely or at all. PDF viewers like the ones by Tracker Software (X-Change) and Foxit Corp (Foxit) are less fussy than Adobe and will oversee non-compliance."
