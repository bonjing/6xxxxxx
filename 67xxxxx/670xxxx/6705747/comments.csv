Since this is not a systemization or even an indexed work but just a collection of nearly random items it would be trivial to add stuff you could get from this site alone to make tens, even hundreds of gigabytes of this collection. But any public library has far more information. I'll be surprised if anything comes of this."
,Derickburton,2011-12-09T18:22Z,"I'm having some trouble downloading this torrent. Its almost finished, but keeps stopping. 
Whenever I restart Miro it works for a minute or two and then stops again. 

I was wondering if it has something to do with my share ratio, as its only 0.11? I have no problem uploading as much as I download, but it just doesn't seem to want to upload. 

I've heard people can ban you from torrents for this. I've checked my preferences in Miro and there is no limit to how much I can both upload and download.

If anyone help me with this it would be much appreciated?"
