
The Codex v1.01 â€œEssentialsâ€
This version is of The Codex is a slightly larger one with all the same goodies and many more new ones! It fits very nicely and neatly on a CD it is meant to be burned and shared with those without internet!
The point of The Codex is to be a base of knowledge from which one can learn and grow. This is the very first test run for what will become a much larger project the goal is to make this a database of all human knowledge and existence 
The Codex is based in part on the â€œCodes Gigasâ€ ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Gigas ) as well as having many books and knowledge I believe all should have!
