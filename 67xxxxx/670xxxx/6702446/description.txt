One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest [1975]

Upon arrival at a mental institution, a brash rebel rallies the patients
together to take on the oppressive Nurse Ratched, a woman more a dictator than
a nurse.

The film was the second to win all five major Academy Awards (Best Picture,
Actor in Lead Role, Actress in Lead Role, Director, and Screenplay) following
It Happened One Night in 1934, an accomplishment not repeated until 1991 by
The Silence of the Lambs.
