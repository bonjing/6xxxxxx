,SillySOB,2011-09-25T19:47Z,"I registered here just to say that you're doing yourself a disservice watching this movie on a cam.  It has, hands down, the best sound design/music I've seen in a movie in a VERY long time.  I'm downloading this now but I guarantee you that when this movie hits the cheap theater I'll be there to see it again. Do yourself a favor guys-- BUY A TICKET.  It really is that good.  "
,danhf,2011-09-25T20:19Z,"Just a word of warning for some: this isn't the final version of the film. The soundtrack is mostly temp tracks, most of which are taken from the SOCIAL NETWORK OST. There are no end credits included, and the opening credits wrongly list Angelo Badalamenti as the score composer.
(It's still a pretty awesome movie though, even in this unfinished form.)"
,epicfrog,2011-09-25T21:51Z,"definitely has the social network theme in it, very bizarre"
,SillySOB,2011-09-25T21:54Z,"Just from watching the first 5 minutes, I've already spotted at least half a dozen changed or added lines and none of them make the movie better.  The dialogue from the 2 guys in the back seat, the 'all quiet' line from the cop, the helicopter being called 'Bravo 2' instead of 'Air 2'.  Lots of little things but they do matter, and like I already said, unless you got an amazing sound setup and a 60 inch tv you really want to be watching this movie in a theater.  "

,epicfrog,2011-09-25T22:12Z,"after skimming through the Social Network soundtrack, the only track I could find that used in this version of Drive is the opening song ""Hand Covers Bruise"" or it could be the reprise of ""Hand Covers Bruise"". other than that I have no idea where they got any of the music for this version of the movie. it's very bizarre and can't wait until the final product comes out."
,axen81,2011-09-25T22:44Z,"@epicfrog yes it should be taken seriously as I'm trying to warn ppl not to get over excited when they see the imdb score. 
I did and was dissapointed. If you all like the film then hey that's great.

I would say it's harder to take your double posting ass seriously."

,prettynerdy,2011-09-26T08:32Z,"W.T.F?

The first 50 minutes were boring as hell. And the entire movie was full of awkward pauses, knowing silences, and shitty 80's music. I feel bad for Ryan Gosling for being part of it. And that's not even touching on the horrible magenta font used for the opening credits.

(a true tragedy, and their handling of it was too).. but how exactly did the US provoke Japan into Pearl Harbor? Oh that's right they didn't, they merely had a large contingent of ships stationed there (from before the war starting). They tried to stay out of it and I think they we were the last ones into WW2 (if not, one of the last ones).

2. If the movie was about the driver, how come Blanche (Christina Hendricks character) was way more of a bad ass?  She was driving and shooting and did most of the stunts in the movie?

3. When Albert Brooks tortures him and cuts off 3 of his toes, how does he get up and walk out of the place without limping when his girlfriend (played by Carey Mulligan) rescues him with the shotgun?

I gotta say by far this movie was total garbage! Im not into giving bad reviews, but the first 35-40 minutes of the movie could have gone right out the window! The idea concept is great, a Driver for Hire, (spoiler) they play around with this chick and her kid storyline FAR to much! 

The acting was crap! Who made the choices on actors? He needs to be shot! The camera angles they picked made me scratch my head, the sound effects were horrible! The car sounds alone made it seem like he was pushing 8 or 9 shifts during the chases! WTF/E! Dude is a driver and cant drive a GTO to nearly save his life!? 

Anyways, The Music was even worse, made me feel like I was in some 1970's porn flick! I have no idea why they made such a horrible choice in Audio Editing to pick some the songs they did, but okay... 

The best part of the Movie was about 45 minutes in when the dude gets capped and then in the hotel room when the fire fight brakes out, which lasts about 3 minutes maybe! Other then the maybe 20 minutes of driving the movie actually does show, the rest is utter bordum! Bottom line! "

I can see why some people would think this movie was rubbish, some people just expect explosions for 2 hours straight. As the movie is called drive i would have expected it to be alittle faster too but it was still a cool movie."

,Marshmont,2011-10-01T03:55Z,What is unfortunate is that those of us that are waiting for a finished copy of the movie will likely have to wait for DVD since it doesnt seem anyone will try for a cam or TS now that this incomplete working copy has become widely available 
,fuellizard,2011-10-01T11:23Z,just watched drive fucking loved it because it didnt have all that cgi explosions and shit and the main character wasnt an unrealistic guy and the sound track was perfect for it watch and and see if it doesnt remind you of early to mid 90s style movies but yea if you think anything the rock has been in is a good movie then you probably wont like this

,tmackb,2011-10-01T15:16Z,"Just a heads-up this looks like a cut of the movie with scratch audio.  I saw this in theaters and a lot of the sound effects used in this screener have ""classic"" sound effects we've all heard before (for example, in the opening scene when he's in the parking garage, the sound effects used in the crowd is the same sound used in Daft Punk's Revolution 909. This was NOT in the final cut of the film).


As for my thoughts on the film, I thought it was great but it's meant for a smaller audience due to it's slow meditative nature in the beginning.  I'm not going to argue with those that thought it was boring, gay, etc.  This simply wasn't a movie meant for you"

I downloaded both this and ViSUALISE's version.
ViSUALISE's has about 15 minutes in the movie that look like ""time frame"" pictures, but it has far better quality than this one. I used this version to get through those parts
I found it strange to listen to ""The Social Network"" here, and there where some audio effects a little amateur, then I discovered it's not the finished version
Even so, you the movie is very good, it has it's how rhythm and style 
It's one of those you keep thinking about the followind day and makes you take another look
But this time I'll do it on a Theater, for the final version, when it opens here in 2 months time"

People who like car movies and action movies will hate this movie, and intelligent people who like non-mainstream movies will hate this movie. But in between, there's a a retarded little group of asshats who think they're intelligent, because to them anything that tries to look intelligent, must be intelligent, because that's the only approach to intelligence they are familiar with.

I could've made another list, ""8 reasons why you'll love this movie"", like I did for Moon, thus successfully averting its sequel because Duncan Dumbass Jones read it and realized the movie was a pile of shit, but really, it sucks too much. It sucks a lot more than Moon. 

You shitheads who love this movie: You're not just stupid assholes with zero taste or insight into real life and moviemaking (both are necessary to appreciate a script like this)  you've passed a threshold into a kind of douchedom that's incurable and lasts the rest of your lives.

Great movie. I assume that those who don't seem to agree were unaware about what kind of movie it would be, unfamiliar with the indie stylings, misled by the trailers and expected it to be a Fast and Furious type of flick as someone mentioned, and merely confused by the rave reviews. To each his own, but I prefer great performances, stylish aesthetics, and emotional potency (though even I agree that the staring was a little bit much, just a little) over a clusterfuck of mindless action. 

Note though that there are no credits (the movie is complete though) and that The Social Network (possibly other movies too) score is used as a stand-in for this screener."

NO this is not Fast & Furious, so if you expect that then you will be dissapointed. Just sit back and wait for F&F6 to come out.

Imagine if the VGs Driver & Vice City were merged and made into a film, that's exactly what you'll get.

You hate a movie and the people that like it because 'It has awkward pauses' or that its 'Slow'

Yeah, there's not someone dying every 5 minutes or an explosion around every corner, go back to the Fast and the Furious you poor neglected angry child. 

Though I will say, it seems like its a hit or miss for people liking it or not, nothing wrong with that.

,dpn7,2011-11-04T03:29Z,"The quality is decent, but it's important to know that this version has not the real soundtrack. The songs used are correct, but it's not the score from Cliff Martinez (mostly ambient sounds). For example during the elevator scene there is ""An Ending (Ascent) by Brian Eno, whereas it was absolutely not this track when I saw the movie in theaters last night. Plus I had the impression that some scenes are shorter/edited...

If you know what to expect (a real intense drama/film neo with romance and harsh violence, not an action/chase film), then hurry to the theaters, it really deserves it."
,poot,2011-11-05T11:20Z,"For those expecting an intense action film look elsewhere. In my opinion this movie delivers more in it's dialog and great acting. 

The director did a great job making anyone relate to the main characters emotions throughout the film. The scenes that do contain action are done amazingly well, its nice to see a movie that's not all gun's a blazin'.

I really do apologize, because you all must have been mentally challenged to find this movie boring or bad in even the slightest way. I absolutely loved every second of it, and found every aspect of this movie to meet or exceed my expectations. The soundtrack to the movie though has to be it's number one feature though. Simply fucking beautiful. I did think it was weird that he probably had the shortest amount of lines than all of the others, but he did great I thought.

Can extremezone not get a quality .avi near 700 mb?  Maybe this is why extremezone normally has near 1.5 gig files for everyone elses 700 mb quality.  Extremezone has failed me yet again.  And before this starts a flame war with all of extremezone's fans, I do realize it is free and am thankful for extremezone's uploads, it's just that extremezone whines whenever anyone comments on the large files sizes for regular DVD rips or the poor quality.
