Family Guy have lost its charm. I didn't even smile watching this episode."
,aParadox,2011-09-26T18:56Z,"Audio was top notch as always, video was impeccable with few artifacts.
The storyline was great, it feels like back in the seasons (after season 1) where it was just golden.
Good pilot! Can't wait for the rest of the season, and can't wait for more Dexter either!"
