Hawkeye miniseries from 1994 featuring Hawkeye after Mockingbird's death going up against the Secret Empire (recently seen in the Taskmaster mini).  I've actually been looking for this mini forever after becoming interested in the Secret Empire due to the Spiderman and Moon Knight storylines in the 90s.  This mini features War Machine, TrickShot, Viper and Javelynn.
