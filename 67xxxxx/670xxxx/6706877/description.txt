Katie Herzig struck out on her own after eight years as the frontwoman for Newcomers Home. Herzig was no stranger to the solo game, having released her first solo album, Watch Them Fall, in 2004, so it was no surprise when, following the dissolution of Newcomers Home in 2006, Herzig put together a second album, Weightless, which was released that summer. Comprised of quirky, heartfelt songs that nodded to twangy, warm-voiced artists like Devon Sproule and Neko Case, the album generated quite a bit of critical buzz. Herzig spent the next two years playing gigs, collaborating with other artists, and writing new material. Her third full-length album, Apple Tree, was released in the spring of 2008.  The Waking Sleep followed in 2011.
