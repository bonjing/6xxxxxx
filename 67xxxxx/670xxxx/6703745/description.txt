Pickpocket King
In 2005, members of an organised crime ring in Naples were so impressed by comedy pickpocket entertainer Bob Arno's light fingers that they offered him a chance to join their gang for $1,000 a day. He declined, returning to Las Vegas where he regularly delights audiences by inviting people up on stage to have their possessions unwittingly stolen.
In this documentary, Arno heads to the Italian city billed as 'the pickpocket capital of the world' and where even he lost his Rolex to crafty scooter-riding bandits. There, he uncovers some of the world's most cunning thieves and hunts for pickpockets who can match his own unbelievable skills. He also ventures into the heart of an international crew of street thieves to discover just how easy it is to pinch for a living.
