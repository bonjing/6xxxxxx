dude,i still get the same recurent problem with you :
you are very very slow and often as peer blocking
and often slowing down certain of my seeds
and making problems with several other peers.
The result is : high traffic congestion :s
not nice at all so !
and this is not the first time,indeed.
Why are you so slow ?
Are you really sure your torrent client is rightly set ? 
wondering what's wrong with you so...
too slow internet connection ?
using or behind a proxy ?
downloading too much different torrents at the same time ?
Vantage computer ?
often get stuck by certain trackers ?
i still see you downloading in force anyway,proving well a serious anomalie from your part.
What else bro ?
Please ask me asap,i would really like to know...
Anyway if it will still continue like that i could be forced to take a hard decision about you.
guess thereby you know what i mean now.
Act bro,find the right solution,ok ?
or contact me to :
tyrell.tpb@gmail.com for more support so.
ty for understanding"

It wanted to access the internet instead, even though I had disabled it from checking for updates, then nothing. Dead in the water. Clicking the Start button was inactive. Nothing happened.

FWIW ChattChitto's DVDFab 8125 version had similar problems as discussed in that torrent's comments. They seem to have found a workaround using a different crack - works for some people, at least."
