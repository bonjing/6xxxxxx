    The third episode looks at the last generation of          
    killer dinosaurs - carnivores that took killing to a      
    new level.                                               
                                                              
    By the end of the cretaceous period - 75 millions years    
    ago - these gigantic and specialised hunter-killers had   
    spread throughout the globe. In the southern continents  
    it was the powerful and muscular abelisaurids that        
    reigned supreme but it was the famous tyrannosaurids       
    (or tyrant dinosaurs) that dominated in the north.        
                                                             
    Whilst the Northern Daspletosaurus hunted in gangs,       
    using its highly developed smell and hearing to take       
    down opponents like the horned rhino-sized beast,         
    Chasmosaurus, in the Southern hemisphere the small       
    skulled Majungasaurus reigned. And though the sharp       
    toothed Majungasaurus was an efficient killer of the       
    much smaller feathered Rahonavis, that did not stop it    
    from occasionally turning cannibal and hunting its own.
