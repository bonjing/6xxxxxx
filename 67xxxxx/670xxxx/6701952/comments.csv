,sherynoshka,2011-09-26T07:44Z,thank you for the good wife
,sspeaks,2011-09-26T10:45Z,Thanks for ALL the shows you upload.
,sspeaks,2011-09-26T12:23Z,"Please do pan am, desperate housewives and csi miami"
,bipolarx,2011-09-26T13:39Z,Dooshbags- you don't need to download the other shows if you don't want them-go to the file and delete/skip those other shows. The fact that charlesfire has gone out of his way to make the files compressed- and three shows for the same mbs as one show would be via extv- is awesome and you should pay your respects for quicker download time. Bet you have a maid that wipes your arse- golden spoon boys.
,slavo66,2011-09-26T13:48Z,i hope you do desperate housewives too. thanks for all the other uploads
,ate88,2011-10-29T06:41Z,WARNING I think this has a virus! the boardwalk file is not an avi and the second it started dowloading it blocked my bittorrent to keep me from stoping it... once i deleted everything bit torrent worked great. download at ur own risk i didnt bother to find out if im right..
