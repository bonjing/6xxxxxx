These are the games I missed, I only saw highlights. To see the whole games is a real treat. Keep up the good work! I really appreciate your time and dedication to 2p2 sharing on a public tracker."
[V],Nepotu,2011-09-27T14:46Z,"I'll try within my possibilities. You're welcome, mma4me!"
[T],thetorrentlord,2011-09-27T16:08Z,"Thanks for all the uploads. Are you recording and then compressing or just downloading files? Asking because some of the recordings have no English soundtrack, and some are very poor quality. Just got around to checking all of the ones I D/L earlier and wanted to let you know."
[V],Nepotu,2011-09-27T21:05Z,"You're welcome! I just download the games from ""direct download"" sites and then upload them here, only here. It's a kind of work with my bandwidth and my space in HDD. :) Anyway, you can't find better quality. Was the VHS era. So... "
[T],thetorrentlord,2011-09-28T15:07Z,Thanks for the reply. I was just curious about the quality and the source.
