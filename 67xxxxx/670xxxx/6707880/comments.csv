,scurvypirate1234,2011-09-29T04:07Z,"maggot_corpse, because of the video/audio quality, or just the movie itself?"
,maggot_corpse,2011-09-29T09:37Z,i'm sure the quality is great. the movie itself is garbage
,Delsher,2011-09-29T13:34Z,Can you upload Green lantern Blu-ray 1080p i've been looking for a high quality but unfortunately there are only dvd rips aviable for the moment.
,TheExpert100,2011-10-05T14:55Z,Great Movie. Cameron Diaz is gorgeous!

,gbussh01,2011-10-10T20:06Z,Is this also the unrated version? TQ
,fuctup.rm,2011-10-18T17:31Z,"@ gbussh01 - Check the runtime. 1:32 = theatrical version, 1:37 = unrated edition."
,matheusrosa,2011-10-27T13:16Z,more seed plz :-)
,Opera_of_Death,2011-12-04T14:19Z,Sadly the rippers forgot to remove Cinavia from this release so you can't play it on a PS3 :(
