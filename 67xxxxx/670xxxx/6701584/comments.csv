,flense,2011-09-26T17:56Z,"I can only assuming it had something to do with the format of the JPEGs. When unrared, Windows couldn't open them. So I'm guessing whatever OS or OS version you have uses different JPEG libraries and ComicRack uses those."

Can you also do fixed versions of wowcabbages new releases for Sep. 28th. None of them work on Comic Rack either. He says next time he's gonna make them work with it but we need a fix for this week. Please either upload a torrent or tell me how to fix it my self Thx."

Agree with cnester. Would greatly appreciate fixed versions of aquaman, hawkman, justice league dark, and superman. or if not, just *how* to fix them so i could do it myself and read on comicrack. Thanks much!"
