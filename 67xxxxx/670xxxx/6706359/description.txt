  How often have you watched a sport  on TV and thought you'd  like to  
    try it, only to be put off by a  boring  instruction manual?  The Go    
  series is designed just for you. It's a book  and DVD  package aimed  
    at anyone with  the inclination to play,  from   the  25+ generation    
  with the disposable income to try new things,   to the  over-40s who  
    are catching up on  a youth spent working  too  hard.  We  all learn    
  better through visual  demonstration, so  the  Go  series  uses  the  
    clarity of print and the dynamism of the   moving  image  to provide    
  the most natural, effective way to learn.                             
    Written in an  inspirational style  with  an  instructive  DVD,  the    
  series aims to help you to stop thinking about a  sport and just get  
    out there and do   it. The tone  is   easy-going  and  encouraging -    
  theory is broken down into reader-friendly,   bite-sized chunks  for  
    maximum clarity and accessibility.
