[V],mirrormaster82,2011-09-28T01:29Z,"So,why are you all releasing workprint of this movie when there's a solid screener released 5 days ago or so?I'm just curious..."
,mk_d,2011-09-28T04:08Z,"@mirrormaster82 This is the same as the screener you are talking about. It is just confirming what many of us already know, that it is an unfinished workprint. It has unfinished effects (not noticeable), different editing and almost none of the original score. However anyone watching for the first time or without information will not be able to notice these things at all, that is why it has been passing off as a screener all these days. The uploader has just changed the name of the (same) print to clarify the facts"
[V],mirrormaster82,2011-09-28T11:39Z,"mk_d:Thanks also for clearing that up.I downloaded the ""screener"" few days ago,but haven't watched it yet..."
