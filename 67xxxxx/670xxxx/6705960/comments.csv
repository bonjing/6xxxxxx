,Alexlegend,2011-09-29T20:33Z,"When you start downloading and see the 30 files it says ""Fifa 11"".
Are you sure that this is ""Fifa 12""?
And if it is ""Fifa 12"" is this the best version or are there better versions than?"
,ykumar00,2011-09-30T04:48Z,DONT DOWNLOAD !! ITS FIFA 11  !! NOT FIFA 12 !!
,FatFreddy33,2011-09-30T13:56Z,"@ykumar00 - you're dumb. did you download it and check it, or did you just read the name? Spelling mistakes happen you know -___-

@jurgenvalid - what do you mean? the game is for ps2 and not ps3, how more can I explain?

@Alexlegend - What on earth is a better version? LOL!"

,Alexlegend,2011-10-01T12:16Z,"And jurgenvalin Fifa and PES will always be for PS2 beacuse most people hava PS2,and not PS3.
I will wait for the new Playstation console to buy it :)"
,FatFreddy33,2011-10-01T14:04Z,"@jurgenvalid - Because I know A LOT of people who want it on ps2, and I have a psp, xbox 360, ps2, But no PS3 and that's why I don't upload ps3 games...

@Alexlegend - ERS is a games studio, where did you read that?"

,FatFreddy33,2011-10-01T18:01Z,"@marshale - you're telling them to read something before they ask stupid questions?
Maybe you should read something first yourself, it clearly says in the description that it's pal."

Its all fine PS2 reads it well until he comes to the Ronney picture and than he blocks.
I let it so for 2 hours and it didnt move.
The music stops and its all blocked,I tried to restart it few times but it wont work.
And idea or tips?
I burned it with Alcohol 120.
tpb-user-100 said ""I patched this game with ESR and works perfect.""
So thats why I asked what is ESR."

,Alexlegend,2011-10-02T21:24Z,"TBP I burned 5-6 games with Alcohol 120 and it worked,just Fifa 12 dosent work.
Why?
Is it so easy with ESR?"
,Alexlegend,2011-10-02T21:26Z,"I burned 5-6 games with Alcohol 120 and they work,just Fifa 12 dont,why?
I burn them on a CD-DVD with speed of 4x.
Its easier with Alcohol 120,try it."
,Alexlegend,2011-10-02T22:00Z,"Friends I am a little boring,but I really want this to work.
This game is for PSx,and I have PS2.
Is the burning process the same or must I do something different.
Is it possible to play PSx games on PS2.
Thank you,
Alex"
,FatFreddy33,2011-10-02T23:24Z,"@Alexlegend - I doubt you have to do anything else, I know I didn't...

,Kaje13,2012-03-11T14:12Z,"All TPB games work on me. I use Brasero Disc Burner on linux. Whether DVD-R or DVD-RW works.
I advise RW since you won't waste DVD-Rs when burning gets fucked."
