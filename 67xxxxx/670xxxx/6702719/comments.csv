,TeamPlayer,2011-09-27T02:12Z,"Thank you very much for this.  ""Call Me Fitz"" is being shot in my home town and is now shooting Season 3.  This will be a real shocker when it aires on HBO next fall...  ;)

Can't give any spoilers, sorry.."

I did release John A.   Birth of a Country. It isn't here because i didn't think there would be demand for it. It is Canadian history so no promise it will have a lot of seeders - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6706068

InSecurity is on next week. Being Erica  was on yesterday and did get a scene release. "
