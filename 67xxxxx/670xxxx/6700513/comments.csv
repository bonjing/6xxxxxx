,DaMadBoy,2011-09-26T19:12Z,"I can't seem to download any of the doctor who torrents, I add them to utorrent, then they flash 1 peer and back to zero. All my other torrents work perfectly fine, it just seems to be the doctor ones.

Any ideas why it might be doing this?

and yes I have waited for the torrents to start, been trying since last night. "

,BinkyDeath,2012-01-13T22:06Z,"It's the exact same file as all of the other copies I've found so far:
TV Rip from the BBC One HD channel (so the resolution is tiny since it's copied from an HD channel).
It has the exact same tinny-sounding audio problems for the first 25 seconds of the episode as all of the other torrents I've found so it must have been a problem with the BBC transmitter. :( That means that all of the TV Rips from the BBC 1 HD channel will have this fault. 
Recording from the normal BBC 1 channel makes more sense if the finished resolution is going to be so tiny - plus you wouldn't have the channel label in the top left corner.
The HDTV label in the torrent title shouldn't be there as it's not High Definition by a long shot.
I would expect better quality and higher resolution for the file size - but I guess it's about average quality for the usual rips around for this resolution. Not horrible quality, but not good either. Not dissing the uploader here - just my observation on the quality.
v:7 a: 1-8 (variable) if you want points for quality.
Then again - I can't find a better copy below 1Gb, only the same copy under different file/torrent names or some differing in file size, probably due to the coding, which seems to make no real difference to the quality of the fininshed copy. 
I don't know who the original ripper/uploader was but a whole bunch of people have downloaded it, changed the file name, and uploaded it again with a slightly different file name, so you may end up downloading the same file a bunch of times like me trying to find a good quality one. Don't waste your time. You may have to go for a much higher file size to find a good copy of this episode (at the time I'm writing this post anyway).
One's as good as the other (especially at this low resolution) if it has been ripped from the BBC One HD Channel as the transmission is pretty poor."
