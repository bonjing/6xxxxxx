Hawkeye and MockingBird 1-6 (2010)
MockingBird has set up her own independent spy agency the World Counter-terrorism Agency (WCA for short). After Mockingbird and Hawkeye stop a gunrunning operation by Crossfire, they find themselves battling a new Phantom Rider teamed with Crossfire.  
The series deals with a lot of Mockingbird's history including Skrulls, the Phantom Rider incident in West Coast Avengers and more.  However it's pretty assessable with much of the history recounted at the very least in a feature at the end of the first comic.
I'll be uling the subsequent hawkeye series that this leads into
Thanks to the original scanners and uploaders. Enjoy
