ReleaseNotes:

When this album was released in 1980, James Taylor had just separated from Carly Simon, his wife of nine years, and was addicted to both Heroin and alcohol. This man was several centuries removed from the author of "Shower The People" or "Your Smiling Face."

Perhaps no other marital split between public figures was so well documented. "Her Town, Too," the standout track on this decidedly uneven album, candidly captures the devastation of breaking up: "Some of them his friends/Some of them her friends/Some of them understand" To get the other side of this story, listen to Carly's devestating "We're So Close" (Available on her Spy CD!).

"Hour That Morning Comes" masks its message of fear and adiction behind some southern soul music, but still gets its message across. And the desolation of "That Lonesome Road" is as much psychological as it is physical. To balance all this, Taylor does manage to throw in one positive sleeper, "Summer's Here."

We rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.
HHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)
