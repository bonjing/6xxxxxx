Struck by lightning, and survivor of six near-death experiences, June DeYoung has been providing her psychic services to Hollywood and corporate leaders for over 30 years. She shared some of her psychic techniques, Hollywood stories, and predictions for the future. Using sage, she said she was able to contact the spirit of Jim Morrison, which she was asked to do as part of a VH1 special. She said Morrison spoke through her and said the day he died in Paris, he'd taken "blue pills," and that he hadn't died in the bathtub, but his body was moved there.

DeYoung said she feels various earth events like earthquakes as physical symptoms in her body, before they occur. She sees the East Coast being deluged by water after a tsunami hits, and Maine being underwater in a separate incident. Further, she foresees plant life blooming in the desert, and Montana as a safe haven. Her most recent vision is of six small planes that will simultaneously explode over different parts of the US.

She predicted problems with the water in Chicago, and a water contamination episode involving the numbers 007, 008 in California. She sees people fleeing the Sacramento/Fresno area possibly due to radiation. DeYoung also related how she got her moniker of Miss UFO, tips for increasing psychic skills, and alternative health treatments.


Alternative Cancer Treatment

First hour guest, Dr. Tullio Simoncini discussed his antifungal treatment for cancer using sodium bicarbonate (baking soda). He has concluded that cancer is a fungal infection, and that sodium bicarbonate can be a highly effective treatment when applied correctly to tumors. Sometimes this might involve surgery, where the bicarbonate solution is applied directly to the cancer growth such that it sterilizes its roots, he explained.
