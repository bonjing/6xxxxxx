This is a rare John Williams conducting of the original Star Wars trilogy score. The orchestra was handpicked by George Lucas and called the Skywalker Symphony Orchestra.

This happened in 1990, right in the middle of that decade where \'Star Wars\' was off the map, (between Return of the Jedi and the special edition re-releases). So it was very pure and removed from the hyper-commercialism that would really take over \'Star Wars\' just a few years later.

It\'s not very different than the standard soundtrack, but I\'ve always thought that it was John Williams\'s best recording of the score ever.

It\'s uploaded as both .FLAC (lossless) and .MP3 at 320 kbps. You can choose whichever version you want. Both file types are tagged and written.

As always, please seed up to at least 100%, and hopefully more.
