Maybe you should just get a grip on your genre.

I would call it ""Progressive Rock"" or simply ""Rock."""

I had just ripped the cd and used nfo maker for details.

So not my fault."
,mo63090,2011-09-28T18:10Z,"who really knows:thrash, progressive, acid.. It is a classic album!"
,prettByRD,2011-10-30T04:29Z,Who cares! It's PINK FLOYD! It's one of the best bands of all time! And If you're downloading it you probably already know who it is and that you like it anyway. lol And I consider it to be classic rock. : )
