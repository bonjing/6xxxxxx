,mak_2137,2011-09-27T09:37Z,"@webchella,
Please let me know if this ""BitDefender Total Security 2012 Build 15.0.27.322 Final"" is in Trial mode or is it a cracked version of the same. I am asking this as Trial mode is available in BitDefender's own site. You have mentioned the features but not the installation criteria. "
,Daikataro,2011-12-10T04:07Z,"The package has the exact same installers that can be downloaded from bitdefender homesite.

The keygen is in either hebrew or some islamic/indian language, uncomprehensible for about 90% of the world's population

The readme file only has a string of numbers and letters that was most likely generated by the keygen, and worst part is that neither that nor the keys generated by the keygen are recognized as valid for the installer

ABSOLUTELY NOT WORTH THE DOWNLOAD"
,Daikataro,2011-12-10T04:51Z,"UPDATE: The keygen language is arabic and doesn't work for any of the 3 supplemented installers, two of which jam at 50% progress"
,cindos,2011-12-10T10:21Z,"Is this for Win X86 or X64?
I prefer x64.
Tq."
