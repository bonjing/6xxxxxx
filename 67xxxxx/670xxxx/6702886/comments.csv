,Warshine,2011-09-27T01:47Z,Thanks you!
,IIIIIIIII,2011-09-27T04:00Z,Is this the theatrical release?
,RPO1973,2011-09-27T06:49Z,It is the version from the most expensive 9-box set that is now out. As far as I know this is with all extra scenes etc.
,IIIIIIIII,2011-09-27T16:41Z,"@RPO1973: Thanks for replying!

And to all those who have 100% - Plase seed. 

If you seed you should have a ratio of at least 1.000 before you delete the torrent. But, If you have a high ratio and haven't finished downloading it's because you seed well."
,nandofire,2011-09-27T20:39Z,This is all movies of Star Wars? Or is just the first movie? 
,IIIIIIIII,2011-09-27T21:46Z,@nandofire: Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999)
,ob1knb2003,2011-09-28T22:29Z,thanks for all the effort for the six ( blu ray ) star wars films can u put the xtras or supplements in future upload
,IIIIIIIII,2011-09-29T09:08Z,"@RPO1973: Are you going to upload the other episodes soon?:

Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith

-----------------------------------------------------

...And remember guys - Don't forget to SEED.
If you want this six-piece collection to be complete, then you have to seed. I haven't downloaded this torrent completely yet - but i do have uploaded 100 gigs by now. So, the more you seed - the faster you get it. It is as simpel as that."
,RPO1973,2011-09-29T13:16Z,"I've already put ""Attack"" on my hard drive, ready for uploading.
ATM I've oploaded 93% of ""Phantom"", so expect the next one to be available later today.
Revenge of the Sith will folow a few day later.
To round it all off, I'll also do the bonus disks (actually quite nice to watch, even though I don't normally watch the extras).
Unfortunately mu upload speed is not that high...you'll all have to be a little patient :-)

To all the seeders: thanks for your help."
,tksamtec,2011-09-30T18:40Z,Stuck at 99.9%... I hope someone seeds more of this... thanks to RPO1973 for the upload.
,RPO1973,2011-10-01T08:51Z,I'll try and help you out.
,RPO1973,2011-10-01T09:11Z,There you go.
,Warshine,2011-10-04T17:19Z,This is Spanish Latin American ^.^ Thankyou!
,dude1450,2012-05-25T08:13Z,Can someone please SEED? It's going to be a ROUGH 7 weeks of trying to download this otherwise! Haha
,dude1450,2012-05-25T08:53Z,"actually, it's estimated over 10 weeks.."
,dude1450,2012-05-25T20:36Z,45 weeks*
