"It's the best book out there. We tried another book last semester just to be different and that was a disaster. So we'll...keep with NATURE OF MATHEMATICS."

"I have found more than enough material in each exercise set that keeps my students' interest. In light of the fact that most...of my students are not interested in math or science, I have welcomed the sight of the many problems that are conceptual rather than computational in nature." "One of the strengths of this text is the 'Presentation of topics that are not always computational in nature. This involves letting students see topics that they do not typically view as being mathematical and explore concepts in ways other than by just pushing buttons on a calculator."

"Even though I do not teach geometry or metrics from your text, I wish I could. Your units on these topics are excellent, better than those in most other texts I've seen or used." "I love the color, the pictures, the cartoons, the attempt to make the pages come alive. Your efforts have not gone unnoticed, at least not by me." --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.
