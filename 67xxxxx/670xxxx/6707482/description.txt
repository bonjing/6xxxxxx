Consider the new Infestation... OUTBROKEN! Covert Vampiric Operations are on the verge of being overwhelmed as the threat goes global. Team-infighting, malfunctioning new super-powers and a mischievous, chain-smoking little alien named Archie could all derail the team... at the exact moment when CVO needs to be at its finest! Action-a-plenty
