The only rip that isn't mine is To The 5 Boroughs so thank you to the original uploader. I ran Audiochecker to make sure it's a true flac and everything checked out - the log is included. Three of these albums are from the 2009 remasters that include a second bonus disc which is rather nice. Unfortunately I'm guessing these "remasters" though are actually butchered & brickwalled. Perhaps they're not too bad as I haven't really listened to them...

From Wiki:


Beastie Boys are an American hip hop trio from New York City.[1] The group consists of Mike D (Michael Diamond) who plays the drums, MCA (Adam Yauch) who plays the bass, and Ad-Rock (Adam Horovitz) who plays the guitar.

The Beastie Boys began as hardcore punk band in 1979, first appearing on the compilation cassette New York Thrash before releasing their first EP, Polly Wog Stew, in 1982. After achieving moderate local success with the 1983 release of their experimental hip hop 12" Cooky Puss, they made the transition to hip hop in 1984 and a string of successful 12" singles followed by their debut album Licensed to Ill in 1986 which received international critical acclaim and commercial success. As of 2010, they have sold 22 million albums in the United States and 40 million albums worldwide.

They are one of the longest lived hip hop acts worldwide and continue to enjoy commercial and critical success in 2011, nearly 25 years after the release of their debut album. On September 27, 2007, they were nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[2] In 2009, the group released digitally remastered deluxe editions of their albums Paul's Boutique, Check Your Head, Ill Communication and Hello Nasty. Their eighth studio album, Hot Sauce Committee Part Two, was released on May 3, 2011,[3] and received positive reviews. 








Licensed To Ill 1986


Licensed to Ill was the debut album by the Beastie Boys, released in 1986.

It was the first hip hop LP to top the Billboard 200 chart. It was also Columbia Records' fastest-selling debut record to date and sold over 9 million copies.

Kerry King of Slayer made an appearance on the album playing lead guitar on "No Sleep Till Brooklyn" and appeared in the music video which is a parody of glam metal. The name of the song itself is a spoof on MotÃ¶rhead's No Sleep 'til Hammersmith album. King's appearance on the track came about because Rick Rubin was producing both bands simultaneously (Slayer's Reign in Blood was originally released on Def Jam).

The full album cover, front to back, features a Boeing 727 â€” with "Beastie Boys" emblazoned on the tail â€” crashing head-on into the side of a mountain. The tail of the plane has the Def Jam logo and the legend '3MTA3' which spells 'EATME' when viewed in a mirror. The livery of the plane is based on that of American Airlines.

The original title for this album was Don't Be a Faggot, but Columbia Records flatly refused to release the album with this title and pressured Russell Simmons (their manager and label Def Jam head) into having the Beastie Boys to come up with another name. Adam Horovitz has since apologized for the band's earlier title.[1]

Music videos were made for the songs "(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)", "No Sleep till Brooklyn", "Hold It, Now Hit It", "Rhymin' and Stealin'" and "She's Crafty".

CBS/Fox Video released a video album of the five Licensed to Ill videos, plus "She's on It" in 1987 to capitalize on the album's success. A laserdisc version was also released in Japan. All versions of the CBS/Fox release are currently out of print due to the rights to the album passing from Columbia and Sony Music to Universal Music Group, and also because of the acrimonious nature of the band's departure from Def Jam Records. Until the 2005 release of the CD/DVD Solid Gold Hits, none of the Def Jam-era videos had been included on any subsequent Beastie Boys video compilations. The Solid Gold Hits DVD includes the videos for "Fight for Your Right" and "No Sleep Till Brooklyn", as well as a live version of "Brass Monkey" from a 2004 concert.

In 1998, the album was selected as one of The Source's 100 Best Rap Albums.[8]

It is still the only album by a white hip-hop act to receive the coveted 5 mics from The Source.

In 2003, the album was ranked number 217 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.[9]

Vibe (12/99, p. 158) â€“ Included in Vibe's 100 Essential Albums of the 20th Century.

Q magazine (9/94, p. 123) â€“ 4 stars â€“ "Licensed to Ill remains the world's only punk rock rap album, arguably superior to Never Mind the Bollocks...knowing that apathy and slovenliness were just around the corner."

Melody Maker (7/22/95, p. 35) â€“ Bloody Essential â€“ "There's lots of self-reverential bragging, more tenuous rhymes than are usually permitted by law and, most importantly of all, an unshakably glorious celebration of being alive....A surprisingly enduring classic."

In 2006, Q magazine placed the album at #16 in its list of "40 Best Albums of the '80s".

Paul's Boutique 1989


Paul's Boutique is the second studio album by American hip hop group Beastie Boys, released on July 25, 1989, on Capitol Records. Featuring production by the Dust Brothers, the recording sessions for the album took place in Matt Dike's Apartment and the Record Plant in Los Angeles from 1988 to 1989, after which the recordings underwent mixing at the Record Plant in Los Angeles. Subsequent remixes were done at the Manhattan-based Record Plant Studios.

Paul's Boutique was initially considered a commercial failure by the executives at Capitol Records, as its sales did not match that of the group's previous record, Licensed to Ill, and the label eventually decided to stop promoting the album. The album's popularity continued to grow, however, and it has even been touted as a breakthrough achievement for the Beastie Boys. Highly varied lyrically and sonically, Paul's Boutique secured the Beastie Boys' place as critical favorites in the hip-hop genre, and has been widely recognized as the group's magnum opus.[1] The album's rankings near the top of many publications' "best albums" lists in disparate genres has given Paul's Boutique critical recognition as a landmark album in hip hop.[2]

On January 27, 1999, Paul's Boutique was certified double platinum in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America.[3] In 2003, the album was ranked number 156 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.[4] The album was re-released in a 20th anniversary package featuring 24-bit remaster audio and a commentary track on January 27, 2009.

Check Your Head 1992 (2009 Remaster)


Check Your Head is the third studio album by the Beastie Boys, released on April 21, 1992.

Three years elapsed between the release of Paul's Boutique (the band's second album) and their recording of this album. Check Your Head was recorded at the G-Son Studios in Atwater Village, California in 1991. The album features the popular hits "So Whatcha Want" and "Pass the Mic"; the music videos for both songs are available on the Criterion Collection Beastie Boys Video Anthology DVD set. The album was re-released in 2009 in a number of formats and featured 16 b-sides and rarities as well as a commentary track.[1] The album is extensively broken down track-by-track by Mike D, MCA, Ad-Rock, Mario Caldato Jr., and Money Mark in Brian Coleman's book Check the Technique

In contrast to their previous album, Paul's Boutique, the Boys returned stylistically to their punk rock roots on Check Your Head, playing their own instruments for the first time on record since their early EPs (although they did provide live instrumentation on at least two songs on Paul's Boutique). Hence photographer Glen E. Friedman's idea to shoot photos with their instrument cases (one of which became the cover). The cover itself is a subtle depiction of the famous Three Wise Monkeys: "See No Evil," "Hear No Evil," and "Speak No Evil." (This theme is revisited in the lyrics of "Finger Lickin' Good.") The album was their first to be fully co-produced by Mario Caldato Jr. Caldato was an engineer on Paul's Boutique and was credited as producer on that album's track "Ask for Janice". The album also marks the first appearance of long time collaborator keyboardist Money Mark.

The Beastie Boys toured with the Rollins Band and Cypress Hill in the spring of 1992 to support Check Your Head.

Ill Communication 1994 (2009 Remaster)


Ill Communication is the fourth studio album by the Beastie Boys. It was released on May 24, 1994 via Grand Royal Records. It was remastered and made available on the Beastie Boys' Web site on July 7, 2009.

It was their second #1 album on the Billboard charts, due to their hit "Sabotage". "Sabotage" was accompanied by a music video (produced by Spike Jonze) that parodied 1970s cop shows. The album would also be their second triple platinum album.

Ill Communication was co-produced by Beastie Boys and Mario C. Featuring musical contributions from Money Mark, Eric Bobo and Amery "AWOL" Smith, vocal contributions from Q-Tip and Biz Markie.

Mike D and Adam Yauch collaborated with Gibran Evans of T.A.Z. to create the album packaging, and to choose the unique cover photo taken by Bruce Davidson. The hand-drawn typeface was created by designer Jim Evans specifically for Ill Communication, and was used throughout the promotion of the album.

This is the last Beastie Boys album to be released in jewel packaging. Future albums were all released in Digipaks.

Hello Nasty 1998 (2009 Remaster)



Hello Nasty is the fifth studio album by the Beastie Boys. It was released on July 14, 1998 via Capitol Records and sold 681,000 copies in its first week, debuting at #1 on the Billboard 200 album sales chart. The album took home two awards at the 1999 Grammys, in the categories of Best Alternative Music Album and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for "Intergalactic".

Hello Nasty was released on July 14, 1998â€”four years after the band's previous album, Ill Communicationâ€”and marked the addition of DMC champion Mix Master Mike to the group's line-up.[1] "Song for Junior" features Miho Hatori on vocals, and "Dr. Lee, PhD" guest stars dub musician Lee Scratch Perry on both vocals and percussion. Hello Nasty also marked Eric Bobo's last appearance as percussionist in the band, as well as the last time the Beastie Boys worked with a co-producer.

The title for the album was allegedly inspired by the receptionist of their NY based publicity firm Nasty Little Man who would answer the phone with the greeting "Hello Nasty".

Hello Nasty received mostly positive reviews upon release. Caroline Sullivan writing for The Guardian Review awarded the album "Pop CD Of The Week" claiming that it "fills a gap created by the current profusion of serious rock bands like Radiohead; elbowing its way up front, [and letting] rip with adolescent vigour."[7] She went on to summarize the record as "the perfect party soundtrack by the perfect party band."[7] Although Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine felt that the album's ending was "a little anticlimactic", he also saw Hello Nasty as a progressive step forward from the group's 1992 LP Check Your Head, and praised the input of the group's new recruit, Mixmaster Mike; "Hiring DJ Mixmaster Mike turned out to be a masterstroke; he and the Beasties created a sound that strongly recalls the spare electronic funk of the early '80s, but spiked with the samples and post-modern absurdist wit that have become their trademarks."[1] In his B+ rated review for Entertainment Weekly, David Browne highlighted the album's multi-genre sound, along with the group's use of a wide range of musical styles, as its most engaging aspect;[2]

"Hello Nasty is a sonic smorgasbord in which the Beasties gorge themselves with reckless abandon. They dabble in lounge-pop kitsch (the loser put-down Song for the Man), make like a summit of Santana and Traffic (the Latin-flavored "Song for Junior"), and subtly incorporate a drum-and-bass shuffle into the mix ("Flowin' Prose"). The melange makes for a looser, more free-spirited record than their earlier albums; the music invites you in, rather than threatening to shut you out."

To The 5 Boroughs 2004



To the 5 Boroughs is the sixth studio album by the Beastie Boys. The album was released on June 14, 2004 internationally, and a day later in the United States. The album debuted #1 on the Billboard 200 with 360,000 copies sold in its first week. To the 5 Boroughs was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 47th Grammy Awards,[11] losing to Kanye West's The College Dropout.

- Their single "Ch-Check It Out" debuted on The O.C. in "The Strip" from Season 1, airing on April 28, 2004.[13]

- This album has been released with the Copy Control protection system in some regions.

- The album was the cause of some controversy with allegations that it installed spyware when inserted into the CD-ROM of a computer.[14] The band has denied this allegation saying there is no copy protection software on the albums sold in the U.S. and in the U.K. While there is Macrovision's CDS-200 copy protection software installed on European copies of the album this is standard practice for all European releases on EMI/Capitol Records released in Europe and it does not install spyware or any form of permanent software.[15]

- The album is the first time the Beastie Boys did not work with a co-producer and the second album to feature Mix Master Mike.

- As the Beastie Boys were included in the game NBA Street V3, the track "An Open Letter to NYC" was included in its soundtrack.

- To the 5 Boroughs has two main themes â€” a tribute to their home town New York after the September 11 terrorist attacks (although, notably, the Twin Towers are on the cover drawing) and a criticism of George W. Bush's presidency.

- "An Open Letter to NYC" is built around a sample from the track "Sonic Reducer" by the punk band The Dead Boys from their 1977 album Young, Loud and Snotty.

The Mix-Up 2007



The Mix-Up is the seventh studio album by the Beastie Boys, released on June 26, 2007. It consists entirely of instrumental performances and won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Album.


On May 1, 2007, an e-mail sent to those on the Beastie Boys' mailing list revealed the album is all instrumental.

"OK, here's our blurb about our new album â€” it spits hot fire! â€” hot s***! it's official... it's named THE MIX-UP. g'wan. all instrumental record. "see i knew they were gonna do that!" that's a quote from you. check the track listing and cover below. you love us. don't you?"

On June 21, 2007, a legal stream of the entire album was released on BrooklynVegan.com.[2] Snippets of all the songs on the album can be found on BeastieBoys.Com along with the video for one of the songs, "Off the Grid". The video for "The Rat Cage" has also been released.

Drummer Mike D said that "even though The Mix-Up is a 'post-punk instrumental' album, the Beasties have no plans to ditch vocals for good. In fact, they are currently planning another version of the album that will feature collaborations with 'a pretty wide array' of 'mostly newer' vocalists."[3]

Two singers speculated to be featured on the vocal version were Jarvis Cocker and M.I.A.,[4] with Mark Ronson somehow also involved. The idea for this version of the album has since been abandoned.[citation needed]

In an interview with The Aquarian Weekly, published in February 2008, the band was asked if they were making a statement about the status of hip-hop music by releasing an album strictly of instrumentals. â€œIn a way, the album was a reaction to our hip hop," said Ad-Rock "Our last record was an all rap record, so when we started recording [The Mix Up] we wanted to work with some instruments, and it just sounded cool, so we kept with it.â€ [5]

Diamond expanded on Ad-Rock's response, adding, "â€œWe get asked, â€˜What do you think of the state of hip hop today?â€™ a lot. Maybe Iâ€™m being defensive, but it seems like people always look for us to come out and criticize hip hop. But hip hop is what we grew up on, and it continues to be one of the only forms of music left that strives on evolution and innovation. Yeah, we might be in a spell where weâ€™re waiting for that next record to come out and change everythingâ€”but still, thatâ€™s what hip hop is and thatâ€™s what puts it in its unique place.â€

The album debuted at number 15 on the U.S. Billboard 200, selling about 44,000 copies in its first week.[6] As of April 27, 2008, the album sold 258,000 copies worldwide. In Australia, the album debuted at number 42. In the UK, the album debuted at number 79. It is by far their lowest charting album in the UK so far, the highest being Hello Nasty, which debuted at number 1.[7]

According to BallerStatus.com, The Mix-Up was the highest selling "hip hop album" of that week. On September 15, the Beastie Boys sent a newsletter listing the last of the shows associated with The Mix-Up; within the newsletter it was joked The Mix-Up was a platinum record.

Uncut magazine gave it four stars out of five, saying "The Mix-Up is the best record collection ever thoroughly digested and re-imagined by a bunch of guys in love with sound."

The Mix-Up won a Grammy in the Best Pop Instrumental category

Hot Sauce Committee Part 2 2011


Hot Sauce Committee Part Two is the eighth studio album by the Beastie Boys, released in 2011.

The album was originally planned for release on September 15, 2009 under the title Hot Sauce Committee, Pt. 1, as the first installment of a two part set. The album was delayed after band member Adam "MCA" Yauch was diagnosed with cancer.[2] After a two year delay, only one album has been released and it is not clear if the plan for a two part album has been abandoned.

The album was previously known by the working title Tadlock's Glasses.,[3] which was stated to be a reference to a former bus driver named Tadlock, who used to drive for Elvis Presley's back-up singers. Presley once gave Tadlock a pair of glasses which he was proud of. It was later speculated that the Tadlock's Glasses story was simply a joke misinterpreted by the media.[4]

A large amount of material was recorded, and the plan was to release the album, now called Hot Sauce Committee, in two parts as the Beastie Boys revealed to Drowned in Sound.[5] Mike D also hinted that part two may be released via unusual means:

"Pt. 2 is pretty much done. Basically we were making ...Pt 1, had too many songs, so we recorded some more songs. Which sounds bizarre but it actually worked out, because it made it clear to us which songs were going to be on ...Pt 1. Then we had this whole other album of songs: ...Pt 2. ...Pt 1â€™s going to be your regular CD in the stores and to download, but ...Pt 2 is going to be released in...weâ€™re still figuring it out, but a different way. More of a 2009 style. ... You could get in the shower one day and, boom, all of a sudden youâ€™re showered with MP3s. Or we might send people a seven-inch every few weeks, so you have a whole box set."


The first part of the album was intended to be called Hot Sauce Committee, Pt. 1 and was prepared for release, with artwork revealed and a planned release date of September 15, 2009.[4] In an interview the Beastie Boys stated that the album was completed and group also announced that they would tour the United Kingdom in support of the new record.[3]
This was delayed after band member Adam "MCA" Yauch was diagnosed with cancer.[2] On July 20, 2009, Yauch issued a video press release via YouTube (and via e-mail to fans on mailing list) stating that a form of cancer was found in his salivary gland and that some or all upcoming shows are canceled, with the release date of Hot Sauce Committee delayed. He added that the cancer is localized, and that he should be fine after surgery.[6]

In October 2009, Adam Yauch announced that the band had not yet decided a new release date, but was quoted saying he was hoping to release it in the first half of 2010.

An email sent out on October 17, 2010, from the Beastie Boys announced: "Although we regret to inform you that Hot Sauce Committee Pt. 1 will continue to be delayed indefinitely, Hot Sauce Committee Pt. 2 will be released on time as originally planned in Spring of 2011." An email sent the following week now clarified that Pt. 2 would be released with almost exactly the same tracklist as was announced for Pt. 1, excluding the track "Bundt Cake."[8] No date is set for Part 1.[9]

Hot Sauce Committee, Pt. 1 was finally released in May 2011 under the title Hot Sauce Committee Part Two with a slightly altered track listing including a new version of "Too Many Rappers". The material intended for part two may now be released as Hot Sauce Committee, Pt. 1 at some point in the future.
