Thanks."
,Mr_Deltoid,2011-11-21T05:37Z,"Awesome file.  Thank you so much...although I can't convert a couple of the files; they are shown as ""invalid"" using my FLACK-to-MP3 converter; particularly Ill Communication, Disk 2, both remixes of ""Sure Shot"".  Any ideas as to why, or how I can fix it?"

,Pro21,2012-05-05T12:05Z,"Great torrent! Excellent quality! The FLAC's are ripped properly and sound superb! 

Sad news yesterday to hear about Adam Yauch's - (MCA) - passing. He will be greatly missed! A true pioneer. Beastie Boys - a legacy never to be forgotten.

Real music. Real hip-hop. Pure innovation. 

Thanks for all the memories Beastie Boys; r.i.p. MCA, you will be missed. "

And RIP MCA. You will be missed."
