The four seasons of Farscape converted by Airvideo and suitable for streaming to your smartphone, well Iphone is Airvideo is used but m4v can probably be streamed to other phones.

Source was DVD-rips.

Great show. Gonna see it again, but this time in bed with a phone on the belly.

Technology is going the right way.
