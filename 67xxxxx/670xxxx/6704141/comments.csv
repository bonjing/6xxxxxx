,whyfoxwhy,2011-09-27T06:09Z,"I missed the premiere on fox and I couldn't find it anywhere. How would I see this show when I wanted if it wasn't for torrents? Fox makes no money from this. Give viewers options online. We all don't have the same schedule and the ability to ""tune in"". Make content available online, on demand and let advertisers who want eyeballs pay, just like tv broadcasting. You can even charge the same amount. Let youtube streaming host the show and you reap the ad revenue. I'm pissed that I had to scoure the internet and get the show this way. "
