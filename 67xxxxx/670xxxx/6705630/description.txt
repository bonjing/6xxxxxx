uperCache breaks the disk I/O bottleneck by using the computerâ€™s RAM to hold or contain the most frequently used disk data. This â€˜containerâ€™ is referred to as a cache. With SuperCache, as a program sends and receives disk data, the most frequently used data is read from and written to RAM â€“ not the hard drive â€“ thus accelerating the programâ€™s performance. SuperCache implements our patented block-level cache technology to increase performance above that of the operating systemâ€™s file-level cache.
