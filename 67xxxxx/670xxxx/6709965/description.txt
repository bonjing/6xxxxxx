The X Factor winner's second studio album - out on August 22 - features 12 'classic covers', including renditions of 'I Dreamed A Dream' from Les MisÃ©rables and classical number 'Time To Say Goodbye'.

The LP follows his victory on this year's series of Popstar to Operastar, which saw him fight off competition from Cheryl Baker and Steps singer Clare Richards. 

McElderry previously described the record as a "snapshot" of where he is as an artist today, adding: "I am excited about the opportunity to record and perform some of this amazing repertoire."

The 20-year-old was dropped from Simon Cowell's Syco record label in April this year after disappointing sales of his debut album Wide Awake.
