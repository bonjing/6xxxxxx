,meskalin64,2011-10-05T14:36Z,How can this be 9gb when the other 720p is 2gb?
,jahnee,2011-10-05T20:25Z,"probably full hd 2gb are usually encoded, someone needs to split re-size and reupload"
,Rldm1012,2011-10-18T19:33Z,"This is the (two part) first episode, and the second episode?
plz someone answer"
,quadrafunk,2011-10-18T22:05Z,"there is no episode 2, because e01 is a double. 2hours long."
