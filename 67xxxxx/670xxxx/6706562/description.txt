Fiona Wallice, is a therapist who has conceived of a new form of therapy: the titular "web therapy." In her estimation, the traditional "50 minute hour" version of therapy gives people too much leeway to talk about irrelevant things. By dramatically shortening session time, she hopes to get results more quickly. Her sessions take place via webcam over the internet using Apple Inc.'s iChat. They are taped in the hope of attracting investors into promoting her new technique as a worldwide therapy option.
