 Album Info..: 
 
 By their third album, Confederate Railroad had established their fusion of Lynyrd 
 Skynyrd and Alabama and knew what worked and what didn't. In other words, When and Where offers nothing new from the band, but it is far from a bad record. The group has gotten predictable, but they continue to shine, whether it's on the rowdy rockers or the surprisingly smooth, radio-ready ballads. They do have a problem coming up with a batch of consistent material, but the album is as enjoyable as its predecessor and nearly as solid. -- Thom Owens
