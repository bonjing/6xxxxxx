Jimmy Dawkins' infrequent albums are always a joy, and that was the case when he made his first sojourn to Europe in 1970 and recorded LPs for Black & Blue, Vogue, and Excello in France and England. This disc features eight numbers pairing Dawkins and the great Gatemouth Brown and another four matching him with equally sensational Otis Rush. The Brown/Dawkins tandem duel, match, and challenge each other as Dawkins' sometimes enigmatic, sometimes bemused and often compelling vocals set the stage for their instrumental encounters. The same holds true on the Rush/Dawkins cuts. While Rush provides searing licks and twisting solos, Dawkins' singing sets the tone with its urgent inflections and weary, resigned quality. ~ Ron Wynn.
