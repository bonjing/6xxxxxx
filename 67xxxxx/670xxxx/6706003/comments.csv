,capnjazz,2011-09-28T22:03Z,"Nope, doesn't work on Lion - installer says it's for an earlier version of OS X and bombs out."
[T],joskewarez,2011-09-29T00:47Z,"Okay, so it's usable on Leopard, Snow Leopard and probably Tiger ;)"
,nemosrings,2011-09-30T12:04Z,"I doubt this torrent is the most recent MPeg2 codec. And No doubt needs Rosetta support which Lion does not have and never will. Rosetta needs to be installed on your system via the OSX installation disk, it's an option not a default installation. Rosetta allows pc based applications to run in OSX on intel machines. You'd also need to reboot computer after installing this no doubt. I haven't tried this one yet. But there are other MPeg 2 torrents on PB such as this one http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3951087/QuickTimeMPEG2.dmg which works on my 2008 intel macpro. However I do not boot into 64 bit."
,nemosrings,2011-09-30T17:19Z,Works fine for me on my 2008 intel macpro with snow leopard. No need to reboot computer which was a surprise.
