,Jessejames05,2011-09-28T19:32Z,Thanks for all the great Movies you have uploaded. The quality is SUPERB. Can I just ask one question and maybe someone else can answer it.....what application/software do you use to rip these Movies? I have tried various applications like CloneDVD Mobile and Magic DVD Ripper and Daniusoft Video Converter Ultimate.....all have given me the quality of picture and the smaller size that you achieve ....mine tend to be grainy and slightly pixelated. Obviously I'm not using the application you are using.....so can you help me.....please?
