thx

Encode:
another good movie which needed a total makeover.
Video suffered from darkness and lack of any colours, also audio was very bad to hear,
noise, hiss, hum everything which makes it total hard to watch and hear. Firstly this
korsubs movie have that 2 line subs, blurring is not possible looks bad and cropping
is ok in this case since its nearly fullscreen. Since i couldnt decide to crop or not,
i have done both versions, for you to decide what you like more. Check the pics, check
the sample, and decide which version you want to have, both version will be available
simultaneously.

I fixed the aspect the resolution, filtered the colours added brightness,contrast,sharpness,
denoise tried to remove some of the interlace that was still in there. totally cleaned up
the audiotrack, behind all that noise in the audio is a good audio track just needed tweak
here and there. its now totally watchable and you can see and hear the movie. enjoy

Video: 720x304 @bitrate 1400 2pass
Audio: English AC3 2.0 Stereo
Sample: yes, included[/b]
