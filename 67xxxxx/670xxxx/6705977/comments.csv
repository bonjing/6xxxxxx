,emjimadhu,2011-10-13T08:37Z,"@all: I have a solution for Subtitle Sync prob... In VLC Media player Go to Tools->Track Synchronization. In that pop-up box u can c an option called ""Advance of Subtitle over Video"" add ""+15"" in that text box... thats all... now everything will works fine... 

""+15"" indicates the seconds... In the beginning the FBI waring and Anamorphic video details were encoded in the movie... so those frames took 15 seconds... Thats y the subtitle is 15 seconds ahead of the video... now its cleared... Enjoy the movie..."
