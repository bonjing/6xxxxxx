â€œI like this crew.Tarantism actually do what it says on the can.Theyâ€™ve the cheek to try and the ability to pull off a true blur of styles, that not only creates new blends but at the same time lets diverse influences feed each other for the better.....by heaven its got chops and more face than the town hall clock!Tarantism get inside the tunes and beef then up in a healthy way, no additives loads of common sense....so if like me youâ€™ve endured a wet afternoon at a festival or ten, when youâ€™ve just longed for band with fizz and character to bring out the sunshine then Tarantism might just be the solutionâ€
