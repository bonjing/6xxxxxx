,sneno,2011-09-27T19:19Z,"Excellent job! I managed to install it in other times:)

I have a Gigabyte P43-ES3G motherboard with an Intel Core 2 Duo E6500 2.93 GHz. Use a graphics card Sapphire Toxic HD 6850th
Everything works great, except that we do not show ATA HDD.

postavio sam u biosu:
1. CPU HOST CLOCK CONTROL (disabled)
2. SATA AHCI MODE (ACHI)

Za instalaciju sam uzeo opcije:
CHIMERA v 1.5.4
Graphics neabler (yes)
32-bit
/extra/extensions
Fake SMC
Disabler
RTC 32-bit
11.1.0 atom kernel
ACH SATA intel
HDA Enabler

Naknadno sam skinuo s kexts.com nivi RTL 81xx kext.

Later I removed the kexts.com Nivi RTL 81xx kext.

,jm1994,2011-09-27T21:46Z,"Thats Good Work Sneno , i installed with a simple install the only thing i changed was the Bootloader to Chimera, disabled Graphics Enabler, and check ATI_ayi which works perfectly for my Radeon HD 6450 Graphics card !"
,olofl,2011-09-27T23:54Z,how to burn on a dvd ? from windows 7 :s
,nirmal_niks7,2011-09-28T00:31Z,"@olofl
use transmac."
,jm1994,2011-09-28T04:29Z,@Sneno I meant ATI_init 
,dionnode,2011-09-28T08:17Z,"It doesn't work for me. I would like to say; when I burn it on Snow Leopard, I have a message that  verify is failed. I've tried the same file on iAtkos's site to download, I have the same trouble that it failed on burn verify. "
,G-skill,2011-09-28T15:58Z,dun try with AMD i try with my crosshair IV formula  x6 1100t booting after it reboot 
,jm1994,2011-09-28T21:35Z,"@dionnode If you have access to Windows , Download and use a program called Transmac and burn it using that program, its what i used and it burned to my dvd perfectly within minutes !"
,Jack0ff,2011-09-29T09:26Z,amd users (like me) would be wasting time trying to install this. amd users NEED a legacy kernel for lion and as of now one does not exist. this distro just took nawcoms kernel and packaged it...hopefully he can make an amd kernel too :) blog.nawcom.com
,dionnode,2011-09-29T21:48Z,"@jm1994; 
I give up this iAtkos. Much trouble and as a newbie, I need something easier than this. Thank you for your contribution."
,Phuque2,2011-09-30T22:43Z,shite. doesn't work!
,poon!!,2011-10-02T22:47Z,"It worked very well for me to install. 
The Hardware are the following, 
Motherboard: Gigabyte EP-45DS4, BIOS F10b
CPU: Intel Core 2 Quad Q9450 
Memory: 4 x 2048 Corsair CM2X2048-6400C5DHX 
Graphic: XFX Nvidia Geforce GTX 285 
Network: Realtek RTL8111C 
Audio: Realtek ALC889A 
Harddiska and DVD all SATA. 
Only problem I still have is with the sleep function, it's not working to put to sleep with the ACPI S3 function. 
Otherwise this was the easiest installation so far. "

,manojkrazad,2011-10-19T23:22Z,can anyone please elaborate how can i use this .dmg file to install over my intel based comp... i am having windows 7 right now...
,DeepKisser,2011-10-20T07:20Z,"Thanks +1 @jm1994
i used ultra ISO to convert  it to ISO
and installed it on my pc but when i boot it hangs 
at boot0: done. plz help !"
,OmgItsSmart,2011-10-20T08:23Z,"No, this doesn't support AMD. And besides, if you have an AMD processor, you shouldn't be trying to set up a Hackintosh anyways. Getting full hardware compatibility with an AMD processor is almost impossible."
,DeepKisser,2011-10-20T10:39Z,@manojkrazad use ultra ISO > Tools > convert > select Downloaded dmg file and select output format to Standard ISO click convert Burn it using IMGburn ( http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6738302/EZB.Systems.UltraISO.Premium.Edition.v9.5.0.2800.Multilingual.Re && http://www.imgburn.com/index.php?act=download ) hope this will help !
,qvejt,2011-10-20T15:30Z,"1) You need a computer with MacOS or MacOS zinatalowanym In the VIRTUAL MACHINE
 2) The disk format tools minimun 8Gb USB stick on a GPT table.
 3) Then Play Itakos L1.dmg image on a USB pendrive.
 4) Run Chameleon and install on a USB stick with the first option from the top - start of the Boot.
 5) Set your Pc in the BIOS to boot from USB - NEW SYSTEM installation takes 10 minutes - a real pleasure."

,jm1994,2011-10-25T01:06Z,"This is a DMG File, which CAN BE BURNED ON WINDOWS !

IMPORTANT : In order to burn a DMG on windows without the hassle of converting it to an iso, download a tool called ""Transmac"". GOOGLE IT.
You can use that tool to burn DMG files to a DVD. 
iATKOS Doesnt support AMD Processors for NOW, in the near future there will be hackintosh for AMD Processors, Project Voltr0n."
,Kaqanikudc,2011-10-25T23:33Z,"yes it work directly from DVD, thank very useful man...!"
