,rgmontejo,2011-09-27T07:03Z,I guess there's something wrong with all Star Wars torrents coz whenever I start downloading them transmission and vuze stops working.
,Tatletz,2011-10-05T09:09Z,Thank you murdock47!
,CosmAvngr,2011-10-06T20:07Z,"I usually avoid 1080p because I have a low BW cap at my ISP, but I didn't see what looked to be any good ~2GB 720p versions.

I am not disappointed with the larger BW needed for this. 

It is a superb encode. I was watching it 3 feet from my 40"" TV and it looks perfect. Excellent surround sound as well.

Video quality is awesome.

Does anyone else have a problem with AC3 /6 channel sound or is it just me!

,rooney102,2011-10-12T12:06Z,Anyone know how to play this on a 360 ? I don't mind watching it on my laptop but I would also like to watch it on my LCD.
,CosmAvngr,2011-10-24T00:11Z,"@Bogus.

No problem here with sound.

It plays perfect on my PC connected optically to a Denon receiver with VLC, MPC-HC as Dolby Digital passthrough.  Window Media Player, plays it perfectly as well, but it demuxes to stereo first. "
