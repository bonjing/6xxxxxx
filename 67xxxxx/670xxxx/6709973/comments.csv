,spifkitten99,2011-10-10T23:54Z,Audio is out of sync. There is no excuse for that.
,wayneking,2011-10-13T01:14Z,"A 4   V 4 - for a cam
M 6 imo.

Watchable on a small monitor, but don't bother trying on a 32inch + TV, it's a pretty poor quality cam.

Thanks for the UL though, I really appreciated it and even managed to enjoy the film on my laptop with earphones during a journey.
