,flame2410,2011-09-28T12:33Z,@BlackMoth  Fake?  Really?  If that's what you wanna think.  I got it from their website until the site that was hosting the download removed it.

Can I use this to update from the Reloaded release (v1.00)?"
,brianxxx,2011-09-28T18:01Z,"Just for the sake of information and not to flame or anything - 
The official 3rd patch was withdrawn by Sony a while ago. The only real patch is the 2nd. A 3rd patch is coming. The PS3 just got it's 2nd patch last week for Europe and last night for US.

There is no release of any 3rd patch for the PC as of today for any country being officially released.

So, using an unofficial 3rd patch now might screw you later down the road when the next official patch is released. Might break the game, make it unable to update, etc. It sucks but you will just have to wait patiently if you are having problems. Right now, I have dealt with glitches but nothing major. Will buy the game as soon as they release a solid, effective bug fixing patch."
,flame2410,2011-09-28T19:12Z,@brianxxx  Alright thanks dude.  I have the second SkidRow patch for the game so I'll take this down and upload that sometime later today.
,Insomneac,2012-01-17T08:04Z,"Stop uploading fake shit.

The ""Skidrow"" website you get this crap from has nothing to do with Skidrow.

Fucking Internet idiots, is it so hard to understand?"
