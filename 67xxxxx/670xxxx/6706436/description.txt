Since this was removed from the sight I got it from, I thought I'd share it on here.  


Instructions:

Extract the .rar file using WinRAR or 7zip into your Dead Island Directory.
Replace all of the files that were originally there.


*WARNING*   This update will most likely delete your save file.  I apologize but I am unsure of how to prevent this from happening.  Try Googling it? :|
