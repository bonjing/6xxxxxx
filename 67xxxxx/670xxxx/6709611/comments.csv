,Whobuysgames,2011-09-29T22:58Z,Riot Games has their own P2P launcher. use that
,Jaydeath69,2011-09-30T03:53Z,Only problem with Riot Games P2P launcher is that you have to patch up the v1.43.11 for about 1-2hrs after you download it. So this is quicker when more download and seed
,Jaydeath69,2011-09-30T03:55Z,"And also with this download it is the straight program file, so you can just copy and go instantly"

I have a problem launching the lol.launcher.exe

""the application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem""

How do I change the application configuration to fix this problem ? 

Thanks in advance."
