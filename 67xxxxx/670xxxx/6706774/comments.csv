Why the hell convert MP3 to FLAC?
WASTE OF BANDWIDTH!"
[T],kimeesteres,2011-09-29T03:07Z,"I converted and uploaded this because people had requested it.

Audio properties for all tracks:
Bit rate 1,411 kbps
Encoder FLAC reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917
Audio Quality - Perfect (Lossless)
Type - flac File [.flac]"
,sapo_joe,2011-10-02T09:42Z,"Well, there's no gain in converting mp3s to FLAC... 
It's better to keep the music in mp3, the quality, in this case, will be all the same.

I mean no offense, just wanna keep everybody informed. =)"
,omnimodis,2011-10-04T04:40Z,"@ kimeesteres - sapo_joe is 100% correct!  You basically made small files larger by going from lossy to lossless AFTER the compression has already beed done to the original files.  True FLAC is only worth it when it's used to encode uncompressed files, otherwise you're just putting compressed files into a lossless container, hence cloning the compressed quality into a lossless format.  Makes zero sense!"
[T],kimeesteres,2011-10-05T15:54Z,"Hey, guys, I'm not a computer technician. I used a standard .mp3 to .flac conversion program, and this is the result I got. 
I want to have happy downloaders, so if this doesn't sound good, tell me, and I will replace it with another .flac conversion upload. Any conversion program suggestions?
It may make ""zero sense,"" but I received requests for a .flac version of ETIAW from a number of PirateBay users..."
,Kole97,2011-10-15T09:43Z,"Whateva you did was Great ....& i'd like to say Guys stop being so mean to Him !!
thanks Kimeesteres"
,deadsloth,2011-11-15T06:06Z,"Hopefully not too late with this but omnimodis is right.  it doesn't make sense to convert mp3 to FLAC.  its like taking a divx DVDrip thats 700mb and increasing the resolution to 1080p and have the end file to be like 2GB.  the image would look horrible.  same thing with mp3 to flac. the only real 'converting to FLAC' is either from the original source, CD/vinyl/DVD, or from another lossless format such as WAV, ALAC, or APE.  cheers, thanks however for the effort."
[T],kimeesteres,2011-12-11T08:31Z,"Thank you for the suggestions, deadsloth. I'll check into omnimodis the next time around.

This is all a learning process for me!"
,MixedUpZombie,2012-04-04T22:25Z,Please don't lie to us and convert lossy mp3s to FLAC. It's not the same as real FLAC.
