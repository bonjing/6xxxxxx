Title: Essential Plant Pathology, Second Edition

Authors: Gail L. Schumann & Cleora J. D Arcy 


The new second edition text comes packaged with a dynamic DVD that works hand-in-hand with the popular APSnet Education Center and provides students and their professors with an engaging way to learn and teach plant pathology. This DVD contains many important supplementary materials that can be used without internet access, including: expanded and revised identification exercises, new APSnet Education Center peer-reviewed instructional materials, and new web links for each chapter.


The DVD is a key part of the book because it includes links to all of the enrichment materials from the APSnet Education Center, APSnet feature articles, and links to recommended websites. These are used for the exercises at the end of each chapter. This allows students to learn about diseases and topics of specific interest to them. Also, there are identification exercises for most of the chapters on the DVD. The DVD also includes the illustrated glossary with photos, diagrams and many of the definitions which are not included in the printed version in the book. For instructors, there are high resolution versions of all of the text images.
