,sabreclaw,2011-09-26T19:26Z,Does this work with the Shitrow release?
,SteXDudE,2011-09-26T19:34Z,"thx,again"

,Halbermunken,2011-09-26T20:36Z,Still runs like crap on hd6850
,RE661B,2011-09-26T20:47Z,"It probably didn't install for you guys, If you notice, the install directory is spelled wrong, ""Dues Ex"". Hence it installs in a wrong dir, not finding your games files to update. Correct the dir spelling, C:\Program Files (x86)\SQUARE ENIX\Deus Ex Human Revolution , or C:\Program Files\SQUARE ENIX\Deus Ex Human Revolution."
,MiniZaggy,2011-09-26T23:35Z,"It works but my savegame are not there, maybe its because its skidrow, illc heck where the skidrow save are stored and copy my fies there"
,MiniZaggy,2011-09-26T23:44Z,SO 2 things. Installed in the the rught directory because theres a mistake in the default install path. Also the savegames files are in Username/appdata/local/skidrow/  .. SO if you got shitrow version you copy your save there (from my documents/ALI213)
,zapout,2011-09-26T23:57Z,"patch is working but, my save files are not available in the game. 
i've got the koas version, where should i copy my ""save game"" files to make them work with the game?"
,Psythik,2011-09-27T00:05Z,Patch 1.2.630 removed the annoying intro screens.  This patch brings them back.  Please fix this!
,Psythik,2011-09-27T00:06Z,"Also, my save games are now gone.  Thanks for breaking the game with this, assholes!"
,Psythik,2011-09-27T00:09Z,"Thanks Zaggy, I got my saves back, but my points still stand."
,MiniZaggy,2011-09-27T01:01Z,"You can pass the logo screens by clicking,"
,elessarGObonzo,2011-09-27T04:35Z,so what exactly is the patch fixing?
,ts174ab4,2011-09-27T08:08Z,"HELP! Anyone know why the game stopped working when I double click the shortcut? Even I install 1.2633 update, I still cannot play the game."
[T],musy2,2011-09-27T09:22Z,hey i cant upload files on piratebay for last three to four days...can any one help me?
[V],.Dude.,2011-09-27T13:43Z,wat error u getting?
,vincentdesrd,2011-09-28T04:10Z,Psythik: How did you get your save games back???
,ts174ab4,2011-09-28T06:20Z,"It just show ""Deus Ex Human Revolution has stopped working"" and then close..."
,CR33PY33,2011-09-28T07:55Z,Thanks. Patch works great with SKIDROW release. For some reason this was the only update/crack that didn't crash at startup.
,zapout,2011-09-28T10:16Z,"if your save games are gone do this--
copy the content(a folder name-28050) of the folder ""ALI213"" from your documents and paste it to ""Username/appdata/local/skidrow''"
,vader619,2011-09-28T16:00Z,Does this work with the SHiTROW version?
,SonicSP,2011-09-28T17:19Z,"I tried looking for the directory of the new saves as mentioned by the two users previously but I still cannot find it. I believe my username is Owner and I cannot find it under there; or a directory called Username, just in case.

Can somebody give me an example of a file name of the new save in the new folder? I already created a new save and I was thinking of just using the search function to find the directory rather than looking for it one by one."
,zapout,2011-09-28T18:39Z,"^^""SonicSP""
go to ur documents,there will be a folder ""ALI213""

open it and copy the folder ""28050"" from it.
now you need to enable the option ""show hidden files/folders.
after that go to --C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Local\SKIDROW
and paste the folder from ""ALI213"" there."
,pnorberto3,2011-09-29T01:31Z,Thank You :)
,Valcugen,2011-09-29T15:02Z,Thanks for posting ! :)

,TheHole81,2011-10-02T13:52Z,"I'm having problem with saves. Have copied my savegames from the old folder to the new. Saves start just fine, but I can't make a new save in the game??!!"
,spckifuhgn,2011-10-05T01:13Z,"so is this the latest update available?
can i install a fresh copy of the game and just apply this patch/crack or do i need the v1crack installed first?
glad to see skidrow back showing the boors like ali213,darkside,soniyu how to release games"
,derederk,2011-10-05T01:25Z,"Does anyone know how to get this patch to work on Vista 32?  The last patch required a different steam_api.dll, and I can't find one for this."
,derederk,2011-10-05T01:26Z,"spckifuhgn, this works on a fresh install.  You don't need the first patch."
,head.hunter,2011-10-05T09:13Z,"no matter how many times i copy the ""28050"" folder (which is actually empty) i never get my saved games back after pasting the crack from this torrent. shouldn't  this file ""28050"" contain the saved games??? bcoz i have about 7! and also i found the real saved games to be in this folder ""C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\ALI213\SAVES\1"" this is were the actual save file are found. so how should i update this game without losing my saves??? thnx in advance!"
,head.hunter,2011-10-05T09:15Z,"Also the reason for me to update is bcoz after finish the mission where i kill the 1st boss (Berrette) in the abandoned factory, i get in the plane and the boom im suddenly in the main menu... but i cant update bcz i lose my save d games =("
,revengeyo,2011-10-07T03:53Z,"Does this work with the SHiTROW version?

,foreveralone,2011-10-19T11:16Z,"Getting weird screen flicker in some areas screen will go white with some blocks of yellow in it in certain areas, weird, does the missing link download by skidrow update this to 1.3.6?"
,foreveralone,2011-10-19T11:20Z,"You can probably disregard my last comment, either retarting the game or running it as admin fixed my issue, also to thos having issues with save you have to copy the folder  from the AL123 folder in you documents to the skidrow one in app data."
,foreveralone,2011-10-19T12:55Z,any ETA on 1.3?
,Flanker-B,2011-10-20T19:51Z,"is this update cumulative, or i need to install the previous update first."
,hentai66666666,2011-10-23T13:13Z,what about the latest update? any news

,Ulayo,2011-11-03T00:00Z,"Does anyone have an ETA on the latest patch?
I'm hoping it will come out soon. This game is really unstable and I'm hoping the patch fixes this."

,Persason,2011-11-12T20:34Z,"WARNING!

Do not download this unless you have the skidrow release, it will mess up your save games and make it difficult to get them back. If you already used this patch and cant find your savegame dont worry uninstall the game and reinstall it with the release you used in the first place.

Then download this patch http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6685810/Deus_Ex_Human_Revolution_Update_1.2.630-P2P
This is a drag and drop and not an installer so it will not mess up your save."
,lixir341,2011-11-15T12:46Z,@londelen same error have fixed yours yet? i really wanna play this game haha
,Zulwarn,2011-12-20T11:41Z,"I need the patch 1.2.643
one that's the latest one which gets rid a lot of stutters. "
,Palpatin3,2012-02-13T15:18Z,"I was able to fix the stutter by enabling DX11. Seem to be a dx9 issue. Anyway, patch 643 will never be released."
,thsnfs,2012-03-06T10:59Z,"Deus ex was working before i downloaded this update, then this update broke it.

not sure if it's worth it to fuck with this patch but i'll try again."
,thsnfs,2012-03-06T11:14Z,"back again, i redid the crack from the original iso over this update. it's working again.

just going to leave it. if it crashes it crashes. fuck it."
,VexxD,2012-03-12T16:36Z,This just made the game slower for me :/
,RicePirate,2012-04-16T04:21Z,I love you man... works like a charm.
