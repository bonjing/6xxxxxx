Contains main feature plus interviews and vignettes.

Runtime: Main feature: 1:26:25

This is the same video as http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4518386/Control_Room_%282004%29_%5BAVC_H.264%5D

but just in MKV container. Now you don't have problems with K-LITE Codec Pack (and others) to choose between 2 audio tracks (film and commentary).

Good video for people which hang's on BBC/CNN or other mass PR technologies.
