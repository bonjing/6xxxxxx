,inuyasha5891,2011-09-27T16:43Z,"Can we get an installation review of the download, by those who have successfully downloaded and installed the game? Is it working? What language is it in as well as Commentary Language?"
,shomy183,2011-09-27T18:58Z,"It's in English, but the commentary files seem to be messed up! For example, instead of introducing the game (""Welcome everyone..."") it says something else, like ""... and it's a yellow card""..."
,uber09,2011-09-27T18:58Z,"installation fails after extracting from data.tptb

precomp.exe crashes and ending its process in task manager starts install again but game says not installed properly :("
,inuyasha5891,2011-09-27T19:55Z,"wow! I'm so glad I asked. I'm currently playing the German. The game works perfectly well, but the commentary is restricted to French and German only. I was hoping this would have been a step up. I have in the past relied on TPTB releases and had no issues, but this is disappointing to learn. I'm almost done with my download, and when I install I keep yous posted on how it goes."
,shomy183,2011-09-27T20:58Z,Maybe Shroo and TPTB could fix the commentary files and make another torrent.
