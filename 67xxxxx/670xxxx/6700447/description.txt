A loud sinister voice coming from above keeps saying that Judgment Day is near.
All people in pre-war Italy have an extra worry to live with, whether rich or poor, scoundrel or honest, old or young. The hour of Judgment finally comes and everyone has to account for their actions personally, in public, all around the world. Isnâ€™t that enough to change everybodyâ€™s behavior towards others?
