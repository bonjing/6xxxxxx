By and large, heavy metal fans certainly have long memories. And if you are a band that established themselves in a metal way, by veering a bit too much off the metallic highway, your career may never recover. But Machine Head seem to be a band that managed to successfully recover from an ill-advised rap metal detour, and have subsequently sworn their allegiance back to headbanging fare, as evidenced by such releases as 2011s Unto the Locust. The first thing you will discover about the groups seventh full-length studio effort overall is that it is comprised of only seven tracks. However, time-wise, it all adds up, as the majority of the tunes stretch past either the six-minute or seven-minute mark. And something else the listener will discover quickly after sampling a few tunes on Unto the Locust is that Robb Flynn and company have hit upon a formula that they follow throughout - start off mellow, then bludgeon the listener with full-on metal fury.
