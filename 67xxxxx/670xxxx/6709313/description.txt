Story / Review /Plot:

Cricket and Cinema evokes passion and sentiments among Indians.. And if a movie is made on cricket laced with comedy, it would end up entertaining the masses. 'Potta Potti' is exactly one that combines all to leave a magic on the masses.Lagaan, Iqbal, Chennai 28 makes the point clear. â€˜Cricket is part of the central plot in Potta Potti.


The movie is set in a village in Theni where the place is controlled by two-Kodaivannan (R Sivam) and his cousin Kollaivannan (Umar). The former is an innocent but an idiotic youth. The latter is selfish and is loaded with ulterior motives. They fight to hold the hands of their uncle's daughter Parijatham (Harini).

The village panchayat decides that both should play cricket and the winner would get Parijatham. Now begins the drama between both, who know nothing about the game. Coming to know that Ramesh (Sadgoppan Ramesh), a cricketer, is in town, one of the competitors kidnaps him and forces him to be the coach.

But the twist in the tale is Ramesh and Parijatham fall in love. Finally the match is played. Who emerges the winner and who married Parijatham forms the climax.


Ramesh amazes with his performance.Sivam and Avatar are wonderful duo. Their roles are well-written. Harini is pleasant and bubbly. She impresses. The rest of the cast too fits the bill. 

The music could have been marginally better, though it does not have much of a part in the film. It is the dialogues section, by Yuvaraj, that needs special mention

verdict : Fun with supershot and Missed catches
