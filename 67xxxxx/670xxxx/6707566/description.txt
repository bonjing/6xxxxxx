The latest EM techniques for detecting concealed targets, whether explosives, weapons, or people

Extensively illustrated from basic principles to system design, the fundamental concepts of RF, microwave, millimeter wave, and terahertz detection systems and techniques to find concealed targets are explained in this publication. These concealed targets may be explosive devices or weapons, which can be buried in the ground, concealed in building structures, hidden under clothing, or inside luggage. Concealed targets may also be people who are stowaways or victims of an avalanche or earthquake.

Although much information is available in conference proceedings and professional society publications, this book brings all the relevant information in a single, expertly written and organized volume.

Readers gain an understanding of the physics underlying electromagnetic (EM) detection methods, as well as the factors that affect the performance of EM detection equipment, helping them choose the right type of equipment and techniques to meet the demands of particular tasks. Among the topics covered are:

    *

      Ultra-wideband radar and ground-penetrating radar
    *

      Millimeter, sub-millimeter, and terahertz systems
    *

      Radar systems including Doppler, harmonic, impulse, FMCW, and holographic
    *

      Radiometric systems
    *

      Nuclear quadrupole resonance systems

Author David Daniels has many years of experience designing and deploying EM systems to detect concealed targets. As a result, this publication is essential for scientists and engineers who are developing or using EM equipment and techniques for a diverse range of purposes, including homeland security, crime prevention, or the detection of persons.
