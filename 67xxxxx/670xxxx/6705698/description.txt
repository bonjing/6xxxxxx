*********************************************************************************  
This practical book from a highly experienced author presents clearly the means and methods for designing, producing and using high-strength concrete.

High-strength concrete offers many benefits. Higher compressive strengths allow for a reduction in the cross-sectional dimensions of columns and walls in buildings. Its greater stiffness allows for increasing building heights while controlling sway and occupant comfort. Civil structures such as bridges have benefited from greater span lengths, shallower beam sections, wider girder spacing, and extended service life.

Illustrated with real life examples, through documented case histories, High-Strength Concrete will be a valuable resource for contractors, producers, inspection agencies, as well as engineers and researchers.
