,hughes1121930,2011-09-26T16:30Z,damn nice upload kinda nervous about downloading it...does anyone know if this is legit
,hughes1121930,2011-09-26T16:34Z,why did u post this twice
,coolrog1,2011-09-26T17:27Z,not to be ungrateful but couldn't you have broken this down into about six torrents of more reasonable size. torrents this big are hard to maintain seeders.
,Mutiny0,2011-09-27T11:14Z,"i uploaded it twice cause the first time i didn't click on ""start seeding"" option so i wasnt seeding it, and if you dont like the size just pick and choose videos to download, you dont have to download every video."
,hughes1121930,2011-09-27T15:23Z,great post mutiny please seed everyone
,hughes1121930,2011-09-27T15:23Z,thanx for the reply
,hughes1121930,2011-09-27T16:00Z,nobody is seeding 
,coolrog1,2011-09-27T16:21Z,it's not about liking the size it's about functionality. I know you can pick the ones you want the problem is seeding a torrent this large. 24hrs and i have uploaded a gig and have only been able to download about 120 mb and i have optimum dsl. there is also the hit and run factor. i stay and seed on average of 5 to 1 but most people just hit and run leavng no seeders in a short while unless the torrent is a more reasonable size so the ratio of seeders to leechers is balanced more easily. please understand i do appreciate the upload its just that i wanted to see it sometime this month.
,Mutiny0,2011-09-27T20:58Z,if you want to see it this month then spend the money on a membership like i do if your going to be cheap and download it for free here dont complain.
,hughes1121930,2011-09-27T22:47Z,fuck yea tell em mutiny
,coolrog1,2011-09-28T00:13Z,go fuck yourself hughes. you have a seeding complaint on here too so you don't have any room to talk. i only advised the uploader that this is not the best way to post a torrent. 
,coolrog1,2011-09-28T00:18Z,GO FUCK YOURSELF HUGHES YOU HAVE A SEEDING COMPLAINT HERE AS WELL SO YOU HAVE NO ROOM TO TALK.
,hughes1121930,2011-09-28T00:20Z,apologies coolrog i will seed for u as long as it takes
,coolrog1,2011-09-28T14:35Z,thank you and i apologise as well. i was just trying to point out to mutiny the problems with posting a torrent this size. after 3 days the seeder to leecher is 3 to 205. whats that a 80 to 1 ratio. the torrents not being seeded because no one can get anything downloaded with that kind of ratio. not to brag but i have brought torrents back from the dead and uploaded a 100 gigs or more. if it's still on my hd i keep seeding it unless its doing exremely well and no longer needs help. mutiny thank you very much for posting this torrent and i look forward to seeing the videos someday. maybe it will be my christmas present.
