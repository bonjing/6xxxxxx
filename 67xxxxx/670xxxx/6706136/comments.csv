The old BitComet crap that you are using has been obsolete for many years now."

,Morph167,2011-10-06T07:48Z,"Great upload, but it doesn't seem to work with my stock ps3 (doesn't detect the file?). Any ideas?"
,joej191,2011-10-06T08:25Z,Try puttin it on a iPod ( USB ) then plug it up if not that then try a media server.
,Morph167,2011-10-06T09:07Z,"hey joej191 thanks for the quick reply. Turns out I was an idiot and stuck the movie on a NTFS external HDD which the ps3 can't read. Only thing is around the 1h 17 min the video stutters for about 10 secs. Either than that, great quality!"
,aspiratr7,2011-10-18T04:33Z,Elexent! Great quality and a really small size 10/10 I'm using windows media player on windows 7 and I have no problems
