Your Quest For God (PDF)

The Bible informs us that God has set eternity in the hearts of men. It follows, therefore, that since men were made for eternity the things of time can never fully and permanently satisfy. There is an endless emptiness which only God can fill. St. Augustine stated it perfectly when he declared, â€œO God, Thou hast made us for Thyself, and our souls are restless till they rest in Thee.â€ Your Quest for God helps us to follow that quest until we find rest in a living and personal relationship with the Eternal God.

Food For Faith (PDF)

Just as a person could be fascinated with recipes in a cookbook and yet die of starvation, so one can be fascinated with biblical â€˜recipesâ€™ for successful living and still remain spiritually malnourished! Food for Faith is a biblical manual written to help you digest the Word of God from your hand - to your head - to your heart.
