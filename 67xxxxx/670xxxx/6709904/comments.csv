,Piranter,2011-09-29T17:31Z,"this is normal, for such a game. And the dl-speed is normal too, because it's a fresh torrent with no seeds :) so be patient. My dl-speed is about 0 kb/s at the moment xD"

,Simon5000,2011-09-30T15:38Z,This is completely real. Google FIFA 12 Mac and you'll see that EA hired a company to port the game for Mac.

I'm at 53% and i am sure that this is legit. "
,MaaxSmallhead95,2011-10-01T14:28Z,I downloaded this torrent two times already because it freezes at 53 percent .. Does anyone solve the problem yet?
,gangsta0555,2011-10-01T14:46Z,it doesn't freeze at 53% u just have to keep going for a bit longer.
,gangsta0555,2011-10-01T14:57Z,"One way to solve the problem is to somehow convert the 'Fifa 12 reloaded' torrent for pc into a mac file because it has more seeds,etc."
,kevad,2011-10-01T15:09Z,"@ Maax: After 50% it takes times, cause there is not enough seeders"
,gangsta0555,2011-10-01T15:10Z,Someone needs to find a way to be able to convert the 'fifa 12 reloaded' torrent file for pc into a mac file as it has more seeders.
,virus.app,2011-10-01T15:14Z,try burning it on a dvd and install using crossover games.. i installed a chess game using this method but sumthing tells it aint gonna work.
,gangsta0555,2011-10-01T15:53Z,its so hard to seed if no one has downloaded the full file. I'm on 55% and sometimes my speeds are like 150k and other times its like 0.5k
,gangsta0555,2011-10-01T17:02Z,WOOT WOOT 56% !!!
,gangsta0555,2011-10-01T18:00Z,"@SLOAN

well what can we do about it? the people who have completely downloaded it are not seeding so we are stuck. I'm not sure what to do."
,Heester,2011-10-01T18:13Z,Mine is at 67%
,gangsta0555,2011-10-01T18:24Z,"@heester

whats ur dl speed like? and when do u think u will finish?"
,Heester,2011-10-01T19:25Z,"@gangsta

My download speed is 250 kb/s max, I think it will finish within 10 hours.. it will resume when I sleep, download caffeine if you want to do the same thing.. it's in the mac app store"
,gangsta0555,2011-10-01T20:10Z,"@heester

iM at 60%, probs finish tomorrow. how r u getting such high dl speed.

,G433N,2011-10-01T21:00Z,going really fast for me and I just started. It says it will finish in 4 hours.  I hope I do not have any of this %50 slow down stuff. XD
,gangsta0555,2011-10-01T21:55Z,yes it will because it was also very fast for me at the start. let me know how u get on...
,Qwaszx1234,2011-10-02T01:50Z,"I'm now at 73 percent done, but it is going at like 15 kb per second"
,MaaxSmallhead95,2011-10-02T07:54Z,"To be honest, I am not done yet with downloading but it seems like this isn't the real game, because yesterday there were 5 seeders and today it's just 1 .. disabuse me. :)"
,Qwaszx1234,2011-10-02T08:38Z,Now there is no seeders. Does that mean it won't be able to download? Or will it just take a really long time. I'm only 18% away.
,Piranter,2011-10-02T09:03Z,I am @ 55% and my dl-speed is between 600 kb/s and 1 mb/s :) I hope it won't break down again -.-
,gangsta0555,2011-10-02T09:32Z,74% and my dl speed is rocketing!! it says no seeds but its still really fast. i hope this is not fake
,MaaxSmallhead95,2011-10-02T10:03Z,I am freezing at 82% now .. And if anyone is finished with downloading please keep seeding or tell us if this game is fake or not.
,kevad,2011-10-02T10:05Z,"82 % after 24h downloading, and still really really slow hope that's not fake."

,gangsta0555,2011-10-02T11:25Z,"@heester

still stuck on 83%. I'm not sure what u mean when u say ur files aren't growing in MB but there is a read me file which u can access in the folder. can someone check it to sees if it gives any clues about whether it is fake..."
,Piranter,2011-10-02T11:26Z,"I'm at 83%, dl is about 30 kb/s"

And a picture of the cover of FIFA 12 .. so I guess it's the real FIFA 12 .. I hope there are no virus in this torrent."
,Heester,2011-10-02T11:46Z,"@Gangsta I mean that under my files tab the files are stuck at 967 MB..

,gangsta0555,2011-10-02T12:15Z,"@Maax

Thx, only 1 gig left but join extremely slow! how can u tell if there might be a virus - i thought macs were more or less immune to them?"
,Piranter,2011-10-02T12:44Z,"@gangsta0555
they're not immune. There are just few of them for mac, because all over the world mac is only used by 5% of people :) 
Windows has nearly 90% of users."

,MaaxSmallhead95,2011-10-02T14:15Z,"Why is the number of seeders always changing? ... -.-' btw, I'm at 87%, I guess it still takes some time. downloading it with 3kb/s .. what about you, @gangster and @heester. . :) "

I'm on 87% as well, speed around 5kb/s (sometimes as low as 0.3 but as high as 500+), fluctuates loads!"

,Heester,2011-10-02T14:44Z,Can someone please confirm this is real? It's hard to imagine that someone with a 1.7 mb/s isn't finished with this torrent..

,cdnalsi,2011-10-03T16:58Z,"To change the video settings do this:
1) Right Click on the app and choose 'Show Package Contents'
2) Navigate to drive_c > Program Files > Fifa 12 > Game > fifasetup
3) open fifasetup_default.ini in Text Edit and modify RESOLUTIONWIDTH = 1280
RESOLUTIONHEIGHT = 800 
or whatever your screen resolution is...
4) RENDERINGQUALITY = 1
value 0 is low, value 1 is medium and value 2 is high.

if you dont know by now this is a wineskin version of fifa 12 but it does work on my mac ! im running it on a inter i5 2011 mac 

what you do is left or secondary click the fifa 12 image in the folder and choose SHOW PACKAGE CONTENTS then click on WINESKIN  when it opens click REGISTRY EDITOR on the left hand side. When it opens click HKCURRENTUSERS then click SOFTWARE then WINE then DIRECT 3D and CHANGE THE VIDEO MEMORY SIZE TO 512 FROM whatever it is THEN GO BACK AND LAUNCH FIFA 12 AND IT should launch you will still see the fifa 12 image in the begining !! follow me @djsevenla"

I got everything working, even getting it in the length of my screen.

Only problem is that i can't see the players on the pitch.
I only see the ball and the player icon ( the arrow ).

I tried to edit my settings by changing my RENDERING= from 0 to 1, and from 1 to 2. 

Still, players are invisible on the pitch.

I just registered on TPB, just to comment on this torrent and to see if there is somebody out there who can solve this problem.

I really want this game to work, played FIFA for several years now and just want it to work on my macbook.

I hope you guys can solve this problem for my, my thanks will be great!"

Really annoying
Good torrent easy install
Thanks Game12345"
,cod4multiplayer,2012-01-02T13:04Z,"@nelson2308 i think you can do this:
I got it from someone.
.   Once that finish dragging Open up FIFA 2012 , When the game Start's and it didnt work IF it didnt work freezes u just can hear the intro sound of the game SO... there is a problem , fixing this would be easy

6. Just Hold command + Q so that the game forced it to quit and Then go to your Users/User/Documents/FIFA 12/instance0 At there you will see an archive named ""replay0.bin"" you need to right click and then ""Get Info"" then just lock the archive.

7. Still the game Freezes ?? Well , please Note : everytime when you start the Game and it just Stuck you only hear the intro sound just hold as i said command+Q and Once it quit's open it again & aggain.... until it work's

8. Still the Graphics aren't good for you ?? Well , just Go to FIFA 2012 --- click show in finder -- right click on fifa 12 -- show package content-- drive c -- ea sports -- fifa 12 -- game -- fifasetup -- fifasetup_default.ini and set the resolution. you want for fullscreen just look at your System preferences & go to Display. then look down at where the resolution end's For example 1280+800 So follow that and paste it in the fifasetup_default.ini as Shown in the video...

9. Save the fifasetup_default.ini and PLAY! Note Again : everytime when you start the Game it just Stuck again , you only hear the intro sound just hold command+Q and Once it quit's open it again & aggain.... until it work's Remember that... 

10. Enjoyy playing (Sorry if some of you STILL didnt work or the graphics are bad or you can't see the player the ball the stadium etc it's becuase of the graphic problem Maybe because of your mac dont support the game So.... Sorry!)"

Anybody know how to get rid of the invisible players? 

Tried resolution adjustment & rendering quality, but no changes. All players are invisible. Any tips?

Cheers!"
,pirateFor,2012-04-30T12:56Z,"Hi All,

for who is troubled by the Graphic (No Players rendering/ ball only), you can try one of the most effective techniques;

run the game with a different engine. you can start from: WS8Wine 1.1.5 up to the latest engine: WS8Wine 1.5.1.

possibility of failure still exists, but the probability of success is still above 80%. this is because the environment at every system is different.  although still of the same OSX.

base on experience :)"
