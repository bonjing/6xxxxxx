Publisher's Summary
One Voice Recordings presents its premiere recording of William Hope Hogdson's ghost story "Carnacki the Ghost Finder: Gateway of the Monster". Carnacki's profession and delight is the eerie art and science of tracking down and dealing with the supernatural, and then relating his latest experience to an attentive group of friends...gathered together for just this purpose.

Reviews
These are very British tales, where staid gentlemen meet at Carnacki's house for a good meal and a good yarn. The stories begin in a leisurely manner, but they become eccentric with the introduction of the spectral event and those implements with which the ghost-finder confronts his spooks. Some of the stories become delightful weird and effective, my favorite being "The Whistling Room," which has one of the most effective moments of horror that I have ever read.

Although the tales are simply told, they do indeed express the horrors that may spill into our realm from the haunted Outside and warp reality. Hodgson writes of these fiends with conviction and effective prose. Absolutely delightful.
