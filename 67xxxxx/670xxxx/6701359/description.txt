Concise and clearly illustrated, the ABC of Resuscitation contains practical information on all aspects of the subject. New guidelines are just one of the changes to the 5th edition of this book. Many of the chapters are completely rewritten, with new material on automated defibrillators, advanced life support including paediatric life support, new drugs plus many new illustrations. The text is relevant for Europe, Australasia, South Africa, South America, Malaysia and the Middle East - especially Israel. Ireland is moving closer to the European position and away from the USA.
