,Brat001,2011-09-28T20:35Z,maybe it was just me but in the beginning of the movie when optimus was talking about the past there was a video pixelation problem as the missle fired from the ship. bad enough to delete this rip and seek another.
,Osanda91,2011-09-29T15:36Z,"Hi neonrainbow, can u do Jurassic park blu ray trilogy when it releases next month..it would be massive, i am sure a lot will be wanting to watch it."

Why not just use streaming over your home network? Go to My Xbox>PC>Videos> and look there. "

,nickstarks,2011-10-02T14:11Z,"@lacrossewacker

mp4s will only play on xbox if they are 2.1 channel audio.. this file is most likely 6.1 so the quick answer is no.. unless youre computer saavy you have to convert the audio to 2-channel then mux the files together.. also learn how to use ""tversity"" and skip all the usb shit.."
,marl10796,2011-10-03T14:12Z,"this has a good quality/audio ..
can u give me any subtitle that match the timing of this version?"

,nabarunp7,2011-10-03T17:23Z,THIS VERSION OF cryptik SUUUCKKKS
,dirtymoon,2011-10-10T21:18Z,"V9 A10
Just what you'd expect for a 720p BD-Rip with a tiny amount of flicker in a couple of places. BTW. If you want to watch in 6 channel audio change to audio track 2. Easiest way is using VLC media player."
,dirtymoon,2011-10-10T21:19Z,
,caneZ607,2012-03-09T22:22Z,Just recieved letter from comcast regarding copyright on this torrent. just thought i would inform all.
