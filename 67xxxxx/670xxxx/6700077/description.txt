Slingers, a spinoff from Spiderman's Identity Crisis story arc. The series follows Dusk, Ricochet, Hornet and Prodigy.  Prodigy is recognizable from the Avengers: Initiave series as well as being a major character in Fear Itself: Youth in Revolt.  The rest of the characters have mostly disappeared although according to wikipedia Richochet has appeared in Runaways (Is that series still ongoing? Anyone know?)
