"Personal Fouls" 

As Coach Ray Masters (Lauria) is inducted to the 
Metro Basketball Hall of Fame by former students 
Carmelo Anthony and Chris Bosh, an ex-player 
accuses the coach of sexually abusing him as a 
child. Detective Nick Amaro (Pino) transfers into 
the SVU squad and is thrown on to the case. The 
detectives interview former players but no one 
admits to abuse, forcing Benson (Hargitay) and 
Fin (Ice-T) to dig deeper into Coach Ray's most 
successful player, basketball star Prince Miller 
(Brooks) and his manager/cousin (guest star Heavy 
D.)

Props to the TotalLameAsses for bring back 
segmenting on shitty sources to what is supposed 
to be a section about quality...
