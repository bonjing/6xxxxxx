The clocks filled the room where Arnold Thaine was shot dead, all of them wrong, one of them broken by a bullet. On the day of Thaine's death, Grace DeLong had been to visit him that morning.
But who was the woman in the brown mackintosh? Who were the other two visitors? And could anything be learnt from the broken clock?

* The sound quality shows it's old cassette tape origins somewhat, but the narration is still quite clear. Another intriguing yet hard to find Ferrars' mystery.


Enjoy and Seed!!
