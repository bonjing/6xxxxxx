"There Will be Blood"

While charges against Harry (Kathy Bates) 
are dropped, D.A. Roseanna Remmick (Jean 
Smart) continues her attack by ordering 
the police to harass Harry and plant 
evidence against Eric (Alfred Molina). 
Elsewhere, Cassie (Karen Olivo) looks into 
a recently fired housekeeper with a 
history of violence while Oliver (Mark 
Valley) follows up on a tip about a 
delivery guy who might know something 
damning about the victim's love life. As 
the media fervor grows, Harry recruits 
Tommy (Christopher McDonald) to handle the 
press.

Evolve... or die.
