The Front Page [1974]

Hildy Johnson is the top reporter on a Chicago newspaper during the 1920s.
Tired of the whole game he's determined to quit his job to get married.
His scheming editor, Walter Burns, has other plans though. It's the day
before guilty (but insane) murderer, Earl Williams, is due to go to the
gallows and Burns tempts Johnson to stay and write the story.
