,Ashleynin,2011-09-29T15:13Z,"CW's 'H8R' brings trash talkers to TV...hosted by ""Mario Lopez"", I've never been Kardashian's Fan Never ever will be, I think this show has the potential to do good. A lot ofďťż people judge without knowing the facts. But I really hope these celebrities aren't lying on this show. I don't know if Kim Kardashian was right about her and her family donating to children's hospitals and Katrina victims :P"
