Charles Basildon is the name given to the best spy working for MI6 at any given time. The Charles Basildon name has garnered a reputation over the years invoking fear in those who hear the name with the current incarnation adding to the mythos in his own fashion. The title 'Sir' is at times added to the name.

With little regard for his partner's well being the current Charles Basildon, described as an amoral snake among other things, has gone through six partners, each of them ending up dead. The Prime minister, concerned with his fitness for duty, requests that Basildon be assessed. In response to this the director of MI6, Sir Richard Pilchard, aware of Basildon's attitudes decides to assign him a new apprentice, Stephanie Shelly, in the hopes that she might curb Basildon's flagrant disregard for danger and the safety of civilians.
