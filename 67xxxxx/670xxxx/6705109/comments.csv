2. Disable automatic updates. This is also just in case."

,Kara-kan,2011-10-13T04:24Z,Where's 2011? :-)
,baghyarga,2011-10-24T11:59Z,Does it include MultiTerm?
,sagesen,2011-10-25T09:30Z,"@baghyarga: no, this one includes trados only."
,nilanta,2011-10-27T00:28Z,"Doesn't work with me :-( Maybe I did something wrong? It tells me that I have successfully activated my product, but when I try to open the program, it tells me that I need a valid license.."
,sagesen,2011-10-27T20:59Z,"@nilanta: did you copy and paste the files in the crack folder to the right directory? if yes, check your licence location with the licence manager. if the ""licence status"" box shows no licence information, you need to locate your trados.lic file by clicking ""add"" and browsing the file on your computer."
,kermit123,2011-11-01T14:24Z,"I installed Trados, copied files from the crack folder and ran Licence Manager. In Licence Manager I browsed to the .lic file I had just copied from the crack folder and deleted the other licence. So far, so good. I don't see anything saying that Trados would be in trial period. Thanks sagesen!"
,crazycatlady1,2011-11-07T10:09Z,"I followed all the intructions above (apart from uinstalling java updates and disabling automatic updates), but I still get an error message saying I don't have a valid licence, already translated 4000+ words and now I can't open the programme, HELP!! :("
,cuki0,2012-01-01T19:02Z,"I installed it and cracked it. The terminology menagement, software location and alignment translated documents do not work. Do you have to install SDL trados studio 2007 to proceed with SDL 2009 (the installation of 2007 is more complicated)? When I translate a document and then get started with another document with a different name but with the same text in it, SDL does not suggest me the translated text.  On my desktop is shown the shortcut of SDL Pssolo 2009, too, which I think is not cracked. Any suggestion would be welcomed!"

,Rondee,2012-03-17T19:35Z,"Works fine, I was able to update it as well, though I'm not sure whether updating is encouraged.

Thanks for the upload."
