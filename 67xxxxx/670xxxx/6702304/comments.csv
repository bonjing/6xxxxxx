Is that including Watch The Throne (at 320 kbps) as well?

It's definitely on the ""To Do"" list.

Perhaps before or after Nas (iTunes Edition) discography is uploaded."
,lwhennen,2011-09-26T22:54Z,@ theLeak Yes that would include Watch The Throne  .  Ok great any eta on the Nas release? Also do you have a demonoid account? If not would it be ok if I reup your amazing work there with full credits and links to you?

Sure why not. 

About Nas Discography (iTunes Edition), it will be uploaded soon. Don't worry. Still compiling as we speak. It may take longer because of college.

If you like to re-upload Jay-Z Complete Discography, Usher or Rihanna on demonoid, feel free to do so but give credits of course. =)"
,naruto000,2011-09-27T03:57Z,"THIS is the discography that itunes has...
this is not everything that eminem has to offer.... 
just letting everyone know."
,idontcare007,2011-09-27T07:03Z,"Could you upload Bruno Mars new single - It Will Rain ?

What's the point repeating it when clearly it's been said on the description?"
