audio but interrupted video"
,xmassacre,2011-09-26T14:45Z,"to extract the rar either use winzip, or as i prefer try 7zip. Its a very small program but extracts files perfectly for me."
,captainnihilo,2011-09-26T17:03Z,Tried both winzip and 7zip.  Still getting interrupted video.

,fillinthisspace,2011-09-26T23:21Z,"Are there files missing from this torrent?
According to the torrent info the file size should be 1.44GB.
The same uploader has uploaded the torrent again, this time containing more pieces.

I haven't downloaded this torrent myself, but I suspect it should have been deleted."
,fillinthisspace,2011-09-26T23:27Z,"Sorry, ignore my previous post. The torrent I linked to is for episode one. I was having a stupid moment and confusing my torrents. The info for this torrent does say it's only 1.07GB."
,leezie,2011-09-27T11:03Z,"I went to extract the file and each folder came up empty...weird. That hasn't happened before.
So I found another copy on Demonoid instead."
,Ponyoo,2011-09-27T17:33Z,"GREAT upload,  sceneline!!

To the whining mother fuckers: Use Winrar!
