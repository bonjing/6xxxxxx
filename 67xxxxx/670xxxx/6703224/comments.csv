I have a lot more coming, but folks are going to have to start seeding. I won't be able to keep my computer up all the time."

Video/Audio = 10
Note. some constructive feedback; next time have the episodes in chronological order (example: S1E1-Strange Love) (. I will goggle which comes first and so forth."
