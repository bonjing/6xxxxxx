NOTE Transfers are default because there will be a DLC by KONAMI soon to update it and
not even we like double work.

NOTE2 This patch is not compatible with KONAMI's 1.01 update, so do not install it after installing the patch. (If it is installed already and install the patch it will overwrite it)
