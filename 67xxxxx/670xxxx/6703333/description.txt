
(Farewell America, URSS 1949, b/n e col. 70â€™)
Regia: Aleksandr Dovzhenko
Con: Liliya Gritsenko, Nikolai Gritsenko, Ianis Osis, Lyudmila Shagalova

A remarkable rarity, Dovzhenko's unfinished final film was a response to the atmosphere of intrigues and espionage - real or imagined - that dominated the early Cold War era. In protest of the intensifying postwar anti-communist witch hunt, American journalist Annabelle Bucard emigrated to Russia and became a Soviet citizen; her book, The Truth About American Diplomats, was published in English and Russian in 1949. That book, and aspects of Ms. Bucard's life, formed the basis for FAREWELL, AMERICA. Shortly after the Allied victory, an idealistic "Anna Bedford" gets a job in Moscow at the U.S. Embassy, which she promptly discovers is crawling with spies. Upon returning home some time later for her mother's funeral, she encounters an America plagued with massive unemployment and sinking into anti-communist hysteria. Near the end of the shoot, Dovzhenko received an order from the Kremlin to immediately halt production on the film; the film remained unfinished until in 1995 Mosfilm and Gosfilmofond Rossii completed the film as best as could be done with the existing material. Finally - a chance to see the Cold War from the other side!
