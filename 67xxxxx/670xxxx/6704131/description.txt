Roobarb was the first fully animated series made in the UK.  It featured the manic adventures of an enthusiastic dog name Roobarb, and the cynical cat Custard, who wants to sabatoge the dog's fun.  These 30 five-minute episodes of roughly drawn animation became a cult favorite in the UK, and was followed by a sequel series in 2005.  It was written by George Calveley, animated by Bob Godfrey, and voiced by Richard Briers,  with a theme by Johnny Hawksworth that became hugely popular in its own right.
