Album Review:

German young pop project BOY may surprise potential listeners not only with its name, which is quite original for a female duo, but also with the latest creation, LP â€˜Mutual Friendsâ€™. At the beginning the album bewitches with its lightness and simplicity, yet further itâ€™s getting clear that thereâ€™s nothing more than that. You canâ€™t count on breathtaking melodies, thought-provoking lyrics or at least, impressive arrangements. Well, yes, I know itâ€™s pop music, but even such music can be really interesting and deep. Here we deal with plain stories of everyday life wrapped in a bit monotonous music that makes you get bored almost after listening to the first half of the album or even earlier. Of course, the songs have their moments, mostly thanks to the vocals pleasant to the ear, however the voice gradually lulls although such tracks as â€˜Little Numbersâ€™, â€˜Oh Boyâ€™, â€˜Skinâ€™ and â€˜Silver Streetsâ€™ will wake you up from time to time in order to immerse into a tranquil drowse again. In general I donâ€™t want to say, that the release is all bad, itâ€™s just for those who enjoy such kind of music and donâ€™t demand too much.
