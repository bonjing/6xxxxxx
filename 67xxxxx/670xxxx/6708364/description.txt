-------------Complete Jean M. Auel Audio Collection v2.0-------------
She's done it again! Released another wonderful Earth's children book. This demands an updated torrent! I have processed all these unabridged books in the following ways:

1. All books were ripped BY ME. All rips are from high quality CDs.

2. FULLY CHAPTERIZED. This took days. Each audio book was compiled into a single file (deleting bits like "Disc 2, please insert Disc 3") and then separated into Parts and Chapters as defined by the original books. I find this to be the best way to enjoy audiobooks and it is perfect for iPods.

3. Encoded all books to a uniform MP3 96kbps 44.1kHz.

4. ID3 Tagged. All audio book files have been fully ID3 tagged including full COVER ART.

And so this torrent represents a 100% complete collection of Auel's fictional works. She has thus far written the 6 Earth's Children novels and no other fiction.

Please leave any comments, questions, or suggestions you might have as they are HIGHLY APPRECIATED! :)

Enjoy!
