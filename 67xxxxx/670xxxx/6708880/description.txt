The TAPS team travels to Hawaii's Plantation Village in Waipahu, Hawaii, in order to investigate claims of the paranormal and try to separate what could really be supernatural and what is natural.  Then the crew trades in their flip flops and tank tops for long johns and jackets to investigate the renovated Ventfort Hall in Lenox, Massachusetts, where people being touched, voices heard, and ghostly faces seen in a loft have been reported.
