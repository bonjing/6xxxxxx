,711thorwor,2011-10-02T13:19Z,"Hello all:

I can not get it to work. When i run driver.exe after replacing with cracked files nothing happens. 
I followed the instructions - installed,ran the patch update and copied the cracked files from SKIDROW folder to the main installed files(folders: Ubisoft Gamelaunch and Driver San Francisco) If you just copy the SKIDROW folder to the main inst. folders i get a missing file error bink32.dll so it cant be that you just copy the cracked files over directly because it doesnt work. ) It does not work by copy and replace the cracked files cos i tried it in all kinds of combinations) I ran it as administrator and there is no settings.yml file being created either not before or after i run the driver.exe file. 

Can someone here tell me what exactly needs to be done to get it to work? Thanks:)!"
