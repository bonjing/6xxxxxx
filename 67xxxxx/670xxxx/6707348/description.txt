NOTES:
Ok. This is a nice and early release of this blu ray. Its region c. Its korean blu ray video and i've matched it with the english audio from the r1 dvd. This has a few flaws though. First, source came with hardcoded korean subs. Secondly, the source vid was a pretty ameteur encode. Compressed wi no filtering using a simple, foreign encoder av never heard of personaly. So source had artifacts like colour banding and aliasing. Av filtered this n brought it back up to a very nice level but its still not perfect. It is a decent nuff encode though and an early copy of this blu ray. Take it or leave it.
