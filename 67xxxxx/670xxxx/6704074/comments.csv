,Stormfront73,2011-09-28T17:13Z,first it makes me sign up to windows live before i can save than asks for a bloody product key. Fuck this i'll go and buy it for the 360.
,marco699,2011-09-28T23:25Z,"@ Stormfront73 

You need to create an windows live acount in order to save it, just like many other windows live games, I have no idea why it asks you for a key, I have installed it fine on my PC.

Sorry to hear you had problems, anyone esle had any problems with this?"
,mcmanic,2011-09-29T03:03Z,"works fine here, win7 x64.

just use the offline account trick to play using Windows Live"
,Stormfront73,2011-09-29T14:49Z,Cheers for the feed back bro. I'll take another look at it !

,marco699,2011-10-05T03:45Z,"@ billz 569
Are you running win 7 64 bit?, have you installed windows live? 
Try reinstalling it, post back feedback, lets see if we can get it working for you."
,deurj11,2011-10-17T19:14Z,"HELP,

,Goloxer,2011-11-12T10:25Z,Wops dont worry i was doing something wrong :) im using deamon tools now :) but another problem when i mount it and run settup it doesnt respond
,Goloxer,2011-11-12T10:34Z,Haha right got the same error as billzy596 any ideas?
,benwin022,2011-12-07T06:02Z,Thanks working fine 10/10
,Jewddha,2011-12-28T00:39Z,Did anyone have to deal with needing a product key when logging into their Live account? And if so how did you fix it. I'll grant 10 internets to whoever helps. 
,mikevanveld,2012-01-08T19:23Z,do somebody has the product key??
,Indy87,2012-01-17T18:35Z,Heya I downloaded and I will seed if i can get it working. My download only came with the iso file.  I mount the image and the setup starts but all it ever does is stop responding before i can do anything. not to mention the file it is running seems to be in another language. Any ideas? I am using daemon tools but i also have poseriso. Thanks.
,Indy87,2012-01-17T18:52Z,yeah no matter what i do I can't get the setup to work. It always says program not responding. I did extract my files though. :/ but it still wont work.
,Skeeter152,2012-02-15T07:13Z,ok..for this..and any other game all you have to do is..if .rar for extract..then theres either an .iso or the files..if you have an .iso you mount it with which ever program you prefer. i use magic iso.. then from there go to the mounted drive and run the setup from there. vista use as administrator. the setup should run perfect. then copy crack...etc... play.. thats it..nothing fancy here...
,Skeeter152,2012-02-15T07:15Z,as for the windows live thing messing with everyone you have to make a offline live account... it confused me and turned me away from a few games cuz but its actually easy..and once you make it any other windows live game you get you wont have to redo it
,Skeeter152,2012-02-15T20:33Z,im installing it right now and i haven't had any problems with errors or anything. im running vista x64..idk why everyone else was having troubles.
,Skeeter152,2012-02-15T20:37Z,and to go along with my other comments..this was one of the easiest games to install...as long as you have an offline windows live account the game installs and then starts up with out a problem. im playing it now. just remember to click the english tick when your installing it
,freakyferret,2012-03-06T00:17Z,"I try to make an account and it keeps giving me an error. Why the hell do I have to make an XBL account to play, it's BS."
,freakyferret,2012-03-06T00:23Z,"Ignore my last comment, after a few errors it let me make an account, but now it's asking for a serial key. Help???"
,huisdaf,2012-03-06T10:59Z,"when i try to run the setup nothing happens except the worm icon comes up and no window shows up, then i have to start task manager and end it... can someone help??"
,ZillaIIDope,2012-03-12T02:48Z,"(not tested on 64bit)
This is most likely my problem."
,watwatman,2012-03-28T02:39Z,"I have the same problem as huisdaf. I downloaded it all, mount it using Daemon tools, and then just the Pinata icon on the task bar pops up, but nothing else. So I go into task manager to close it, it's only using less then 4000k in memory... Any help from anyone?"
,xrenax,2012-04-03T18:45Z,"Hi, I just downloaded this and I dont understand what people mean by 'make a offline windows live account' ? How will that help and how exactly do I do this?"
,SuperGeekNo1,2012-04-08T20:43Z,"press the home key which pulls up the guide toolbar 
highlight create a new account and make one then play "
,PinkieLie,2012-04-11T03:33Z,"Please seed. I am getting like 60kB/s off and on, and would like to play sooner that 1 week:("
,mdgames56owner,2012-04-14T14:47Z,if you want to play it with widows live account then use the serial code that is CKXJ9-K38VT-28BQQ-DB38Y-9DK2Y
,KuroKiss,2012-04-17T19:46Z,"I have to say, this file has been nothing but a pain in the ass since I downloaded it.  I don't know about other operating systems but if you have Windows 7, don't bother.  I had to spend hours searching for a fix just to be able to sign up for a stupid account so I could get the sodding thing to save.  Finally found a fix that required me to delete something like 103 files from my windows folder and even then I didn't get a chance to actually play.  It demanded a serial code, which there is no real keygen for anywhere.  Wasted another 3 hours of my life searching for one.  The only program I found that even really worked produced keys that were 10 digits too short.  

Seriously, Marco, dunno what operating system you're running but you should put a giant sodding neon sign across this download listing all the crap anyone on Windows 7 64-bit will have to go through just to have the game still not let them play."
,Fudgehog,2012-05-20T04:21Z,"This fully worked with no problems with me.

I've done this both on 32 bit, and 64 bit.

Download the file.
Use Deamon Tools Lite to mount the .iso file inside the download.
Just click the usual next buttons (but don't forget to select English as language).
Unmount image after installation.
Launch the game, and when it asks you to create an Live Games user account. Simply click it away, and select Games for Windows Live again. 
Now click create an account.
You have to read through a ''i agree'' page if I remember correctly, but between the lines there's a link saying: create local account.

Do that, and you'll be able to save your games and not having to create a windows live account.

Sorry if this already has been posted, just wanted to point out that everything worked amazing."
,Fayze123,2012-05-31T18:33Z,when i downloaded this it worked just fine and is installing fine but everything looks like its in spanish accents or something when i in did the setup i did set it to english though so i hope that fixes it
