My first torrent!  I began sharing this on Demonoid because I had trouble creating an account here.  Solved!!!


This is what you are downloading:

480p digital recordings off VHS tapes and converted to DVD ready files. They can be mounted to virtual drive using a program like PowerISO and viewed on your PC or burned to DVDRs with Imgburn (I left the MDS files because programs like Imgburn require them)and used in your DVD player.

There are 6 nights of CBC broadcasts (commercials, intermission shows and full games) they cover the entire first round series of the 1996 Stanley Cup Playoffs featuring the original WPG Jets v the DET Redwings.  Set the way-back machine and enjoy reliving old glory days with the likes of Stevie Y, Osgood, Selanne, Khabibulin, Ron Maclean (with hair!) and the old HNIC theme.

*One thing of note is the missing 3rd period of game four (how shabby is that?!).  Alas the tape ran out without my knowing.  Such is life!  

I continue to seed this and share it with you because someone downloaded my files and is actually trying to sell them.  You get them the way God (me) intended - FREE!

Thanks and enjoy!!
