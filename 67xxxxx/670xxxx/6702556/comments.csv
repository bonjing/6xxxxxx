But this song is shit

Lou reed sounds like hes talking over the sound of Metallica playing very low in the background. 
 It just doesn't sound good at all. "
,jpuff,2011-09-26T23:54Z,"I do like it, strong music and a strong intimidating character, with an exciting story, looking foward for the whole album, sadly is until late october.

is easier when you forget about whos playing and just focus on the song...

and theres nothing weird about the structure of the song, Lou has many songs like this.

Thanks for the upload."
