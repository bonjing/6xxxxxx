,Seed_Demon,2011-10-31T19:13Z,"Nicely said Anacondaz...wish there was a report button/link though, for all of  us to be able to get it in a mod's face to decide if it IS a fake, or packed... or if it ,isn't and is just someone frustrated, causing more confusion as you mentioned, then they too should meet some accountability, like temp bans, for 1st offense, and you can figure from there....Thanks for all your great work A!"
