Your previous upload of this has been deleted."

I had to upload the torrent twice because I discovered that when attempting to edit the description text it would not allow me, so I had to upload a completely new torrent just to get a minor edit in. After that I tried to delete the unused torrent and then the delete button wouldn't work.
Maybe try fixing the website you moderate before snapping at me yeah?"

Perhaps try fixing the site that you moderate first.
I had to create and upload a whole new torrent just to make a minor edit because apparently the edit option is non-functional along with the delete option."
