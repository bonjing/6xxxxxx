,SPARTAN246,2011-09-28T14:40Z,"Game works perfectly, If your connected to xbox live it doesnt matter what firmware you have if youve got a flashed drive you can play this game. IF youve already been banned and are not downloading dashboard updates at regular points throughout the year then the disk will regonize your dash needs updated and if you try to update this game it will flash your drive back to normal but if you then update to 1.9 you will get around this

This is the best fifa yet its insanely realistic top download thank you "

,lookwhoshere_wow,2011-09-29T09:21Z,"shaani993....
If you you choose to update it then what happens is very simple... All fake games stop working in your xbox... You will have to reflash it again with LT+ 1.91 which will make fifa 12 work and all other fake games...
So, relax and just flash it again with LT+ 1.91"

Burning process failed in 2 discs and in third it burned successfully and even game runs but than it gives dirty disc error .
