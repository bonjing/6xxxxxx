Sherlock Holmes and the Seven Deadly Sins Murders
UNABRIDGED
by Barry Day
Narrated by David Ian Davies
Length: 4 hours 51 minutes

At Oxford they jokingly called themselves The Seven Sinners. Now, 30 years later, they are being murdered - each in the manner of his particular 'sin'. Who is doing it and what is the connection with the twin serpents, the mysterious Emerald Lady and the holy Book of Kor? Holmes and Watson -with the aid of their new friend, Professor Challenger - must race against time and the killer...before one of the victims becomes his brother, Mycroft.

Within the outpouring of Holmes pastiches, Barry Day's series, of which the "SH and the Seven Deadly Sins Murders is the latest, stands out as far superior to most or all. The plots are quite inventive, and the naratives are presented in fine form. The author is most attentive to the Canon, with constant reference and allusions.
