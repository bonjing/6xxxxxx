,Robidub,2011-11-30T04:17Z,"Hey, I downloaded the media player you recommended and it doesnt play episodes 58-69 and vlc wont play any of them properly. Any suggestions would be apreciated. I got pulled into watching this series and now I need to finish it, please! ty"
,Pixels1080,2011-12-02T20:08Z,"@ Robidub

The One i linked is a media convertor not a player ,

If its not working personaly i use KMPLAYER its free and playes almost every thing  :)"
,raven6613,2011-12-24T07:50Z,"So I downloaded the first 2 seasons and they work fine, but for some reason, most if not all the epsidoes from this one are buggy for me. Epsiode 55 for example appears to be playing very fast and is only about 15 seconds long. Some of the others have the audio lagging REALLY far behind or there are skips in the video every couple of seconds. I'm using AVC to convert them to .AVI from .MKV and watch them on my pc with WMP. I have all the proper codecs and what not as everything else I play works fine, including (as I said before) the previous 2 seasons. If you could get back to me on this that'd be great. I spent a long time downloading the torrents and was pretty bummed. I registered just to see if there was something going on, as the only other season 3 torrent here is not dubbed. =| Thanks in advance."
,Pixels1080,2011-12-25T15:10Z,"@ raven6613

Its either your player or the conversion went wrong some where , 

Plus I do check my uploads before sharing them. and all works fine .

My recommendation is use KMPLAYER its free and plays almost every thing .

if that didnt work for you re-download only Eps 55

Note : i was not able to write a comment some error kept poping ""Data base error"" :("
,raven6613,2011-12-26T05:06Z,"Thanks for getting back to me. Gonna try re-downloading everything to see if my machine went haywire somewhere. If worse comes to worse and I can't figure it out I can pull a few episodes from Youtube with Zamzar. Quality of sound and video is great so I hate to miss out though XD Thanks again, and Happy Holidays. =]"
,bpcookie,2011-12-29T11:50Z,"Mystery solved! For those who think 70-71 are not there. They are there, they're just sort of out of order. For reasons unknown, episodes 58-69 have a u with a line over it in ""Shippuden"", so 70-71 end up between 57 and 58."
,elvisbs121,2012-01-24T07:23Z,hmm... not workning on my DVD im burning them to CD and just 3rd season shows error and kills my CD :/
,elvisbs121,2012-01-24T19:57Z,ow now i know whats the problem! MAN CONVERT THEM FROM MKV TO ANOTHER FORMAT MY DVD DONT SUPPORT MKV!!!
,SoldierNThug,2012-01-28T03:10Z,I downloaded the video converter you recommended but for reasons unknown it wont convert some episodes
,GummyB,2012-02-07T00:41Z,"Hi Pixels1080. So as I've seen in a lot of the comments some episodes don't work. I have a pretty decent video converter, but it says the episodes do not exist in particular episodes 58-69. I never knew what that meant, but nonetheless i can't convert them. I know it would be a big hassle for you to do, but on behalf of everyone i think you should consider converting this season in avi. It doesn't make sense, i can convert seasons 4 and 5, but not this one. I would really appreciate it. I can't find season 3 anywhere else, and even on this site, it's subbed.  Hope to hear from you soon. "

,glavan117,2012-02-07T17:46Z,"hey pixels im trying to download it but its too slow, i mean my net speed is awesome and i downoloaded all the other seasons quick as whats going on with this one even with little seeds i still download fast  bro "
,bflinch,2012-02-09T00:10Z,the problem with the conversion is the line over the u change it to normal and your problems should be better
,GummyB,2012-02-09T13:14Z,GENIUS!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!
,gellis2010,2012-03-11T00:49Z,Pixels. You are a legend mate! Best naruto torrents about. Thank you sir.
