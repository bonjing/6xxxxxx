Members,

I\'d like to share with you our newest addition to the LibraryPirate Arsenal:

The LibraryPirate Book Rapist

This FREE and simple to use program will turn any digital camera into a lean mean textbook scanning machine. Just take pictures of the textbook on a black background and the program will do the rest. LPBR will crop, sharpen and re-size the entire folder of camera scan images into one easily readable PDF ebook. It\'s so easy to scan a textbook now, even a college student can do it. During our testing, we were able to scan and convert one 500 page book in under 2 hours.

Coming soon: Video tutorial on how to scan a textbook with the LibraryPirate Book Rapist

Special thanks to RiddleRiot for crafting this new weapon in python.
The program will work on most windows, linux and mac platforms.
LPBR supports both single and double page camera scan images.

Now, grab a textbook, fire up that digital camera and JOIN US!

Best Regards,
