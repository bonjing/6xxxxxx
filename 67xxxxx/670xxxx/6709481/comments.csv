,Damien74,2011-10-07T23:23Z,"Does anyone know if there will be a problem with licences for me. I got a real licence to PS CS5.1 but I can't afford to buy Lightroom for the moment even though I will later on.

MetallicaSucks you gotta be kidding?
Most pro photographers loves Lightroom. Paint can't do anything lol."

,ghostk,2011-10-15T17:12Z,does it have 64-bit included also?
,pxpierre,2011-10-17T00:19Z,"Thank you alexisthebest & seeders!

To reply to a few questions above:

1- I had a pirated Lightroom v3.0.1 installed and ran this v3.5 & it updated fine without the need to use a new key nor the keygen.

2- Yes, 64-bit is included as well as 32-bit. The installer automatically select the proper one for your Windows system.

3- Norton AV would delete keygen.exe saying it contained a virus. That's a lie, just disable your AV to be able to run it.

4- The file CORE10k.EXE is just a crap animation and is not needed to install the program."
,dingo53,2011-10-17T07:29Z,"Guys.  Ignore the virus reports on the Keygen.  They always do it.  You may have to turn your virus checker off while you run the keygen.  Just don't forget to turn it back on.

The tricky thing is editing your hosts file so that it doesn't try and register with Adobe.

My complete host file looks like this:

# Copyright (c) 1993-1999 Microsoft Corp.
#
# This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.
#
# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each
# entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should
# be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.
# The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one
# space.
#
# Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual
# lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.
#
# For example:
#
#      102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com          # source server
#       38.25.63.10     x.acme.com              # x client host

,Phavonic,2011-10-18T05:52Z,Alexisthecunt. This had a trojan virus in it. Bad form !
,ripley511,2011-10-22T03:15Z,"I also initially had the same problem with keygen being snagged as having a virus. Listen to the people who kindly spell out the instructions - TURN OFF YOUR ANTI-VIRUS.

The program AND the keygen work great!! There is no virus.

Thank you to alexisthebest and all of you who helped the rest of us in the slow class.  Much appreciated!"
,callumo,2011-10-31T03:21Z,The CORE keymaker dosen't even have an option for LR? How do I install now?
,partypapa,2011-11-01T17:55Z,need for CD-KEY. my antivirus won't let me to open this keygen :(
,mamasmilk,2011-11-13T03:09Z,It's telling me I need a serial number??? Help??? 
,Partypetie,2011-11-15T23:39Z,A*. Selected the correct software option on the keygen and the serial worked fine. Thanks!
,adobe212,2011-11-17T22:26Z,"The torrent is the lastest version but the only problem is Serial doesnt work I grabbed my serial 
from http://bayimg.com/nALAhAAdA and it worked perfectly. "
,HaakonM,2011-11-20T21:20Z,"I can confirm the Keymaker contains the worm Fujack.T. It gathers information from your computer and can be used to control your computer.
Many key makers are infected, and it's naive to just turn of your antivirus program and run a .exe file like this. I will moderate myselv, it's actually very stupid. If you turn of your antivirus, you are no longer protected and you will get infected. Quite simple. Why not realease the serial in .txt ?

But, in this case new antivirus programs will be able to clean out the worm and leave a clean and safe to use keymaker. I used Norton and after it was cleaned the icon of the keymaker was gone. That should be a safe sign."
,djb28,2011-11-26T00:08Z,"Dont listen to HaakonM, He doesnt know what the hell he is talking about! Many torrents do this. It is as simple as turning off the virus or extracting in safe mode. I will save you all the time! Enjoy.

,edguy74,2012-01-09T20:59Z,"Thanx alot for this. I had no trouble at all. For those who are newbies.: First shut down or turn off  your antivirus/firewall or whatever you are using,just to make sure that the KEYGENERATOR isn't mistaken for a virus. Keygens are OFTEN mistaken for viruses,trojans but they are normally safe to use. Then run the installer. After that you locate your HOSTSFILE as described (open it in notepad) and you paste this : 127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com at the bottom of the file. Start lightroom and when asked for a serial number use the keygen to get one,copy and paste the serialnr and you are good to go!!"
