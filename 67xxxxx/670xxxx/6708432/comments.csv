Still the torrent won't seed despite there having been up to 17 peers. I'm only connected to one peer but it just won't start. If anyone can tell me why did is then please tell me what's happening. I've uploaded plenty of torrents in the past and they used to work just fine, but these days whatever I upload won't start.
Anything I download will upload just fine however so there's no problem with my port settings. I've put in plenty of trackers. What the hell is going on?"
,stonelesscutter,2011-09-29T03:48Z,Could this problem be related to Windows 7 or that it's the 64-bit version? My old XP 32-bit system never had the problem.
,stonelesscutter,2011-09-29T04:46Z,"My utorrent says it's downloading the torrent that I just uploaded myself and it is at 0%!!
WTF is up with that?"
,stonelesscutter,2011-09-29T05:38Z,"I still have no clue what the freaking problem is but I've cheated and found a way around it for now.
I rarred the file into 4 parts and send those individually to a friend of mine. Asked if they could put the unrarred file into their download folder and then download my torrent from here. Then I expected it to start but it still didn't. When I set the torrent in my client to a different download location it suddenly started downloading the file from my friend.

Soon I shall be able to seed my own damn torrent. It's freaky that I had to download my own torrent from somebody else first for it to work. I mean WTH is up with that?? If anyone can help me out the dark here they'd make me really really happy."
,stonelesscutter,2011-09-29T05:57Z,"Well I thought it was working but I've been stuck at 99,8% of the file for about 20 minutes now. I know there's someone else who's also stuck at 99,8%. And there's somebody who has a 100% and still seeding but for some reason it doesn't share the last 0,2%. Then there's the matter that 16 of the 18 peers don't seem to want to connect. This whole thing is still a mystery to me."
,stonelesscutter,2011-09-30T03:04Z,"Well this just isn't gonna work folks, so if no-one can tell me how to solve this problem I'll have to delete this torrent.
There's no sense for you people to try to download this right now, you're only wasting your time, you won't get past 99,8%. I'm sorry I couldn't get this to work. Don't say I didn't warn you. If you have a solution then please leave a note."
