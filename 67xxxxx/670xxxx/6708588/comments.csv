,nani177,2011-09-30T06:16Z,"hey guys cen some one tell me
is this 5.1 channel surround audio
thank you "
[V],HolyRoses,2011-09-30T06:22Z,"All my HD releases have a 5.1 track but it is not the default track.  If you have an Apple TV enable Dolby Digital in the settings and the 5.1 track will play by default however.  On a PS3 you will have to select the 2nd track.  If you use VLC you will have to select the 2nd track.

the default track is a dolby pro logic II track."
,myqueenHR,2011-09-30T18:04Z,I just created an account because I wanted to thank you Holy Roses for the vast library that you have shared with us throughout the years.  I really appreciate it and I hope you know how many people look forward to your next project.  I myself can say that all of the video content on my iphone and ipad is because of you.  All hail to the Queen!
,downaccs,2011-10-01T07:34Z,"how about the run time?

some have 154 min, other have 157 min."
,xenoFLASH,2011-10-03T18:08Z,"I remember reading you use handbreak for your encodes. I was wondering what settings you use. There are many older films I would like to re-encode(and play on my x-box). Noone makes them like you. Also, I don't care what anyone says about this movie: it kicks ass. Don't stop doing what you do, HR. Looking forward to Green Lantern. Hope you do the extended version. Thanks!"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-10-04T05:40Z,No I don't use handbrake.  I forget what else u type.

,Hopit88,2011-10-14T03:07Z,I created a account to say thank you HR for sharing great quality. All my movies are from your library of movies. Dont stop...=)
,lakanooki,2011-10-22T01:56Z,"Hey HR, I'm suddenly having problems playing 5.1 on your movies via ATV2. No audio at all for this upload, but older ones work fine.  If I turn off Dolby Digital, the 2ch stereo plays fine.  Do you think this is related to the recent ATV firmware upgrade?  Other movies in 5.1 play fine so I'm confused."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-10-25T16:45Z,"try firmware 4.4.2.
