    Yes, we are aware of dupe frame scene, but there's no pattern to it

    Half-breed Keoma returns to his border hometown after service in the     
    Civil War and finds it under the control of Caldwell, an                 
    ex-Confederate raider, and his vicious gang of thugs. To make matters    
    worse, Keoma's three half-brothers have joined forces with Caldwell,     
    and make it painfully clear that his return is an unwelcome one.         
    Determined to break Caldwell and his brothers' grip on the town,         
    Keoma partners with his father's former ranch hand to exact violent      
    revenge.
