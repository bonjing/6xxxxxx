Milla Jovovich's 1994 debut (and to date, only official) studio album ''The Divine Comedy.''
 
While it's now common for models and actors to try their hand at music, the good results of The Divine Comedy are not as common. Produced by Rupert Hine, the album is a low-key, laid-back affair featuring guest appearances by Eric Bazilian and Martha Davis. Milla has a pleasant voice and above-average songwriting ability, and the songs are organic, light, airy concoctions that work well in their understated settings.
