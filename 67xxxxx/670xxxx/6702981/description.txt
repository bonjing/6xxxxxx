S04E02 Stone Cold

Brendan Percy, who died near Mt Dasher, in Otago's Kakanui Ranges, in January 2004. "There are still unanswered questions surrounding Mr Percy's death and Oamaru police hope that publicity generated by the programme may encourage people to come forward with new information to assist the investigation," said Detective Sergeant Mike Ryder. "We know Mr Percy was seen alive with his mountain bike and helmet on January 18 between Kakanui and Oamaru. His body was discovered by trampers near Mt Dasher on January 21." Mr Ryder said the investigation had remained open as it had never been established how Mr Percy came to be in an area of sub-alpine terrain, why he was there or what happened to his mountain bike and helmet, which were never found. It was known that Mr Percy associated with people who used and sold drugs.
