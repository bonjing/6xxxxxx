,sankar89,2012-04-22T06:26Z,"the subtitle is out of sync..but you guys can download the subtitle edit from softpedia then open the subtitle file in that software..the next you have to do is click on the synchronization on top and then click adjust all times. A small dialog box will pop up and click on the show earlier button untill you can see the total adjustment is : -46,000..then close and then save it...now load with vlc player and it will be fine."
