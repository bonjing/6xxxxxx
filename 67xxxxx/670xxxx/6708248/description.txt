Publisher's Summary
You know how stuffy those English men's clubs are: "right sort of chap, and all that rot." Now imagine that the very worst sort of interloper forced his way into the exclusive club - a ghost who refuses to leave. And even worse, a ghost who was a failure in life and a failure in his haunting. David Ian Davies offers an enchanting one-man performance of this otherworldly tale.
