The third episode looks at the last generation of killer dinosaurs carnivores that took killing to
a new level.

By the end of the cretaceous period - 75 millions years ago - these gigantic and specialised
hunter-killers had spread throughout the globe. In the southern continents it was the powerful
and muscular abelisaurids that reigned supreme but it was the famous tyrannosaurids [or
tyrant dinosaurs] that dominated in the north.

Whilst the Northern Daspletosaurus hunted in gangs, using its highly developed smell and
hearing to take down opponents like the horned rhino-sized beast, Chasmosaurus, in the
Southern hemisphere the small skulled Majungasaurus reigned. And though the sharp
toothed Majungasaurus was an efficient killer of the much smaller feathered Rahonavis, that
did not stop it from occasionally turning cannibal and hunting its own.
