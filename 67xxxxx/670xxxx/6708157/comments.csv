[V],mirrormaster82,2011-09-29T00:38Z,"This concludes new 52 debut issues...I'm not sure about this,50-50 for sure,although I haven't read this week releases and few of the previous week.Still better than Marvel...at least to me."
,flense,2011-09-29T01:23Z,"Interesting... looks like (from the cover, at least) they're going to pickup where they left Hex during The Return of Bruce Wayne. Have to read it to see for sure, though.

@mirrormaster82 Agreed. And thanks."

,marvelpunk,2011-09-29T03:12Z,"Hey MM, you have New Mutants #31 by any chance?"
,new52,2011-09-29T03:28Z,"another 52 thanks, mm82!"
[V],mirrormaster82,2011-09-29T12:49Z,marvelpunk:Should be out today...so whoever uploads it first
[T],MrDowntown,2011-09-30T18:12Z,I enjoyed this - Its sad that the only good 52's are these random obscure ones.
