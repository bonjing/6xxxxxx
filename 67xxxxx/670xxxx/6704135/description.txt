disc 1 of \\\"Autechre & The Hafler Trio - Â»ah3eo & ha3oeÂ« (ae3o3)\\\" on Die Stadt
aug 29 2011

\\\"The next installment of the enthralling collaboration \\\'twixt h3o and those likely lads Autechre is ready to see the light of day on Die Stadt and Simply Superior. This should make the previous two glow again with renewed ardour, and provide a couple of answers, but many, many more questions. 

 This release will come in a special format: double DVD (5.1 Audio Version), each disc featuring 2 hours of material. Due to the special nature of the format this title will come in a limited edition of 1000 copies. 

 The official release date is August 29th 2011. 

IMPORTANT TECHNICAL NOTES: 

 Firstly, it is essential to use a 5.1 surround sound system in order to experience the work in the intended manner. Both discs provide Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1 soundtracks. Of the two, DTS is the technically superior audio standard, so a surround amplifier capable of decoding DTS will give the best results. 

 Secondly, the DVDs are factory created and printed. One of the discs is a Dual Layer DVD and the other is a single layer DVD. Factory created Dual Layer DVDs do not require a special DVD player. However, very old players might give problems or refuse to play. If this is the case, the only thing that can be done is to use a newer device. 

 Thirdly, the discs are not, we repeat, NOT DVD-A, also known as DVD-Audio or Audio DVD. Rather, the discs are standard DVDs, also known as DVD-Video.\\\"
