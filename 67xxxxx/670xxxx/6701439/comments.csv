Install ERVERYTHING in that folder

THEN
Copy everything from the skidrow folder expect steam_api.dll (seems to be a problem with this file!!)

Then run the game"

,FizzyBanana,2011-09-30T10:39Z,"For all of you that have problems with errors and shut downs etc. I got those errors too but try this, this is how I did and it works now..

Before you start, uninstall the game if you've installed it already and delete the RailSimulator.com folder.

_____________________

1. Mount sr-r3ts12

2. Install as normal, tick all the extra installations as .NET FW 4, PhysX, Adobe Flash Player etc. (it probably wont install them since you've mounted the image file so if you get errors when installing all those programs just click OK and move on)

3. Go to the the installation folder and into the Install folder. Install all programs in this order (!!Run as admin if you can!!)
-vcredist_x86
-PhysX
-Adobe Flash Player
-Direct X9
-.NET 4.0
After you've installed .NET 4.0 you'll have to restart your computer, DO SO!

5. Download the updates for RW 3 which can be found here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6707854/Railworks_3_Train_Simulator_2012_Deluxe_Update_1_and_2-SKIDROW

6. Run the update (as admin) and install to your main Railworks directory

7. Open the mounted ISO file (sr-r3ts12) inside that you'll find the SKIDROW folder. Copy ONLY the Railworks.exe and paste it and replace it into you main Railworks folder. 

8. Open the folder with the update that you downloaded. Open the SKIDROW folder. Copy and replace ALL files from there into your main Railworks folder.

9. Start the game with Railworks.exe and enjoy the game

,analjuggern4ut,2011-09-30T22:19Z,"@Giancarlo1001: have you checked that you are using the latest graphic card drivers? If you can load the initial screen, which has package manager and the other stuff, the problem is probably not with the game itself. Have you tried whether or not the previous version, RailWorks 2 (also available here), works on your computer? Did you run the setup as administrator? What antivirus/firewall package are you using? Have you already tried to set it to ""game mode"" (or chosen some other silent option without ""are you sure you want to allow railworks.exe to run on this computer"" popups, which could cause the game to crash) before running the game?"
,Giancarlo1001,2011-09-30T23:13Z,analjuggern4ut: I downloaded RW2 with skidrow and works perfect. RW3 is the one that keeps crashing when i click on Start Railworks 2012. I use McAfee and already tried turning off the antivirus and firewall
,analjuggern4ut,2011-10-01T00:18Z,"@Giancarlo1001: if you check ""settings"", the second tab on the launch screen, try to uncheck ""Train Simulator 2012 Game Engine Technology"" and then press ""Start Train Simulator 2012"". Does that make any difference? And, did you apply the Update 1 and 2 pack, available as a separate torrent?

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6707854/Railworks_3_Train_Simulator_2012_Deluxe_Update_1_and_2-SKIDROW

You could also try to uncheck ""Full Screen"" and set the basic settings option to ""Low"" as that turns off most of the extra graphics options. If you can load the game that way, then try ""medium"" basic settings before moving back to ""high"". You could also try to move the Anti-Aliasing slider to left. 

I am using a quad-core Phenom II CPU and a Radeon HD 6870 graphics card and the game runs perfectly with ""high"" settings with the new graphics engine as long as ""Multi-Core"" option is enabled on the settings tab (the launcher does not remember this setting, so I have to check it manually every time I launch the game). However, the latest ATI Catalyst (11.8) drivers seem to have some stability issues, so I reverted back to Catalyst 11.7 drivers."

""Does this new version overwrite RW 2 or is it a seperate install. If it is a new instal can I transfer my assets over .?""

You can choose to install into separate directory and install any expansions again in RW3. If you copy them over manually, make sure that you're not overwriting newer files included in RW3 with older RW2 files."

,europe85,2011-11-15T02:12Z,"Thanks for the upload. I have purchased the original RW3 game for â‚¬ 40,- but Already 2 months much problems with Steam (Steam is sucks!!!) I have only one account and one pc where i running the Steam app. In other words, If you buy fair games than it didn't work (or with very much problems) If i download here the ''illigal'' RW3 than it works 100% great. My opinion is, that Steam is the company thats not fair and illigal with they stupid DRM shit!. On this way peoples will use illigal stuff, and yes i support illigal software if the company's like Steam give only problems with peoples purchased software. For me is this illigal version not realy illigal because i have also purchased the original, but i say to everybody that want download RW3 from Skidrow, do it, because the makers of RW3 have choise for the worst company ever ''Steam'' and that is their own fault. I hope RW4 will come as a normal stand alone version again without that stupid Steam. Ow'ya, i have purchased the DVD (not a digital download) but that doen't matter, if you buy the DVD-ROM than it say that you need still Steam and it will download from Steam in more than 3HOUR, Yes it install not from the original DVD. On this way, F*ck all the legal software!!!!!

I was having an issue with the game crashing upon running it from the launcher. Tried changing all the possible settings options on the off chance it was configured improperly - didn't help.

What fixed it was:

Uninstalling - and deleting the original install directory file.

Reinstalling - At the end of the install check all of the additional game component options for installation. [directx, physx, ect]

Copying ONLY the following files to the game directory: LocalisedStrings.dll, RailWorks.exe, Skidrow.ini, **AND** Steamclient.dll

Don't copy steam_api.dll

Didn't need the update files to get it working. Thanks whoever the OP of that fix was.

I have downloaded MANY SKIDROW files and know how to properly transfer those files, but I have now downloaded this game twice and everytime I'm clicking the launcher button the screen goes dark like its starting to load, then goes directly back to the launcher screen... 

WHAT THE HELL DO I DO?!?!?!? This is really annoying cause I'm  trying to get this game for a buddy of mine who knows NOTHING about pirating hahah 

Any help is greatly appreciated! :-)"

What it means?"
,fima_007,2012-03-27T17:51Z,"OMFG what a bunch of buggy users here...

install guide:

1. mount the .iso in daemon tools
2. run setup file.
3. in the setup check all additional software, if u dont hawe then(but C++ is requaired for the game to launch)
4. copy contents of skidrow folder into game folder
5. run the game.
6.(optional) if u have problems both in te launcher or ingame, down and apply skidrow up 1&2(mentioned above), update drivers for you vga card(important!), do the system update(windows), if vista/7 is in place, run launcher with admin  privilegies(necessary!)(find it in propert. of shortcut, on the compatibility tab)
7. support game dev here: http://www.railsimulator.com/products.php"
,dauntlessk,2012-03-28T14:19Z,"Had a few problems to start but they were very easily fixed. D3dx9_43.dll was missing which a simple update / reinstall of directx fixes. I had another popup I think similar to that occured but the fix was just as easy / the same.

Then the program would run but then after the screen going blank, reverts back to the original screen closing the game without any error messages. The simple update of 1&2 fixes this. (See links before)

Now everything works like a charm. Very good torrent thanks!"
