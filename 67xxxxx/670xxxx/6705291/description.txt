On 2011s The Hunter, Mastodon abandoned the proggy, conceptual route taken on previous outings, choosing instead to mine the trailblazing, riff-heavy abandon of their 2004 masterpiece, Leviathan. Mastodons increasingly accessible sound may not land them a hit anytime soon, but cuts like Black Tongue, Curl of the Burl, and Balsteroid, all of which arrive in sequence at the front of the set, show a willingness to write within the parameters of 21st century pop musics dark side. Thats not to say that the band has pulled its head out of the vastness of space, as there are more than enough tracks here to satisfy fans who prefer the sludgy, drop-D epics of yore to the more organized roar of The Hunters front end.
