BetterZip lets you quickly inspect archives without first extracting their contents.

* Extract Only Files You Really Need: If you only need a few files or
  folders from a larger archive, you don't have to extract the whole thing.
  Simply drag the files you need from the BetterZip window to any Finder
  window or the desktop.

* Open Archives Without Extracting: Not only can BetterZip open
  archives without first extracting them but you can also search for a file
  using the iTunes-like interface. BetterZip can open and extract archives 
  with the most common formats: ZIP, SIT, TAR, XAR, GZip, BZip2,
  RAR, 7-Zip, CPIO, ARJ, LZH/LHA, JAR, WAR, CAB, ISO, CHM,
  RPM, DEB, NSIS, BIN, HQX.

* Create Archives: Simply drag files and folders from your hard drives, 
  disks, or network places into your new zip file. You no longer have to
  copy all the files into a temporary folder first. The supported formats are
  ZIP, TAR, GZip and BZip2 compressed TAR, XAR, 7-ZIP, and RAR
  (using the external RAR commandline tool). Large archives can also be
  split.

* Protect Your Data: BetterZip can protect your data with a password and
  create WinZip compatible AES-256 encrypted archives. 7-zip and rar
  archives can also be protected.

* Update Archives: Add new or updated files to existing archives.
  Remove any file or folder from an archive, or even move files around
  inside the archive as if it were a normal folder.

* Make Archives Compatible: Strip Mac specific files and resource forks
  from archives for best compatibility with systems like Windows or
  Linux.

What's New

New Features

* Using the service 'Extract with BetterZip' you can now extract all
  archives in a folder hierarchy.

* If files are selected in the archive window, presets now only extract 
  those instead of all files. Hold down Shift to extract all anyway.

* Enhanced 'replace existing files' dialog: it now allows to merge extracted
  items into existing folders, keep both versions or replace the existing
  version with the one from the archive.

Enhancements

* Enhanced accessibility.

* Improved SIT file handling.

* The favorites sidebar is now populated in the background and there is
  no longer a delay when starting BetterZip.

* Re-added 'Terminate after last window closed' option.

* Enabled the additional parameters field for tar archives.

* Holding down the option key now shows a save panel even for services
  or direct extraction.

* The location preset in the save panel is now by default next to original
 /archive.

Bug Fixes

* Fixed two bugs that could lead to a crash.

* BetterZip now uses the original encryption method when resaving an 
  archive, i.e., header encryption will be retained.

* Splitting 7z archives was off by a factor 1024.

* The Save toolbar button wasn't correctly initialized with the default
  preset.

* Cancelling archive creation through a service in the save panel no longer
  displays a confusing message.

* Moving or deleting the external rar program could lead to a crash when 
  saving with a preset with rar format.

* The progress bar no longer gets stuck when hiding BetterZip while
  extracting large archive.

* Extracting an archive via context menu while the same archive was open
  in BZ could crash BetterZip.

* Fixed a problem with extracting read-only folders in archives.
