This is for flashing your XBox360 dvd drive so you can play your backups. If your new to the Xbox360 Scene do some research and educate yourself online.

Most xbox360's are unique and the drives, often require special 'Things' or hardware to flash properly. Don't attempt to do anything unless you know what you
are doing.


Messing with some of this and not doing it right will either ban your xbox360
or brick your drive or console. You've been warned for the noobies.




Includes xbins to get you started as well.




Enjoy and Seed!!
