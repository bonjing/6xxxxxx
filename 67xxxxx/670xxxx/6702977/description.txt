Not much goes here because I am short on time for school in 10minutes. 
Anyways PS3 SDK KIT Leaked by some guy I forgot his name but yes correct 3.60. I downloaded all links off of BuC-ShoTz go thank him on NGU. I decided to make a torrent if it helps your guys download speed an they sdk is already in its parts of like 40 so all you need to do is extract it just by right click mouse and click extract here witch is recommended. The SDK still works on linux an windows I have no idea on mac but I hate it so figure it out mac users.


I go by I-Am-I or I-Am-Dev  OR ProDev just so you know me.
Also as I said go thank BuC for doing this:
