,Elliot678,2011-09-27T23:30Z,Why the fuck does everyone use shit websites like imageshack for screens. Use imgur.com FFS
,Elliot678,2011-09-27T23:38Z,"""Note: if you have a problem viewing the images while clicking the links , 
plz do copy the url links and paste them to ur browser instead,or sign up to imagshack,
or find the screenshots from my home site or other sites,or finally download a sample of the movie""

I have a crazy idea. Why not use imgur.com so no one has to sogn up for shit or piss about copying and pasting the links."

Dont waste ppl's time telling them the movie is bad, thats ur opinion. If ppl wanna watch it they will, positive/negative comments about overall file quality is appreciated though"
