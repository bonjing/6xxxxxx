In this course, we will create a large scale arch-viz project using V-Ray
We go from start to finish, modeling to final while learning the principales
of V-Ray along the way. Learning how to set up global illumination, creating
proxies and learning their benefits, V-Ray's material system and other
important aspects of V-Ray which in the end will give you the knowledge to
go and create your own realistic renders using V-Ray
