We're closing our doors
Stadtgruen won't come back
 
2 1/2 years have passed since Stadtgruen released it's 45th release. 2 1/2 years of nothing happening at all, of dead silence.
 
Like it's with many spare time non-profit projects, the lack of time forces us to stop our releases from rolling. When we realized we cannot manage to keep a certain pace at releasing new stuff, we decided to put things on hold and hibernate. 2 1/2 years. However, we now see that we're not going to leave this state anymore, as we moved on to new projects and also have a life to live.
 
We would like to apologize for dozens of demo tapes, some of them with promising new artists, left unanswered in our mailbox.
 
We would like to thank our artists for many remarkable releases, our supporters and fans for keeping us motivated, Jay for hosting our stuff and all people who helped Stadtgruen to become Stadtgruen.
 
Thank you.
