""So there were a few minor bumps with the launch, came out a few hours late, the launch build was actually an older beta build without achievements and minor music issues.. but we were able to update asap and patch the issues right away.""

""update notes:
-We are aware of a few bugs (wall bug, secret room bug, alt tab bug, etc) and are compiling an update for this weekend that should fix them.

-The Mac version of the game IS saving your achievements, but not rewarding them yet. Tommy is currently working on an app to fix this this week.. so dont worry mac people, all your achievements are there in your save and will be unlocked on steam once we patch the game!

-Anyone still not getting achievements on Pc after they have updated, delete your local content and redownload the game, it will fix any issues."""

THETA releases show up as false positives."
,Iksob,2011-10-01T09:51Z,How can I change resolution ?
,CWC,2011-10-01T12:27Z,"@Iksob In the game press Esc to pause and click options. You can set the window size and fullscreen res there, also toggle window/fullscreen mode.

It's worth setting up a PS3 or 360 controller (or whatever controller you have) with xpadder or joy2key.

Thanks alexisthebest!"
,Iksob,2011-10-01T13:27Z,"@CWC

Maxium resolution in this game is 1280x800 but game looks fine in fullscreen. My res is 1680x1050."

The notes also say that Theta are not responsible for modified releases, which yours is. So really, there's no way I am going to trust some asshole on the internet that something is virus free just because they say so."
[T],alexisthebest,2011-10-02T01:24Z,"@tristant

Why am i suddenly an asshole?
I'm just sharing a release. I've only repacked it so that it's not in a ton of rars, which people seem to hate.

I'm a trusted uploader because i upload clean stuff. I'm not gonna upload an infected files and get my Trusted status removed."

,jamescobler,2011-10-04T04:12Z,"kaspersky came up with a trojan, tried downloading all three of your releases same thing each time.
Shows up as Trojan.Win32.Chifrax.a"
,levmeister,2011-10-10T05:25Z,"Yeah, guys, that 'trojan' is what we call a false positive. It's not really a virus, just a part of the game that your virus protection thinks is a virus. Because virus protection is retarded.

Read up on it."
