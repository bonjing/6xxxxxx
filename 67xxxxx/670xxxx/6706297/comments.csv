,Lyxnman,2011-09-28T06:08Z,"This is the most under the radar award winning comic I've seen in a while, it's very good a must read for anyone who likes a good emotional story with some supernatural elements, government conspiracy and just a look at another place so different from the safety of nations who aren't plagued with such harsh problems."
,Lyxnman,2011-09-28T13:19Z,"how the fuck(not angry just like saying fuck) else do you describe the ""other"" Moses who knows perfectly what to do and it works also all those dreams and shit he keeps having also those flashes to other points in his life or a plane he obiviously. also then there's just the whole weird happenings every once in a while that can't be explained as just ""it happened to turn out like this"""
,wat1234,2011-09-28T14:45Z,"If you've ever read ""Armor"" by John Steakely, Moses's other persona is a lot like the Engine that takes over Felix and makes him an unstoppable force. Really, it's a survival persona that allows someone to get through extraordinary situations."
