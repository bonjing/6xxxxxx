Gundemonium Recollection
The first game in the Gundemonium trilogy, and tells a story of alchemy gone wrong in an alternate 18th century. Its galvanized and finely tuned side-scrolling bullet-hell shoot-'em-up gameplay sets it well above most other games in the genre. The game is deceptively simple from the outset, but has very well-thought-out gameplay mechanics. There are multiple playable characters, expertly crafted enemies and bullet patterns, a variable-difficulty "Phase Level" system, a risk-and-reward bullet "Friction" system, a "Demonic Shift" ability that's not for the faint of heart, and much more.

GundeadliGne
The second game in the Gundemonium trilogy, and continues the tale of humanity's war with hell brought on by alchemy. Its gameplay is a second extra-strength dosage of the kind of bullet-hell shoot-'em-up pandemonium found in Gundemonium Recollection, but with a dramatically game-altering "Flip Turn" ability. If you're tired of getting flanked in other shoot-'em-ups, now you can turn the tables and get your revenge. GundeadliGne also supports two-player cooperative play, so a friend can join the action and cover your six.

Hitogata Happa
The third game in the Gundemonium trilogy, but the events in its storyline take place before the previous games. It has chaotic bullet-hell shoot-'em-up gameplay similar to that of the first two games, but it's also wildly different. The action is now scrolling vertically, and you'll be taking control of an array of deadly self-destructive flying dolls. Each one has its own game-changing abilities. You'll have to decide which to use, when they'll fight on, and when it's time for them to make the ultimate crash-and-burn sacrifice.

â€¢ Sweet old-school retro anime-style art
â€¢ 8 playable characters, and 4 unlockable characters
