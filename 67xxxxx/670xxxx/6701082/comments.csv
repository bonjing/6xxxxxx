Thumbs.db is a mac extension, its the file for listing the contents of a folder as icons btw... only shows up when present on a windows machine..."
,dekalk,2011-09-25T23:38Z,looks good  thank you

,DTM4888,2011-09-27T01:38Z,perfectly acceptable for a cam thanks for the ul
,watbol,2011-09-27T11:37Z,"Uh, windows has been using thumbs.bd since
Mellenium edition. It might be present in Win98SE, I don't remember that far back.
But from what I've experianced,
It's a database of the thumbnails of the photos in a folder when in VIEW as ->Thunbnails.
If you don't set the view as thumbnails, it
usually doesn't create a .db file.
Also, I have an imac and Like you said...
I never seen it there. As for the movie A/V,
I'll Be Back! :)~

,watbol,2011-09-27T12:14Z,"The sample is out of synch...
mouths move .25sec before it's heard.
Movie is properly matched.
There's an abrupt cut in the movie at 21:12,
I don't know how much is missing,
But you can tell something is missing.
A lot of sceens have a 'rainbow' effect coloring,
this is not seen as bad in the ViSUALiSE version.
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6701568/Killer_Elite_2011_TS_XviD_-_ViSUALiSE
Although both have the cutout at 21:12.
It's still watchable! All in all...
Very Good, Nice 16:9-WideScreen movie.
Keep up the Good WerkÂ¡!

,money_miguel,2011-09-27T20:28Z,"look this is a great movie quit bitchin about samples and quality. you sound like a bunch of spoiled children.

,The.Norse.Crown,2011-09-29T07:17Z,"Decent cam. A 700MB file would be more worthy of the bandwidth, but this is the only copy out so what can you do? Good UL Ultratorrents. You have cornered the market on mediocrity...  A\V 6.5\5"

,oldcarman,2011-10-02T18:31Z,"audio slips a little, little flicker on video, but otherwise a very good cam job, very watchable...although I thought the movie was a little lacking...."
,av5498,2011-10-11T21:27Z,@watbol Your lack of a spell check on your machine leads me to believe that you are still in fact using Windows Millennium Edition. So I will regard your comment about improper synch as rubbish. Good day.  
,nautica002,2011-10-14T04:58Z,"downloads quick,video sample is 8 overall.its a cam,no blueray. still downloading movie. and sample is NOT out of sync as watbol said"
,ice1505,2011-10-14T21:06Z,""" mickel007 ""... 

maybe mac also creates a thumbs.db, i dont really know... 

But thumbs.db is also created by windows as a hidden system file, and the file caches a thumbnail version of the pictures in the folder, making it quicker to view the thumbnail images each time the folder is opened,,,...
