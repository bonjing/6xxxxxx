,michaelrwatson,2011-09-29T18:10Z,"Quality is decent. I've seen complaints about the sync and ""rainbow"" effect in video details... yah, well, it ain't a DVD rip. It's a very watchable TS/cam with minor flicker. The rainbow effect & pixelation may be an artifact of flicker removal filters. It's like watching an old TV screen.

But again, PLEASE create MP4 not MKV. Thx./ "
