,researcher70,2011-10-07T16:44Z,I'm running Win 7 32 bit. Anyone know why the program appears to keep a copy of the file somewhere on the hard drive even when you delete the split file? The HD seems to increase in size after the split (even after deleting the file).

Program did not show the video from the .avi file I worked with. It did play the audio only. That is probably a codec problem on my PC. 

Otherwise, it is a Good Torrent and I Thank You ChattChitto for another job well done!"
