,akicita,2011-10-22T05:45Z,"Files: no problem, what can go wrong with six mp3s? 

But be aware that these files have NOT been tagged with iTunes/media data yet, so there's no attribution for artist (author), album, etc. As a result, the files are only identified as ""Part 1, Part 2, Part 3"", etc. In a iPod/smartphone, they don't show up in your queue unless you look for files by song title (don't look for ""Richard Dawkins"" or even ""unknown artist""--they're not there), and then scroll to ""P"" to find them. So I'd suggest personalizing the files with tags when you add to your mp3 player in iTunes (or whatever), and THEN playing them. I wish the seeder has opted to so this, but it's not a big deal. "

,commentor837,2011-12-14T02:14Z,"Magic? Hardly.

If you've got a grade 10 education, nothing in this audiobook should be new to you. It had me fast-forwarding through most of it because there was hardly anything to learn from it. Ironically, the non-science in the book, that is the creation stories and myths, were the most interesting parts. 

Take note that this is ""...a science book aimed primarily at children and young adults"". "
,derpfft,2012-04-21T22:14Z,"commentor837, you know this is a book for children, right? dawkins said this book is for twelve year olds and older. 
but the way dawkins explains things is far superior to the ways i was taught them in school. this should supplement every student's science book. "
,dubblue4,2012-05-22T16:18Z,excellent. thanks.
