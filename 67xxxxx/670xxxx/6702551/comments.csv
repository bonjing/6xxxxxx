,NostalgiaOldTimes,2011-10-07T15:03Z,"Please someone help me!How can i delete my pirate bay account?How can i delete my torrents uploaded?Is this correct?:The standard procedure to remove Pirate Bay accounts is to post at Suprbay,the forum for Pirate Bay. 
At the time of writing,a user's account was deleted as recently as 17 hours ago,so it seems that you can request admins to delete your Pirate Bay account by posting at Supr Bay.Go to this forum and post a new thread with the topic''Please delete my TPB account'' or something similar.However,if you are too late, this may not help,the site sale was announced today morning(June 30),so you may not be able to delete your account."
