 Since her dense, varied, post-modernist eponymous second album illustrated that 
 Sheryl Crow was no one-album wonder, she wasn't left with as much to prove the third  time around. Having created an original variation on roots rock with Sheryl Crow, she was left with the dilemma of how to remain loyal to that sound without repeating herself on her third album, The Globe Sessions. To her credit, she never plays lazy,  not when she's turning out Stones-y rockers ("There Goes the Neighborhood") or when  she's covering Dylan (the remarkable "Mississippi," an outtake from Time Out of  Mind). However, she has decided to abandon the layered, yard-sale production and  pop-culture fixations that made Sheryl Crow a defining album of the mid-'90s. The  Globe Sessions, instead, is the work of a craftsman, one who knows how to balance  introspective songs with pop/rockers, one who knows how to exploit their signature  sound while becoming slightly more eclectic. In that sense, the album is a lot like a  latter-day album from her idols, the Stones -- it finds pleasures within the craft and the signature sound themselves. That means that there are no surprises (apart from the synthesized handclaps, of course) -- the Celtic homage "Riverwide" may be  new, but it's not unexpected, much like how the whiplash transition in "Am I Getting  Through" isn't entirely out of the blue -- but that's not necessarily a bad thing,  since The Globe Sessions has a strong set of songs. Since it lacks the varied sonics,
 humor, and flat-out weirdness of Sheryl Crow, it's never quite as compelling a listen as its predecessor, yet it is a strong record, again confirming Crow's position as  one of the best roots-rockers of the '90s. -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine
