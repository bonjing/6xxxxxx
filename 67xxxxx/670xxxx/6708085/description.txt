Movie - Drama / Sci-fi

THE COMING DAYS is the story of an upper-middle-class Berlin family on their personal journey from the present into a near future, a journey into a time of uncertainty and major changes. Due to a rare antibody reaction, Laura Kuper has to choose between her desire to have children and Hans the love of her life. Her sister Cecilia is driven into the abyss of a newly emerging terrorist movement by her unrequited love to Konstantin. And then there is Philip, the youngest child of the family, pulled into a hopeless war for Germany, over the few remaining oilfields of Asia.

A destabilized family tackles a destabilized world, entering their future with all their hopes and fears. Essentially, a family drama set to the backdrop of world collapse.
