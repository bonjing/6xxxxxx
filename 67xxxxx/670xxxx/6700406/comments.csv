,curly1015,2011-09-25T16:23Z,What is this game???
,Phuque2,2011-09-26T01:28Z,"curly1015 who cares what it is. I never trust anonymous uploaders with useless descriptions. Screenshot looks like shite too. 1.6 gb for a black and white game, fuck that!"
,tahl112,2011-09-26T03:34Z,"It's an indie game project which acts as a sequel to a fantastic game from 2005 called Lugaru.
I'll save the description for your own research as it sounds a little left of field but I assure you that both Lugaru and it's upcoming sequel Overgrowth are fantastic games.

This torrent is the 149th weekly alpha build which is distributed to those who have preordered such as myself.
I'm not entirely sure why someone would upload such a torrent but nonetheless feel free to have a try and visit it's website to learn more and get behind these great developers."

,MThird,2011-09-26T05:54Z,":D Just realized ""By request of MThird ;)"" You are a great guy/girl! And it's legit!"
,MThird,2011-09-27T09:50Z,How do I make it full screen? I know you have to change the config but this cracked version doesn't exactly have a config.
,bl00tack,2011-09-30T08:57Z,"It's not cracked, it just doesn't have any security :P

IDK about Mac, but on Windows it's in (Username)/My Documents/Wolfire, or somehing along those lines."
,TAStorey,2011-10-07T09:47Z,"I waited 2 days for this to download. An when it finished I was left with a zip file that no program could unzip. What the hell. So if anyone has any ideas, please email me at tastorey@hotmail.com. Thanks"
