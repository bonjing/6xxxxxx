,kingywex23,2011-10-04T06:10Z,"Can someone who speaks Persian or Turkish please correct this?

It is mostly English with a few Turkish words that could not be translated.

,FinnMac69,2011-10-07T21:29Z,The goo link above actually works to get English subs as there are only Turkish ones available on all the other sub sites. The subs are not the best but you will get the drift of what they are saying. Good insight into life in Iran.

,Sumalia,2011-10-10T11:27Z,"The provided subtitles are machine translated so keep in mind that they make no sense.I started watching so I will finish the film with those subs,but my advice for others is to wait for real subtitles."
