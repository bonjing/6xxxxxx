,Gh057man,2011-09-28T14:58Z,No worries. Can only seed during waking hours.
,Phntzm79,2011-10-23T19:55Z,"Hey idiot, for you to complain about one bad song in my torrent is really funny considering this shit that you have uploaded and no one wants to download!Poor Baby! I feel your Pain! My Torrent is still rocketing higher! What a pussy!Australian fag!"
,Gh057man,2011-10-27T04:19Z,Oh ... Hi again Orgzm79. Wow. I didn't know this was a competition. Your pecker must be really really REALLY small to be concerned about this. You poor guy. :)
,Phntzm79,2011-12-04T15:13Z,"You wish Biaaaatch! I'm sorry to put you in your place, but what have you contributed to the world? You have not made even the smallest effort! You should be very ashamed! It's not a competition, but at least I made an effort to share and put in many hours of effort. What have you done? Shit on other people's work! A fine Legacy!"
,Phntzm79,2011-12-04T15:27Z,Your nest is already full of shit and empty of any meaning! Time to make Birds nest soup or burn this fucker down! Peace! Phantazm79.Sheepish Grin! The Horror! The Horror! 
,Phntzm79,2011-12-04T15:42Z,"If you check out my latest Lana Del Rey Discography torrent, you will be happy to notice that a perfect, high quality, no glitches version of the song you wanted is there! What I think you fail to understand, is that when you shit on someone's work, you damage the whole torrent world and shit can your reputation at the same time! This whole thing is a work in progress! Yes? Phantazm79."
,Phntzm79,2011-12-04T16:46Z,"Poor torrent etiquette? what is that? I can take a lot of bullshit, but not from an insignificant person who's only contribution to the torrent world is one robot TV show and a shit movie that nobody has downloaded!Stop the Horror, The Horror! "
,Phntzm79,2011-12-06T14:50Z,"Resistance is futile, You will be assimilated! Surrender to the superior being!"
,Phntzm79,2011-12-24T18:21Z,"Gh057man, I uploaded a Christmas present for you in my Lana Del Rey torrents!Phantazm79 "
,Phntzm79,2011-12-26T00:12Z,"Gh057man, you are a special case so I must consider what I learned from a very eminent professor in medical school, he said, ""Never argue with crazy people as it will prove to only antagonize the damaged mind""! Your assertions are again incorrect! You aren't Bugs Bunny but you wish you were, as for my contributions to the torrent community, they are small in scope but superior to yours. As for the time to convert to FLAC, if you think it shouldn't take that long, then why don't you do it and contribute to the torrent world instead of just complaining? And the final comment, UNIX based operating systems are superior for many reasons, stability, lack of viruses, Trojan horses, worms and other dos Windows crap. The main reason for not converting everything to FLAC is that the end result would be files 3-4X bigger than VBR LAME Mp3 and most people don't care about Lossless Audio codecs [FLAC, ALAC, OGG FLAC which are mainly PC (bound) only and FLAC/OGG hybrid portable media players are still a minority. For now, VBR LAME MP3 is the best choice! Phantazm79 "
,Phntzm79,2011-12-26T00:28Z,Why do you still only have 2 uploaded torrents? I have been working to improve my torrents and many people continue to download from me. Why has you contribution been so small but your complaints so numerous? You can do better! The torrent world is built on work not complaining about others work! Isn't that true? Phantazm79 
,Phntzm79,2011-12-26T02:27Z,"Gh057fag, if my torrents are so half-arsed as you say, then why do many people continue to download my torrents? Why are my L.D.R. torrents all over the internet? Your torrents are dead and never even lived! This is the harsh reality!

,Phntzm79,2011-12-26T02:29Z,"The evidence is clear, your contribution to the torrent world is not impressive by any standard! All you are capable of is bitching and complaining like a little girl about wanting better quality fucking FLAC files, file glitches in one song etc. You are a waste of carbon atoms and we can all hope that your DNA will not be propagated on this earth to infect the planet with more bitches! If you really are Bugs Bunny, then it's hunting season! Phantazm79 "
