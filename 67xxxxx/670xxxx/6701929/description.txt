A man wakes up in a barren vault, alone and without any recollection of how or when he ended up in his new, unfamiliar surroundings. With only a flickering fluorescent light and a locked steel cabinet, he struggles to come to grips with the dangers that now threaten his life. He faces starvation and madness as no one hears his screams and pleas for release. Cunning, ingenuity and hidden clues are his only chance for survival, his only chance to escape the Iron Doors.
