In love with Nemo, Bombay-based Ashok Kumar    
goes to meet his Nairobi-based prospective     
father-in-law, Jamnadas (Murad). Upon entry    
into the hotel room, he finds his dead body,   
and fearing an arrest, flees, makes himself    
invisible, and with the help of his wealthy    
friend, Murli (Agha), re-locates to Rangoon,   
Burma. Once there, he hopes to unravel the     
killer(s) identity - as well as meet with his  
girlfriend's sister, Ragini. Little does he    
know that soon he will not only be taken into  
custody by a Private Detective, Ramesh and     
Inspector Kundan, but also be blamed for Nemo's
sudden death.
