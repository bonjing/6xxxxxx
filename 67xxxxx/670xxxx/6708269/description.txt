Reviews'It is London 1900 and Sherlock Holmes finds himself investigating a string of murders that have one common thread - each of them recalls one of his famous earlier cases and each of them implicate him. Has that great mind finally cracked - Watson wonders - and how is all this connected to Britain's latest secret weapon and the doings of the enigmatic Graf von Bork and the mysterious Society for Anglo-German Solidarity ?'

This is the third in Barry Day's Sherlock Holmes 'Murder' series and,much as I enjoyed the others,this is his best to date. The basic premise is an ingenious one and the author cleverly interweaves his tale with the actual history of the period.
