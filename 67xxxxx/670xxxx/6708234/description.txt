Publisher's Summary
Tall, gangling schoolmaster Ichabod Crane, both educated and highly superstitious, comes to live and teach in the quiet, rural town known as Sleepy Hollow in the Catskill Mountains of New York. There, he falls in love with the daughter of wealthy farmer Van Tassel. But he must compete with the much admired, waggish ruffian Brom Bones, whom he encounters - with absolute terror and belief - in the guise of the much storied and feared specter... The Headless Horseman.

A great piece of literature that was first introduced to me a young child, this story certainly withstands the test of time. I loved it back then as a short story and still enjoy it now as a much older adult... No doubt it, this story has been around for years and will remain to be around for years to come. As for the narration, this narrator does a great job and his graspy voice is perfect for this ghostly reading.
