,antinames,2011-11-26T17:04Z,"Thanks for the torrent. While pretty good over all, there is distortion on Track 7, I Drive, even at very low volumes. Listen to 1:32 onward to understand what I am talking about. I wish I could offer the technical expertise to fix it, but if there is some way this effect can be counteracted through Equalisation or what not, please let me know."
