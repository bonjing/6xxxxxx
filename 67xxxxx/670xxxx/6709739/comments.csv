,LeiyaKerrigan,2011-09-29T15:54Z,It's perfect. Just copy the files into your data file. Enable them and you're ready to go. Just visit the Gun Runner shop and it should be there!
,CaptainPicard,2011-09-29T16:03Z,"I would appreciate you so-called pirates who have downloaded this to help seed it.

This has been up for about 30 minutes and over 100 have downloaded it, yet I don't see a single one of you seeding what you got.

Should no one else help to seed this then I'll simply pull it and you can take the heat for the torrent being pulled."
,amancebado,2011-09-29T16:08Z,Works fine. Thank you very much.
,caoquemordeuhomem,2011-09-29T16:33Z,Is this the english version?
,maumau82,2011-09-29T16:45Z,Thank you
,_AssMan_,2011-09-29T17:07Z,Finally - why did this arrive 2 days late?
,XtraZoom,2011-09-29T17:58Z,English version? I previously dled a copy elsewhere turns out to be german I think.
,trapt2821,2011-09-29T19:36Z,"THANKS!!!

So I've only had a chance to check out Chet in Goodsprings store; do all of the Gun Runner's new stuff have (GRA) at the end of it? That's a good thing and a bad thing: 1) Good because you'll know it's a new gun part of the DLC  immediately and 2) it gets kinda old to keep seeing that on certain weapons. I wish they would have given then all unique names.

But thanks for sharing :)"
,XtraZoom,2011-09-29T19:40Z,Well seems to be English version.
,CaptainPicard,2011-09-29T20:35Z,"My error in not mentioning it above.  This is the ENGLISH version and only the Gun Runners DLC since, like mentioned above, I figure everyone already has the Courier Stash."
,Rawlings44,2011-09-29T21:33Z,"Thanks, was waiting for this pack before starting Lonesome Road."

,Archmaster0,2011-09-30T22:41Z,Thanks very much!  I'll help seed when I can.
,Vendroth,2011-10-01T02:33Z,"I don't know why, but the GRA pack won't show up when I play the game, but it is in the data file, and I checked it on the launcher. Please help."
,Vendroth,2011-10-01T02:40Z,"Thanks for putting this up, but when I extract this to my data file and check it on the laucnher, it own't work. Help please."
,yyywww111,2011-10-01T22:21Z,Thanks
,CaptainPicard,2011-10-01T23:02Z,"For those who think it isn't working, it does not auto give you the guns.  You have to go talk to one of the merchants, especially the Gun Runners, to get the weapons.

And let me forewarn all of you, the guns are EXPENSIVE!."
,craftghost,2011-10-03T08:13Z,Thanks 
,spikeisd34d,2011-10-05T00:40Z,"I've downloaded the files, moved them into the data folder - just like EVERY other dlc or mod, and it won't work. I've gone to all the different NPC's that should sell the weapons, gone to unique weapon locations, ect, and it won't show up.

I also started a new game, finished Goodsprings, and ran up to New Vegas and Vendortron didn't sell any of them.

Secondly, for some reason when I exit the game, and check in Data Files in the launcher, the Gun Runners' data is no longer checked. I check it, start the game, exit, and when loading the launcher it is no longer checked.

The only other file that has done this way for me was the level cap raiser, which would uncheck itself and never worked.

Please help! Do I need to rename something? Is there a new update I need?"
,6H6P6,2011-10-06T21:37Z,"All my hoarding of caps finally paid off. Interesting guns and attachments, but Bethesda should have released this with HH and OWB. Overall great DLC and torrent, thanks."
,dreamchaser89,2011-10-11T21:45Z,"Can someone seed a little please? I will seed if you don't want to do it, but i need to get it first. If anyone can do it i will appreciate :)

Thanks in advance!"
,Kneezus,2011-10-13T05:41Z,"Awesome torrent, works great, I'll seed for 3 weeks, by then everyone should have this....at least everyone who really wants it."
,dreamchaser89,2011-10-20T14:50Z,"@Kneezus, are you still seeding? I had the computer on all the day and didn't download anything.

If someone read this, can seed a little, please? I will upload, i promise, but i need to get the file first, if someone could help i will be grateful :)"
,CrazyMatt92,2011-10-23T14:21Z,Does this work with SkidRow?
,Mally205,2011-10-26T19:00Z,Didnt work with mine :( ...... is there anything else one should do after copying the files and enabling them in the launcher?Coz the 'downloadable content' menu ingame doesnt display this pack.
