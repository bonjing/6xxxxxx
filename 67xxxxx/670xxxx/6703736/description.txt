From the Infowars web site ::

Alex talks in-studio with Tad Lumpkin, director of The American Dream, a 30 minute animated film by Lumpkin and Harold Uhl that reveals how the banksters have rigged the financial system. Lumpkin is an 11-year veteran of the entertainment business working both on the executive side and the creative side of film making. 

Alex also runs down the latest breaking news and covers the unraveling of the Perry campaign, Ron Paul's chance at taking the GOP nomination, and the continued implosion of the economy in Europe and the United States.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
 
 !! please try some of the other shows I upload too !!
