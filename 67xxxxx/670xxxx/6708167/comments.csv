,nflfan,2011-09-29T20:10Z,"Before downloading this torrent, bear in mind these are rar files, so you may not want to go through the hassle of uncompressing and/or converting them."
,leonidas_led_300,2011-09-29T22:56Z,"Yes, they're RARs, but all you have to do is unpack them. Nothing complicated about that.
No conversion required as long as you can play .MKV files, which I think almost everyone can. .MKV has been the standard for high-def video for, what? Like 3 years now. Quit your whinging.

@nflfan - wow, way to complain about something that's free, and after somebody took the time and effort to capture this, encode it, and upload it here, in high definition format no less. If you don't want it, then don't download it. But many of us are grateful to have a source for games like this -- judging by how there are over 110 folks uploading and downloading this at the moment."
,dazman242,2011-09-29T22:56Z,Anyone have the Week 3 Bucs Atlanta game??
,dazman242,2011-09-29T22:57Z,"Anyone have the Week 3 Bucs Atlanta game??

Go Bucs!!  Always blacked out here..WTF!!"
,dani00cl,2011-09-30T03:20Z,"I just watched the game. The quality is quite good, minor flaws, specially at comercial breakes.

I'm not the encoder, i just found it somewhere else and uploaded it here for my fellow cowboys fans.
I'll be watching the scene for the next sunday Cowboys-Lyons game and I'll try to upload it ASAP.

HOW'BOUT THEM COWBOYS?!"
,nflfan,2011-09-30T08:49Z,"@leonidas_led_300

In future I suggest you read and understand other's comments before jumping in. Personally rars are no great hassle for me but may be for some, hence my  comments, and far from whinging, I was the first to thank dani00cl for this game.

In short, engage brain before passing comment."
,dani00cl,2011-09-30T13:49Z,"This was my first upload to the piratebay. When I download stuff it's almost always compressed in rar files, i didn't thing it was so complicated. But from now on i'll try to upload the video uncompressed, it's not a problem.
Anyways, you cannot compress videos too much."
,nflfan,2011-09-30T15:55Z,"Let me say thanks again dani00cl for your first torrent. Well done! I didn't think I'd seen your name before, and obviously any NFL games are really appreciated here, especially at the moment when other regular uploaders are having problems.

All I was trying to say was that some people not used to extracting RARs might think the process of finding, installing and utilising a suitable program for the job (7-Zip seems to be a good free one) rather a lot of hassle.

Anyway, thanks again and I look forward to your upcoming games."
