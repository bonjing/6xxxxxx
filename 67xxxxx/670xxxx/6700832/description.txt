Review
"The publication of McKeown's Classical Latin is very exciting. It is going to be fun to teach from! It is thorough yet not pedantic; it covers all the important material in a logical fashion, and it does not have the silliness that is found in some elementary Latin texts. I am planning to adopt it for Elementary Latin (a year course, in which I think McKeown will fit very nicely) the next time I teach the class. It will be a great improvement over the text I have used for years and years." --Jane Crawford, Professor of Classics, University of Virginia

"McKeown's Classical Latin is lucidly written, succinct, intelligent, and accessible. The traditional presentation is complemented by active language acquisition strategies and will appeal to all kinds of language learners. The length of the book and the length of each chapter are manageable and in a classroom setting could be adapted to a two-semester course or a six-week intensive course with equal success. It could also serve the self-learner and the home school market." --Cynthia White, Associate Professor of Classics, The University of Arizona

"Classical Latin will allow us to benefit from McKeown's wealth of experience and his earned wisdom about teaching Latin. The wide range of materials and exercises not only are targeted for different learning tasks, but also will complement a variety of teaching styles. The engaging, relevant, and copious cultural content and the online study tools are a welcome addition." --Peter J. Anderson, Assistant Professor of Classics, Grand Valley State University
