EDDIE CLEANHEAD VINSON and ROOMFUL OF BLUES
CD Released: March 16, 1994
Original Release Date: Jan 27, 1982
Label: Muse Records
Format: Flac

If there were justice in the world, Eddie "Cleanhead" Vinson would have been able to tour with this type of group throughout much of his career. Roomful of Blues, a popular five-horn nonet, has rarely sounded more exciting than on this musical meeting with the legendary singer/altoist. Vinson himself is exuberant on some of the selections, particularly "House of Joy," one of five instrumentals among the eight selections. Whether one calls it blues, bebop, or early R&B, this accessible music is very enjoyable and deserves to be more widely heard.  Scott Yanow, All Music Guide
