,Joesmith88,2011-09-27T22:34Z,"Hey, I would just like to tahnk you for taking the time to upload the videos of TOWIE, I know it takes time and I'm just saying cheers :)

I've been meaning to record all the 7 Episodes of ""Don't Shuttup!"" off the website before they get taken down but my DVDRecorder has busted! is there any chance you could get these up? I'm sure lots of other fans would be very very greatful!! also theres a DVD called Essexercise coming out 31/10/11 :D , I'm trying really really hard to find the series 1 promo aswell.. seems quite rare. not the pilot, the original tv spot before series 1 came on. sorry for all the questions. Joe"
,GaryBradbury,2011-09-28T00:46Z,"Joe, you have stumped me!! I cannot watch those episodes because I don't live in the UK! If you or anyone else goes to the link below and plays it. After it is fully downloaded, go to your ""Temporary Internet Files"" folder and copy it and paste it in ""My Documents"". It will be an flv file, but you can play that with VLC Media player. http://www.itv.com/channels/itv2/itv2shows/theonlywayisessex/tags/dont-shuttup/

I have not found that promo you are after, but the Essexercise DVD shouldn't be hard to get once it comes out. Sorry I couldn't help :("
,Wellsj,2011-09-29T11:47Z,Cheers mate!!
,GaryBradbury,2011-09-29T12:07Z,"I was mistaken. The new TOWIE is out on the 1st of October (UK Time). I will post it as soon as I find it!!! Sorry guys, gotta wait a couple more days :(
PS- Thanks to everyone seeding :) "
,missfj20,2011-09-30T01:33Z,"Thanks for such a great job! I love TOWIE! 

s03e02 aired on Wed 28 Sept in the UK if this helps... confusing as it is on twice a week :)"
,GaryBradbury,2011-09-30T04:58Z,"Thanks! I thought it was showing on the 28th!! Anyway, as a present to you, I have uploaded it now!!!"
