you need to use theme chooser to apply the theme, if you don't have theme chooser you can get it from one of my other torrents

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6707807/Android_Stock_Apps_2.3.5

it's called themechooser.apk"
,chop007,2012-01-21T20:13Z,"Then why did you not call it CM7 THEME CHOOSER THEMES. What is wrong with you? An ADW Launcher  theme is completely different from cm7 theme chooser theme/ t-mobile theme chooser themes. Please use your brain and don't waste peoples time. I mean really bro, common man!!!!! "
