,ogkush815,2011-09-26T00:09Z,"its working ofcourse. for those who have save problems. finish the game from the start until the end of chapter 2. your game will be save even if you exit. just click the ""campaign"" button at the main screen when you've launched the game again then pick the last chapter that you completed."
