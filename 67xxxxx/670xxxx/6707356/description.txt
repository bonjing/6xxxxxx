Plot: Wannabe rock star Goldi lands in a house of three musicians, one too hot, one too cold, and a third who seems just right. They let her sing with their band, and she romances them one at a time, thinking sheâ€™s found her new home. But when she unleashes her own songs on the guys, they cut her out of their scene, forcing her to discover that real success means becoming your own rock and roll hero.
