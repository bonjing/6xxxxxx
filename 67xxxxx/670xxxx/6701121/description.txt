Bruno Merz - Departing From Crowds (EP)(2009) + Collected & Recorded Bonus Tracks & HQ Video Promos)(Indie Folk Rock)(MP3@320)




Most of these songs are recorded from a variety of website streams and I have tried to offer both the album as the EP. However, there is not much info and downloads available for this artist, so 2 songs are missing from his 2008 album. Otherwise, all songs are there in great quality.
This really is an Inde FOlk gem, so I'd say, give it a try!

And in case anyone could offer his music in cd rip (preferably flac), please upload it here or PM me!
Thanks & enjoy!!

Reviews:


â€œThis 5 tracker comes from the breathy school of Colin Blunstone / Nick Drake but with some great pop sensibility. Strong vocals are not the only thing drawing me towards this, the music itself hits the spot and augments the great lyrics and vocals. One to watch out for...â€
Jumbo Records - Jumbo Records Review


â€œThis new ghostly folk music has shed the old skin of protest songs didactic diatribes. This is painfully personal, earnest music, that balances intensity and tension with quiet understatement and whispery vocals.â€
CD Baby editors. - CD Baby


â€œThe CD Baby editorial staff hears hundreds of albums every day and we love this album so much we're going to include it in our upcoming Haunting, Fractured Folk Pop collection. â€

â€œWow - love it! Great for relaxing or working! Heard Nine Sixteen while studying at Starbucks. Bought the album right away. It's magical. â€
Jse75 - iTunes reviews


â€œHis voice blends perfectly with his melodies in the most appropriate way. His melodies are intricate to the point where you can tell that time and soul was involved and yet a balance is accomplished so that the music doesn't distract the listener. Most definitely worth the asking price!â€
IndieEar - iTunes reviews


â€œThis is laying down by a quiet river, next to the person you love, reading a book and eating a peach either early spring or a southern autumn (you decide) sort of album... listen to it, you'll know what I mean. It is beautiful to say the least. I am a new fan of Bruno Merzâ€
