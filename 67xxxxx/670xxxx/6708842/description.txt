+ Interview with The Vibrators on December 2004.

The first ever DVD to feature one of Punkâ€™s most enduring success stories, The Vibrators, â€œ1976-2004â€ is a definitive history of the band, packed with live performances and promo features. Amongst the tracks featured are â€œAutomatic Loverâ€ (a UK chart top 40 hit in 1976) and â€œDisco In Moscoâ€ (an independent chart top ten hit in 1982). The band formed in 1976, and early shows saw them supporting The Stranglers, Iggy Pop and The Sex Pistols at the infamous 100 Club Festival Of Punk. They soon signed to Epic Records and their first album â€œPure Maniaâ€ spent five weeks in the UK top 75. After several albums and line-up changes, the original line-up reformed in 1982 and signed for Cherry Red label Anagram Records. Although the line-up and labels have changed over the years, the attitude and dedication that the Vibrators bring to their craft has never waned. The current line-up of the band has just completed yet another world tour playing to their ever loyal fanbase. Also included in this package are three tracks taken from the bands most recent world tour â€“ the first time their new line-up has been filmed together â€“ and a brilliantly entertaining interview with founder members Eddie and Knox.
