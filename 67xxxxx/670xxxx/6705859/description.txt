  Wigan coach Michael Maguire insists that the 'double' is still on     
  despite their 26-18 play-off loss to St Helens.                       
                                                                        
  The Challenge Cup winners must now take on in-form Catalan Dragons    
  in this Sunday's preliminary semi-final.                              
                                                                        
  If they get through that, just like last year, Wigan will have to     
  play successive weekends to reach the Grand Final at Old Trafford on  
  8 October.
