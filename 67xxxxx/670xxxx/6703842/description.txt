Renowned news anchor Tom Brokaw once said, "If fishing is like religion, then fly fishing is high church." Fly fishing worshippers seeking a new "bible" will benefit greatly from the wealth of information found in "Fly Fishing: the Lifetime Sport, a comprehensive yet highly readable reference tool for fly fishermen of any skill level. With 8 1/2" x 11" full glossy pages, this book is well organized and visually appealing, with color photographs and illustrations on virtually every page.

For the novice, fly fishing can appear to be an intimidating sport that requires expensive eqipment, flawless technique, and intrinsic sportmanship. The sport, however, has been broken down in easy-to understand, bite-size sections, beginning with such basics as choosing the right tackle, an introduction to flies, casting essentials, and practice methods. The casting chapter includes dozens of visual examples of proper techniques.

The book's writing style is simple and straightforward and the inclusion of personal fishing stories gives the book added authenticity. Later chapters cover topics such as stream and still water characteristics, aquatic environment, wading, and angler etiquette. A meticulously illustrated section on knots takes the mystery out of this essential skill. Plenty of information is also offered for the intermediate to advanced fly fisherman, who will find his book a highly useful resource.
