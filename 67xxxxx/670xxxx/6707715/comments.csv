[T],n2kmaster,2011-11-15T17:00Z,"I'm trying, im getting a lot of eastern canada hit and runs. This event is part of a HUGE investigation into this federations fraud, so i wouldnt expect to see this federation around. And this is a stationary camera thru the whole event. I know stuff like this NEVER hits Pirate Bay unless its a  cam rip for a movie. This is a live camera inside the arena they expected to rip a worker off. I was supposed to be the ring announcer for this event (it was a lie to get me there) they covered no travel for me Hoss and Zero, none of us got paid, and it still came here cuz im loyal to pirate bay and only pirate bay. in the great words of Tosh....... ""FIRST!"""
[T],n2kmaster,2011-12-08T03:41Z,"And to all the sellout forums like c4wrestling who post the initial story about this, beg for the story to be told then get bought off by CWI to hide the true story about him ripping off eastern canada. I DARE YOU COME HERE SELL OUTS AND TRY AND DISCREDIT ME! You're little backyard e-fed forum sites are nothing compared to the sheer power of the pirate. So take your little forums and stuff em up your ass, all copies of this online ARE STAYING ONLINE!"
