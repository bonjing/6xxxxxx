Reason why this went up: The promoters super crooked, scammed a bunch of people in my area bringing the event here, asked for money cuz i worked the entire shows cameras, no answer, no reply, no more bs from that fat b******d. Here's the read up on what he pulled here:

He's been wanted for fraud before in 2000 another lovely write up on him is here http://www.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBiosW/wyman_01sep28-can.html

Before you start freaking on quality etc, this is a stationary camera that was supposed to get cleaned up however not getting any money for working out of that fat loser doesn't really motivate me to do the whole video editing thing with it. And since he couldn't say a word to me for over a month, he loses the footage to Pirate Bay. Few of the other unknown feds ive uploaded have done really well here so heres another slice of the indy pie.
