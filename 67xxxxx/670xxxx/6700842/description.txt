This was a Spanish/ Mexican co-production that was filmed in Panama and Columbia in 1971, and released theatrically that same year in Spain under the title "SECRET MISSION IN THE CARIBBEAN". The film was only released theatrically in Mexico in 1976, and when it finally turned up there, it had been retitled "MYSTERY OF THE BLACK PEARL" for some reason. It was later sold on video as "SANTO IN THE CARIBBEAN CONNECTION".
