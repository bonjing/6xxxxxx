Comes from my personal collection.
old group but still nice to listening for sure.
Pyromania is probably the best album from them.
most of tracks are really pleasant to listening.
Anthology album and a must have anyway for any fan of them.

Excellent album and Worth a download anyway.

converted to mp3 cbr-stereo 256 kbps-44 khz with original and crc error protection both enabled in high quality.
result : excellent without error
