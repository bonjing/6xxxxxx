Welcome CiCi Rhodes to Ultimate Surrender. "The Titan" is 5'10 and a solid 155lbs. She is big, strong and a scrapper. She has never lost a bar fight, and loves to scrap it up. However, US is not a bar - a lessen she soon learns the hard way.

Ariel X has won 18 regular season matches in a row. She is a two-time Ultimate Surrender overall champion, and current reigning champion. No other wrestler in the history of the site has ever won the championship twice.

The rookie sized up the small champion in the locker room, and thought there was no way she could lose. It took about 15 seconds into the match to realize she was going to get her ass kicked good and hard. Ariel made the big girl submit twice, and got fingers in her early and often. CiCi was beaten, fingered and fucked hard. Ariel taught the rookie a lesson in humility and taught it well.
