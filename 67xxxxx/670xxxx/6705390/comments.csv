[T],stevekasian,2011-10-02T07:42Z,"@dandeedan: Fool? lol  You, my friend, are the fool. This was ripped @ 16000 Kbps, which makes it more than twice the bitrate of any other version available here at TPB at the time of this writing. If you want inferior video quality, why bother downloading a 1080p resolution version?

Dumbass."
