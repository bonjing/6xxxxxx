Read description.
 If you like the soundtrack click on the link in description & download from there."

,johyyny,2011-10-06T17:34Z,"On your Berlin Alexanderplatz torrent, what is the source of the subtitles? specifically the portuguese subtitle, as it doesn't seem to come the same dvd.
(I ask here because you say we should post comments in your most recent torrents)
Thanks"
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-10-06T19:15Z,"Yes, they must be Brazilian then, from  a sub site.
Often I see the same subs uploaded as Br and Pt as well then I get pissed not knowing which is it.
But in most of my new torrents I do say if it is Port Br...All of you should leave comments at the subtitles-sites saying what sub it is, Br or Pt, spa Cast or spa Lat Am...
Some blu-rays don't say it either if it is Latin Spa or Pt.
Finally you learned some new Brazilian expressions, good for you ;-)"
,Madmateo,2011-10-06T23:12Z,"Please, can you rip other extras from this BRay? Deleted scenes, Marvel One-Shot: The Consultant and Featurettes in mkv with subs.
Thanx!"
,nachin22,2011-10-22T07:05Z,"Hi ""mkvonly"" your torrents are great; let me say i would appreciate if you say if the audio file is in spanish or -latin american spanish-; I find out this time is not lat ame spanish, I'd Love your audios were latin american spanish. =)   I will tell you that latin american people usually find more pleasant to watch movies in english to iberian spanish, Yeah even if it is ÂĄÂĄspanish!! Beyond my personal likes or dislikes I respectfully suggest you to share latin american audio tracks"
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-10-23T01:02Z,"@nachin22
It's exactly as in description:
""Audio English DTS 1500 KB/s, 1.13 GiB (22%)

Optional Audio Tracks (separate) AAC 192~236 KB/s, 150 MB each:

French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Spanish""
so I don't understand your problem.

Here are some torrents where I mention Lat Am Spanish:
Green Lantern (2011) 1080p (8 Audios, 26 Subs) [mkvonly] 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6763647/Green_Lantern_%282011%29_1080p_%288_Audios__26_Subs%29_%5Bmkvonly%5D

The Incredibles 2004 1080p multi [mkvonly] 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6753872/The_Incredibles_2004_1080p_multi_%5Bmkvonly%5D

Serenity 2005 BDRip 1080p multi extra [mkvonly] 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6667032/Serenity_2005_BDRip_1080p_multi_extra_%5Bmkvonly%5D

and many more...
The Spanish speaking pirates are too lazy to leave a comment saying which Spanish track it is. Also almost none of the Spanish torrents mention which Spanish track they have so how on hell would I know. Because often I add the track from an other torrent. And if I demux it from Blu-ray again I don't know which Spanish it is, only I can guess if at the end of the Spanish subtitle it says Latin Am Spanish then I suppose the audio track is as well."
,nachin22,2011-10-25T21:36Z,"@mkvonly Hi!! dude, I was glad you answered my comment, i love latin audio tacks and they help my little brothers do not fall asleep watching movies L.O.L. (ther are 5 and 8 years old). I am very grateful to you. your work is outstanding
Best whishes, Long Life ""mkvonly"""
