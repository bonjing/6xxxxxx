Her husband was raised on the standard American diet. Her grandpa was a butcher. Her mom was the best home cook around, with a generous pat of butter here and a crumble of bacon there. But now Sarah is a mom who wants to feed her children right. Great recipe book with subtitle â€œSimple Meatless Meals the Whole Family Will Loveâ€.
