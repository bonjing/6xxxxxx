Amanda Kyle Williams-The Stranger You Seek 2011 epub,mobi


The Stranger You Seek is the opening salvo in a new series from freelance writer Amanda Kyle Williams.  Set in Atlanta, Georgia, it introduces us to a spunky new heroine, former FBI criminal profiler Keye Street.
 
Street tears up several of the clichÃ©s of the genre.  She is Chinese-American and physically non-imposing (coming in at 5â€™4), and has, unlike so many other mavericks, actually managed to get herself fired from her job at the FBI.  When we meet her, she has built up a small business working as a bail agent and process server.   Accordingly, Williams has broken new ground, creating something of a freelancer procedural, combining the lone-wolfishness of the PI genre with the procedural accuracy of police works.  When not staking out suspects, bouncing around theories or struggling to keep her abstinence from alcohol in check, she serves warrants, chases down bail jumpers and investigates missing persons cases.


Enjoy!
