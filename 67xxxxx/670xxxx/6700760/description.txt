Allmusic Review:
Three relatively extensive SWV anthologies were released during the late â€˜90s and early 2000s, while this 2011 disc -- part of Sonyâ€™s extensive S.O.U.L. series -- is a ten-track budget compilation. It contains almost all of the groupâ€™s Top 20 Billboard Hot 100 singles, including â€œIâ€™m So into You,â€ â€œRight Here [Human Nature Radio Remix],â€ â€œWeak,â€ â€œYouâ€™re the One,â€ and â€œAnything,â€ but not â€œSomeone.â€ Most of the groupâ€™s casual fans will get all they need from it, but the earlier compilations dig deeper for a reason. SWV's catalog has some depth beyond the major crossover singles.
