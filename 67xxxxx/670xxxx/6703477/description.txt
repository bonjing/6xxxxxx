This Is the First Part Of The One Piece Series. The East Blue Saga!

In This Saga Luffy Is Gathering His First four crewmembers Zoro, Nami, Usopp and Sanji.

The Last Couple Of Episodes Are Completely Japanese. But The Rest Of The Episodes Are Japanese/Englis Dual Audio

They May Not be HD But you can\\\'t deny it\\\'s a damn good quality

i hope you enjoy my first torrent
