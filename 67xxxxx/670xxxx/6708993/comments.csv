,x_Darkstorm_x,2011-10-04T03:31Z,the archive for Swamp Thing #1 appears corrupted
,lost_faith,2011-10-30T12:28Z,"Great effort, man. 
Although, Batgirl seems to have a missing page problem, cause it's not the fixed scan (like this one http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6660617/Batgirl__1_FIXED_[DC_New_52_Relaunch]) in this compilation. And, yeah, Swamp Thing is not responding (in CDisplay anyway), too. "
