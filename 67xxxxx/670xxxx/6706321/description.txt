The Doobie Brothers is the first studio album by American rock band The Doobie Brothers, released in 1971. It is their only official studio album to feature original bass player Dave Shogren on all tracks, who left during the recording of their second album.

The first single from the album, "Nobody," failed to chart, as did the album itself. The single was re-released in 1974 after the group had become a highly successful touring and recording act, peaking at #58 on the Billboard Hot 100. "Nobody" was later re-recorded for the group's 2010 album, World Gone Crazy.
