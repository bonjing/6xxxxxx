â€˜An odd rock concept album about the Civil War. Pretty goodâ€™ â€“ The Acid Archives


The brainchild of 23 year-old writer / guitarist Dale Menten, The House Of Leather is a rock opera set in a bordello during the US Civil War. It was originally released in December 1968, shortly before it was staged as a sell-out rock opera in Minnesota. A fine mixture of acid-tinged pop-rock and ballads, it makes its long-overdue CD debut here â€“ together with liner notes that tell the story of the productionâ€™s ill-fated move to New York in 1970.
