,Delsher,2011-09-26T13:22Z,Thank you very much! i guess the next upload is Green lantern Blu-ray 1080p :-)
,WIL300,2011-09-26T20:06Z,"I love these Bluray rips. If only all the latest movies would appear in here, I would do away with my monthly movie rental sub. Is Piratebay the best place for this or can someone advise me were to find more. Thanks"
,BMcM2000,2011-09-27T04:27Z,"Big Huge Thank You!!!!!  I wan wondering if this came with a Bonus Disc or not?  If so, Is it possible to request an upload of that a little later?  Thanking You Again!!!!!!!"
,utterr18,2011-09-27T14:46Z,"not too sure on how to exactly play these. Do these files have to be merged before you can play them? 

I don't want to burn to BD so if there is any other option that would be great. "
,MDIWNCOR,2011-09-27T15:14Z,"I too  wonder how to watch this.
Would it be okay to burn it do an image file maybe, instead of a BD disc?"
,Martello,2011-09-27T18:43Z,You can play the 00800.m2ts file in VLC or Media Player Classic. You can select audio that way. Not sure about the subs though.
,rollanhq,2011-09-27T18:51Z,Is the 3D out yet?
,rille311,2011-09-28T01:30Z,I use the software makeMkv to create a mkv file and then play it on my tv or projector screen
,Sub20hz,2011-09-28T04:58Z,"im averaging 4kb a second is everyone else having this problem or is it just me.  I am able to upload 500kb a second tho....

also there is no 3D version or bonus information available for this title until late Fall or early winter. Guys please seed for the rest of us...this is my all time favorite movie and i just want to hear my subs scream during this movie with a lossless codec.
