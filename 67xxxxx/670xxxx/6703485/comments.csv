,CongoGirl,2011-09-27T04:23Z,This site should be named after you 
,Jessejames05,2011-09-27T10:35Z,Thanks for all the great Movies you have uploaded. The quality is SUPERB. Can I just ask one question and maybe someone else can answer it.....what application/software do you use to rip these Movies? I have tried various applications like CloneDVD Mobile and Magic DVD Ripper and Daniusoft Video Converter Ultimate.....all have given me the quality of picture and the smaller size that you achieve ....mine tend to be grainy and slightly pixelated. Obviously I'm not using the application you are using.....so can you help me.....please? 
[V],extremezone,2011-09-27T12:09Z,"most used is virtual dub,avimux gui and some similar audio or video encoding tools-on my max encodes,the rest are from p2p or scene sources"

,TheReverendKROM,2011-09-30T06:08Z,"@Jessejames05  I use WINX DVD ripper platinum it works very well and rips a good quality rip. it also came with a converter, which allows you to convert to hd PSP Ipod mp4 avi mkv really great software.. I got it online but I did pay $35 for it but was well worth it.."
,Kalika1,2011-09-30T22:11Z,"Hey all, I'm a noob @ the DVD burning thing, I've spent hours reviewing sites & user reviews & I can't seem to find out what the best free software is for converting & burning DVD's. All of the ones I have tried have been garbage & every other one I find has numerous horrible user reviews. I am willing to pay for it if it works spotlessly, but can't seem to find that either. I would greatly appreciate if someone could help me out on this. Thanks in advance :)

PS. Thanks for the upload Extremezone! Ridiculously fast download(10 mins!) & excellent quality, as always :) Cheers! "

,scottsasse,2011-10-06T10:25Z,"@Kalika1, Your best bet might be to try using one program to rip and another to compress and sometimes you may still want to use a 3rd program to do your burning. This may sound confusing but its not. Just a lot as dragging and dropping files between programs until you get the result you are looking for. If you are just looking to make perfect copies of DVD's then Any DVD Cloner Platinum is the easiest and best at busting through copyguards!!Good luck!!"
,iburnswishers,2011-10-08T19:48Z,"@kalika1
im a power burner and have used various programs for ripping dvds. im now using convertXToDVD. it has a built in converter for transcoding virtually every type of format to dvd.
it can be found here on tpb. just download, un rar, & install. if u want to backup copyrighted dvds dvd-cloner8 works great. this can also be found here. hope this helps you out. why pay $$$$$ ? free is better!"
,HOLMETOP,2011-10-10T13:10Z,V-9/A-9/M-6/ firtst one was better... Th@nks
,Kalika1,2011-10-11T06:38Z,"@ scotsasse: that doesn't sound confusing at all, I get the point & I appreciate the help, thank-u. I was hoping to get an all-in-one program, but it's good to know there are other options as well, thanks again.

@ iburnswishers: Thank-u SOO much, I was really hoping someone could give me an all-in-one trusted program & free is DEFINITELY always better, lol. Your help is MUCH APPRECIATED ;)"

,PanMS12,2012-04-12T19:07Z,"Hi Guys, I would like to know if you have encountered the same problem that I do with extremezone torrents. Normally it is a good copy but when I burn the movie to a DVD it does not play in my DVD machine. What about you?"
