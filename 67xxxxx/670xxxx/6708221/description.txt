thx

Encode:
another good movie that needed a total makeover.
Video suffered from darkness and lack of any colours, also audio was very bad to hear, noise,
hiss, hum everything which makes it total hard to watch and hear. Firstly this korsubs movie
have that 2 line subs, blurring is not possible looks bad and cropping is ok in this case
since its nearly fullscreen. Since i couldnt decide to crop or not, i have done both versions,
for you to decide what you like more. Check the pics, check the sample, and decide which
version you want to have, both version will be available simultaneously.

I fixed the aspect the resolution, filtered the colours added brightness,contrast,sharpness
denoise tried to remove some of the interlace that was still in there. totally cleaned up
the audiotrack, behind all that noise in the audio is a good audiotrack just needed tweak
here and there. its now totally watchable and you can see and hear the movie - enjoy

Video: 720x394 @bitrate 1400 2pass
Audio: English AC3 2.0 Stereo
Sample: yes, included[/b]
