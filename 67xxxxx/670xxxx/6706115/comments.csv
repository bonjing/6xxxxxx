,LukeScooto,2011-10-28T05:50Z,"Says for females right in the description, you just have to read it. But if you have a girlfriend, this is a good book to have. You can just kinda flip through it and throw some things out there while your watching tv from time to time. Only good things can come of it. Thanks for posting, one of the better ebooks ive seen lately."
