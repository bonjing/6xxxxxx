[T],thetorrentlord,2011-09-26T17:30Z,More info about the file itself rather than just a synopsis  of the show would be a lot better description.  Also if you don't RAR the file it can be previewed as it is being downloaded to check the quality. Most people won't D/L a RAR file blindly. Thanks for the upload.
[T],thetorrentlord,2011-09-26T17:32Z,One more tip: it saves almost no space to RAR video. Waste of time on both ends.
[T],thetorrentlord,2011-09-27T15:19Z,Just finished and this is corrupt. Only the first (S08E21) of the two parts is inside.
,chitaz-3,2011-09-28T02:03Z,"thetorrentlord thanks for the advice, I do .rar files because except for the pilot they are whole seasons I don't bandwidth to sit here with each episode. 

and I just checked the pilot rar file and it is complete.

all the files are files received through TPB. "
,rabbit42,2011-09-28T05:07Z,"if you want the pilot just d/l JAG 8:20-21
Ice Princess & Meltdown"
