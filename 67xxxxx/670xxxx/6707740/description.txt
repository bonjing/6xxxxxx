Part 1 - In a small town in Michigans Upper Peninsula, a virus turns nearly every resident into a vicious killing machine. A group of uninfected is trapped within the town, abandoned with dwindling resources. These survivors must fight against the infected, as well as the paranoia growing between them. Sparked by a mysterious stranger, the survivors dig into the towns secrets as they hatch their escape, yet none of them are prepared for what they discover.
