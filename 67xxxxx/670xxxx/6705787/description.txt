This torrent includes the official podcast mp3s released on the www.glennbeck.com website for the radio show. It includes the "4th Hour" with Pat & Stu which is available only to subscribers (ie. it is not part of the regular radio broadcast).

I have today figured out how to get the podcasts as opposed to just the mp3 files (it was a little hard to find the podcast info on Glenn's site), so from now on my torrents will include the official podcasts only.

These can be imported into itunes and will automatically be recognized as podcasts and can be easily synched without changing info and classification (unlike the the other mp3 files from the site).
