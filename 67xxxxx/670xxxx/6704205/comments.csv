,drcat123,2011-09-27T23:52Z,The first ep was not bad but this epsiode was just terrible . There was very little two and half men. It was basically the walden show . Which sucks because it is like watching the  ashton as Michael Kelso 
,superbanned,2011-09-28T00:29Z,"don worry they knew this show would suck without charlie. Hes back!
"
,makisunn,2011-09-28T08:07Z,"Chuck Lorre tried to get people to pre emp Charlie's Emmy speech. I don't think he's coming back soon. I miss stupid Kelso. So that's the lighter side of this whole thing. 

70s and a half men. You heard it here, folks."

,baadcarma,2011-09-29T22:39Z,"Show not good...  Weird noise every time Kelso (a.k.a. Kutcher) tries to act...

R.I.P. Charlie
Miss ya dude. 
You made it what it was and what it never will be no matter what they pay a B-actor to do...
You will always be a hard act to follow.

Put 2 1/2 men to bed... pls."

The last week many of the torrents I try to download just stays on ""connecting tracker"" or ""tracker response error""
I have bitlord
Why? "
,Lpspacer,2011-10-01T10:38Z,This show has downgraded into dribble.  I'm sure anyone with have a brain could of come up with a better scenario than a billionaire washing up onto a beach.  Ashton could of been a lost brother than eveleyn gave up. The show has started off on a bad note and can only go downhill.  I'm downloaded every episode before this farse has been perpetrated.

The piratebay trackers are fucked up, it works on some clients, but not all. My QNAP NAS does not work on pbay anymore, but trackers on I-S-O-H-U-N-T work without any problem

Fix it damn lazies!"
,eloni,2011-10-02T20:48Z,"@Lpspacer - the show should probably hire you to do the writing...way better scenario than Walden washing up on the beach. Was watching reruns of the old Two and a Half Men - much more fun & chemistry between the actors.
Rip is pretty good - A:8,V:8"
