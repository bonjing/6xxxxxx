Historic 1952 recording of Mahler's symphony song cycle with the Vienna Philharmonic, conducted by Bruno Walter, featuring Kathleen Ferrier, contralto. Often cited as the foremost recording of this work, the performance is rendered particularly poignant by Ferrier, who was dying of cancer at the time, in the final movement, "Der Aschied" ("The Farewell").
