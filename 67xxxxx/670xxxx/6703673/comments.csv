,diawkdfi,2011-09-27T18:11Z,I use media player classic 64bit.  The video lags and jumps with all of the videos of this series.  I don't have this issue with other videos.  I don't know if you have any idea why this is happening. Thanks for deciding to cap this series.

I am unsure what might be causing this, a probable cause might be missynchronized subtitles (that some part of the series have).
However I am using VLC, and it plays it with no problem, maybe give it a try for these problematic files?"
