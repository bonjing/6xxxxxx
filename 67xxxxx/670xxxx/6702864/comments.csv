,Stagpump,2011-09-26T16:58Z,For the love of god save the Bandwidth. I was unlukcy enough to win tickets to see this a week before release. Dire dull boring shite. why take a minute to tell part of the story when 10 hours will do. It's like a mash up between a Michael Mann film and a bad attempt at bullitt. OH and the music made me want to stab myself in the ears with a pen. My faith in the academy is low as it is but if the rumours are true and this film even gets a nomination than what little faith remains will be gone forever. whilst this torrent may be fine the film it's self gets minus10/10

,Marshmont,2011-09-27T04:16Z,"@DVDguy not for nothin but Contagion is also certified fresh and it is a bad movie.  From what Ive heard the screener has an entirely different soundtrack and is incomplete, so Im going to wait"
