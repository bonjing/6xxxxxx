Plot

The movie revolves around Ajay (Siddharth) who comes to Chennai/Hyderabad and introduces himself as Mano. He rents a house owned by elderly couple S V S Murthy (Mouli) and Jayam (Geetha). A do-gooder, Ajay lives life with a purpose. He gets along with everyone and wins the hearts of those whom he is close with. Vidhya (Nithya Menen), a photo journalist gets acquainted with him. Ajay is the sort of person who finds satisfaction in helping others. He sponsors the education of street children with the help of Vidhya who is attracted by his good nature. Things take a turn when she tells him about her feelings. Ajay, without informing her, decides to leave Chennai/Hyderabad. Meanwhile, flashbacks reveal that Ajay was a doctor in USA and was attracted to Renu (Priya Anand). They get married only to be told months later that Ajay has cancer and he would die in a few months. As Ajay is about to leave the city, Vidya meets with an accident and has to be operated upon immediately. Ajay takes Vidya to USA for treatment. While in the USA, he meets his friend who asks Ajay to return to Renu, but Ajay leaves as he sees his wife happier without him. It is revealed that earlier Ajay had faked his death to make Renu believe that he had died so that she would not suffer thinking about him every day. Now seeing her happy, he decides not to meet Renu. So, he decides to leave USA. The title of the movie '180' implies that he may die in 180 days but doesn't want to count those days. He'd rather live those days in happiness and make others happy.
