BUFFALO BILL - the brilliant sitcom from 1983 starring Dabney Coleman and a young Geena Davis.  This is an episode lifted from an old VHS copy I have kept all these years.  I can provide more if there is any interest.  This is my *very first attempt* to rip and upload a video, so please be gentle with your criticisms!
