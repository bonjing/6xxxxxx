We all negotiate every day, whether we realise it or not. Yet few people ever learn how to negotiate. Those who do usually learn the traditional, win-lose style. In today s interdependent world of business partnerships and long-term relationships, however, a win-win outcome is fast becoming the only acceptable result. Win-win negotiators value their business and social relationships winning in a given negotiation is not as important as maintaining their winning relationships, but this does not mean they must sacrifice their interests. Win-win negotiators believe they can win both the negotiation and the relationship. Written in a lively, succinct and easy-to-read style, David Goldwich shows you how to develop the win-win negotiator s mindset and introduces the core skills and techniques to successfully negotiate win-win agreements. Learn the art of a win-win negotiation, and achieve win-win results in all your negotiations today!
