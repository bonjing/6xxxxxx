This Minecraft installer was compiled by kaise123 (Kai)
I take no credit for the loader, which was created by AngelDE98, AnjoCaido, Mojang (The base), Kartracer97, Smoolak, JBExtrem, Zebz213 and others.
I merely added all the mods and the 'cracked' loader and made a convenient easy-to-use installer that gives you options =)

The mods are owned by their respective creators and I take no credit for their creation. To see the source code on open source projects Google the names of the mods (listed below) 

This is an easy-to-use, user-friendly way of putting minecraft on your computer.

Please report ANY non-normal minecraft errors or bugs to me!

Changed this version:
Version 2.2.0
For Minecraft 1.8.1
Added back most old mods from 1.7.3
Added Single Player Commands
Changed back to 'classic' Optifine because of reported problems with the MT one.
Added new loader (Minecraft Smart Loader v3) (old loaders now in start menu just in case)

As nobody seemed to read the readme i will keep this small.

This version includes basic unmodded minecraft, a version with mods and a version with Optifine (See Below)

TooManyItems
Zombe's Modpack
HD Texture pack Fixer (Now included in Optifine)
Modloader is included.
Dynamic Lights
SP Commands
Zan's Minimap
WorldeditCUI
*Optifine

*Only in the optifine version. Optifne is a mod that dramatically increases FPS and stability on most computors. I have never had any problems with this but if you see random holes in the world, install the standard version. Do not install this if you don't have a slow PC.

The 'Unlicenced Copy' text remover is not included in this version, because I have heard that the text does not appear in this version. If you see the text E-Mail me.

The controlls for basic minecraft are in the controlls section in 'Options'. Other Controlls (For the modded version only) are below:

F = Fly On/Off
E = Fly Up
Q = Fly Down
LSHIFT = Fly/walk faster (different from 1.8's sprint feature)
F6 = NoClip while flying (SSP/CSP ONLY)
Backspace = Path tracker (See where you have walked)
Numpad + = Advance Sun Time
Numpad - = Detract Sun Time
END = Stop Time (Freeze Sun in place)
HOME = Normalize and Resume time
L = Shows where Hostile Mobs can spawn (Yellow = Night only, Red = Anytime)
O (in the inventory) = Enables/Disables TooManyItems
In single player press the chat button and type "help" to see single player commands commands.

To run the game and play on a server that is 'cracked' just put in a username and no password and that will act as your name in-game. Email me for some servers you can play on.
