,BD001,2011-09-30T18:21Z,Worth the dl for Tuf Voyaging alone
,4rcane,2011-10-01T00:27Z,"I like how you give different cover design to each reader. Roy Dotrice get the standard cover design while Roy Avers get the modern design.

Do you have Roy Avers book2 audiobook? Its the hardest to find. Roy Avers is better than Roy Dotrice imho, esp when doing the female voices"
,4rcane,2011-10-01T13:46Z,"in order from best to worst
Roy Avers > Roy Dotrice > John Lee >  Ted Stoddard"
,Bk-I-HaKz,2011-10-01T16:35Z,This is unbelievably great work Neil ! I can't thank you enough !. I really appreciate all the work you put into this so people like me can enjoy Martins works. Thx again !
,4rcane,2011-10-13T12:46Z,"actually I noticed, there quite a bit of corruption and problem in your encodes. Stutters, skips, pops etc e.g in A Clash of Kings chapter 67 Tyrion 14.44. This isn't the only one, there are MANY"
,tekproxy,2012-01-23T21:13Z,"I know how long this stuff takes and how tedious it gets. Please know, deep down in your gutty-wuts, that I am very, very appreciative. Even if, as someone pointed out earlier, there are encoding problems. Thanks to you and Martin and everyone else that made this stuff."
,Pringworm,2012-02-17T01:19Z,Baller package Neil.
,mtorresm,2012-02-20T03:22Z,"Excellent, the torrent is excellent"
[H],politux,2012-04-03T18:19Z,"Thanks so much, this is a great torrent."
,oOtalOo,2012-04-05T22:15Z,"Are the skips mentioned bad? or are they minor?
I just don't want to miss anything"
,w00tbie,2012-04-17T07:03Z,much appreciation to you my good sir :)
,snippet.,2012-04-26T17:08Z,"@neil1966hardy 
Thanks very much for the work you did! 
Nonetheless two points of criticism concerning “A Storm of Swords” read by Roy Avers: 
- it has a second voice/recording whispering in the background (compression artifacts?). 
- the loudness has not been normalized; look at the waveforms for the chapter 52 of the book “A Storm of Swords” and compare yourself >> imageshack.us/photo/my-images/860/waveforms.png/ (first one is Roy Avers, second one is Roy Dotrice); when in loud ambience it is hard to understand Roy Avers."

some good shit homes"
,muttam_kurami,2012-05-04T16:19Z,"Thanks..
Could some one put some true story novel ,audio books?"
,mudd12,2012-05-06T20:38Z,I noticed no skips or stuttering in Game of Thrones but there are several chapters of Clash of Kings that are affected. It's still possible to understand the passages but it's annoying nonetheless.
,rabbit122,2012-05-21T15:42Z,"Thank you man, this is great :D"
,LittleGod,2012-05-24T12:47Z,"Awesome!
