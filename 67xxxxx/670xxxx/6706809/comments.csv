,japhater,2011-09-30T01:15Z,is there a way to turn off the subtitles?
,honunet,2011-09-30T10:24Z,"Ha ha what a fucking clown... Nice touch with the picture of the dvd box, really sells the scam.  Thanks kbw2 for alerting everyone to the fact that this is NOT Season 1, it is the first and second episodes just like every other swinging dick has out there.

 Only its it some gay format these clowns like to encode it it, which offers ten times the downloading speed for 1x the quality.

So in other words:

FAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
