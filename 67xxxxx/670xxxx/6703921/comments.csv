Request.. have you every film on handheld that nobody else has got ? just asking (This is a joke)
Thank mate."
,bog23man,2011-09-27T14:10Z,P.s Are you using HR-PIZ encode ? I cannot find it anywhere and just want to make what I publish smaller for people with small storage devices thats all 
,RaSe_77,2011-09-27T18:03Z,"Hope you liked it mate. If you mean HR's encode, it can be found here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5195246/HR_basic_Windows_PiZ_encoding_v1.1 but, in response to your question, no, I use Handbrake as per on.off.on torrents: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6134512/Handbrake.Fast.guide.3xO Hope this helps and thanks for the comment :)"
,aks123321,2011-09-28T11:00Z,can you please upload HANGOVER PART 2 in psp format
,RaSe_77,2011-09-28T19:45Z,"Sorry mate, I do not convert for PSP. I'd recommend HolyRoses or albert2172 for PSP converts."
,aks123321,2011-09-30T18:20Z,"can u please upload ""Delhi Belly"" in ipod format
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1934231/
 it is an awesome comedy movie"
,RaSe_77,2011-10-01T22:26Z,"aks123321 - Sorry no. I see you've requested twice on my torrents asking and have asked the same thing from at least 3 other uploaders. FYI, it might be worth registering on Suprbay as there is a forum to request films. It would also save uploaders duplicating work."
