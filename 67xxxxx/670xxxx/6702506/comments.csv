,soletar,2011-09-27T05:17Z,"Thanks mr treehuger, but i have actually checked out that link you gave me before. i chose YIFY torrents because they are of the best quality and still of very small size. i live in africa and i have very slow internet speeds. YIFY's Archer season 1 is for example 750mb while the others on TPB r at least 1G....YIFY pls i am eagerly waiting for Archer season 2.thanks again treehuger"

,WorldTurnBlack,2011-09-27T05:48Z,"YIFY i hope you will consider my request. if you didnt gat my email i wanted both fantastic four movies. the vampire girl movie ''let me in'' and X-men 1 and 2. the trackers are everywhere!!! i have to use a VPN & Peerblock not to get caught!
