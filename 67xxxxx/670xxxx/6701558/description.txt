 Balu is a brilliant student and always tops     
 Maha Lakshmi comes from a village and stays     
 in Balu's house to do her graduation in the     
 same college. Balu has the typical ego possessed
 by state rankers and he is obsessed by it. His  
 studies get disturbed with the entry to         
 Maha Lakshmi as she starts dominating him       
 over a period of time. This leads to            
 differences and ego clashes between Balu and    
 Maha Lakshmi. There is also a subplot of        
 two separated grand parents. The rest of the    
 story is all about how Balu and Mahalakshmi     
 realize that they are made for each other.
