[T],dynstab2,2011-09-25T16:36Z,Title says ÂŤ + SolutionsÂť but you uploaded a single PDF file with a weight very close to that of the textbook alone (uncompressed). The textbook is already there on TPB (losslessly compressed). What's needed is the solution manual. Is it embedded at the end of the textbook in the same file?
