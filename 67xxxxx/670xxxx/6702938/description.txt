Once in a while I like to go trough some of my favourite tracks. Almost automatically this becomes a kind of voyage in which I am looking for a specific mood (in this case tracks that are able to get people moving).

However, I am a sucker for beautiful music and make many side steps, effectively travelling two journeys at the same time.

Often this may result in a kind of playlist (a record of my steps). And sometimes the result is worth sharing.

In this Case Alice and Alone were compiled together, in which Alice is the easy path while Alone is trying to get things moving.

My library is quite extensive, so probably you hear some great new tracks (in HQ).

Enjoy and share.
