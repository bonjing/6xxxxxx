[V],globeplus,2011-09-27T19:36Z,"To .l.l.l.l. : first of all thank you very much for your positive appreciation about my games files work and you can believe me that no one more than myself in the way of doing a constructive positive work on the game files liked to keep nice worked game files coming to the possible interested users in pratical games files to download but unfornatly after my forced home change i needed to reduced all my expenses to the minimum including using a slow net that it is only possible upload not too much size files but all my friendly positive sharing spirit keeps alive independtly of that but of course that you understand that i canĂÂ´t put the users waiting more than a week for a normal 2 gb or something game file and that really borring me but i need to respect all the possible users in all the ways possible including the timing to get the files , my hope is to get my life improved again somehow soon and improve my net again and my friendly user , the net users are full of cases of people that at a certain point of the life for some circunstancial reasons needed to make a reducing of the net costs for more borring that a thing like that can be , what it is really important is not to loose our hope and our friendly sharing spirit , life can be a rollercoaster sometimes but we still beeing ourselfs with more or less problems and it is like that ...

Thank you again for your good impression about my work and it is because users like you that who can make positive work on the files still making when get the opportunity ... you welcome to any of my files independtly of the size of course ... see you ."
