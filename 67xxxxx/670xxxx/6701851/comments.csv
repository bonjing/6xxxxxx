,octogirl_21,2011-09-26T04:35Z,I think I understand what you mean about leechers and I am ashamed I have been one at times. At this time 165 people downloading refused to share...shame on you. At least do it for a few days!
,octogirl_21,2011-09-26T05:16Z,Thank you for the download!
,crazewray,2011-10-01T06:56Z,"I never used to seed but then again it cost me $29 for 2Gb downloads.  Now I have unlimited downloads and uploads so I seed all the time, especially the Classic Doctor Who.  Come on people seed!!!"
,octogirl_21,2011-10-01T21:08Z,"yes crazewray...I found out the hard was that I was paying for seeding this month. Cogeco where I live does not offer unlimited service and I had to pay an additional 40 bucks this month for uploads. When I called in she explained the reason to me with peer to peer sharing.

I had a ratio of uploading that was higher than my downloading...me and my bold statement...what do I do now?"

@ octogirl_21   ""[Leechers]...At this time 165 people downloading refused to share...""

If you are looking at the ""Leechers:"" figure (on top of this page) - that figure isn't what it seems to be.  Leechers are just people who haven't yet completely downloaded the file.

Most of them may well be sharing all that they have ... they just haven't yet obtained 100% of the file(s).

Seeder: Has 100% of the file(s).  
Leecher:  Has 0-99% of the file(s).
Both:  Potentially sharing all that they have.

Seeders and leechers are all peers.  Typically, they are sharing.  (We're all peers!  I feel like I've just been knighted).

It is not uncommon to see a period when there are far more leechers than seeders for a given file set (for various reasons involving timing in the sharing ""life cycle of a torrent"", initial popularity, file size and other distribution oddities).
