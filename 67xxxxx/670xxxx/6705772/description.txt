She-Wolf of London (TV Series 1990â€“1991)

American grad student Randi Wallace travels to Britain to study mythology with Prof. Ian Matheson. She arrives expecting a stodgy old academic, but Ian is young, and the two are immediately attracted to one other. That complication quickly pales when Randi spends a night camping on the moors and is bitten by a werewolf. For the rest of the series, Randi and Ian investigate supernatural phenomena together while they search for a cure for Randi's curse. Eventually, their search takes them from British academia to American TV, when they move back to Randi's native California, and Ian becomes host of a trashy TV talk show focusing on psychic phenomena. The series was an old-style romantic comedy with a touch of horror.
