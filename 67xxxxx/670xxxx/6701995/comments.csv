,muckymucks,2011-09-26T07:16Z,"What the eff?! Leaked episodes everywhere. Dexter's season opener got leaked and now Breaking Bad's penultimate episode. Thanks but no thanks. I'm gonna hold off 'til Sunday but it's cool when awesome stuff gets leaked. Enjoy, everybody! And, please, no spoilers!"
,ivap38,2011-09-26T07:45Z,You rock! Thanks! 
,tuggtugger2,2011-09-26T07:46Z,"Leaked? what in the world are you talking about? the air date for S04e11 is 9/25 and this torrent was posted a little after midnight on 9/26.

What is this Leak you speak of?"
,outpatient730,2011-09-26T07:57Z,You're the shit eztv!!
,tuggtugger2,2011-09-26T08:03Z,"oh wait. i  think i know what you're talking about. all those torrents posted by grubino.

Those are all fake torrents, which have already been removed."
,DickDickstein,2011-09-26T08:58Z,"lol...yeah there have been a lot of fakes the last week going around. 

House was out early though I heard, and that is legit. I'm going to wait though. I heard it wasn't edited right yet. "
,tom_appleford,2011-09-26T09:21Z,You are the best - thanks for this excellent show
,useitright,2011-09-26T09:39Z,"I do not know why people like grubino waste their time on stupid shit like that.  Anybody that is not completely stupid can easily tell that they are fakes at first glance, and they were removed very quickly.  In fact, I think he/she was still in the process of putting up fakes when they all got removed.  I have seen the same thing happen a couple of times where a person is uploading major amounts of fakes, and I still do not know why they do it other than tricking not so smart people into downloading a virus or something.  Other than that....always top notch quality eztv....I can not thank you enough."
