Top 100 Unforgettable Love Songs 4CD Set (musicfromrizzo) varied bitrates

Whoever said "Singin in the rain" aint exactly
a love song? Its still one of my favourite choices
as it happens Ilove the rain as its romantic weather for
me as I get rather introspective especially then!

Anyhow's, it is still strange that it should make it onto a list
of top 100 unforgettable love songs I think - oh well right now we
are all equals at making selections I figure - so look closely before
you decide on what will give you the best wholesome thrills I say!

Enjoy this 4CD set!
