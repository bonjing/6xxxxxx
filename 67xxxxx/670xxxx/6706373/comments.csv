,au55ies2,2011-10-01T06:04Z,"Firstly, thanks. However, this is another file with a non-standard VBR audio stream of less than 128kbps, using ""Writing Application: Lavf53.2.0"", according to MediaInfo.
This audio will not play on some hardware media players, including PopCornHour.
It can be fixed by remuxing with AviDemux or similar apps, but continues to be a PITA.
To LOL encoders, only some of you are doing this. Could you please use other methods that don't cause this problem.   "
