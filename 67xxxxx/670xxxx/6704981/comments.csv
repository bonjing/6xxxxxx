[V],boobsman,2011-10-01T11:23Z,"Your console is stuck trying to update from disc, the new dash update checks your drive for flashed firmware and changes it back to stock if its found. Because your console can no longer play copies the dash update cannot finish from the disc and your console is stuck. The only way to fix the problem is to have your console reflashed with the latest firmware and to finish the update."
