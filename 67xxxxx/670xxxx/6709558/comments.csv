Only Good thing about this is the Music....
HOLLYWOOD.....STOP Destroying the classics with a buntch of No Name actors.
Only real actors in this is Dennis Quaid and Andie MacDowell....the rest is just a Buntch of No Names!!!
Kevin Bacon will always be Mister Footloose to me!!!
Music is ok....Thx RoffeTheCoolMan :-)"
,MistaBone,2011-10-15T18:02Z,Any chance you could re-rip and not use VBR and sound leveling?
,sirneon1,2011-10-29T17:07Z,Really hoping the movie is better than the soundtrack. What marketing idiot thought making the Footloose soundtrack freakin' COUNTRY was a good idea?
,britishlover,2011-11-06T08:16Z,"@sirneon1 of course it's country, it's set in them middle of hicktown nowheresville where they outlaw dancing! lol. i don't normally like country music but this soundtrack is awesome. :D"
,Linken89,2011-11-24T20:25Z,Compare the dancing now and then so guess thats why they have real dancers in the remake to match this centuries dance style :P since no big named actor atm can dance like that :)
,cowboytilidie,2012-03-19T21:29Z,"Paradoxxx69 has no taste or clue what he is talking about, be your own judge! Awesome movie!
Kevin Bacon is loser in my opinion sorry! That's what you grew up knowing that's all you know give change a chance. Julian Hough is HOT!!!! She is a natural actress way better looking then Kevin Bacon's partner. Plus in the 1984 version they left too many unanswered question! Now they are answered! Well done! The Soundtrack needs more!!!! "
