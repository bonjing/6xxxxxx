Since BAYIMAGE seems to not like me at random times, and this being one of those times I uploaded the cover for the DVD to imgur

Basics about it. NTSC, in English, a 4.7gig DVD format in a iso file, mount it or burn it or whatever, it is assumed you know the routine. 
It is PG-13 and it is a pretty cool western adventure that takes place in the far east during the days of the old west. Based on a real person and it is very believable.. 

According to the IMDb. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317648/

I know there are other torrents of the same name but this is different that all the menus and the special bonus's are included. Even the subtitles which is needed for when the characters speak in Navajo.


ANY questions about how to mount or burn the ISO file?
