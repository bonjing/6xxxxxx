Here is a copy of Netflix for the Playstation 2. Acts mch like Netflix on PS3 and X360.
You use your existing Netflix account, or make one.
This is NTSC.
You HAVE to have an internet connection to your PS2 for this to work. (duh)
I\\\'ve tested this with HDLoader and Open PS2 Loader v0.8, but make sure mode 3 is on for sound fix.
I\\\'ve read on another site also works with ESR too.
Seed for awhile if you can, this is really rare and hard to get a hold of.

Comment and let me know how it goes :)


I\\\'ve also included cover art for use in OPL for the ones that use it.
