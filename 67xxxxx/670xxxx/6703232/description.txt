This album came out in 1965 and featured a new fifth band-member on vocals and keyboards: Peter Winsnes. On this compilation youll find more excellent vocal tracks in the typical style of the midsixties. Outstanding instrumentals and interesting bonus-tracks such as the two jazz-numbers Take five and Bye Bye Blues close the circle of the disc.
