,Dutchlike,2011-09-26T10:52Z,Any comment about the quality? With Breaking Bad immerse is ussually quite shitty.
,Dutchlike,2011-09-26T10:53Z,Well shitty is a bit harsh but it's a bit blocky if you know what I mean.
,uk-guy,2011-09-26T12:18Z,I wish these groups would just go back to encoding these the old way however we are lucky its not a 500mb release ?
,Dutchlike,2011-09-26T12:54Z,"Exactly, you know that if you're going to download something in 720p it's going to be a big file. If you have a slow connection but want it fast you have to download the lower resolution ones.

I have to say I haven't seen this yet so I'm going to take a look when it's done and comment on the quallity. "
,uk-guy,2011-09-26T13:28Z,these new encoding rules that were brought in i think were more about saving bandwidth are we seeing the first signs of a poor world economy effecting the digital market
,pathduck,2011-09-26T17:56Z,"Real deal, top quality release, thanks a lot EZTV!"
,CobraDoc,2011-09-26T20:11Z,Thank you! Finally a new season :D
,FeiticeiraOmega,2011-09-27T06:10Z,does anybody know what the deal is with the random jumps in brightness shortly after shot changes? Is it a defect with the rippers TV?
,Kole97,2011-09-27T13:07Z,Thanx..been waiting for ages xx
,Dutchlike,2011-09-27T15:02Z,"I'm not really digging the quality here guys, it's a bit jumpy, quite annoying."
,parrumies,2011-09-27T15:47Z,"C'mon. New encoding rules allow for BETTER QUALITY. Previously it had to be compressed on a given filesize no matter what. If immerse decides to give your crappier quality instead that's their decision, nobody stops them from releasing 2GB/1h show now. "
,orly01,2011-10-07T02:50Z,Why is this such bad quality for HD? Can someone U/L a decent 720p file.... please....
,farkstick,2011-10-11T21:32Z,"@orly01
