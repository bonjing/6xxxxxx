[b][color=blue]::Plot::[/color]
  [i]While the gang enjoys a lunch, they are interrupted by a Dangoro landing on their lunch table. Satoshi decides he wants to capture it, for ruining their lunch, but it manages to defeat both Mijumaru and Pokabu. Dent notices a strange suction cup on the back of Dangoro, which is knocked off in the battle. At the PokÃ©mon Center, Satoshi has Mijumaru and Pokabu taken care of when a man named Tuttle talks to Nurse Joy and informs her that the water tank seems normal, and the cause is elsewhere. Nurse Joy informs Satoshi and friends that the water supply has been strange lately, and tells them that the water supply comes from the caves. They say they saw a Dangoro near the caves, but Nurse Joy tells them that Dangoro rarely come out of the caves. Dent says that the Dangoro was attempting to tell them something, and also remembers the strange object on its back. Tuttle says he will go to the caves to look, and Satoshi and his friends volunteer to follow. Elsewhere, the same Dangoro warns several wild PokÃ©mon about something, and inside a cave, a strange device driven by Team Rocket chases after several Dangoro. Satoshi, Iris, Dent, and Tuttle enter the cave which is supposed to deliver water to the town to see why the Dangoro are acting strange when they come across Team Rocket capturing several Dangoro to fill up a device. Satoshi manages to save one of the Dangoro (the same one from before) from Team Rocket, who exit the cave, but smash the cave walls, causing a cave-in. A rock falls towards Satoshi, but Dangoro saves him by using Luster Cannon. Team Rocket fires a energy blast, the Luster Cannon (as they have nicknamed the combined attacks "Dangoro Cannon") to cause a cave in at the entrance. Yanappu and Doryuzu use Dig to get the gang outside, where they chase down Team Rocket who try to use the Luster Cannon to escape once more. However, the device backfires, due to the Dangoro forcing the energy into reverse. the Dangoro are freed, and with combined attacks from all the Dangoro, Pikachu, and Pokabu, they defeat Team Rocket's Pokemon, and destroy the machine, forcing Team Rocket to flee on jetpacks. At the PokÃ©mon Center, Nurse Joy checks on all of the Dangoro, revealing that they are healthy, and the one Dangoro that Satoshi first saved reveals it wanted to travel with Satoshi from the moment they met. This time, Pokabu manages to defeat Dangoro, allowing Satoshi to capture it. [/i]
