From the Infowars web site ::

On the Tuesday edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with former Minnesota governor, Navy SEAL veteran, actor, wrestler and radio talk show and television host Jesse Ventura about his encounters with the TSA and his lawsuit against the agency and the Department of Homeland Security. Jesse's lawsuit charges that the agency has violated his rights under Fourth Amendment, which protects Americans from unreasonable searches and seizures.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
