,RS232C,2011-10-01T13:33Z,it's stalled and I do not see anyone seeding? this is only at 1 GB out of 22? 
,RS232C,2011-10-01T21:27Z,"a trick of the trade is to download the torrent yourself, make two directories. one with all the files complete, and the other with one of the episodes at a time complete, the rest non complete. download the torrent yourself, and choose all the files that are not complete as ""Do not download"" and only the one episode you are uploading that is already complete in the directory. this way you are only uploading data to people once. and not have all the redundancies making you upload things you already uploaded and the community will handle uploading the rest amongst themselves. you can then later fill in the blanks yourself later, after you've uploaded it all if you wish.
