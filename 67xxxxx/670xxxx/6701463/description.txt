    In the 200+ years since the American Revolution, the       
    United States and Great Britain have moved from enemies   
    to firm allies. This documentary follows military        
    experts and historians as they work through the top       
    secret 'War Plan Red' to see how a hypothetical battle     
    between America and Great Britain might have unfolded.
