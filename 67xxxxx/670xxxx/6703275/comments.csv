,BradMacPro,2011-09-26T23:57Z,I see no cracker. How can I tell this anything more than the free version?
[V],polisdavid,2011-09-27T05:57Z,"BradMacPro,

,keejoon,2011-09-27T06:30Z,"Thanks! After i install this file. the program was registered itself.

[T],nobody2007,2011-09-27T07:43Z,"Thanks, works like a charme."
,feedthekoala,2011-10-04T17:28Z,"Worked great, thank you so much! :)"
,bigmamajay,2011-10-07T16:58Z,"Install and relaunch System Prefs, works like a charm. Thanks!"
,nemosrings,2011-10-10T03:53Z,"Thanks. :) After installing the read me said to upgrade to pro. bleh, until I read the bit here about relaunching system prefs. Replaced my old v.2.2"
,nemosrings,2011-10-11T08:56Z,"Discovered this version Flip4Mac clashes with Photoshop CS2 & refuses to allow PS to open. grr. Why do I use CS2 Photoshop? Because there is a graphics problem, apparently due to an Apple issue that affects Photoshop CS5. It is impossible to cut cleanly in PS CS5 or apply effects cleanly along edges. You end up with 1-2 pixels along the edges with varying opacity. :("
,nemosrings,2011-10-11T08:58Z,1 to 3 pixels along the edges I meant.
,b1indfold,2011-10-14T10:55Z,"this does not work i have tried and tried and tried again and again and again, to relaunch from System Prefs and keeps crashing, crashing and crashing,..., you get the idea, FÂŁ@NG FRUSTRATING, i have uninstalled and reinstalled...., a few times, and .... nothing, honestly is a waste of time, does not seems cracked and does not even play or work any wmv files as the free version does. so guys be aware, no bullshitting but giving my honest oppinion. "
,KOATV,2011-11-26T19:46Z,"Hi Nemo!

You should try photoshop cs3... it works great on my Mac."
,bunnypup,2012-01-28T05:55Z,"Thanks for the share!  Will seed as I can.

(great torrent collection, BTW)"
,_Death_,2012-04-30T05:25Z,"blindfold is actually right. Unfortunately downloading this torrent and installing this Flip4Mac has no effect on Mac OS X applications that read windows media files (such as Roxio Toast Titanium). You might as well just get the free F4M from the Apple website. Even after ""restarting"" system preferences (not even sure how this differs from just closing it and reopening it), applications that require advanced features still ask that you upgrade to Pro. This torrent is a waste of time and useless."
,xmajd92,2012-05-27T16:42Z,I just downloaded it. At first it didn't work for me. But after updating the already cracked app it worked for me! Try it!
