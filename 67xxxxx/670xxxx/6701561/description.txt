Balu is a brilliant student and always tops     
Maha Lakshmi comes from a village and stays     
in Balu's house to do her graduation in the     
same college. Balu has the typical ego possessed
by state rankers and he is obsessed by it. His  
studies get disturbed with the entry to         
Maha Lakshmi as she starts dominating him       
over a period of time. This leads to            
differences and ego clashes between Balu and    
Maha Lakshmi. There is also a subplot of        
two separated grand parents. The rest of the    
story is all about how Balu and Mahalakshmi     
realize that they are made for each other.
