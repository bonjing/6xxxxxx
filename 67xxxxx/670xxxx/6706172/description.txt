Man @ Work is an album by Scottish singer Colin Hay, released in 2003. (See 2003 in music). The album is essentially a career-retrospective for Hay: he is best known as the lead singer for the 1980s Australian pop band Men at Work, and roughly half of the songs on this album are Hay's solo studio renditions of works from the Men at Work catalog, while several others are remixes or re-recordings of material from his solo albums. The songs vary from renditions that are almost identical to the original recordings (e.g. "Be Good Johnny") to complete reinterpretations (e.g. acoustic versions of "Down Under" and "Who Can It Be Now?").
