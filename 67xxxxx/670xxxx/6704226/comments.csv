your Request  :)

@rhondavarley first of all you need a torrent clinic, if you dont have one you can download it at www.utorrent.com  

2 when you download a torrent, and leave the torrent open (and don't delete the torrent) that means you seeding

3 to crate a torrent: in utorrent clinic, you will have to go to file,and select create new torrent,  select if you wanna add a file or directory, ones your done, just crate on account here and add your torrent, remember seed your torrents. :)  

plz comment if these helps  .. regards avrumi"
