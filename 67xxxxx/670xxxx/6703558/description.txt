The founder of Wine Tribune, Hammond offers a massive number of breezy oeneophile tips in a compact package. She begins simply, covering basics such as reading labels, food pairings and the logistics of ordering wine in a restaurant. The bulk of the book is devoted to regional styles, and there it really excels. Not only does Hammond cover France, Italy and Spain, she also offers insight into wines from Argentina, the Mediterranean and Switzerland, as well as the intricate classification of "growths" in Bordeaux and the Italian "Supertuscans," in an easy-to-follow manner. Regional varietals are discussed in detail and recommendations are offered for wines from particular purveyors, often taking budget into account. The format lends itself to reading in small doses, and the overall result is an insightful guide to the world of wine that keeps in mind the novice as well as the experienced wine drinker.
