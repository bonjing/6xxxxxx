My wife thanks you.  She recently learned she will succumb to metastasized breast cancer.

You are truly a wonder! One of a growing number to realize the personally rewarding fulfillment that comes from giving.  I sincerely appreciate your efforts.  You deserve all the praise and gratitude I can deliver. 

Thank you for all you do. We can sincerely use your gifts, and we are grateful.
