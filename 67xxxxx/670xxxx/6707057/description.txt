Nothing beats a good melody that you know and have heard before, and would love to hear again and again. That is the essence of Happy Jazz.
Swing & Dixie is Happy Jazz at its best. With a perfect blend of old time Swing and Dixieland jazz-standards, the band has earned a reputation of creating an atmosphere of warmth, humour, joyful grins and intense stomping feet wherever they perform.
You will catch a glimpse of the club atmosphere in the first seven songs that were recorded at the Falu Jazzclub.
The oldtimers, Arne, Hasse, Rolf and Lennart, with long experience from numerous bands, including Sandviken Big Band (which they founded), combined with fresh blood from the youngsters (Niklas and Geir), make a perfect mix of traditional, solid, back-beat and young, modern attitude.
Sit back, make room for your stomping feet and enjoy music from the happy days
