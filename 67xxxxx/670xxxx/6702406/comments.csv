,rgmontejo,2011-09-27T07:03Z,I guess there's something wrong with all Star Wars torrents coz whenever I start downloading them transmission and vuze stops working.

,DarthPS3,2011-09-28T08:29Z,"I've been through a few uploads of the Star Wars bluray's and these are by far the best. I remuxed it and coded the subs in so it would play on my PS3, and it looks sick. Thanks so much, these are the ones I will keep in my collection. "

Why?

Can you upload a separate file with the timecode & chapter titles (as others have done for subtitles)?

Thanks!"
,Sunofsomething,2011-10-15T19:29Z,I'm not getting any subtitles when they speak something other than English. Did I miss something when I downloaded it?
