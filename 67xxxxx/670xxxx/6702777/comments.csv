,PezDude,2011-09-27T20:00Z,"Worth pointing out that there's a MUCH better Genesis/Megadrive emulator out there. 
KEGA FUSION supports SegaCD and 32X! You'll need bios files but it works beautifully.!
Also Flarestorm is a better PS1 emulator though I admit it take a bit of tweaking to run properly..."
,surfkw,2011-09-27T23:49Z,I can't find much info online about emulator enhancer.  Specifically I'd like to know if it adds network play to any of the N64 emulators.  I added the folder to application support and see no signs of change in sixtyforce.  Any suggestions?
,MarkGibbons,2011-11-30T10:57Z,"I haven't really tried online emulating either to be honest. As far as I can see, emulation to me is playing classic games on different devices, Adding an online feature would change the actual rom, so I really can't help you, but if you do find out, I'd love to hear back from you. You can find out how to contact me via the torrent README. "
