"The Falcon and the D'Ohman"

Homer befriends Wayne (guest voice Kiefer 
Sutherland), a reserved security guard 
recently hired by the nuclear power plant. 
Plagued by violent flashbacks from his past 
as a CIA agent, he must overcome his 
tortured nightmares to save Homer from a 
Ukranian terrorist. Meanwhile, Marge 
fantasizes about being a contestant on "Top 
Chef" hosted by Tom Colicchio (guest voicing 
as himself), and the future of Springfield's 
hottest "it" couple Nedna, Edna Krabappel 
(guest voice Marcia Wallace) and Ned 
Flanders, will be revealed after months of 
online fan voting and speculation.
