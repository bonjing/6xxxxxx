,contacme,2011-10-07T19:59Z,"I am trying to play it on VLC player but the print is extremely bad, the movie stops and play, stops and play. It is totally unwatchable.

I tried to play it with windows media player and Quick Time, but both failed to play it.

Is the print atrocious or something is wrong with the VLC player?"

This movie is awesome. ( meant to be watched in english, although hindi audio is released in india )"
,leech007,2011-10-21T20:56Z,"@skt12: I don't think Indian films require 6 channels of audio. Stereo is more than sufficient for the ""sound effects"" in bollywood films."
