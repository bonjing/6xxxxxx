Story
====== 

23 18 "One Shall Fall"[20] Vinton Heuck Duane Capizzi
Joseph Kuhr September 24, 2011[20] August 21, 2011 123 

Optimus became concerned that a prophecy detailed in the Covenant of Primus was imminent and 
that Megatron could regard it as his destiny. When Agent Fowler reported that the Decepticons 
were stealing components for a new space bridge, Optimus took a team to a military lab to stop them. 
Though they stopped the Vehicons from stealing the power source, Megatron himself arrived and before 
they could react, Bumblebee also arrived with a gravely injured Raf. While 'Bee and Arcee returned 
Raf to base, Optimus and Bulkhead snuck aboard the Nemesis to retrieve the power source. They located it, 
and Prime sent Bulkhead back to base with it, while he went in search of Megatron. He found his prey near 
a volcano and the ancient enemies fought. Optimus managed to fell Megatron, but as he prepared to deliver 
a killing blow, the volcano erupted with Dark Energon. Megatron experienced an increase in power, 
and turned the tide. The prophesized alignment of worlds had occurred, and Megatron had Optimus at his mercy.

First Appearance: Unicron (Cameo)

Reference: The famous Transformers line (first used in The Transformers feature film, The Transformers: The Movie) 
"One shall stand. One shall fall" was used in this episode. In the beginning of the episode, Optimus recites the 
Covenant of Primus, which first appeared in the Transformers: Beast Wars episode: "Nemesis, Part 1." 
Megatron refers to Optimus as "the last of the Primes," which he is also called in the same continuity video game, 
Transformers: War for Cybertron. This also is a term to refer to Optimus in the live-action films. 
Megatron used the term "rising darkness" various times in this episode, this is a reference to the Mini-Series' 
title "Darkness Rising".

Fact: Starscream is absent for the fifth time in this episode.
