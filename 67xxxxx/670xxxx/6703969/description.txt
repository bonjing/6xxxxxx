I Like Trains Lyrics
-------------------------------------------------

I LIKE TRAINS

Hey! Have you heard of the I Like Trains kid?
He\\\'s pretty cool, but I think there\\\'s something wrong with him
I don\\\'t know if he\\\'s cursed, or if it\\\'s something with his brain
But the only thing he ever says is:

I LIKE TRAINS

From birth the I Like Trains kid never spoke a word
Not even to his parents, not a single sounds was heard
But on the first day of school the teacher asked his name
All he did was smile as he said:

I LIKE TRAINS

They put him on some Ritalin to see if that would help
The doctor found the perfect dose and asked him how he felt
He stared at the doctor with that same creepy smile
And the I Like Trains kid said:

\\\"I feel great!\\\"

He got a fancy job and he straightened out his life
He met a nice girl who he asked to be his wife
As they stood at the altar, and prepared to say their vows
He put a ring on her finger, and he said:

I LIKE TRAINS

Got bad grades? I like trains!
Awkward date? I like trains!
Don\\\'t like trains? ...

I LIKE TRAINS (double chorus)
