,pixz561,2011-12-13T20:48Z,"Yoo, but like more than HALF of the extensions don't work, i try to use an instrument and the message pops up, ""Access violation at address 06B044EA in module 'Nexus.dll'. Read of address 73F13210."". WTF DOES THAT MEAN!! How do I fix it?"

,Zelash,2011-12-26T15:50Z,"At first I also thought that like half of the expansions wasn't working - most of them just crashed the program - but then I downloaded one of those AiR Licenser Emulator, works fine now.

and HOLY SHIT ITS OWSOME, THANKS TONNY!

Though Classic Trance still says that I need to update Nexus, but who cares, tons of other sounds to play with!"
