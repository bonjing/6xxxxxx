This is the 2nd Dead Island patch by Skidrow.  It was removed by the hosted website but I decided to put it up here to share! :D

Instructions:

-BACK UP YOUR ORIGINAL FILES.  Just in case something goes wrong, make sure you are able to go back to the original state.
-Open the .RAR file using 7Zip or WinRAR
-Copy over the files into your Dead Island directory and replace the previous files.
-Enjoy!

WARNING
Updating your game will likely delete your save file!  If you do not wish for this to happen, either do not update your game or find a way to not have this happen.  I apologize but I am unsure as to how to keep the save file. :(


Support the creators!  If you like the game, buy it!
