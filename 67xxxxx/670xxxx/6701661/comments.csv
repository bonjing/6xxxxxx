,justmealwatts,2011-09-26T23:06Z,"Here are the directions:

1.Install the setup.exe

2.copy the patch and paste it to the installation folder and run the patch from inside of the install folder which is located in C:\Program Files\Anti Trojan Elite. (you will see that the patching is done successfully)

3.Restart your computer.

4. Start the program/go to About/ and you will see ""This copy is registered by............""

5. Go to Options and choose ""Auto detect new version online"" and choose ""NO"" and click ""OK""

5.Done

*** This was installed and activated on XP Pro/SP3 x86 ***

OMG!!! I have finally contributed some little something to The Pirate Bay (I think)"

,justmealwatts,2011-09-27T04:30Z,"I just happen to have Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 x64 and I have installed the program and it is registered.

1. I disconnected the internet and my UAC is disabled by choice 

2. Ran the .exe

3. Restarted the computer

4. Copy and paste the crack in the Program Files x86/ Anti Trojan Elite

5. Ran the patch inside of the folder and it successfully patched.

6. Restarted the computer 

7. Enabled the internet

8. Started the program and went to ""About"" and it shows registered. Go to ""Options"" and choose ""NO"" to Auto detect new version online and I also chose to not start with Windows (personal choice)

9. I also did auto update online and it confirms that I have the latest version

10. Bottom line: Activated and running on Windows 7 Ultimate x64 with SP1"
,underclock4,2011-09-28T12:23Z,"To all those who cannot get this to work follow the directions given by @justmealwatts but run the patch as administrator. 
I was having problem installing this on my w/7 sp1 but when running the patch via administrator mode it patched without a hitch.
Hope this helps and a big thank you to the up-loader.

Cheers!"
