,privateer2day,2011-09-28T07:35Z,Extremely low quality for the large file size. 
,matiasdf,2011-09-28T10:05Z,"It's not my fault. That's how my source looks. I can assure you that it looks much more acceptable in motion. This is NOT the same as the DVD version. This is a now gone (as far as still in print releases go) open-matte version, which shows more picture at the top and at the bottom. 

The reason i made it with such a large file size, is to avoid introducing even more artifacts to the picture than the source already has. This is the best quality rip available online of this version of the movie, that's what you get for a laserdisc from back in 1982..."
,privateer2day,2011-09-29T08:37Z,I understand. Thanks for your efforts to share. 
,matiasdf,2011-10-01T06:28Z,"May anyone please help me seeding? 

Also, does anybody already have the full file?"
,matiasdf,2011-10-02T15:08Z,"Those who are already done downloading, what do you think?"
,matiasdf,2011-10-09T17:36Z,"After some serious brainstorming (comparison of DVD vs. this), I can tell you that this movie's true aspect ratio is neither this' 1.33:1 nor the DVD's 1.78:1/1.85:1 (it depends on your region code) but rather a midway 1.66:1 ratio.

This, of course means that BOTH the DVD and this LD are cropped. Which means that neither of these are to be seen as OAR. 

I guess we'll have to wait.
"
,niggerplz,2011-11-13T04:52Z,"Comparing this one with the vhs and dvd rips the AR on this is completely off, the other two are pretty close, and the dvd is the only version thats cropped and cut down. The quality of this is slightly higher than the vhs, but still nowhere near dvd quality. 

Is it worth having a low res version? Maybe if you like that little house on the prairie look, or you're dyin to have 3 more frames of preteen vag in your collection. Whatever. 
"
,matiasdf,2011-11-14T17:18Z,"Whatever. While you have a point, I'm sure there are many people out there who'd want to have this version of the movie."
