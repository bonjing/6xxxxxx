,awinahe,2011-09-27T10:57Z,"Im mad at myself! I should have wait for your upload... I already downloaded terra nova and alphas! What a waste of time... I always choose your files first because of the good quality in small files... I should have been more patient! Next time, promise, I WAIT lol... Anyways, thanks for your great job!"
