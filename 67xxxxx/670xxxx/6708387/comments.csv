,hendo666,2011-09-30T16:01Z,"Hmm...all his other films have been amazing, chronos being my fav.I'l, be let down if its not good. Suppose the thing is all the others were in spanish, with unknown spanish actors which gave them that edge. This is a 'hollywood' production, bit of a sell out on his behalf. As for quality of the rip, do you even need to ask when its bone. Cheers bone:)"
