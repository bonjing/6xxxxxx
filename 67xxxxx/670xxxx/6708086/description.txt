Have you ever wondered if you need to use a flash in sunlight?  What the best lighting is for a macro shot?  How long your exposure should be in low lighting?  If you have, this book is for you!  Lighting affects composition, focus, exposure decisions, and pretty much everything about taking a picture. Further, the mood of the photograph is totally dependent on the lighting - and can make or break the image. It is also one of the hardest things for a budding photographer to grasp. The existing lighting books tend to require expensive equipment and extensive knowledge on how to light photos.  For those who aren't at that level yet, this guide shows how to take shots in certain settings and times, such as lighting for specific seasons, back-lighting, water lighting, available light at mid-day, and more. Loaded with photos, tips, tricks, and inspiration, you can't  help but walk away from this book with the critical knowledge you need to know to take the perfect picture.
