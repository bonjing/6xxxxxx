,Teverant,2012-01-26T11:46Z,"I've downloaded this and the x64 version and I can't get either of them working without generating a .script file first and loading that up. This is happening on my Win7 x64bit machine. If I load it up on my XP netbook, it works fine. Any ideas? Can't find any similar instances of failure. It skips right past the render generation and goes to the render que and doesn't load up a file because no .script has been generated."
