""Rookie.Blue.S02E13.HDTV.XviD-TLA.On.The.Double ""
and
""Rookie.Blue.S02E12.PROPER.HDTV.XviD-2HD.On.The.Double""

Did you just name S02E13 wrong or are they the same file?"

Thanks for pointing this out, FAnMCName ;).

I accidently named S02E13 wrong.
It is NOT the same episode like S02E12.
The correct title for S02E13 would be ""God's Good Grace"".

Cheers"
