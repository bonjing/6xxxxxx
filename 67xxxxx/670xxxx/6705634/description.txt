Attempting to cash-in on the generation gap phenomenon, "The People Next Door" purports to be an expose of the of the typical modern American family. The dark underbelly behind the hypocritical facade is revealed. Mom and dad find their virginal teen daughter tripping in her closet and running away to be with her biker boyfriend. The neighbor's wife is a total boozer and their Ivy league-bound son is the local pill pusher. "Who are The People Next Door? They are you, they are me." (IMDB)

This is a very rare film. It came from a dvd rip of an old vhs tape so the quality isn't great, but it's the best copy I've found so far. If anyone has  better, PLEASE upload! I'd love to have a higher quality edition myself.
