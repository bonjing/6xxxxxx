,RubbingHood,2011-09-26T16:45Z,Legit. I wish insinuendo seeded it though.
,MrBalle,2011-09-26T16:46Z,"Great, been waiting for your upload!"
,a_79,2011-09-26T17:00Z,Please seed!
,MustangFord,2011-09-26T17:51Z,"100 peers, all at 7% - Is anyone seeding this at all? ArtVandelay is clearly NOT the new superuploader...."
,MustangFord,2011-09-26T17:58Z,SLOW!
,sup2010,2011-09-26T18:18Z,seed!
,MrBalle,2011-09-26T18:32Z,"@MustangFord, I'm at 15% so not all are stuck on 7%. ""so don't be a bitch, bitch!"". Learn the basics of torrenting before posting."
,undercash,2011-09-26T18:44Z,"i love those release, but you need to upload this to a server first before publishing the file"
,MustangFord,2011-09-26T18:53Z,"ok, I'm a noob (20 percent now btw) - Please tell me how, if possible, to connect to more seeds. I see them in the swarm but cant connect."
,MustangFord,2011-09-26T18:56Z,"Also Balle, you'll notice I never used the word ""stuck"".  I posted 40 mins before you....."
,spacelord76,2011-09-26T19:00Z,Grrrrreat!!! Thank you!

,Tropius__B,2011-09-26T19:19Z,"Wow, a whole lot of bitches whining about being stuck.

Here's the thing, when I start it later in the week, in finishes pretty damn quick. Today, I am starting it on monday and there's only 8 seeders..

Regardless of the fact that it will take longer, I am still pretty sure it will be done at a sooner time than if I wait until later to start it."
,Andrew2011,2011-09-26T19:37Z,"10 kbyte/sec? ARE YOU KIDDING???
Creator, do you have superseeding option on or off?"
,luqaskr,2011-09-26T20:59Z,any seeders???:-(
,Eejay.Jauregg,2011-09-26T21:39Z,"guys, i seriously cannot take this... pls seed!"
,dstgjdgj,2011-09-26T22:04Z,"164 seederes, cannot conect to any of them. This has stopped at 73% now. Have uploaded close to 3 GB..."
,Eirik_FS,2011-09-26T22:21Z,"DAMN YOU LEECHERS! All stuck on 75%, earlier there was a dude with 100% but he left.."
,guy_wild,2011-09-26T22:28Z,"Patience is a virtue indeed. 

Remember we all share the slow connection artvandelay2007 mentions in the description. And we share it until a few of us are done. Torrenting 101. 

Btw... can anyone explain to me why so many get the Immerse instead of waiting a bit longer to get this much better rip?"
,a_79,2011-09-26T22:34Z,"77%, uploaded 34,2 GB, ratio 30.6."
,ricky5005,2011-09-26T23:21Z,114 seeds and not a single one is active?
,artvandelay2007,2011-09-27T00:07Z,Too much ungrateful bitching. I've stopped seeding and you useless complainers can get it yourselfs.
[T],insinuendo,2011-09-27T00:14Z,"Yup...there...you got it...

Bitches :)"
,balanced,2011-09-27T00:18Z,You have to wait a bit to get some speed.  I just started it and although granted my pipe is a pathetic 5Mbps Canadian CRTC special it's totally being filled right now with an ETA of only 1 hour.  Thanks so much vandelay for putting this up for those of us who will wait for a proper rip that isn't inappropriately packaged (RARed) for NNTP when in fact everyone knows that is more of a nuisance than a help when it comes to the torrent method of distribution.
,ultraVert,2011-09-27T09:09Z,"Hey artvandelay2007 thanks a lot for this, it's appreciated!"
,OKtoaster,2011-09-27T18:35Z,"artvandelay2007 uploads the wb-dl version of a highly popular TV-show, with a seriously slow connection. People point this out, and how he could fix it. Artvandelay2007 takes these comments personally, and stops seeding. Time for someone to grow up?

People get the immerse version because they've been looking forwards to seeing the episode and don't want to wait another day. Shouldn't be too hard to figure out. The immerse version is way good enough for a normal pair of eyes and a normal screen."
,Ba1tuks,2011-09-27T18:51Z,"You have to put to the shame yourself! People works hard to put something on torrents, because of you. It's for free, but almost all of you crying, despite feeling glad!!! :-("
,Orchonic,2011-09-28T22:07Z,"GAWSH PPL, LESS QQ, MORE PEW PEW"
,cuntmug,2011-10-15T21:51Z,Thank you very much!
,Guija,2011-12-14T01:18Z,Thank you so much for the upload!
