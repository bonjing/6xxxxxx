,JARX,2011-09-29T03:53Z,"Does this work with achievements?

afaik you need them for the game to work properly (to unlock new things)"
[T],alexisthebest,2011-09-29T04:29Z,"@JARX

According to their steam page, there are no achievements.

There are unlockable classes in game, but that's about it.

There should be no problems and the game should work properly."
