[V],globeplus,2011-09-28T11:20Z,"To tim19155 : i donÂ´t know if your comment is a tactic to get information about the veracity of the file or if it is a bad joke , one thing it is for shore : THE FILE IS REAL AND WORK FINE AND I DONÂ´T LIKE UNPROVED SPECULATION ON MY FILES , GOT IT ? suppose it was you uploading a nice movie file maded with all the care to all the possible users and then someone start saying that your file maded with lot of work was a fake , i am shore that if you read a thing like that you probably get pieced off ... ok , i donÂ´t want you around my comments specially with comments that can cause doubts for the download to the possible users , only talk a thing like that when you are shore about you are saying ... thank you ."
[V],globeplus,2011-09-28T11:23Z,To irishboyblue : thank you for your comment and you welcome to download any of my files wherever you want . 
,noel_lee,2011-09-28T12:21Z,thanks globeplus for this one at this size.really amazing you are.@tim19255 probably he is high.
[V],globeplus,2011-09-28T13:25Z,"To Noel_Lee : thank you for your comment and with my slow net connection i need to upload the files for not too much size and you can believe me when i tell you that this video type (RMVB) guarantees a nice screen definition for not too much size including an automatic compression of the video , the more common video types can have close 10% of compression and an RMVB for close half size than an avi for example keeps the screen definition , the flv for example after the conversion for this kind of bitrate works fine but when you watch the converted flv video in full screen you get a normal tendence to a pixelization of the screen , what i mean is that an RMVB with 200 mb for example in full screen view keeps the video definition as an 600 mb flv or something like that , for close half size or less than the flvs the picture view still ok in full screen keeping the correct definition and this carachteristic is amazing somehow , another thing like i said you canÂ´t compress a RMVB to get less size with 7zip for example , this video type is already compressed , what you willl get is a 7zip file with the same size than the video file , other video types if you do that you have a chance to get near 10% or something on the compression on the 7zip , i am talking about this as an another interesting carachteristic of this type of video , so with this video type we get the video file with a very nice screen definition for smaller sizes and with the video already compressed in his normal state for the viewing ... the RMVB video are really recommended to get smaller size movie files on the net and the prove is that almost all the new nice movies normally are getting 2 versions at least to be getted on the file sharing services by links , a first one avi or mp4 for 800mb or more and an RMVB for close 300 and something and this is even more understandable after getting this RMVBs and find out the nice viewing of the movie like the big size avis like nothing going on and not a single thing to borring on the view compared to the avis or mp4 , what you can do is to convert with a nice converter the downloaded RMVB to an high quality avi or mp4 and then work the downloaded cam with the Virtual Dub making all the possible improves that can be possible to make with the video and after that if you want get a new RMVB with a converter and this time with everything improved and resolution corrected .

See you around and happy movie .  "
,carlozone,2011-09-29T00:32Z,"@tim19255 fuck off and stop spamming fake comments you dick! Your not even an uploader so why the fuck do you get off on pissing people off!
@globeplus, keep up the good work pal and ignore the haters."
[V],globeplus,2011-09-29T10:36Z,"To carlozone : thank you for your commeny friendly user , the point is that many times for new movies can always happen the possibility of fakes and piratebay simply delete them many times as necessary but also can have the possibility of beeing a good torrent file specially if you donÂ´t have any clue for the contrary , just making speculation depreciating the file is not correct , the more correct procedure is to downloadand after get the file talk if it is the case but i repeat to the fake torrent files infractors : piratebay delete the files once is proved they are not ok to the users !!!

Thank you again and you welcome anytime ."
