,TrustedQualityRatings,2011-09-29T02:23Z,"I WILL! rate this when it is finished downloading! Keep checking back. As always you can trust my ratings unlike some people on here which is why I created this account. 

I will rate as a cam and as a whole both out of 10 and also provide feedback and details about the quality."

,TrustedQualityRatings,2011-09-29T03:48Z,"BASED ON THE FIRST 10 MINS:

9/10 for a Cam
7/10 in general quality

MOVIE IS IN ENGLISH!
This copy is so good, I didn't even think it was a cam. The only reason I gave it a 9 instead of a pure 10 is because there is a blurred line through out the entire movie that runs along the bottom of the screen, but it's not thick and it is on the bottom. You can see the movie just fine. Oh and another reason is because you cannot remove the foreign subtitles. Other then that, this is about as good as Cam rips get and I'm still not even sure if it is a cam. It looks like a defective VHS screener or something. I can't rate the movie yet because I haven't finished watching it. So far though, the quality looks tip top!   

Hope I helped! :)"
