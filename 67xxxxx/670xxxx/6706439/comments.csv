,brizownthepi,2011-09-28T20:10Z,"Also like to point out that I'm in SE Alaska, where GCI basically has a monopoly on high-speed internet.  I have a 150 Gig data transfer limit monthly, and seeding these albums is going to cost me money, as I am already approaching my monthly limit.  Show some fucking gratitude asshole.

And please keep seeding!!"
