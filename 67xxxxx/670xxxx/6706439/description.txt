From jambase.com:

Early in 1978 Frank Zappa played London's Hammersmith Odeon and these concerts provided the source for the Basic Tracks for 1979's Sheik YerBouti. Hammersmith Odeon, compiled & produced by Gail Zappa and Joe Travers is now available in the Special Party Pack 3-CD set designed to celebrate FZ's 70th Birthday on December 21.
Mixed in NYC by Frank Filipetti, none of these tracks have been previously released and the track listing mirrors and/or parallels the set lists of the concerts. Peter Wolf, former band-member and current multi-faceted producer/arranger contributed Liner Notes.

The band is Frank Zappa, Lead Guitar & Vocals, Terry Bozzio, Drums & Vocals, Patrick O'Hearn, Bass & Vocals, Adrien Belew, Guitar & Vocals, Tommy Mars, Keys & Vocals, Peter Wolf, Keys and Ed Mann, Percussion.
