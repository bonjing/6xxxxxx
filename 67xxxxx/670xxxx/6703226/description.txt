The history of The Baseballs began in 2007 in Berlin. Sam, Basti and Digger met by chance in a recording studio and started doing cover versions of songs from the Fifties and Sixties. But soon they discovered the appeal of transforming modern songs into a rock n roll style, or in the bands own words: We take good songs and lead them to their true destiny.

The release of Strike! in May 2009 turned everything upside down for the three young guys. The album scored major impact, in the following 18 months they toured almost non-stop throughout Europe, played hundreds of concerts, performed at festivals for enthusiastic audiences of thousands and received countless awards (among these the Emma Award in Finland for the best-selling album of the year) and along the way sold nearly one million albums. In recognition of their international success the band was presented the European Border Breakers Award 2011 as Europes most successful new band at the Eurosonic Festival in Holland in Janaury 2011.

With Stringsâ€™nâ€™Stripes Sam, Basti and Digger release their second album on April 15. They remain true to themselves and their love of the sound of the Fifties and Sixties, this time around presenting their own versions of California Girls (Katy Perry), Quit Playing Games (Backstreet Boys) or Paparazzi (Lady Gaga).
