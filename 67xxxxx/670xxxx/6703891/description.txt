Despite what the title of this CD says,
this is not the Ultimate Ballads album in any respect
of using that phrase honestly - however there are some
great enough songs on here (Ive added some bonus tracks
for good measure)that it should do a nice job for those
that especially like contemporary artists and yet have
a taste for greatness from the likes of Pavarotti - also
included here with his great song Caruso. It is not the
ultimate song speaking in respect of the lyrics, however
it is one of the best songs ever recorded for its beautiful
melody and sound of the words spoken.


It would have been better to include "aint no sunshine"
by Tom Jones rather than Green Green grass - for this
collection - and so look for the included bonus track
as indicated.

Likewise "Have i told you lately" would have been the best
song from Rod Stewart's collection of offerings
rather than the song by him we instead found on the CD. 
That said, I opted for the bonus track of the title
by the original artist - Van Morrison in grand style
equally!


Also the 40s and 50s is the best place to reach
back to if you do the theme justice and in this
respect please look to our other postings here 
too as I have lots already previously launched
for you to enjoy and to build up a collection
with.

Enjoy!
