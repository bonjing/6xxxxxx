Yeah.. That's because the word is not possible to write correctly in western signs anyway, and thus it is 'translated' in various ways according to who and where you are. You see; TPB's db doesn't support Hebrew lettering..

Quabballa'h would be closer, but remember that the last a has a 'hcc' -type sound in it as well..

So, if it makes me feel any better; you misspelled it too..

@ramikaz: 'Anything involving the jew is to be avoided/boycotted.'

I am a Jew, and I use Israel as a name of honor, in spite of what the 'leaders' in the area known as respectively Philistine/Palestine and Israel is doing to destroy the great name Jacob was given by God.

By faith, I am a Jew, and as such I advice you to take your slur and post-it on the wall of the places where your fellow.. ..ahmm.. ..people dwell.

Or you'd rather not, really, you just don't know why yet. I will, however, pray for you, and my God is an awesome God. You'll be amazed. I just hope you'll be amazed before it's too late..

@ramiraz: Come on.. No matter what we think of the people ruling this world, there is nothing to gain for anyone in boycotts and such. I don't mean that 'anything goes', because it most definitely doesn't, but there are things, agendas, lurking in all of this, seemingly, chaos.

There is chaos, but it's all a means to divide us into groups, quarreling, arguing and killing each other.

'Divide and conquer', 'Ordo ab Chao'..
Loads and loads of stuff that tell a broader story of all this we see unfolding around us..
Haven't you seen it?

Please; don't take this badly, that's not my intention. I just think it's waaay better to listen to someone who has seen a little more than the 'dogma' that divide us.

A person that can see things from different perspectives, and inevitably therefore has a better way of communicating, can actually do some good in the midst of this hateful generation. I'm aspiring to be such a person.

I am sorry I haven't gotten further already, but I'm learning from the inside out..  

ANY suppression of people on the grounds of fascist control is a tear in God's eyes.

He WILL deal with it in His time, in His own way.
I take comfort in that, and I try to expose both the good God has in store for anyone that want it, AND the evil that men do in the name of God.

I truly hope that is what my torrents bear witness of..

,qwertzo99,2011-09-26T20:37Z,"My comment has nothing to do with this upload but since the comments above left in certain direction I'll add my 2 cents:

The mentality of jews is such that they are very aware they stole the land from the Palestinians (and keep on doing it) but continue to claim they belong there and Palestinians not with fanatical belief greater that that of fascism of ww2. Their belief in ""superiority"" over ALL other gentile people is strongly rooted in judaism and passed to ultra-nationalistic atheist jews (zionists). 
Israel is a country that has THE BIGGEST NUMBER OF UN CONDEMNATIONS all the while they portray themselves to be ""democratic"" while they have laws that forbid mixing of jews with others in order to keep the jewish blood pure. Imagine that. Pure!?! 

Countries are slowly beginning to see though the lies and are making a stand against Israel. Newest country is Norway. Just before the killings by a zionist Anders Breivik Norway banned all Israeli oil related companies to do business with Norway. 
USA is being bankrupted by wars it leads for Israel. Even while USA cuts on it's education and other social investments for it's people, billions of dollars that are given to Israel each year is never brought into question. 
It would seem Israel's ""honour"" has no problem with taking billions of dollars of handout from USA.

,ramikaz,2011-09-26T22:26Z,"@ qwertzo99, you are 100% correct of course, but the Zionist/racist jew media NEVER show the TRUTH about their behavior and only spread lies about Christians, Muslims, Arabs, Blacks, Chinese...

It's also interesting to see how the jew ALWAYS defend APARTHEID, rape, murder, occupation, concentration camps... as long as it's israel that does it, but they are still crying about a ""holocaust"" that allegedly happened more than 70 years ago while the REAL holocaust is still happening today in what's left of Palestine.  Where is the Justice and Reparations for the Palestinians?  They won't come until America is bankrupt and then with no protection from the USA, israel will disappear like a fart in the wind.

I have to ask; where did you get that info?
From thedailybeast.burp?
Because it's a known fact that Breivik actually published a nearly 1600 page manifesto online well before the killings, in which he clearly identifies himself with Nazi mindset and ultra-right views. The FR Party in Norway aren't too happy about it since he was the leader of the youth group of the party a few years back, and they're in opposition to the sitting government. At least that's what they're trying to give the impression of.. Thinking they're kings and queens, they're pawns..

Anyone who can't see his total commitment to Israel is blind.

..Or unknowing of what you claim. Like me. I was not aware of that, and the manifesto? I can't find it, and truly, if I could I wouldn't take the time to read it. There is no time for that, I'm sorry.
But I understand you have read it, so I'll just have to take your word for it. I'm not surprised, though. It's anyone's guess how it's all connected, but we do have a hunch, some of us, don't we?

It falls in line with the ugly ways of the NWO anyway (which 'Three world Wars' make so clear, btw..).

You see; on most counts we agree.
It's just; the spiritual Israel is the only real Israel as far as I'm able to see.

So when you say; 'I have nothing against jews as a whole but zionism, stealing land from other people and oppressing them for almost 50 years. And if you would be a real jew you would oppose Israel too, verifire. Orthodox jewish view is against creation of Israel by people. Real jews are against Israel and it's crimes against humanity.'

I can only say that this is absolutely true. I endorse it from a worldly point of view, and as a statement I think God sees the same way. From what I've written in a post above this you can see that I do weep for the inflicted poor people of Palestine/Israel. More than you know. 

I have tried to explain this political charade masking as 'divine right' and 'license to kill' to many people. Often with no luck or goodwill as a result. I hate it when I see a Israeli 'star of David' -flag in Christian assemblies. In fact it has never been any 'star of David', but it is known as the 'grand seal of Solomon', and is one of the most.. ..revered and feared..(?) ..magickal symbols there is. [Ooops! ..And we're actually touching qaba'lah here. Go figure.. Is this 'thread' back on the rails? ;-) ]

But, and I know this might look like I'm evading the issue on the table atm, but it's not like that; I can't seem to see any way around it, it seems to me that this in fact is bound to be this way for a while still, so that all our thoughts can reach their end and be revealed. But I firmly believe that there will be loads of people from the Gaza for instance, that will stand as witnesses with God to judge the evildoers. (I'm sorry for using such a 'oldfashioned' word, but bear with me, please. ;-)

Come to think of it: Jesus made the most radical statements against the very same forces that rule today when He was there about 2000 yrs ago, calling them 'vipers and offspring of vipers', 'hypocrites and whitened graves, outwardly squeaky clean, but on the inside only dead men's bones'  Loosely quoted, and just to mention some of it.

But none of us are without guilt in this or that. The one who claims otherwise is either blind or a liar.

But back to the rest of your comment.. [ ;-) ]:

'And it's nice to see your attempt to lead the argument in different direction and not touching on the points I made:

I agree. I tried to lead the conversation away from the temporary, visible, evil that goes on.
I tried to expand the picture a little by trying to focus on the spiritual aspects of a human being instead of the outward manifestations we see, for instance, in Palestine/Israel.

Because there is a bigger picture.

MY view?
1. The stealing of land. Actually, the inhabitants of palestine, or rather those who owned the land that was set up as Israel in 1948, had actually SOLD most of it to 'English owners' to quote Israels Dec. of Indep. at the time, or 'British Mandate Palestine' to be pertinent.

G. Ford sr. wrote 'The International Jew' in 1920, setting the standard and also peoples hearts on fire, which helped build up for the next stage after the 1. WW. > WW2.

[T],verifire,2011-09-28T22:30Z,"..The 'comment' got too long.. That's why I said forums are better for this. But it's probably read by more people in here.. 

OK. Onward:

'Result? A place for the 'Israelis' (read: Zionists') to make preparations for the third stage and the rebuilding of the Jewish temple in Jerusalem, and the coming full scale war that will start between the political Zionist 'Israel' and the 'Muslim World'.

Am I against such occupation? Indeed. My Jerusalem is free and heavenly. It's not the old ruins on the two mountains.
In Revelations, the city is described by an angel as '..the great city, which spiritually is called
Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.' But it is the scene where very important events still will have to happen, culminating in the fulfillment of God's secret; the resurrection of the dead in Christ, those that haven't worshiped the beast, but follow and have in their lives the testimony of Jesus.

..Which doesn't mean I'm one of those that thinks anyone that haven't heard the name Jesus goes to hell. That monstrosity is a twisted gospel. Paul explains that it is not so in the first chapters of his letter to the Romans.

OK?

2. 'Biggest number of UN condemnations in the world'.
Not surprised. Not at all. Probably well deserved, but there should be more on that list than them, don't you think? ALL oppression and schemes to destroy and kill should be on that list of condemnations. ..Which STILL doesn't mean I'm trying to whitewash 'Israel', or rather Zionism. Zionism is fascism at large.

Do I say this to please you? No, I don't. In fact that would be very foolish of me, since I more than likely will alienate a lot of people with what I write here.
I don't care. The truth have to be told, and this is what I feel about these, 'half-worldly' matters.

And I still cry and feel the anger at the thought of the warcrimes the 'Israeli' government with their rabbis as 'moral backbone' have committed, and do commit. It's not hard to get to such a stand. All one have to do is to Google; 'gaza attack, dead children, phosphorous, tungsten..' etc in any combination.

The ones that see such things on for instance youtube and doesn't cry, is either dead or evil.

3. 'Laws against mixing of blood'.
Still not surprised, and it only goes to show how worldly-minded the people that sets these laws are. To me this is insanity, given the time and age. The law they base this on, was only a shadow, a picture, of the real principle: In my blood is my soul, and I can not mix my soul, my life and thoughts, with someone that opposes my soul. That would not be possible without giving in and making a hollow believer out of me. But the Zionists have never seen any real use in such spiritual pictures. They're still living in the old ways inherited from their 'rabbinic' teachings, faaar away from even the law of Moses. Even Jesus himself pointed this out to the religious leaders, which in Israel at least since then have been the true political force at work. Because Moses actually told the story he experienced, but it is just a picture, 'a shadow' if you please, of the things that were to come.
A new creature in Christ is all that matters now.

4. '-Inherent racism even in religious views'.
Well, of course. How could it not be so?
The reason I wrote that I hated the sight of the grand seal of Solomon in Christian assemblies, yes even as silver and gold necklages etc [..stuff you couldn't get your hands on just a few decades ago, btw, without going to a 'certified' witch, made by a which, to buy. hat was before it was 'braindoctrinated' into the Christian world as a symbol for love for Gods people. They just don't understand the difference between flesh and spirit. Please forgive them. But I still shake my head in sorrow when I see that..]

OK. Onward again:

'..I wonder if the Christians that support these people knows that?
I surely hope not, or we are looking at the most insane setup of all time.

So: If we add yours to mine, I'm thinking we're not so different. Except for seeing things from different angles, we're quite.. ..compatible..?

And, to take up your sentiment on Freemasonry/Zionism; Freemasonry is built upon the 'secret teachings' of the Zohar and the Jewish witches and their 'wisdom'.
It's not to blame Freemasons for what the Zionist do; it's making a link between the two, and see that world domination is their mutual goal.. Who's being played by who, remains to be seen.

Do I have proof? Yes I do. Loads of it. All I had to do was dig for it.. It's to broad a theme to talk about here beyond what's been said already.

I just want to make clear that I do not defend the Zionist empire, neither the Norwegian government, the US, the Russian, Chinese.. Nor do I take sides with anyone except for the poor people that's wedged in between these forces right now. That includes you and me too.

I am trying to look at this from a spiritual point of view, and that is also the reason for this upload, like so many other of my uploads: To alert blue-eyed, kind, deceived people about the grim facts: That if you're not aware of the people that's trying to play you any way they can, then you are hopelessly blinded.
I'm just trying to change that. And, in fact [and again I do not say this to please you. i say it because i mean it.]: What you write in the above and what I've had to answer hopefully furthers that mission. The truth still sets free from false impressions, and truth and grace is love.

And to end it all; have you seen the art of David Dees? I have. I think you'll get a kick out of it..
Search and download.. He tries to make some money out of his art, but mostly he's too engaged in this stuff to make anything else..

I hope I've answered your points to satisfaction. It was never my will to have it look like I supported Zionism. Qaba'lah is just the magickal side of Zionism..

Man, have I put my foot in it now..
Oh well. Truth be told..
