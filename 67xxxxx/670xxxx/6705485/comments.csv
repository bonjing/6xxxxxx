Plz look before u post comments like this. its a valid release from reloaded. Cheers"
,americanderp,2011-09-27T17:35Z,"iits reloaded, just 14 of the same torents in a row"
,Arayas,2011-09-27T21:30Z,"Solution:
Don't need to install!
1. make a file on your PC
2. mount .iso and copy all the files from it in your new folder
3. add the fifa.exe from a crack only torrent available, this for example http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6705393/FIFA_12_-_RELOADED_CRACK_only
4. click on fifa.exe and play the game

Don't install the game, you don't need to. "
