This looks like a complete manual, all in PDF form. There's no index or page to tie it all together, but it's organized into folders and is pretty easy to find what you want.  Maintenance, inspection, removal and install instructions, wiring diagrams, troubleshooting, fluid and torque specifications are all here.
Huge thanks for the effort to get this together."
