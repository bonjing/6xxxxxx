Sorry there are no subs on this, but it is really just a music video (with a bit of background extras related to the song and video). A running commentary about the making with Hard Gay and Real Gay in a little box comprises the main extra.

The song, "Young Man", is a Japanese version of "YMCA". His costume has gotten a bit gaudier for this outing. Hey, learn a new thing everyday!  I always thought gaudy came from the name of the Spanish Architect Antonio Gaudi. Not that I thought his buildings fit the word, but figured someone else (a critic perhaps) might have thought so.

Hard Gay Ramon may be best described as a Japanese living and breathing Tom of Finland action figure, though his performance art is more along the lines of early Ali G.

If you haven't found any of his stuff with English subtitles, there are a few uploads already here. I recommend his cooking and social improvement guerrilla street performances. They are collected here, in avi format:

...a couple of hours of Japanese high camp weirdness.

This one is only about ten minutes, from 

an uncompressed NTSC DVD5, VIDEO_TS files.
