Allmusic Review:
Avalon was the first album John Tesh released since his blockbuster Live at Red Rocks, and its expertly paced and engaging music indicates that he learned something from the consistency of the live record. Although Avalon isn't its equal, it's nevertheless one of his very best works, featuring cool, measured performances from Tesh and a pleasingly trancy set of songs that will appeal to any fan of Red Rocks.
