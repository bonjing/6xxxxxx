Fringe Season 1 and 2 Extras consists of a mixture between PAL and NTSC Retail
DVD's source clips to get the best quality. The extra's on the BluRay's were SD
quality, so no difference there. Most of the Dissected Files and some of the
other Extra's are from NTSC source. Dutch subtitles are from PAL DVD's, English
subtitles are from NTSC DVD's. Extras that have [!] in their name is a spoiler
warning and it is recommended to watch the whole season first.
