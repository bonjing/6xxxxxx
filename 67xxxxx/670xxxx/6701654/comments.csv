video slighty better than extremezone's. 
blurry bar at top im pretty sure is blocking the timestamps for the movie. thats cool though, you can figure out the time layout with your brain, if you have one.

anywho thanks, any chance of another earth?"
,row123,2011-10-09T22:13Z,"cool movie waited for this a long time ,finally got to see it. more like from a few peoples point of view of the end of the earth than millions of people running around like crazy, good quiet afternoon sunday movie."
