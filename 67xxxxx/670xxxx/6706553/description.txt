                             The Complete Season 4


Damages is an American television drama series.

The series revolves around the brilliant, ruthless lawyer, Patty Hewes (Glenn Close), her protÃ©gÃ©e, Ellen Parsons (Rose Byrne), and the law firm, Hewes & Associates (located in New York City). Each season features a major case that Hewes and her firm take on, while also examining a chapter of the complicated relationship between Ellen and Patty. The series is also known for its depiction of the season-long cases both from the law firm's point of view and from the target's point of view. The series has attracted many stars to play characters on the side against Hewes, including Ted Danson, William Hurt, Marcia Gay Harden, Martin Short, Lily Tomlin, and John Goodman. Close and first-season star Zeljko Ivanek won Emmys for their performances, while several other actors have been nominated.
