I'm not sure quite how to rate the video/audio but it sounds good and the picture quality is okay except perhaps just a little blurry. If I expect better, I guess I should buy the DVD when it becomes available.

Thanks so much for the upload, baltic8...I was wondering what had happened to Emilio. He's a MUCH better actor than his brother Charlie and seems to be much more like his dad...spiritually and otherwise.

Thank you again."
