Anyone D/L ""new folder"" posted mid september: contained Nokia manuals ? Torrent dying, would really like to get full copy or even more than 37.4 !"
,wackypete,2011-10-04T02:25Z,Is this R2011b? The notes above say release R2011a.
,zeally,2011-10-06T02:41Z,is this legit?
,zeally,2011-10-06T05:29Z,R2011b confirmed. Working great ! Thanks + seeding!
,ususu,2011-10-19T12:12Z,"Please, please post UNIX version!"
,nirgoen,2011-10-21T14:30Z,"Many Thanks!!!
It works fine on Win 7 Ultimate X86"
,kalmande,2011-10-25T11:01Z,"Confirmed. This is R2011b.

But it doesn't create any shortcuts and I have to manually create a shortcut to ""matlab.exe"".

What is wrong with these releases?!"
,archicorn27,2011-10-27T14:45Z,Thnx
,nsp99,2011-10-31T01:44Z,the license file didn't work for standalone...help?
,marawhy,2011-11-27T19:50Z,The install.txt seems corrupted/binary..could you advice on how to open/view it please?

,MistrzFil,2011-12-31T15:34Z,"This is what I got just after completing of the installation: 
1. The following products require a supported compiler:

MATLAB Compiler 4.16
MATLAB Builder NE 4.1
MATLAB Builder JA 2.2.3
MATLAB Builder EX 2.1
Stateflow 7.8
Simulink Coder 8.1
xPC Target 5.1
MATLAB Coder 2.1

2. Simulink requires a C compiler for simulation acceleration, model reference, and MATLAB Function Block capabilities. It is recommended that you install a supported compiler on your machine.

3. To accelerate computations with the following products, a supported compiler is required:

SimBiology 4.0
Fixed-Point Toolbox 3.4

4. Run mbuild -setup from MATLAB before using MATLAB Compiler or builder products. 

I've found this C compiler here: http://www.mathworks.com/support/compilers/R2011b/win64.html?s_cid=pi_scl_2_R2011b_win64
but what with the rest? Are those things really needed? "
,MistrzFil,2011-12-31T16:54Z,"I have no idea if it helps anyboody but I downloaded Microsoft Software Development Kit (SDK) 7.1 from the directory above and then I put the mbuild -setup command in matlab as it is written above. All in all, at last this version of matlab works properly because R2011a looked wrong on my machine"
,Tshering,2012-01-02T09:12Z,"R2011 has highly sophisticated features & tool box like global optimization, image processing, and parallel computing. Most of the control design models were updated and simulink code inspector is a new feature. I would like to share a simple steps to download it successfully:
1. Download this torrent in C:/ This will minimize errors like ""torrent file access denied"".
2. Once download is complete, click on ""setup.exe"" file.
3. Select install manually (NOT internet).
4. Then enter the installation key: ""59327-00840-06743-08309-05690"".
5. By default, it will install in ""C:/ Program Files"". Otherwise direct to it, or make sure you know where you are installing. 
6. It will take several minutes to install. 
7. If asked to launch manually or via internet, select MANUAL.
8. Now you will be asked for license file. 
Click browse->C:/->MatlabR2011b->Crack->lic_standalone.dat and select OK.
9. You will see successful installation notification, but no MATLAB ICON. 
10. Go to C:/ Program Files (or wherever you installed), ->MATLAB->R2011b->bin.
11. You will see executable file named: ""matlab.exe"". Right click and create short cut to your desktop. 
12. Go to your desktop and rename it as MATLAB R2011b or whatever you like and pin to start manu or taskbar. 
13. Launch it and develop an unprecedented control system. Good Luck!"

,majki_majkon,2012-01-15T00:11Z,"at Tschering:
is it a problem for matlab if i coulntd fint the matlab.exe file in the bin folder, instead i wrote exactly and hit it, a command window came out,and started the process. Im wondering, some errors were writen in the matlab window, first time i opened it, now it says nothing, what must i do, if i have to, cuase i think it said some errors about installing some stuff, 4 rows, cant remmember what it said, anyone have an what what could ve been said? thanks "
,teos9888,2012-01-23T03:34Z,"Works 110% (r2011b) even though Avira reported a (probably false positive)

,hudsontek,2012-02-10T01:21Z,The Matlab splash screen comes up then just quits!!!! can anyone help me here??
