[b][color=blue]::Plot::[/color]
  [i]On the way to Nimbasa City, Ash and the gang encounter an Audino walking through a thick fog. They realize that something is very wrong with it. They encounter Officer Jenny with two young detectives named Doyle and Christie, who place the gang under arrest, even though they insist that they have not done anything wrong. Finally, Cilan reveals that he is the Gym Leader of the Striaton Gym and explains that a simple phone call will clear things up. After Officer Jenny apologizes to the gang, she explains that something is seriously wrong with the Audino in town, as they are disappearing one after the other. After they have introduced each other, they receive a call that the PokÃ©mon Center's Audino has disappeared shortly before the call. Cilan volunteers to help solve the case of the missing Audino. He explains that he is a Detective Connoisseur. They decide to split up to cover the three remaining Audino in town, and tag them with tracking devices. Ash and Doyle's assigned Audino starts moving first, followed by Iris and Christie's, then Cilan and Officer Jenny's. They follow them until they all converge to the same path. The gang follow the Audino until the tracking devices fail. Officer Jenny explains the tracking devices use sound waves to track positions. They start to walk away from them and the two PokÃ©mon use Psychic and Telekinesis to pull them back but they lose one. The two Audino snap out of the hypnotic state while Cilan suggests that someone must be using sound waves to lure the Audino and tells Ash to call out Roggenrola because of its sensitive hearing. Roggenrola starts following the sound waves that were luring the Audino, while the Audino do everything they can, to prevent the people from following them. Roggenrola continues to follow the sound waves which leads them to an abandoned power plant. Inside, Team Rocket have the Audino inside a cage. Ash and the gang battle Team Rocket and eventually destroy the machine, causing the Audino to snap out of hypnosis. All the Audino attack Team Rocket, forcing them to escape on jetpacks.  [/i]
