,db1987,2011-10-01T21:13Z,thanx a lot for the prompt upload. 
,pzykotic,2011-10-01T21:16Z,obviously a fake the episode has finished airing in the UK yet
,drougnor,2011-10-01T22:34Z,19:50 GMT - This was posted at 21:00 GMT.  How does that make this fake?
,guy_wild,2011-10-01T22:36Z,"@pzykotic... Riddle me this: Why would Sceneline, a long time VIP on TPB and with high cred, risk loosing all that for uploading fakes?

Pzyko... go check your facts (or time math) before you make stupid accusations left and right. Episode finished at 19:50 UK time.

And for this upload I am thankful."
,GWSucks,2011-10-02T01:15Z,It's the real deal. Just finished downloading. Video is great quality but unfortunately the audio is completely out of sync.
,xenoFLASH,2011-10-02T02:01Z,Is there anyone else to confirm the sync problem?
,ReaperDjF69,2011-10-02T03:27Z,"Guys love your uploads, really really appreciate you and them, but come on--can you please lay off the Tagging your website name all over everything, please? I have no issue checking it out time to time, just you don't need to put it everywhere in your uploads, the titles, file names, etc, just overkill, you don't need it. Thanks. "
,xenoFLASH,2011-10-02T03:57Z,"I had NO sync problems. Thank you, sceneline!"
,PhattBouy,2011-10-02T08:37Z,"@ pzykotic
some people use the comments to check whether or not to upload, so please be more careful with any put-offs that you want to publish.  Also, did you have a word missing from your sentence anyway? You might want to type more slowly in future so as not to be mis-understood."
