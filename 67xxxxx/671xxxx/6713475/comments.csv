,confezzor,2011-10-05T01:55Z,hey Gordo2772 question.I'm not sure of your intension but as I've downloaded many other windows 7 iso's I never had this happen to me. I seem to have a virus that seems to be a bios virus..it has infected my whole computer no matter what i do to install a different OS. This has never happened to me and i have been using different windows OS from other torrenters on this site for about 3 years and this has never happened..now i'm not going to out right blame you for this but I would like your feed back ASAP on this matter..I really upset but at the same time i'm trying to compose myself from blowing up on this site..SO please get to me when you can. This is really killing me..my whole computer is serviceable now cause of I installed this iso.. 
,Gordo2772,2011-10-05T09:45Z,I'm using it right now. This doesn't have a 'BIOS' virus. My machine is working perfectly.
,confezzor,2011-10-06T07:30Z,well i guess i'm shit out of luck..damn lost my fav laptop...Ok..Thanks for the upload anyways..
,Gordo2772,2011-10-18T06:59Z,"I guess you are S.O.L confezzor. You're obviously mistaken and don't know your ass from a hole in the ground. So after the few hundred downloads of my torrent and no one else has made idiotic accusations, I'll take it that you're a smacktard and your opinion means absolutely nothing. BTW, for all my downloaders, this OS has TOTAL updatability to SP1. Fuck the haters. Enjoy!"
,Peter9900,2011-12-21T01:35Z,"is this a good clean version, cuz I dont want to fuck up my pc... "
,Gordo2772,2011-12-22T20:41Z,I'm using it right now. It works and it's clean. Cheers.
