[V],boobsman,2011-10-05T09:36Z,"You need to reflash your console with the latest LT2.0 firmware, this will not work with the active iso method and all future games will also require new firmware."

THANKS VERY MUCH TO: RISE OF NIGHTMARES - RROD - XBOX360 - REGION FREE - XGD3 0800 {BOOBSMAN}


10 EASY STEPS TO FOLLOW IN HELPINSTRUCTIONS BELOW:


It workes for me because I have Flashed/Chipped my XBOX 360, and updated to new Firmware LT+ 2.0! (NOT LT+1.9 or less) Check u Xbox 360 in System Settings > Console Settings > System Info > DASHBOARD Nr: 20135990

DOWNLOAD THE 88 FILES OF THIS GAME, THEN EXTRACKT THE RAR-FILES INTO: 1 ISO GAME FILE (8.13 GB), AND 1 DVD-TEXT FILE (1 kB) OF THE GAME TO PUT TOGETHER IN A FILE AT THE DESKTOP. CHECK THAT U HAVE DUAL LAYER BURNER IN U COMPUTER.


Normaly I Allways Test ALL Xbox 360 games and Verify it to 100% before burning the game with the easy program: ""Abgx360"". 

But now it don't even recognize the imagefile or dvdfile at all? But donÂ´t worry about that - It works 100% anyway. 


INSTRUCTIONS FOR BURNING XGD3 BACKUPS WITH IMGBURN: I recommended that you download and use the latest version of ImgBurn (v 2.5.6.0) downloadable at:
http://www.imgburn.com/index.php?act=download)

Older versions may handle this burningprocess differently and/or give a different set of errors in the game.


1. Click and open the >IMGBURN >HELP >About Imgburn. U now will see if u have the latest Imgburn version: (v 2.5.6.0) Coded by: LIGHTNING UK!

2. >Tools >Settings >Write. In Options itÂ´s allready selected: User Specified, and written 1913760 Change this numbers first to: 2133520 and then select >Calculate Optimal and click OK. 

3. Click >Write image file to disc

4. After ""Please select a file..."" U click on the yellow map: Browse for a file

5. Hold U Pointer abowe the top smallest dvdfile: 1 kB (36 bytes) and click On it.

6. On top it should now be written: rrod-ron Check the write speed Maximum: 2,4x 

7. Click on ""Write"" at the bottom.

8. Choose and click on: Write until end of disc (Truncate)

9. It will now in some Xbox depending of witch drive u have, ask if U would like to burn the game that is oversized 8 534030 GB on u only 8.5 GB disc?
Click >Yes

It now burns the game for about 35 min. and then says: Operation Successfull! Just click OK, close Imgburn, and take out the disc.

10. Install this finished burnt Game 2.3 GB Disc to your Harddrive on U Xbox360 untill 100% is complete. Start the game. It works PERFECTLY A 100%!!!


THE ONLY WRITEABLE DISC WORKING A 100% IS: ""VERBATIM DVD+R DL 8.5 GB""
THAT U CAN ORDER CHEAPEST DVDPACK OF 10, 25, or 50 DISCS = (1 EUR/DISC + mail price) DIFFERENT SIZEPACKS ON: http://www.sweburn.com/search.php?mode=search&page=1

NOTE: (IF) U HAVE OLD FIRMWARE less than LT+2.0: WHEN U DOWNLOAD ANY NEW GAMES, N U PUT THE DISC IN U XBOX, IT WILL ASK IF U WANT 2 UPDATE U XBOX JUST TO START THE GAME? 
AND I PRESSED (YES)... WARNING..!!!! IT WILL MAKE U DOWNGRADE U FLASH/CHIP N U WILL ONLY PLAY ORIGINAL GAMES, 
UNTIL U FLASH/CHIP IT ALL OVER AGAIN WITH NEWEST FIRMWARE. BUT WORKS 100% IF U HAVE LT+2.0!


LETÂ´S KEEP WORKING TOGETHER GAMERS - AND SEEDING, AND PLEASE COMMENT RIGHT WORKING INFO SO WE ALL CAN ENJOY MORE UPCOMING GAMES...

PLEASE UPLOAD WHEN READY: SAINTS ROW-THE THIRD, METAL GEAR SOLID-HD Collection, I AM ALIVE, MAX PAYNE 3, NEW TOMB RAIDER,  DEAD SPACE 3, GTA 5.
