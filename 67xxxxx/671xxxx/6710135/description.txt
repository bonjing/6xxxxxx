In â€˜Leonardoâ€™s Lost Robotsâ€™, Rosheim is on the trail of another intriguing da Vinci mystery: Did the renowned Renaissance painter, inventor, engineer and architect design some of the worldâ€™s earliest robots? â€¦ This book should appeal to readers interested in engineering history, robotics and mechanical engineering, and it should serve as a helpful resource in teaching early engineering. â€˜Leonardoâ€™s Lost Robotsâ€™ offers a fascinating glimpse into the world of Renaissance technology and the genius of Leonardo da Vinci." (Robin Tatu, ASEE PRISM, Vol. 16 (1), September, 2006)

"Leonardo da Vinci was fascinated by automata and sketches of robotic mechanisms are spread through his notebooks. Rosheim, in this beautifully illustrated volume, explores their feasibility and traces da Vinciâ€™s legacy among modern robot makers." (Financial Times UK, December, 2006)
Product Description

This book reinterprets Leonardo da Vinci's mechanical design work, revealing a new level of sophistication not recognized by art historians or engineers. The book reinterprets Leonardo's legacy of notes, showing that apparently unconnected fragments from dispersed manuscripts actually comprise cohesive designs for functioning automata. Using the rough sketches scattered throughout almost all of Leonardo's notebooks, the author has reconstructed Leonardo's programmable cart, which was the platform for other automata. Through a readable, lively narrative, the author explains how he reconstructed da Vinci's designs.
