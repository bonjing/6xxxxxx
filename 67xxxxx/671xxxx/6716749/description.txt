"How'd yew like to be livin' in a town like this here Innsmouth, with everything a-rottin' an' dyin' an' boarded up! Things crawlin' an' bleatin' an' barkin' an' hoppin' around black cellars an' high attics every way ye turn? Hey? How'd yew like to hear the howlin' night after night from the Esoteric Order o' Dagon hall an' know what unholy things is doin' part of the howlin? Yew think this old man's crazy? Well, sir, let me tell yew that ain't the worst! That ain't the worst! That ain't the worst!"

There is something wrong in the decayed seacoast town of Innsmouth. Something wrong in the crumbling buildings. Something wrong in the cold deep waters.

Something wrong in the blood.

This is a full-cast, soundscaped audio dramatization of the classic work by one of the masters of horror by The Atlanta Radio Theatre Company.
