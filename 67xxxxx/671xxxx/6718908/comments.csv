,the-loft,2011-10-04T21:16Z,"Excellent quality, although the ""Citytv"" logo is a little anoying. Subtitles here: http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-71017  Thanks!"
,M15f17,2011-10-04T22:29Z,im pretty sure all the copies are gonna have water marks because its only aired on TV so far. And 90% of channels use water marks. BTW CityTV is pwn.

This shows fun. Kinda like Star Gate meets Jurassic Park. "
,ZitraZnr666,2011-10-05T17:28Z,"awesome series this is, strongly recommend this!  "
,aapb,2011-10-06T01:35Z,the show should be called Terra Ible
,FMyLife0,2011-10-06T01:46Z,"AVOID this piece of SHIT SHOW at any cause! 40 minutes youll never get back. This show is so terrible that after watching it i wanted to commit a suicide and leave a note so that the creators of this horseshit would feel almost as terrible as I did. With a budget almost as big as 'Game of Thores' youd would expect atleast decent actors and special effects, but no. Creators please go fuck yourselves. "
,FMyLife0,2011-10-06T01:50Z,OMFGGG IMDB RATING OVER 7!!
,FMyLife0,2011-10-06T01:55Z,How this show has rating over 7 on IMDB is just mindboggling. One reason for that could be that all children like dinosaurs and rate it 10. Therefore this show is for children and retarded people.
,hurka79,2011-10-06T13:07Z,THX! Hungary
,shawnaldo,2011-10-06T17:49Z,"Ignore the haters, This show is GOOD. It's at least something different on TV. 

Let the haters go watch CSI, CSI-Miami, CSI-NY, NCIS, NCIS-LA, Law & Order, Law & Order-SVU, Law & Order-CI, Criminal Minds, Criminal Minds-SB... or some other fine original programming."
,tuxfx,2011-10-06T19:52Z,"You've seen Terra Nova before, in dozens of science fiction shows and movies. There is really not a single original moment in the entire show and, alas, it doesn't seem to realize this.

The setup is a society that's on an ecological disaster (like ""Blade Runner""), where a family is sent back into the past (with dinosaurs like ""Jurrasic Park"") to form a colony (like ""Earth 2""). The family consists of a heroic father, a smart mother, an angsty son, a genius daughter (like Lisa Simpson) and a younger, cloyingly cute younger daughter. None have the depth of a cardboard cutout.

Storywise, it's a mess. There is never a moment when you can't predict accurately what will happen next. It's not even difficult to do so: when the doctor is treating an accident victim, you know she's going to say ""stay with me."" "

,MrOsborn,2011-10-08T14:22Z,What does 'cloyingly' mean?
,thedecking,2011-10-08T23:37Z,Thanks EZ
,Hex-bag,2011-10-09T00:08Z,"According to IMDB, episode 03 is airing 10th November. Are you ppl. sure this isn't episode 02, that did air 3th November?"
,Hex-bag,2011-10-09T00:21Z,"I just read on tv.com that the pilot was episode 01 & 02. So you ppl. are right that this is episode 03.
Too bad that IMDB is wrong, then..."

,Shawk132132,2011-10-10T18:51Z,"Just so everyone know, this is S01E02: Instinct. The S01E03 isn't out yet for download, they just had it mixed up cause the first episode was double the lenght, 84min instead of 42min."
,Ixor779,2011-10-11T04:15Z,"Yup this is ep2, dled because I missed the show tonight. Heres the real one just down the page. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6719085/Terra_Nova_S01E03_720p_HDTV_X264-DIMENSION_%5Beztv%5D"
,mpa324,2011-10-11T20:37Z,"I think the uploaders got confused,According to imdb and wiki,Episode 1 Genesis is split in two parts both aired sept 26.The episode 2 is Instinct which is aired oct 3.And episode 3 is What Remains.Episode 4 airs Oct 17..I dont know why they made the episode 1 in two parts,,the first part is only 17 minutes long.Thats why I had a hard time looking for episode 2 on TPB..so episode 3 is the episode 2"
,HiroPro2,2011-10-19T03:02Z,"The Episode numbers are totally outta whack!

The two hour opener should be called S01E01a and S01E01b

people have called the second half of episode one episode two totally screwing up the episode numbers...

Hasn't anyone noticed this in 5 episodes !!!! "
,Reincarnated.Satan,2011-11-08T11:42Z,"Great up. A/V 10 on 10.
