HQ rare promo music video. ""Start!"" is the eleventh UK single release by punk rock band, The Jam and their second number-one, following ""Going Underground""/""Dreams of Children"". Upon its release on 15 August 1980, it debuted at number three, and two weeks later reached number one for one week. Written by Paul Weller and produced by Vic Coppersmith-Heaven and The Jam, ""Start!"" was the lead single from the band's fifth album Sound Affects. The single's B-side is ""Liza Radley"".

""Start!"" is based on both the main guitar riff and bass riff of The Beatles' 1966 song ""Taxman"" from the album Revolver, written by George Harrison. Likewise, The Jam's ""Dreams of Children"" had featured the same ""Taxman"" bassline, played then as a lead guitar riff.

The Jam were an English Punk rock/New Wave/mod revival band active during the late 1970s and early 1980s. They were formed in Woking, Surrey. While they shared the ""angry young men"" outlook and fast tempos of their punk rock contemporaries, The Jam wore smartly tailored suits rather than ripped clothes, and they incorporated a number of mainstream 1960s rock influences rather than rejecting them, placing The Jam at the forefront of the mod revival movement.

They had 18 consecutive Top 40 singles in the United Kingdom, from their debut in 1977 to their break-up in December 1982, including four number one hits. As of 2007, ""That's Entertainment"" and ""Just Who Is the 5 O'Clock Hero?"" remained the best-selling import singles of all time in the UK. They released one live album and six studio albums, the last of which, The Gift, hit number one on the UK album charts. When the group split up, their first 15 singles were re-released and all placed within the top 100.
