,highlander777,2011-10-24T23:42Z,"Thanks Kingman_Arizona. I was wondering what happened to this TV series. 

Looked up the Wiki too. I actually didn't think a show portraying the 1960s would attract the 18-48yo male demographic. It's just too long ago. Kind of makes you wonder how long ""Pan Am"" will last."
,BSorensen,2011-12-08T12:38Z,"Damn, I kinda liked this show. Not so realistic though; the girls are all too skinny, and their eyebrows too perfect :)) Very 21st century, not 60s at all. As for Pan Am, I doubt that'll last...it's too boring and out there"
