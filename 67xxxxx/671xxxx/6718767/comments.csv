,nellypaal,2012-05-10T15:18Z,"I'm downloading now.  For anyone who starts and is put off by the slow download speed, I recommend persevering.  I was getting barely more than 10 kB/s for the first hour or so, but am now averaging a steady 300-400+ kB/s.  The larger the file, the longer it takes to bed in.  I'll seed, so give this torrent a chance!"
,Whitey137,2012-05-21T19:06Z,"It took me a while to finish but the quality is worth it. If you like documentaries, nature, cars, science, religion, art, animals, social studies, psychology... the list goes on....these imax films are awe striking and should be watched by everyone. With all the convoluted trash we get with media today, please don't forget the pure beauty and awesomeness that really exists in our world. Take a glimpse at some of it... in 1080:p"
