In the 22nd century, mankind has fallen in the wake of The Metal Wars. Machines, led by the cyborg Lord Dread have subjugated the human population through a process called digitization.

One such leader, Captain Jonathan Power of the Heroic Soldiers of the Future, and his faithful team which include Lt. "Tank" Ellis, Major "Hawk" Masterson and Jennifer "Pilot" Chase fight to preserve and eventually overcome Lord Dread and his BioDread machines.
