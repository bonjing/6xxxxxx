Last night I saw in OMDs concert, a fantastic night but at the same time a nostalgic one. OMD was just WOW great. We laughed, danced and yelled like teenagers once again. Listening to their songs, I told myself all night that our generation was so lucky to have experienced this awesomeness. Short wave radio, vinylâ€™s pops and cracks, MTV and endless number of talented but unlucky bands you hardly could keep track of. The concert got me so pumped that today I finished Vol 54 of these popular compilations I had been sitting on for some time. Alright,  letâ€™s enjoy the 80s now!
