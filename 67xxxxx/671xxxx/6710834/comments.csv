I try to put a code in my hosts file it may not be found. There are no hidden folder, however looking at the properties of the folder 'etc' it well There's 5 files and opening, the hosts file is not visible.

I tried every combination and I am now without a solution.
But pasting C: \ Windows \ system32 \ drivers \ etc \ hosts in the bar I can open it with a text editor but can not save it because the properties can not be changed.

I come to you for advice.

Sincerely,"
