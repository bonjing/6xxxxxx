,sugar-pie,2011-10-03T18:31Z,Buhu :( The video breaks off about 12 minutes in. Is it possible to get this sorted? Pretty please :)
,GaryBradbury,2011-10-03T20:17Z,"Hi Guys. I am soooooo sorry. This is a bad copy. It does go haywire 12 minutes into it. I will look for another version and upload again. I don't watch it in full before uploading it. I flick through certain points and make sure it is good, then share it with everyone as fast as I can. It has worked for everything I have uploaded with the exception of this one.
Again, sorry :("
,sugar-pie,2011-10-03T20:54Z,Thank you in advance 
[T],Magash,2011-10-03T20:57Z,No big deal Gary you do good work. I'm just happy to know it's the upload that is fucked up and not me. I'm a complete computer tard and figured I did something wrong. 
,aussiegirl00,2011-10-03T23:53Z,Thanks anyway
