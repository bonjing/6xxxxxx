I'm seeding though. 
I'll comment if it works when it's done and all that stuff."
,zombird,2011-10-01T17:38Z,"Okay, got it installed. 
Works just fine.

Bit of instructions- 
First you need Toast Titanium, or something similar to mount the DMG's as discs.
Mount just the Install CD first, click install.
It will then ask for the Data CD, mount it as a disc as well.
To play you will need to mount the Data/Play DMG as a disc, which is fine with me.
No serial needed. Thanks.
