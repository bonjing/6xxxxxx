,balanced,2011-10-03T13:34Z,"I encourage everyone to dl the UN-RARred version of this same .MKV file at https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6717698/Boardwalk.Empire.S02E02.720p.HDTV.x264-IMMERSE

No one has yet explained to my satisfaction how a RARred version of a download helps me when using the torrent protocol.  Good for NNTP?  Yes.  Torrents?  NO absolutely not so everyone boycot this RAR sh*t and maybe then they'll get up to date with things."
