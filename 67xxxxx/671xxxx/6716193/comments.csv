,lastjedi,2011-10-02T18:55Z,you shouldnt use aac audio because most programs cant play that audio.i use avs video converter and iyt plays everything except aac audio.i get no sound when i play a movie with aac.so thias isa useless to me.
[T],fachman,2011-10-02T19:52Z,"dear lastjedi. MP4 with h.264 and AAC20 is currently the most universal format you can find. It can be played without any converting on multiple devices.
This file should play on the following list:
 iPAD iOS 3.2.2, iPAD2 iOS 4.3.2
 iPhone4 iOS 4.2, 4.2.1
 iTouch 4th Gen iOS 4.1 (model: MC540C) 
 Nokia N8, Samsung Galaxy S, HTC HD7, ZuneHD 
 Archos 10.1 Android Tablet, Motorola Xoom Android OS 3.1
 Just about any mobile (Win7 included) that can play MP4's and has 720p resolution

 This file can play on the following list with assistance:
 PSP Go - N1000 Use Media Go to import

I have no idea what program are you using but most probably inability to play such sound lies in wrong configuration..."
