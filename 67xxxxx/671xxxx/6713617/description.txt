Big Bill Morganfield Blues In The Blood
Released: 2003
Label: Blind Pig
Format:Flac

With this  release, Big Bill Morganfield affirms that the blues is indeed in his blood. The appropriately titled Blues In The Blood is proof positive that he inherited more than just a regal blues pedigree and a wonderfully menacing baritone voice from his father - McKinley Morganfield, better known as Muddy Waters. As the son of one of the most influential musicians of the 20th Century, Bill rises to the challenge of meeting many of the burdensome expectations placed upon him. Blues In The Blood documents the full maturation of Bill's musical skills as a guitarist and songwriter and certifies that he is now a major talent in his own right.
