Marshall McLuhan: You Know Nothing of My Work!
by Douglas Coupland
(epub)

A crackling look at the philosopher whose founding ideas were at once obscure and eerily prophetic.

Marshall McLuhan, the celebrated social theorist who defined the culture of the 1960s, is remembered now primarily for the aphoristic slogan he coined to explain the emerging new world of global communication: â€œThe medium is the message.â€ Half a century later, McLuhanâ€™s predictions about the end of print culture and the rise of â€œelectronic inter-dependenceâ€ have become a realityâ€”in a sense, the realityâ€”of our time. 

Douglas Coupland, whose iconic novel Generation X was a â€œMcLuhanesqueâ€ account of our culture in fictional form, has written a compact biography of the cultural critic that interprets the life and work of his subject from inside. A fellow Canadian, a master of creative sociology, a writer who supplied a defining term, Coupland is the ideal chronicler of the uncanny prophet whose vision of the global villageâ€”now known as the Internetâ€”has come to pass in the twenty-first century.
