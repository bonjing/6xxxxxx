,charlie19866,2011-10-02T22:58Z,"@profil84

They do teach other languages, in english schools. You know useful ones like french, german ,italian or spanish. But why the hell would they want to teach a sub par language like russian?"

,asdfern,2011-10-04T03:08Z,"@Knaster @profil84

russian is not an international language. english is. this site is used by people from all over the world, meaning that using english would be the most effective means of communication. 

maybe i should have written this in swahili then bitch about how you should learn new languages? it's typical of russians to write in russian despite being on international sites/platforms. you see this in multiplayer games all the time. some russians just assume everyone else knows their - fucking garbage - language for reasons i can't even begin to fathom. i rarely see this from other nationalities as well, but not nearly as much as from russians.

why on fucking earth would you assume everyone knows russian? do you think the majority of people on this site know russian? more than english?

just admit it's not about communicating effectively. it's about being a stubborn faggot. "
,My_ass,2011-10-04T03:49Z,"asdfern i agree with "" it's typical of russians to write in russian despite being on international sites/platforms"" its alway piss me off ,but other part of your comment sounds like some nerd,gay,dumb ass bullshit ,get a life to others dude.

The torrent seems to be very slowly seeded, therefore it may be an idea to get

Thanks, i'll look into that one."
,vsevtopky,2011-10-04T09:21Z,"MichaelKnight_83 asdfern

Please don't insult my language. It's not a ""typical of russians"" (as you said), this phrase (""typical russians"") always piss me off. 

Just remember: Ð¾nly ""bydlo"" and stupid schoolboys write in russian despite being on international sites. Bydlo translates in English as ""cattle"" or ""livestock"" and means lowlifed, stupid, uneducated and at the same time - always self-righteous people, exactly as ""rednecks"" in USA, i think you understand me. 
Almost all of them are jingoes and they still believe in Great Russian Empire, Tsar (Putin lol), nuclear missiles and same shit. Fucking dumbasses.

They piss us off, not less and even more than you. But fact of their presence on the Internet - particularly irritates us. Unfortunately, in Russia a large percentage of bydlo and Internet is now available to almost everyone of them. Just ignore them or take it easier."
,crazynoodle,2011-10-04T10:49Z,"to vsevtopky
And how about a liberal oriented bydlo? So-called ""liberasts""?
Liberast (don't confuse them with liberals!) is a man, who belive that USA and EU ALWAYS right. He will say that he stands for democracy and freedoms... as long as noone says anything oposite to his opinions. Some of them even go so far, that sugests occupation of Russia and total destruction of socio-political structure. And I'am not making that up- Navodvoskaya will be great example of ""liberast"". Political Bydlo comes in many forms- nazis (""farshist""- or National-Homosexual), russian supremesist (pro-apartheid and for the restoration of Russian Empire), tolerance-fan (""tolerast""- thinks that crime is a culture way of some peoples and we should respect that) etc, etc, etc
BTW- why do you even bother to explain it to the people, that simply can't imagine white trash using a computer?"

,Scream_Muxa,2011-10-04T12:02Z,crazynoodle is just another stupid troll.. :D
,vsevtopky,2011-10-04T12:09Z,"I know who are ""liberasts"". It's same bydlo, even worse. but it is worth noting - number of them an order of magnitude less than pseudo-patriotic bydlo. Novodvoskaya, by the way, is just aged brainsick.

Anyway, you shouldn't generalize your opinion about all Russians judging only by the behavior of white trash in internet."

,BeenGamingLongerThanYou,2011-10-04T21:30Z,"@vsevtopky-

When you say ""typical russians"" pisses you off - why?  I guarantee you say things about westerners in generalizations - I GUAR-AN-FUCKING-TEE you say stuff about the US all the time.  The rest of the world hates us after bush and you all say stuff about us all the time so fuck off please.  

Also, I went to college with many, many russians.  Some were even my friends and we hung out quite a bit.  I found them to be extremely dishonest and not trustworthy at all.  This grouped cheated on their tests - even went so far as to have the ""smart"" one take the finals early then give the answers to the rest.  So, from what I've seen russians are not to be trusted under any circumstances.  And before you tell me to shut up I guarantee again you say the same shit about US citizens as well and don't try to deny it.  "
