,lorum,2011-10-04T00:45Z,"Jimstalk or aarque

It is possible if you guys can throw this catshit1 out of piratebay?

and ask for in a permanent ban.

We here in the FSX community don't have to tolerate this shit!

We are talking about serious sick person here!"
,Scofit,2011-10-04T01:20Z,Who the fuck do you think they are? They're just nobody's like the rest us. They have no powers on here. Not that I'm any fan of catshit mind you.  
,aarque,2011-10-04T04:14Z,"Actually Scofit, the trolls account was already banned once. And it is not about power, it is about petitioning the powers that be about adherence to acceptable conduct. And it doesn't hurt to report yourself, they actually DO listen. For that matter, we could probably start a ban catshit thread in the TPB forums and they would comply that much sooner."

stop being a little pussy batty crease and grow a pair for fuck sake, aarque and jim hold as much power here as you do, zero, so why you're requesting for them to do your dirty work of silencing ppl i dont know.
this is a piracy site, power to the people over the greedy faceless companies and corporate tossers who want to dictate how everybody can use the music, movies, games etc (that they pay alot of money for) with the sole intention of screwing as much money out of everyone of us that they possibly can.
suppression of an individuals freedom of speech is a tactic favoured by those very people and is not wanted or welcome here.
BTW, catshit will be loving all the attention you're creating for him so behave yourself and stop being a baby. i'd much rather read catshits harsh critical reviews and statements than your pathetic whinging and whining, at least he's amusing and real, unlike all the cheesy fucks on here who suck the uploaders cocks and lick their arses cus they think those tactics give them a better chance of receiving the numerous requests they make on every torrent uploaded. everyones got their own selfish agendas."
