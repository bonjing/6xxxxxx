,vip600,2011-09-30T03:02Z,Thank you
,deadxgirl,2011-09-30T05:35Z,Only 780MB? 720p are at least 1GB.
,fall1en,2011-09-30T05:53Z,"Thank you! 

Love this show! :)"
,fall1en,2011-09-30T05:56Z,"@ deadxgirl

Yeah I've noticed that too. Would be nice if it was explained why the size has changed. "
,deadxgirl,2011-09-30T07:29Z,"@ fall1en

Yes, I'd love to know why is that."
,Elroosi,2011-10-02T02:17Z,TLA is this a new group?
,ThierryZ,2011-10-02T20:09Z,Maybe the smaller size is due to the fact it's in several .rar files instead of a single mkv or aviâŚ
,Jarska.,2011-10-07T12:28Z,The quality was a bit crappier.
,emeraldfiction,2011-10-12T15:25Z,"This is a fake file, all other episode released for Mentalist by this uploader are fakes too. When you try to extract it you will get a CRC Failed Error. "
,ferrabra,2012-03-19T11:43Z,Not working for me. Hate this rar multi file torrents. IÂ´ve had the same problema with Episote 03 of the same season.
