The 'reality slap' takes many different forms. Sometimes it is so violent it's more like a punch: the death of a loved one, a serious illness, a major injury, a freak accident, a shocking crime, a disabled child, the loss of a job; bankruptcy, betrayal, fire, flood, divorce or disaster. Sometimes it's a little gentler: envy, loneliness, resentment, failure, disappointment or rejection. But whatever form it takes, one thing's for sure: it hurts! And most of us don't deal with the pain very well.

Within these pages, you will learn how to cope effectively when life hurts: not just how to survive, but how to thrive. Using the proven principles of ACT, you'll discover how to:

* find peace in the midst of your pain
* find calm in the midst of your chaos
* anchor yourself in the midst of emotional storms
* increase your sense of connection with yourself and others
* use your painful emotions to cultivate wisdom and compassion
* find fulfilment even when you can't get what you want
* heal your wounds, and come through stronger than before
