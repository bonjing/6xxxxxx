,marktero,2011-11-23T17:08Z,Hey why doesn't the Audio work on this?? I'm using it with VLC player..
,spunkster,2011-11-24T02:16Z,"Yeah, the audio on this rip is fucking awful. It's almost inaudible even with my volume all the way up. Sounds like it's playing through a cellphone at the bottom of a toilet full of honey. It's a shame because the video quality is great. Skip this and find a better version.
V:8
A:0 (yeah, ZERO)"
,FluffigtDjur,2012-05-21T12:17Z,"Something is definitely wrong with the audio. I was 10 mins in before I realized it wasn't some weird, discomforting effect but simply an awful copy. Wth is this a cam? It's been 9 years, got to be a better source by now."
