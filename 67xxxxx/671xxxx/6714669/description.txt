Luciano Pavarotti - The Songbook CD 320k + bonus tracks (musicfromrizzo)

This is another CD I first came across at the Library here and
enjoyed listening to - it was at the reference Branch and so you were
able to listen on headphones right there in one of their HIFI equipped booths.

I just purchased this CD recently, however I have replaced most
of the tracks with re-mastered version for you from the Ultimate Hits
CD which we have posted for you in its remastered quality form already.

For those who would like additional tracks here, or prefer to also be in on this
CD offering for all, please hop on board - equally as it were!

with thanks to all who seed with me!
