In this collection, experts from around the world present changes in the global marketplace and developments in research methodologies that underpin new product development (NPD). The business and marketing aspects of NPD, sometimes neglected in books of this type, are addressed alongside methods for product testing. 

Specific topics include consumer-driven NPD in the food and personal care product industries, evolution in food retailing, advances in concept research, hedonic testing, viewpoints on consumer research methods, statistics for NPD, the future of innovation, and the implications for NPD on topics such as human genetic variation in taste perception and neuroimaging. Several chapters do not fit the genre of a standard scientific article; rather, they are written records of conversations between two people on a particular topic related to consumer-driven innovation in foods and personal care products. In them the interviewees speak freely about their views and experiences in NPD, providing unique insights. 

Consumer-Driven Innovation in Food and Personal Care Products will broaden readersâ€™ understanding of the many approaches available to NPD personnel and ways in which they can be used to support innovation activities.
