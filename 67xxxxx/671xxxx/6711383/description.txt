2011 two CD collection from the Alt-Country/Americana outfit. Yours Truly is split into two parts: the first disc showcases popular favorites chosen by fans in an online survey; the second includes obscure, hard-to-find B-sides and previously unreleased demo versions of 16HP masterpieces. Yours Truly was mixed by producer Bob Ferbrache (Blood Axis, Soul Merchants, Slim Cessna's Auto Club, Tarantella) specially for this release. The deluxe package comes with a lyric booklet with rare photos and artwork. As rural gothic goes, one cannot do much better than David Eugene Edwards and company, with their use of acoustic old-time instruments mixed with the impassioned vocals and fire-and-brimstone lyrics.
