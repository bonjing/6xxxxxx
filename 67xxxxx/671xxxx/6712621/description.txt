Being a huge Eagles fan I really enjoyed this show and wanted to upload it for others that may have not had a chance to see it. Jerome and Reggie were before my time but I love watching footage of them. It's a tragedy that both their lives were cut short and were both unable to win a Championship together for the city of brotherly love. Enjoy.
