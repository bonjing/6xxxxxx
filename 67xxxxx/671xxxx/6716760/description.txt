They're baaaaaaaaaaaaacckkkkk!!! Rocky Coast Radio Theatre returns with yet another copious cornucopia of classic concoctions, crafted and compiled for the captive congregation (gotta love that thesaurus!). Nightmares on Congress Street, Part V offers dramatized adaptations (complete with music and sound effects) of chilling stories penned by Edgar Allan Poe, Hugh B. Cave, and H.P. Lovecraft, as well as a few additional treats. So douse the lights, snuggle up with your favorite corpse...(oops) "life-challenged" person, and prepare to be thoroughly goosebumped.

This collection of short radio plays are fun, spooky and perfect little tales for anyone who is a fan of horror fiction. The adaptations were thoughtful and well done. I place a high value on original material and while the original material does not disappoint, there could be more of it. 

Overall Story Performance I wrote a rave review for Part IV, and it was that purchase that prompted me to get Part V. I am so glad I did. It was even better! There's one somewhat weak adaptation of a Poe piece (Tell-Tale Heart). It works, but... ennnnhhhh. Retroactive Terror is a biting satirical piece, which would make many a conservative pale. Ray Bradbury's short story, The Wind, is an amazing tribute to his writing prowess. The Door Below is deliciously creepy, and HP Lovecraft's Testimony Of Randolph Carter is the scariest and most atmospheric audio theatre I have ever heard.



Enjoy and Seed!!
