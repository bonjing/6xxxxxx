Yeah, right? Criminal Minds was like that also, but it turned out it was ok. It was named minimal crimes, like wtf? lol"

Raising hope I think was blazing dope.  Always quality downloads, the zips are kinda a pain, but they always download the quickest, so even after unzipping they are ready to go much quicker! Thanks sceneline!"

But I'm just wondering what on Earth could be the reason for making such a bunch of small RARs. This is torrent. It already *is* divided into a bunch of small pieces and your torrent client puts them back together for you. The RARs have to be extracted by the user. A bit annoying."
