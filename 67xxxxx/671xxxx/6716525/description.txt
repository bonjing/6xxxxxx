I just got home with a new sealed John Mcdermott - Danny Boy CD
for just a five dollar bill on a clearance sale. Ive actually paid
close to forty once to have the CD delivered to me at a hospital
where I was staying for a brief period. I had previously borrowed it
for the local library where I first discovered it. 
It currently going for $28 plus shipping on amazon dot com however.
I spent many many hours listening to this CD back then and now I
am only drawn to his style most on the Shamrocks and Heather CD
where I believe he displays emotive brilliance commendable
to the best of Irish singing from his quarter in the Canadian
Regiment as it were.

Anyways - its a brand new CD converted to 320k - two samples
from the Shamrocks and Heather CD must have come from an old worn out
CD I am sure, however that's how we previously found it on the net 
for posting (never again at this shoddy level of CD workmanship
due to aging I promise) - soon we'll have the real McCoy for you
- in the meantime I hope we have his cash register ringing for a
bit more than a fiver so he can afford the haggis as it were as
usual as it was back then eh! Cheers mate!
