A real eye-opener
30 May 2007 | by johnmichael-2 (United States)

I watched this documentary in environmental science class this past semester. It really made me think about how obsessed our society is with having things. It wrecks our bank accounts and spoils our kids us and give us all unrealistic expectations, etc., etc. You know what I'm talking about.

Or do you? Please watch this documentary. While, deep down inside us somewhere, we knowing everything it teaches, we really need a movie like this to actually make us aware of what harm our ""affluenza"" is actually causing.

Highly recommended! 10/10 - 3 of 4 people found this review helpful."
