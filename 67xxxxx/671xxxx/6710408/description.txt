Andre Rieu - New York memories 2CD set (musicfromrizzo) vbr

Here is the master of showmanship managing great pomp and circumstance
to suit the occasion and enhance your enjoyment of the music - this
performance was in fact seen on Public Television across the North American
continent on PBS. Note on CD2 we substituted for the 2 minute intro
explanation (in French on this CD, with "Somewhere over the rainbow"
from Andre Rieu's "the flying Dutchman CD" - hope you wont mind - merci).

Enjoy this great master of musical achievement from the Netherlands
- the great Monsieur Andre Rieu! (Great singing too in these numbers)
