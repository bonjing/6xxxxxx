,x_PseudoAnonymous,2011-10-05T11:17Z,"I went through the arduous process of logging into hotmail, using its premature search system to locate the confirmation e-mail sent by TPB, recovered my password in order to log in here and then writing an eloquent comment - all to say that I hugely appreciate your work, YIFY. Keep it up (and please continue adding subtitles, since I do not fully enjoy a movie without them and find it extremely difficult to locate appropriate ones). : ]"

,TyMod,2011-10-09T23:05Z,"And I did use it on a 5.1 surround set up, it was fine but as a stereo setup or if you just wanted to watch it on a TV there is no way in hell you could.  As I stated each channels only 31 kbps lol  Sounds BAD.

So if you want a good quality rip just to watch one night on your tv this is NOT the torrent for you..."

What I don't believe is the 1080p (progressive) mode) it's impossible on MP4 video format. I just hope it looks good while i buy the original DVD."

Should have figured by the file size that this movie could not possibly be 1080p but I took a chance and sure enough it isn't. Better than standard DVD but far from 1080p.

Not bashing the uploader, he has my thanks in fact, just wanted to point that out for all the high-quality video freaks out there who want perfection in their movies."
