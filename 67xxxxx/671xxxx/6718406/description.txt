OFFICIAL RELEASE [320k MP3]

It was a warm and welcoming night in Macon, GA for the Allman Brothers Band, who were making their first appearance in their hometown in 19 years.  The buzz had been building for weeks as the show had long been sold out and the local newspaper had generated even more excitement with two consecutive days of front page press.

On the day of the concert the band had officially opened the Allman Brothers Band Museum at the Big House with a ribbon cutting ceremony featuring Robert Reichert, the Mayor of Macon and great grandson of Elizabeth Reed,  giving the musicians the key to the city.  U.S. Representative Jack Kingston delivered a wonderful keynote address and local, national and international press covered the event.

Fans from all over the world descended upon this quaint middle Georgia town for this historic occasion and that night the band delivered a concert that was one for the ages.
