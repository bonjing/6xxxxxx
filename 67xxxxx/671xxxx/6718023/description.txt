The Sprint Of Our Life

The teams depart from the National Revolutionary Martyrs' Shrine in Taipei, Taiwan, and travel to Yogyakarta, Indonesia with the knowledge that a double-elimination awaits at the Pit Stop. A Roadblock makes racers spelunk into Goa Jomblang to find a mask and dagger to trade for the next clue, which Bill and Cathi have to await to do when confronted with their Speed Bump. The Detour gives everyone a choice to either "Shake Their Money Maker" by dancing and playing music in the streets for donations, or "Be a Ticket Taker" by parking rider's motorbikes. However, following directions when giving their earnings to an orphanage in exchange for the Pit Stop proves tricky for most, leading to a scramble to check in at Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat.
