Description:
=========
Haruhi is a poor tomboyish student at a school for the ultra-wealthy, able to attend because of a scholarship, and unable to even afford a uniform. One day, she stumbles across the decidedly peculiar but very popular Ouran Host Club. She tries to leave, but accidentally breaks a vase, and unable to pay for it, she's told that she'll have to stay and do odd jobs. That is, until they decide she would be more valuable as a club member. Not realizing she's female due to her appearance, they fix her up and give her a male uniform. She's an instant hit, so they decide to have her keep up the charade even after they find out the truth. Haruhi, being average almost to a fault, doesn't know what to make of the unconventional activities of the Host Club (or of the even more unconventional members), but having little choice, she plays along. Before long, real bonds are formed, friends made, and Haruhi finds herself accepted in a way she could never have been otherwise in this affluent school.

02 "The Job of a High School Host!"

The host club finds out that one of their regular customers, Kanako Kasugazaki, one of the few that skips from host to host regularly, is having trouble with her fiancÃ©, Toru Suzushina. The group then cooks up a plan to help, involving a dance, in which the "queen" of the dance would receive a kiss on the cheek from Tamaki. However, when Kanako is chosen as the queen, Hikaru and Kaoru Hitachiin announce that Haruhi would be giving the kiss. Tamaki realizes this will be Haruhi's first kiss and, jealous, runs to stop her and accidentally pushes her. Haruhi ends up kissing Kanako on the lips instead. This makes Haruhi embarrassed, not only because she is not a boy, but that Kanako's fiancee was watching. However, he decides that the kiss does not count and reunites with Kanako.
