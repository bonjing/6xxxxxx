One reason was that most of the ISP:s block it out nowerdays.

What do you know about that?

Does this works for you?"

I am not sure where JonDo is blocked exactly, i think that only a few ISP block it. I could use it without problems. There is also an anti censorship service included which helps to use JonDo if it is blocked.

Thanks a lot, now  will try it out!

:-)"
,LJUSALF,2011-10-01T19:26Z,"Ok! Now i had installed the software. 

1)you must install jondo BEFORE jondoFox

2)you must download Firefox if you didn´t already have it.

3)you must install the newest JavaRuntime

4)And you Must have a serial, and I can´t find one.

So, is there a serial someware?"

1) You don't need jondo for jondofox. You could also use Tor or a simple proxy with jondofox. 

2) You could install jondofox portable, so you don't need a firefox installation

3) yes you need the java runtime installed, i am not sure if you need the newest one.

4) you don't need a ""serial"", you could use the free services without it. if you want to use the fast premium services, you need a code. you can get a test code from here: https://shop.anonymous-proxy-servers.net/bin/testcoupon?lang=en"
,LJUSALF,2011-10-01T22:58Z,"Well, when in installation mode your only option is to install jondo if you want to install it at all.

Thats what it says, IÂ´ve retried a cople of time now and  there is no other option, the install will not go any further.

But itÂ´s no biggie, i did do that.

More funny things through install, when asked for language I choose english but during install the language was german and in the end i could choose language again, and again I choose english. Then th install box said: ""that was not your selection in the beginning"" (or something like that)

I think things like this is very funny.

But I speak english as well as german (even not as good) So itÂ´s two languages in one installation.. 
No, actually itÂ´s three because in the answerbox its swedish, which is my language.

But now itÂ´s working, but in a simple mode.

Thanks a lot, I will enjoy this, and thank you for your time."
