[V],boobsman,2011-10-02T17:33Z,"@ frozt21, you will need to reflash your console with LT2.0 to play this game, its not released yet so you'll need to wait."
,SEC902,2011-10-02T17:51Z,ok so wat DL disc should be used?
[V],boobsman,2011-10-02T18:12Z,"@ SEC902, the nfo contains burn instructions for imgburn, you use the same dual layers as normal games but there are some extra steps before the game will work and it wont go through abgx as its not been updated to run xgd3 games yet."

,fantasygamer84,2011-10-08T08:45Z,is this prepatched? or do i have to patch it?
,wannapod,2011-10-08T16:16Z,Does anyone know why most if not all the XGD3 titles have so few people seeding and or downloading? Even before LT2.0 came out it seemed like most people were not downloading them. Now that LT2.0 is out there has not been much of an increase. Sure there are some issues to overcome burning them and updating to LT2.0 but that has never stopped anyone before. Multiple disk games have come out before as well so thats not the issue. Why do these games seem to be different and not as many people are downloading these. For the record I owned two copies of Gears 3 from the midnight release. 
,eightballr,2011-10-14T16:10Z,can i play this on my jtag? do i just add iso to my hard drive
