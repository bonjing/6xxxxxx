,masterxplod3r3r,2011-10-12T01:13Z,um if you download this maybe you should comment on it or something... c'mon now... this is not first grade we have all done this before...
,semon100,2011-10-13T09:19Z,thanks a lot
,craltijd,2011-10-13T15:29Z,you need jailbreak for this?
,walk_the_plank,2011-10-17T18:52Z,Does your iPhone need to be jailbroken to install these apps ?  Tks.
,Rang3r187,2011-10-17T22:35Z,"If you didn't BUY it, YES, it has to be jailbroken. LOL.

Even google will tell you this. Some people are too lazy to google, but can ask questions and bitch. ;)"
,tdej,2011-10-20T06:33Z,I could not install a single one of these. itunes did not transfer them to the phone! What is jailbroken?
,smurfmurfet,2011-10-20T16:34Z,"On your Iphone/Ipod touch, goto www.jailbreakme.com in safari. Install Cydia.

Go into Cydia (once downloaded) find appsync (iOS version). Mine is 4.1, so I goto Appsync 4+. Install that. Then add the apps with iTunes and it will work. 2 minutes work if you're quick."
,nixinne,2011-10-30T16:08Z,Nice apps! still DL but will seed...thanks~
,mrpirateman,2011-11-01T19:02Z,"Is this the free version?
sorry to ask, but i'm new to this stuff. -_-"
[V],GunningHawk90,2011-11-06T18:35Z,"Yes, your Ipod does need to be jailbroken."
[V],GunningHawk90,2011-11-06T18:37Z,"You're supposed to do whatever smurfmurfet has said.

But a WARNING. Read up articles about Jailbreaking before you decide to do it.

And, there are videos on youtube that will show you exactly what is to be done.

Feel free to ask anything else :-)"
,GloriousPlague,2011-11-12T08:46Z,I'm downloading right now and will let you guys know what I think when its done. Sadly I'm downloading at 70 kb/s.
,GloriousPlague,2011-11-12T08:55Z,Also I was wondering if anyone knew how to get apps off of my ipod to share... I have looked through a few forums I guess I'm just not wording it right or something.
[V],GunningHawk90,2011-11-13T05:59Z,"I searched, and this is what I found:

get OpenSsh from Cydia and install it. Then google how to use Oppen Ssh. You will have to download a program called WinSCP which should be a link on most walkthroughs. Install that onto your computer. Then just follow the walkthrough. Its basically just like another way to see and access all that on your ipod without using ITunes. This is nice given that you can then copy things from the ipod to the computer and vise versa."

,Ganjagal420,2011-12-31T19:32Z,"just jailbroke my ipod today. best decision ive ever made. these games are working perfectly thanx GunningHawk90.. anybody know how to DL games/apps without going thru itunes or installous, i googled but couldnt find much"
,Jeronwong,2012-01-15T20:23Z,"iPhone 4S has no jailbreaks as of current, so you can't play these games unless you get them from Apple..."
,michaelpark17,2012-01-20T08:26Z,can i update the games?
,tasoz,2012-01-25T13:19Z,"a easy way to install the apps is by using the program iFunBox
basicly just connect the phone to your computer
start the program
and then you click ""Install App [AppFastIn]
select the app file and wait
then its done!
or just dubble clicking them and syncing thru itunes worked too, for me atleast with a iphone 4s jailbroken ofc"
