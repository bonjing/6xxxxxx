Quote:
Mastodon's fifth album is as near
to punchy and concise as they're
ever likely to come. Gone are the
13-minute multipart epics â€“ the
longest track here is just five and
a half â€“ yet there's a depth and
darkness about The Hunter: not
the darkness that drives
Norwegian metallers to burn
down churches, but the darkness
of space. The titles of tracks such
as Blasteroid and Stargasm
capture the mood. The star of
the show is drummer Brann
Dailor, whose jazzy fills lend a
fleet-flootedness to music that
could easily get mired in sludge.
Towards the end of standout All
the Heavy Lifting, when he
switches to double-time kick
drums, it's as if all the sonic
promises metal has made are
being met. It's not all
apocalypse-with-instruments,
though: the title track deals in
the fathomless sadness that
ended up making crossover stars
of Metallica with One. Thrilling
stuff.
