"The Incentive"

After a rousing motivational speech, Robert 
California (James Spader) challenges the 
office to double their sales. After the new 
manager promises the unthinkable, everyone 
in the office suddenly gets motivated to 
sell. Meanwhile, Pam (Jenna Fischer) finds 
an unlikely pregnancy friend.

Congrats to the morons for segmenting 
Mentalist. You do realize this blows the
RC_lookahead right? Oh, nevermind, you
idiots do not care if you pre total shit.
