Description:

In Spider-Man: Edge of Time, Spider-Man faces one of his greatest challenges ever 
saving Spider-Man. Developed by Activision-owned studio Beenox, Spider-Man: Edge of Time
challenges the player to take on the roles of both classic Amazing Spider-Man and Spider-Man
2099 to correct a time stream gone awry and prevent a catastrophic future brought on by the
early and untimely death of Peter Parker. Spider-Man: Edge of Time is a focused, action-packed
adventure set in two connected and evolving timelines, from the contemporary times of the Amazing
Spider-Man to the corrupted future world of Spider-Man 2099, against the backdrop of a rich, tightly
crafted narrative by acclaimed Marvel veteran Peter David (co-creator of the comic book series Spider-Man 2099).
The game features all-new cause-and-effect gameplay, where players will see how the immediate and sometimes
unexpected effects of their actions as one Spider-Man changes the timeline of the
other Spider-Man.
