,Brutal78,2011-10-04T20:31Z,"what a f*** is this,stupid one from dude where's my car and bad half of two and a half man....
Bring Back Charlie pleeaseeeee........"
,wieszcz,2011-10-05T02:13Z,"thanks a lot, 
On the episode: a better one than the first two, but how long Berta, Jake and Allen will have to carry the show.  Walden needs to pick up his part, otherwise the show will go down.  I will give it a chance for the next two episodes."
,rando606,2011-10-05T05:20Z,"i dont see where all these negative comments about the show are coming from, i find it enjoyable. not as good as the old show but still its good. and stop saying bring back charlie. Charlie was an idiot, while his character was good hes just an idiot. Also its impossible to bring him back he was ran over by a train remember?"
,kilroy238,2011-10-05T11:32Z,"@rando606 being ""dead"" is not an excuse. It's simple Rose was a loon and a rich loon for all we know Charlie is right now naked and tied to a bed because Rose went all Annie Wilkes on him. "
,DYanna,2011-10-05T17:20Z,Thanks for the up
,TheDutchJesus,2011-10-05T21:26Z,CHARLIE FOR PRESIDENT!!
,Sarahnem,2011-10-05T22:26Z,"Charlie Sheen is a washed up fuck up.  You don't go  to work and get pissed off at your boss and tell him to fuck off.  You all need to quit whining and put the blame with the idiot that got himself fired, and not with Ashton Kutcher or anyone else.  Quit acting like my 5 year old and just deal."
,earlsme,2011-10-06T04:17Z,"seeds please,,,,,:("
,SexyGoat,2011-10-06T23:02Z,It's next to unwatchable and unenjoyable when the main guy isn't there any more.
,hoffa1111,2011-10-07T08:12Z,thank you
,desertlover,2011-10-08T02:38Z,This episode was better than the first two but about every time Ashton came on it wasn't as funny. If you get what i mean :S
,Youdthinkso,2011-10-08T07:24Z,everyone that says to bring back charlie: HE IS DEAD... HE GOT RUN OVER BY A TRAIN. HE ISN'T COMING BACK... have a little bit of an open mind for fucks sake. ashton kutcher is a good actor.
,Leganen,2011-10-10T18:27Z,I want Swesub 
,Dr.Rockzo,2011-10-16T06:41Z,lol ashton kutcher a good actor? In what universe? Charlie Sheen is a legend. Bring him back or cancel the show.
,walsh9239,2011-11-01T03:07Z,perfect thanx :)
