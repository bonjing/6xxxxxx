,sagar2011,2011-10-01T06:51Z,what do u mean by ripped foreign langugaes...does it mean all other commentries except english are removed...if thats the case plz provide some addons to it...
,4966,2011-10-01T08:27Z,You guys are really on FIRE!!!
[T],PirateBoy,2011-10-01T08:36Z,"@ sagar2011

Yes. Ripped foreign languages means that all other languages other than English are removed. This is not a full rip. A full rip contains everything(nothing ripped). But, in general ripped versions, either foreign languages or multiplayer or cutscenes(movies) are removed...or else videos are encoded...in this case...foreign languages are removed....

Shroo is a great ripper and I think he may provide the foreign language addon for such a popular and good game... :)"
