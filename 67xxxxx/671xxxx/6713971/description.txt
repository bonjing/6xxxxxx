The Irish Tenors - 1999 CD 320k (musicfromrizzo)

Features mainly John McDermott and Ronan Tynon along with
the presence of Anthony Kearns on some songs a bit - the
composition of this team hasn't always included McDermott
of course, however he does a lot of solo on this CD.

These are some of the greatest songs of what is Irish music
done here in good style and effort of spirit - enjoy!
