Here is one favorite games of all time.  The game even if it is 3 years old still looks amazing to the eyes.  Also it is a game play that is often overlook in the industry.  

=====================================================================================

I promise that anyone that is a fan of High-Def gaming or just fast pace game play will be a converted into a true lover of the game if they are not already.

=====================================================================================

I know I am not the first person to upload this, yet I have not seen it in awhile and decided to put it out there again.

=====================================================================================

Again I try to make it easy as possible.  Just put the folder in your program files and or "Game" folder, then run the "Mirror's Edge" shortcut in the main folder.

Note: This game likes to not make that shortcut work, but worry not just look in the "Binaries" folder and look for the exe.  It will work from there no matter what.

I hope you guys have as much fun as I do with this game.  Any problems just leave a comment.  :D
