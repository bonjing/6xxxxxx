I'm your huge fan yify. Always wait for your rips.
As usual,
V - 9/10
A - 9/10
M - 8.5/10
I have a request though. Not a request for a particular movie, but for subtitles for this movie. I would really appreciate subtitles for this rip. If someone else can help me with the subtitles, i would be more than happy. Please. They are nowhere to be found."
