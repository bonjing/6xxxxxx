,Hooligan1488,2011-09-30T07:18Z,"@mkdhdh

I'm sorry, i don't understand the logic here. The shows are uploaded after they are aired, how can you get them before the people there who can watch it on tv as they first air, lol. :P You just get the show in the next day.

But anyway, EZTV is the best uploader ever. Always seeding he's torrents."
,Unbegreiflich,2011-09-30T08:37Z,"@Hooligan1488  The guy is saying he gets the episode in the morning the next day, how can you not understand that ? It's just earlier in the morning cause when it's 6.OO in Europe, it's around midnight in the US, which we can say is late in the evening. The man is talking from his own point of you. Of course every one can upload the episode at the same time.

Can't you figure out that the man saying he is living in Belgium, he doesn't speak english that well and makes mistakes making is point ? How dumb are you ?"
,TheSageM,2011-09-30T10:54Z,"Thanks EZTV, you're the best!"
