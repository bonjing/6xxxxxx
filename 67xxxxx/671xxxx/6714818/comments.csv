,trollbaby,2012-05-27T00:44Z,"mean..thanx for this. havent watched it yet  still downloading.. my daughter has cancer and she has jst turned two and we also have been at a crossroad whether to stick to alternative or go conventional. long story short a s a parent i can honestly say that fear kiked in and we went conventional but we are now integrating medicinal philosophy to help our baby Kosher-Love Lopes. We live in New Zealand but i totally agree with the fact that chemotherapy is poison and its reduced us to tears many times, and has tested our faith in the belief that food is thy medicine. You jus dont want to do the wrong thing as a parent. i could write a novel bout it but nah ill just say this, In my country there isnt a large state of awareness of alternative healing and its fuken expensive. thanks for the DL"
