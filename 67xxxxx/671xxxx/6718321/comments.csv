,brknsoul1,2011-12-09T02:25Z,"Serial no longer works, program now phones home to check serial. 
Blocking net access gives ""can't connect"" error."
,SpineInMyChill,2012-04-30T17:20Z,"The serial does still work, just skip a few and use the generated number for both the Username and Serial Number. Works a charm, Thanks!"
,yoep,2012-04-30T22:25Z,"Thank you very much. 
Works perfectly. Only had some problems with generator because I didn't read the comments. But again thank you."
