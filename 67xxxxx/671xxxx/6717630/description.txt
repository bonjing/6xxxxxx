The Last Train Home

On the evening of July 11th 1990, 23 year old Sarah MacDiarmid caught a train from Richmond to Kananook station. She had been playing tennis with her friends at Flinders Park. She got off the train about 10.20pm and has never been seen since. Police believe that Sarah was abducted as she walked to her 1978 red Honda civic parked in the Kananook station car park. The inquest into Sarahâ€™s death was held in May 1996. Coroner Iain West found that Sarah was dead and had met her death by foul play. Two psychics are able to provide some answers into Sarah's last moments.
