[V],Nepotu,2011-10-02T23:55Z,"you're welcome, but, please, seed!"
[V],Nepotu,2011-10-04T00:19Z,"I don't know why appear 86.6% of my file when it is entire file. When you arrive at 86.6% I think that's all, and please verify if it play! Thanks."
[V],Nepotu,2011-10-04T15:31Z,When you achieve 86.6% of DL in fact you have 100% of the file. Play it and enjoy it!
,rpg849,2011-10-05T02:07Z,"Hello Nepotu, thank you for this. However could you please check the file it has interruptions in very exciting moments of the race around minute 9 and a short cut in the middle.
This is perhaps related to the fact that it only downloads up to 86.6%, the rest is missing.
Thank you anyway."
[V],Nepotu,2011-10-05T13:21Z,I will check and return with further informations. Thanks rpg849!
[V],Nepotu,2011-10-05T16:11Z,Now is 98.2% available. I don't know why isn't 100%. But is better than 86.6%.
,rpg849,2011-10-05T18:46Z,"Thank you, Nepotu, now its almost perfect. Thank you again. "
[V],Nepotu,2011-10-06T09:02Z,"You're welcome, rpg849! And thank you for your feedback!"
,stenioz,2011-10-07T01:55Z,"I downloaded and it stucked at 98.2%. But at 15min it got a hole and the video crash. I need to jump from 15min 0 sec to 16 min almost 17 to watch, else the video crashs =(
Awesome video man, just hope I can finish it if someone seed! I love your uploads, mostly the motogp ones! cya!"
,stenioz,2011-10-07T02:40Z,"yeah, I think nobody online has more than 98.2% of the file. Hope some1 seed it soon, then more ppl can seed!
Again, thanks Nepotu! you are the man!"
,spitfire486,2011-10-07T10:32Z,"Thanks for your hard work Nepotu!

A question though, I'm in North America, your files are 50FPS(not a big deal, I convert to 29.97fps it with a very simple program called ffmpeg) is this due to it being from Europe?

I am also stuck at 98.2% :("
[V],Nepotu,2011-10-08T11:53Z,"Sorry guys! I don't know what it happened. I brought here the file from 3 different sources of the riper brown8. And I couldn't arrive at 100 %. I'm very, very sorry! I will try again to reup or something, based on yours feedbacks. Is not a seeding problem."
[V],Nepotu,2011-10-08T12:17Z,"@stenioz: Thank you for your appreciation.
@spitfire486: No, doesn't. The sport-tvshow (soccer, basketball etc.) ripers try to improve the quality of their rip. So, for any game you could find 10-15 ripformats, from 8-10 GB (FullHD no compress) at 300-400 MB (low quality). I try to up best quality at 700-1400 MB (that including differents fps) from HDD space and internet bandwidth reasons. For example, extremezone, who is from my birthcountry, upload tones of movies at usuals fps."
[V],Nepotu,2011-10-08T17:30Z,This is nothing I can do with this up. I'll up an BBC english version of this particular race in a couple of hours. Thank you for your understanding.
