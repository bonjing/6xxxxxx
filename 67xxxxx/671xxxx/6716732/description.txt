Description:
On the eve of his high school graduation, Will Kidman (Liboiron) finally looks up from his books to catch the eye of the girl hes longed for the last four years the mysterious Eliana Wynter (Shaw). Hes always been the shy kid, flying under the radar, but when he discovers a dark secret from his past that he is heir to a powerful line of werewolves -- he finds he has a choice to make between succumbing to his primal nature, or turning against his own, and maintaining his humanity. In order to fight the destiny of his legacy, and save Eliana  as well as himself  he must battle not only his growing blood lust but an army of fearsome beasts bent on killing him, Eliana...and then, us all.
