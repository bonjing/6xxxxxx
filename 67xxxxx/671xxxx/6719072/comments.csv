""Upgrading software, please check back in some minutes."""
,Mikkel Rev,2011-10-04T18:09Z,@RomanMMX YES! TPB has been acting wierd for me aswell...
,RomanMMX,2011-10-06T04:57Z,"US television network NBC pulled the plug on The Playboy Club on Tuesday after just three episodes, in the face of poor ratings and an outcry from parents who thought the 1960s-themed drama was too hot for prime time.

THIS WAS A HOT SHOW!
Nothing good ever lasts.....
Just like the 2007 ABC's CANE!

Now it's just SON OF ANARCHY,
the only great show left........

,AndroidLove,2011-10-21T18:05Z,Seriously lame to pull it off the network. Hope HBO picks it up - imagine how f**kin amazing the visuals would get on a show like this then!!!!
,AndroidLove,2011-10-21T18:07Z,"@RomanMX - what other hot shows are available now - think along the lines of Entourage (not the last season), Californication, etc ... - get the drift :D
'How to Make it in America' & 'Hung' pretty hot since HBO picked it up, esp. since HtMiiA is the same behind the scenes crew as Entourage.
Never seen Sons of Anarchy. Anything else?"
,Kingman_Arizona,2011-10-24T10:30Z,"The Playboy Club ,is an American television series, which ran on NBC from September 19, 2011 to October 3, 2011. Set in 1961,[4][5] the series centers around the employees (known as Bunnies) of the original Playboy Club operating in Chicago.[6] NBC announced on May 12, 2011 that it had picked up the pilot as a series.[7][8]

The Playboy Club was canceled on October 4, 2011 after airing three episodes.[9][10][11] It was the first cancellation of the 2011â€“2012 television season.[9] NBC continued to film the series until October 10, 2011, hoping to sell the series to another network.[12] Both Playboy magnate Hugh Hefner and show creator Chad Hodge have expressed the hope that the series will be picked up by Bravo.[13][14]

When production wrapped on October 10, 2011, Chad Hodge and Laura Benanti both confirmed that they had finished seven episodes including the pilot.[2] Benanti further stated that the seventh episode has two endings, one of which is more final to the series.[3]
