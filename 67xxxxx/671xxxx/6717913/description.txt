                          Thank  you SHOWTIME for airing 
                         the   Dexter  premier  full of 
                          glitches, this makes 2 seasons 
                            in  a row now. We had to piece 
                            this   release  together using 
                            the  first  airing  along with 
                            the repeat. Enjoy!
