It tells of 11 mystery days in 1926 when the novelist, distraught because her husband wanted a divorce, disappeared from view and checked into a health spa under the name of her husband's mistress.

The official explanation for the episode was "insomnia," and the event is ignored in Christie's autobiography. But how much explanation do we need? Her disappearance, her pseudonym and her behavior are easily accounted for by the crisis she was facing. We might not have acted that way ourselves, but we can understand why someone else would have.

Agatha is a visually rich movie filmed exquisitely by Vittorio Storro and pleasantly scored by Robert Mandel. Superstars Vanessa Redgrave and Dustin Hoffman are paired as the two unlikely companions.
