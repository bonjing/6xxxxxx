I\'ve looked through several torrent sites trying to find this album and none of them had it, not even in MP3 format. So I went out and bought the cd just so I can share it with the people of The Pirate Bay. So please don\'t make me regret it and SEED SEED SEED the shit outta this torrent. And for those of you who care about the quality of your music, I present this album to you in FLAC. ENJOY!!!!
