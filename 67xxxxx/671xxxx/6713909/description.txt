These are all the bootleg concerts that TD have done over the past 40 years, Vol.1 - 61 are all complete with covers. I have just recently aquired Vol. 81 - 87, These are all complete apart from Vol. 83 which has 3 songs missing.  These files are not easy to find anywhere online and I have not even found the volumes 62 - 80. Maybe I can do these in a future upload sometime.

This is a large music file at 8.23gb so I will be seeding this forever and would appreciate it if you could do the same.

This will take a long time to download from me so please be patient as it is worth having all these rare concerts in your collection.
