It's hard to imagine anyone better than Jonathan Cecil at reading P.G. Wodehouse. This novel includes ridiculous yet recognizable characters from all classes of British society. Their speech blends regional dialect, period references, personal shorthand, and dotty humor in situations of comic genius, in this case multiple romances, multiple impersonations, and multiple aged aunts looming round the dinner table threatening to quash it all. But no matter who's speaking, Cecil sounds like he was born to deliver each part. Listening to him as the deadpan genius butler Jeeves is like listening to a perfect character actor.
