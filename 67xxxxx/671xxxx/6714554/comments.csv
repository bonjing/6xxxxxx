,stevensnz,2011-10-01T18:18Z,"Hi i installed this and ive got a rip of avatar and star wars 1 - 3 and using this program gives me an error message saying sorry but trial versions cant access the the update server, 

Total size: 23911296 sectors (46701 MBytes)
Video Blu-ray label: Star Wars Episode 3
Media is AACS protected!
Media is BD+ protected!
AACS MKB version 23
couldn't retrieve AGID!
Sorry, but trial versions are not allowed to use the update server!

The AnyDVDHD trial is intended for functionality testing only and,
for business reasons, updates for processing some new discs are not available.
ERROR processing Blu-ray disc!

Please help!

Any chance to upload a cracked copy of pavtube blu ray ripper ;)"
,stevensnz,2011-10-01T18:31Z,oh and even if i uncheck the box for use online datbase when it loads the disk it says it needs to use the online database
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-10-01T18:47Z,"bro,listen to me :
1) disable and uncheck following cases 
in your general menu setting option :
check automatically new update
and
allow connecting to online support database.
Cause when you let these cases enabled,
SlySoft online server checker is able to trace your ip and detects that you use a cracked version of Any DVD HD
as the crack can make believe that it is still trial version in certain cases or conditions,sometimes.
Retry by procceding like that :
uninstall all and delete completely SlySoft folder
as well as all trace in registry :
run regedit.exe et search SlySoft and Any DVD HD
name and delete all keys from;
after that reboot and go offline and reinstall 
trial version after the end of this one,close all !
be sure that Any DVD HD is not enabled and running by watching and checking if its icon is present in your taskbar.
Any DVD HD icon must be to grey color =
means unactive and disabled !
auto exiting its icon from your tasbar,crucial !!!
place RES patch directly in SlySoft folder now.
On Vista/Win7 run patch as administrator !
if necessary patch again to be sure.
close all now,and run Any DVD HD,unable it and its icon is now on red color = enabled and active !
ohhh man,i forget something very important too !
disable absolutely auto enable program at start session of windows,cause when you start again your os,this one is enabled and can be sometimes traced again also by online server checker as it is active in background as well.
The best way to do it is :
use,enable it only offline,right ?
try to work offline only,every time and all should be ok.
SlySoft have made their special online support database to get best and maximum chance to detect all cracked versions of their soft...
That's the big problem cause whitout this one Any DVD HD might possibly lost its full potential to decrypt as well.SlySoft are not so stupid,so be aware of that,be sure as they will still try to permanently track you as well.
In fact,first thing is to always install any trial version offline,and yeah,even that so :s
cheers and GL"
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-10-01T18:59Z,"so,if you have been owned :(
your ip is traced by SlySoft now and as i have expected this fucking special online update support database is the true problem anyway.
Without it we are dead for get full potential to decrypt so. :s
appears that SlySoft is really intelligent,they find the way to fuck us very intelligently so.
Well let me more time and i will try to see if it will be possible to find an alternative method,but i don't have much hope to this topic.
sorry again for this sad news so and apologies as well for this sad inconvenient."
,Nuchem,2011-10-01T20:18Z,"Why does the torrent stop downloading at 99.9% really need this to use for Transformers Dark Of The Moon Blu-ray disc? There are plenty of seeders, tried to get 100% 2 times now."
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-10-02T04:03Z,"Well quite strange mate.
My seed is still and ratio not exceded yet.
approximaly 100 downloads already achieved...
file is still available at 100%...
check your tracker list to be sure...
Uless a damn peer blocking or a possible little freeze,however,i see two peers downloading
actualy without any problem...
try to switch to 80 port to see if better.
Let me know asap if still continuing or not,ty !
regards"
,Timewarpone,2011-10-02T04:41Z,"Works great. No more problems with Transformers 3. The first thing, after downloading, I did was disconnect my internet connect. I then uninstalled my previos version then installed the new one and then rebooted. I then put the patch in the Anydvd installation folder in program files. I then clicked on the patch and thats all she wrote. Before turning my internet connection back on I went into the program settings and unchecked ""Automatically Check for new anydvd versions"" "
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-10-02T16:53Z,"hĂŠhĂŠ,nice one TimeWarpone ;)
fine understanding...
glad to learn this good news so.
yes,the fact you have decided to reboot during the method to crack has been determinating,sure.
There is a subtility to understand for get sucessful
match and you got this one,gg !
Welcome to magical world dude :)
cheers"
,CerealUK,2011-10-02T20:36Z,"Still not able to rip the Hawaii Five-0 Season 1 Blu-Rays, same error about having to go online to retrieve the keys from the online decryption database - which I expect will get my IP address blacklisted? 

Not Tyr3ll's fault though, everything else works fine once cracked. I guess these keys are not stored inside AnyDVD's local key database yet. 

Thanks for your efforts in releasing this so quick dude."
,CerealUK,2011-10-02T21:40Z,"Nevermind, ignore my previous post. It seems you can access the online decryption database without getting your IP blacklisted."
,Nuchem,2011-10-02T21:52Z,"So I was able to download this torrent 100% from another computer in my house, it seems that the issue before was the computer I was using. Another good step to do is block AnyDVD HD with your Windows firewall, if your using windows, so there is no incoming, or outgoing connection to the internet. I was able to remove all copy protection etc, from Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011) Blu-ray disc, with AnyDVD HD 6.8.7.0 (This version), & am copying to hard drive with DVD Fab right now. Thanks to Tyr3ll for the upload, he got this version faster than the elite tracker sites somehow. Now I can return disc to Redbox, had to keep a day longer to remove disc encryption, but at least it cost me $3.00 only. "
,stevensnz,2011-10-03T08:09Z,"how did you manage to use the online database, mine just says trials cannot use this or whatever, i know this is not tyr3lls fault and thankyou for your help btw, does anyone know the keys for the starwars collection? "
,CerealUK,2011-10-04T21:08Z,"I was able to connect to the online decryption database for approximately 3 discs, now it keeps warning me that trial versions cannot use the update server. I have reinstalled, cleared the registry, used the supplied crack and changed the external IP address with no joy.

The b******s must have something else hiding on the system that isn't cleared when uninstalling. I'll burn their shop down before I pay 63 euro's for an annual license!! "
,Dav333,2011-10-05T10:15Z,CerialUK Ill be happy to help you burn those scum #####. EAT SHIT slysoft you rip off fuks. I backed up star wars without paying you dirty in breads
[T],grimreaper420,2011-10-08T03:01Z,"went offline like I always do before&after, patched the file, rebooted (still offline) go to  Program Settings, and UN-check Automatically check for new AnyDVD version.
I will recommend UN-check Use Online Protection Database....do you really want the headaches? 
Yes, I managed to rip 4 DVD's and 2 bluray discs :) piece of cake thanx Tyr3ll "
