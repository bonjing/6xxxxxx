For their third studio album, spacy North Carolina-based, alt-country-folk trio Megafaun dial back the more progressive elements of their sound in favor of a languid, Laurel Canyon-inspired foundation that treads the middle ground between experimental, neo-Southern rock romancing and infatuation with American Beauty-era Grateful Dead. While the eponymous Megafaun is far less exploratory than its predecessors, that doesnt mean that the band has forsaken its acid-folk roots. Richly textured and laden with long, cavernous harmonies, songs like Real Slow and Get Right feel lived in and highway ready, while simpler, more compact cuts such as Resurrection and StateMeant wouldnt have sounded out of place on fellow Carolina crooners the Avett Brothers elegant I and Love and You.
