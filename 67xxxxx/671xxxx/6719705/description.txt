VVVVVV is a 2D puzzle platform video game designed by Terry Cavanagh and scored by Magnus PÃ¥lsson. The game was built in Adobe Flash and released on January 11, 2010 for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. The game was ported to C++ by Simon Roth in 2011, and released as part of the Humble Indie Bundle #3. The port to C++ allowed the release of a previously-cancelled version of VVVVVV for Linux.

In VVVVVV, the player controls Captain Viridian, who is lost in an alternate dimension, in search of the missing members of her[note 1] spaceship's crew. Instead of jumping, the player is able to control the direction of gravity, allowing Captain Viridian to flip between the floors and ceilings of the environment. The graphical style of VVVVVV is heavily influenced by the Commodore 64; similarly, the game's music is entirely chiptune. Magnus PÃ¥lsson released the soundtrack to VVVVVV as PPPPPP.
