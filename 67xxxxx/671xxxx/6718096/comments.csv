I know you say in the description that it's a homemade compilation but why then do you give it the exact same name as an official release in the same genre ? Most people would probably download without ever reading the description ... You did the same thing with 'Authenticite', a bunch of people probably think they have the 'Authenticite' and 'Nigeria 70' albums now, but actually what they have is a compilation you made ...

That you're putting out all this music is great man ... but could you please try to name think more consistently so people don't get confused ? "
