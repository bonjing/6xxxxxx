,blk09,2011-10-07T04:15Z,haha...  anyway thats the skidrow release. both cracks are skidrows. managed to work it the first time but after some time sth did went wrong. I think ubisoft game launcher causes the issue.
,Hawkeyeshx,2011-10-17T19:35Z,What do you type for the cd key
,noto_bang,2011-10-20T19:13Z,"@Hawkeyeshx it shouldnt ask a key.
 i found out its kinda trouble in order to make it work due to ubisoft game launcher and other(if exist) installed ubisoft games.
 for those who have  problems with mispell (due to f****n edit that is temporarily disabled for ages) try this one

without aplying the ubisoft launcher files and the update just the needed game files.ubi launcher should be untouched or fresh install or will cause probs."
