Heartland S05E03: What's in a Name?

Tim's revelation threatens to upset the family's traditional naming ceremony for Lou's baby. 

Michael and Susan Hogan, who play Peter's parents on Heartland, are actually his parents in real life. Michael Hogan played Colonel Saul Tigh on Battlestar Galactica. 

Michelle Morgan, who plays Lou on Heartland, was pregnant in real life and at the time episodes one and two of this season were being written she had not yet had her baby girl (who was named Mara). To be safe, everyone thought it would be wise to give Michelle and her new baby time away from production, so she wasn't in the first block of episodes. In Heartland's world Lou and Peter were visiting Peter's parents in Saskatchewan.

This episode aired on CBC on October 2, 2011.
