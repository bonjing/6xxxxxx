,00Daddio,2011-10-01T07:02Z,"@425paul
Not sure why it is saying no seeders but there are and if you read the post you will notice I stated that I am limited on bandwidth. I have been seeding since its inception and will continue to do so as long as it takes to get this going."
,425paul,2011-10-01T15:32Z,"I look at the top of this page and it says Seeders: -0, Leechers: 50. 0 means Zero, nada, zip, none."
,00Daddio,2011-10-01T18:23Z,According to  u-Torrent there are 14 seeders but suite yourself 425paul. Perhaps I added the tracker info wrong when creating the torrent file itself and tpb is unable to track it properly which is my bad but if you actually try opening the torrent you should see the 14 seeders and to them I thank you for seeding.
