This classic horror movie starring Bela Lugosi is known as the worlds first zombie film.
Unfortunately this one is in a sucky KVCD format but it was the only one I could find. It can be watched using VLC or burned to a cd. Note that you may have to select track 2 in the audio menu in VLC to hear the sound.
