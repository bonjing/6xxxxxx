,Ciahast,2012-03-08T16:09Z,The english hard subs kind of ruin it. Especially since they're subs for the Jap audio and so don't what any of the characters are even saying.
,Ciahast,2012-03-08T16:10Z,and so don't match what any of the people are saying*
,jsummers1,2012-03-11T22:19Z,"So is this the sliced up Nickelodeon version? Or is the video from the DVD/BD release?

Will there be blood?"
,Baltheron,2012-04-11T11:27Z,"What are the subtitles? Can you turn them off? If not, what are they there for."
