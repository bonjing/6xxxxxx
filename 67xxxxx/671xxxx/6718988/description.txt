Auction Hunters Season 2 Complete

Every day in America, there are over ten thousand abandoned storage units that are put up for public auction. 

Each unit has the potential to be a goldmine or a bust for those who make their living hunting unclaimed property. This series follows two of the best prospectors in the business, Clinton "Ton" Jones and Allen Haff, in their quest to win auctions, acquire treasure and sell it for profit.
