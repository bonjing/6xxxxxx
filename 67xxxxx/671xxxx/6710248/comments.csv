plot:

Megamind getting rid of all his evil weapons of destruction in a sort of yard sale; it seems like a good idea until a button in a box gets pushed and an unused ""unspeakable evil"" gets activated and focuses on destroying the protector of Metrocity â who at this time happens to be Megamind himself."

That's a data rate of almost 5 GIGABYTES for a 2 hr movie....

Get a clue please. Thanks."
