A thrash band from Southern California, Warbringer came together in 2004. Sharpening their skills through numerous performances, the band recorded a demo which eventually led to an EP release in 2006. Entitled One By One the Wicked Fall, it was good enough to capture the attention of one of the planets biggest metal labels, Century Media. The label signed them up, and the band released their debut, War Without End, in 2008.
