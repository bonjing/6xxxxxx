,aaron1266,2011-10-03T16:23Z,Why on 96 Khz when a red book cd limit its 44.1 Khz?
,aaron1266,2011-10-03T16:24Z,Why on 24 bits when a red book cd limit its 16 bits? 
,MoggyM,2011-10-03T17:52Z,From audio Bluray for best quality.
,hultin35,2011-10-06T20:24Z,"Why 24/96?
Because itÂ´s recorded in higher resolution - and for those of us who has a system that can reproduce 24/96. (Many systems can do that today, not just expensive ones)"

,Wolfpacker96,2011-10-10T17:04Z,"Who cares what the Red Book standard is.  Flacs play at 24/96, which was ripped from the Blu-ray audio disc.  If you want to reduce the quality and burn it to CD Audio, go for it.  The rest of us will play it at the higher quality.  This is 2011, not 1995, we don't need audio CDs."
,snadge,2011-10-10T21:42Z,"@ aaron1266 - you want to check the Blu-Ray audio standard mate... not the CD, this audio did not come from a ""redbook CD"" so there is nothing 'sus' about this upload, you can play this format on your PC, laptop, MP3 player or iPod (converted to ALAC) - I currently have it on my iPod in ALAC format and thus is better than CD quality - Studio Quality actually, there is also a 5.1 and 4.0 Surround sound version of this in 96/24 "
,BLORRY,2011-10-12T01:16Z,Sounds like aaron1266 has been living on the dark side of the moon for the past decade! LOL
,snadge,2011-10-12T18:15Z,"also, this is not the 2011 remaster...

there is no hi rez version of that, the only hi-res versions are
1973 2.0
1973 4.0
2003 5.1
stupid I know... not having a hi-rez version of the 'new' remaster in the immersion boxset..  in fact none of the hi-res stuff is 'new'"
,aaron1266,2011-10-13T10:06Z,No use to argue snadge. So for those folks who think that a bootleg recorded on cassette (and in his 3rd gen) with a mic (assuming) 40 hz to 20 khz sounds better in flac... well. just enjoy your hifi with ears who can listen to those frequencies!
,aaron1266,2011-10-13T10:09Z,But still i prefer the SACD version IN ITS ORIGINAL AND LEGAL FORMAT... All I was saying its that those versions are not worth downloading especially in stereo supersampled at 24/96.
,camaro600f,2011-12-12T18:46Z,Is your argument that the bluray and dvds released with this album were undersampled to redbook standards? lol.
,S.C.I.,2011-12-24T23:40Z,"day by day you find more and more assholes around here complaining about everything,fuckin hell!!!
aaron could you please shut the fuckin hole a put away the key?
the torrent is free,even the uploader had some work to share with brainless people like you.
really any torrent a look for recently have some sort of rat talking shit.
ah,i almost forgot,thanks anonymous great share indeed"
,bartekelm,2012-03-05T20:40Z,IT IS NOT 24-BIT SAMPLING!!! FLAC supports only 16-bit. It changes it to 16 automatically. Check these files out. WAV files are needed.
,bartekelm,2012-03-08T00:02Z,"Sorry, my mistake"
