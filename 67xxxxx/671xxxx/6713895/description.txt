Editorial Reviews
From AudioFile
Setting out to prove that he can solve problems with the skill of his
butler, Jeeves, Bertie Wooster schemes to help Gussie Fink-Nottle and
Tuppy Glossop with their romantic problems. Of course, Bertie's plans
are destined to "strew ruin and desolation" in the manner of Attila
the Hun, as his Aunt Dahlia suggests. Jonathan Cecil reads the story
with a fine ear for comic wordplay and absurdity, giving fitting caricatured
voices to the likes of Fink-Nottle and Glossop. He gives Wooster's first-person
narrative the right balance, letting the bumbling hero misread situations
as needed. The chaos builds toward a crescendo of levity that will be
a favorite among Wodehouse fans. J.A.S. ï¿½ AudioFile 2005, Portland,

Book Description
When Jeeves suggests dreamy, soulful Gussie Fink-Nottle don scarlet
tights and false beard to win over soppy Madeline Bassett, Bertie Wooster
doubts this is the way to get his friend hitched. Meanwhile, Bertie's
eccentric Aunt Dahlia asks him to hand out prizes at the Market Snodsbury
Grammar School, which he's sure he would have to get drunk to do. Complicating
maters, Madeline invites Gussie to stay at her friend's house in the
country. The friend turns out to be Bertie's cousin Angela and the house
- Aunt Dahlia's. Thinking things have definitely gotten out of hand,
Bertie takes Jeeves off the case, acting on his own plan to bring Gussie
and Madeline together. But when things go disastrously wrong, who can
Bertie turn to but Jeeves? Acclaimed actor Ian Carmichael brings comic
flair to this rollicking tale by the man The Times (London) called a
"brilliantly funny writer."
