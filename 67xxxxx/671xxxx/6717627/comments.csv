[V],UltraTorrents,2011-10-03T14:31Z,"ShowTime aired it full of glithes, the repack was build from both first air and repeat."
,Krn90,2011-10-04T01:39Z,"There's this ADS EVERYWHERE!

If u click in some blank space on TPB = NEW TAB = ADS

If u click in any link on TPB = NEW TAB = ADS

Maybe when I submit this comment now a ADS will show up from hell!

ITS DRIVIN' ME CRAZY! WTF?!"
,pjsat,2011-10-04T03:57Z,Picture quality and sound is good but I'm getting sound and picture out of sync a little. Tried a couple of different players same result.
,.h10.,2011-10-04T16:13Z,use vlc and change sound to + 0.200 s and enjoy.
[H],politux,2011-10-04T22:15Z,Thanks for 720p
,BoonesFerry,2011-10-05T01:40Z,Out of sync in several places. 
,pjsat,2011-10-05T02:07Z,"Yes I used MPC HC and shifted sound which fixed sync problem.
The sync is fine with the original release (except for the glitch near the end).
Both releases seem to have some dropped frames or something. Get a bit of jerky palyback here and there.
Overall Ok though. Beggers can't be choosers."
