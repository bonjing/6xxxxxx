Just tried the ""AP9: P3 â 1Z19 Plymouth - Paddington"" scenario included in the AP9: New Measurement Train (NMT) Scenario Pack. The view angle in the normal cab view is upwards, not towards the track, which renders the scenario unplayable from cab view. I'm so happy I didn't overwrite my old RW2 installation but installed RW3 in a new, separate directory."
