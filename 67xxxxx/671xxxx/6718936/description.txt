Kill Shakespeare #1 - 12 Complete [IDW]

An epic adventure that will change the way you look at Shakespeare forever. 

In this dark tale, the Bardâ€™s most famous heroes embark upon a journey to discover a long-lost soul.  Hamlet, Juliet, Othello, Falstaff, Romeo and Puck search for a reclusive wizard who may have the ability to assist them in their battle against the evil forces led by the villains Richard III, Lady Macbeth and Iago.  That reclusive wizard?  William Shakespeare.

A combination of Fables, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and Lord of the Rings, Kill Shakespeare offers a remixed re-envisioning of the greatest characters of all-time, featuring action, romance, comedy, lust, drama and bloody violence.  It is an adventure of Shakespearean proportions.
