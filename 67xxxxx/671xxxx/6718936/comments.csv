,SINpatria,2011-10-04T23:42Z,"Wow this was awsome, I'm currently penciling a comic about the authorship of Shakespeare's work, it's basically about several different poeple claiming to be the real author of his works. Its sorta a crime noir, i'll post it when ever i finish It (if I ever finish it, lol), this is a great comic, The authorship debate is actually a real thing"

Classy work, man."
