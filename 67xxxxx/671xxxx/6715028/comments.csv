I'm guessing it won't all fit on one DVD-DL though."
[T],trialNerror,2011-10-02T21:45Z,"You can use 2 DVD-R's, however DVD's have a max bitrate of 9.8Mbps while parts of these videos might possibly exceed that.  This will result in jittery playback at those parts no matter how slow of burn speed you use.

This will only happen at a few clips throughout all the season.

Just wanted to let it be known before anyone comes back saying there's something wrong with the videos while trying to watch them off a DVD.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with these episodes (I watched all of them streaming to the PS3) and ANY stuttering while trying to watch them off a DVD is due to the standard DVD's limited bitrate."
