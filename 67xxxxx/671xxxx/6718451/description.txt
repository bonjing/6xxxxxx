I uploaded this torrent in view of the people who have a crappy download/upload speed (like me) and can\'t afford to download the HQ ones. The episodes are in mkv format and 60MB each with subtitles in English and audio in English/Japanese. Plzz after downloading this try to seed as much as possible because my upload speed is pretty slow.......
