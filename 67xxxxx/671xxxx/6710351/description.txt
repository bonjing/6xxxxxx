-------------Complete Patrick O'Brian Audiobook Collection v2.0-------------
Patrick O'Brian is considered by many to be the greatest historical novelist of the 20th century. I absolutely love plunging my imagination back 200+ years and living the adventures along with two of the greatest characters in fiction.

After releasing my first O'Brian torrent 2 years ago, I found that many people wanted the full Aubrey-Maturin series done by either Patrick Tull or Simon Vance. Therefore I have spent months tracking down every single version of every O'Brian novel that exists. I have processed all these unabridged books in the following ways:

1. I ripped ALL of these myself. All 61 books are ripped from high quality CDs. It has taken me 3 years find all of the versions.

2. FULLY CHAPTERIZED. This took many weeks. Each audio book was compiled into a single file (deleting bits like "end of disc 5, please insert disc 6") and then separated into Parts and Chapters as defined by the original books. I find this to be the best way to enjoy audiobooks and it is perfect for iPods.

3. Encoded all books to a uniform MP3 96kbps 44.1kHz.

4. ID3 Tagged. All audio book files have been fully ID3 tagged including full COVER ART.

Although the Aubrey-Maturin series is what first attracted me (and most people) to O'Brian's works, they were not his first novels, nor even his first novels about the sea. In this torrent I believe I have included 100% of his works that are still in print -- that's 26 novels. However, please note that his 3 earliest novels cannot be found in audiobook form.

Most importantly, included are both the full Patrick Tull collection and the full Simon Vance collection of Aubrey-Maturin novels! I have also included 14 additional A-M recordings. This was a massive undertaking but I think and very much hope it will be worth it to all the faithful O'Brian fans out there. :)

Please leave any comments, questions, or suggestions you might have as they are HIGHLY APPRECIATED! :)

Enjoy!
