I used to love Dr Snuggles growing up because it was just littered with crazy adventures. There\'s the Cosmic Cat, Woogie the humped camel who lives in the rainbow land and Rickity Rick and the flying ship dreamy boom boom. One episode, \'The Fidigty River\' was written by Douglas Adams which should give some idea of the crazy adventures Dr Snuggles get up to.
