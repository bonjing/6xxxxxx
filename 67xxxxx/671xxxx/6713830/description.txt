Joining Jools in the studio this week are Leicester's stadium rockers Kasabian with tracks
from their fourth album Velociraptor!, and North London's rapper and former Grime MC, and
now star of the charts Wretch 32, with songs from his debut album Black and White, including
recent No 1 single Don't Go.

Also Crowded House's Neil Finn returns to the show with his 'supergroup' Pajama Club,
which features his wife Sharon on bass along with Sean Donnolly and Alana Skyring
completing the line-up, the songs on their self-titled debut album coming after late-night
jamming sessions between Neil and Sharon.

The show also features young Mali singer Fatoumata Diawara and Warwickshire's own
bestselling and award-winning pop-soul singer/songwriter James Morrison.
Canvey Island's guitarist and songwriter Wilko Johnson, particularly associated with the UK
rhythm and blues outfit Dr Feelgood, performs classic tracks from their catalogue, joined by
