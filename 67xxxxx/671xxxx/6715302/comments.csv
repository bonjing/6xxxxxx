,jjaworsk,2011-10-02T10:47Z,How thick do you like your spam ???
,ebnbiz,2011-10-02T11:17Z,And what is spam about this? Why do you guys keep condemning people's efforts and diverting attention away from what is right? What is the source of your hatred?
,ebnbiz,2011-10-02T11:20Z,"@jjaworsk, you are yet to upload any torrents for people to benefit from, yet you run around torrents screaming ""spam"" at the top of your voice. Grow up, kid. And take the back seat when men are getting serious."
,ebnbiz,2011-10-02T11:24Z,grow up! This aint spam! Do your investigations before commenting here!
,jjaworsk,2011-10-02T14:38Z,"From Wikipedia:-

Forum spam is the creating of messages that are advertisements on Internet forums. It is generally done by automated spambots. Most forum spam consists of links to external sites, with the dual goals of increasing search engine visibility in highly competitive areas such as weight loss, pharmaceuticals, gambling, pornography, real estate or loans, and generating more traffic for these commercial websites. Some of these links contain code to track the spambot's identity if a sale goes through, when the spammer behind the spambot works on commission."
,ebnbiz,2011-10-02T18:01Z,"^Thank you for educating me. I don't know what spambot is. And I don't know what tracking of identity is. I am not promoting anything that you mentioned either. People are matured enough to make their own decisions. This is a genuine opportunity and I believe everyone here on piratebay is matured enough to decide if this is what they want or not. I will not be caught trying to increase any website's visibility either. Bonvoyage gets as much traffic as it needs to keep on offering their services without anyone trying to do it for them. My name is Sikir Abdul, and I am the author of 6 best selling books on clickbank. My passion is traveling and assisting people to travel. You may continue to post ""spam"" alerts here but I believe I have responded enough to allow people judge this can never be regarded as spam. Once again, I thank you for your comments, they are educative, if not inspiring. And just to mention, over 47 people from piratebay have signed up yet for the offer. I believe their comments too on this thread would not be too long coming. Cheers!"
