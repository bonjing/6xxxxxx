Plot:For the first time ever, Fantasia is available on DVD Restored and remastered, DVD truly captures Walt Disney's unique inspiration - complete with the intermission and narration - which have not been included in the film since its original theatrical release!

Fantasia created the mold for blending music and movie magic into an exhilarating movie-going experience. Unforgettable images are brought to life by some of the world's best music - the comedy of Mickey Mouse as a troublemaking sorcerer's apprentice, the beauty of winged fairies and cascading snowflakes, even plump hippos performing ballet in tutus!
