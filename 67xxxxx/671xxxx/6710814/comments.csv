[T],Filmofiel,2011-09-30T17:51Z,"Lol @ uploader, torrents aren't depending on how fast your servers are. They are depending on how many users are up-and downloading. The files arent't available on the servers but are available at the users and the trackers which are leading the way. So your completely wrong."
