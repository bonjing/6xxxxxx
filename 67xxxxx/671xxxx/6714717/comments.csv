you download the program. on the folder ""setup"" you install it. and replace the files on windows-system32- colorefex....,
with the files that are on the program's package.it's called folder ""crack"" be sure to read the ""readme file"" there.
This is all I can tell you! See ya"
,sam4729,2011-10-19T22:25Z,"You can call me an idiot, but I don't get the instructions at all.

1. Install.
2. Replace ColorEfexPro4FC32.dll and ColorEfexPro4FC64.dll cracked ones in the folder Window/System32 (SysWOW64 for 32bit in x64 system). For replasing ColorEfexPro4FC64.dll use Windows Explorer or 64 bit File manager.
3. Enjoy!"

,pxpierre,2012-02-24T20:57Z,"Thank you to chami1988 & seeders!

Work great on Windows 7 64-bit in both Photoshop CS5 & Lightroom 3.5:
1- Install selecting Photoshop 64. Don't start ANY programs after install.
2- Copy ColorEfexPro4FC64.dll from Crack64 to Crack32.
3- Copy both files now found in Crack32.
4- Paste both files in:
- c:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop\
- c:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS5 64 Bit
- c:\Windows\System32
- c:\Windows\Syswow64
5- Start Photoshop > open a photo > Filter use Color Efex, close PS.
6- Open Lightroom > Develop a photo, check > Edit > Preferences > Additional External Editor > Add Efex if not already there. Now right click photo & select Efex & have fun!"
,MediaLight,2012-03-23T00:23Z,@pxpierre: Thanks for the last comment! it worked for me.
