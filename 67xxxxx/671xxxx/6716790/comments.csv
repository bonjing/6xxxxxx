,prius4845,2011-12-07T00:15Z,"@ XRain Yes, Sorry, i originally posted just the song God Gave Me You, and that is why the .torrent was in the folder. I then decided to upload the entire album and forgot to remove the 03 God Gave Me You.m4a.torrent file. Also, is there anything wrong with the M4A format, that's just the first option in iTunes ""import CD"" list and thus I decided not to mess with it."
