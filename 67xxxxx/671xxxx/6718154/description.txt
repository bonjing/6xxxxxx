I dedicate this boxset to all young West Australian ladies,bless'em.

 If Rolf Harris has anything it's cheerful enthusiasm mixed in with not a little talent, plus he simply oozes sincerity and he's pretty impossible not to like. OK many of his songs aren't 'deep' [well other the odd Deep Purple cover], but whats wrong with taking a paddle in the shallows occasionally. Plus some are great Australian folk [e.g. Waltzing Matilda, Tie my Kangaroo down, Six white boomers] - and the kids like his slightly riske lines, e.g. about Mary also having a little bear: 'and everywhere that Mary went, you saw her bear behind...'
