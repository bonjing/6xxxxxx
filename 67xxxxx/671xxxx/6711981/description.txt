This is a big collection of 3DO games(60 games). Due to the big size of the collection I decided to divide it into 3 torrents. This is part Two

games in this part are: 

21. Gex
22. Icebreaker
23. Incredible Machice

37. PO'ed
38. Powers Kingdom

I will upload part 3 as soon as I finish seeding this one so please seed!

Also, I have included the world only 3DO emulator, FreeDO v2.1 alpha and I included the somewhat hard to find bios file FZ10. (in part 1) 

To play a game open the emulator and select the bios file "3do_bios_fz10.rom" which can be found in the emulator's directory inside the bios folder (for the first time only), then Click: File ---&gt; Open Image

All Games should work straight away

Further more, I included the JoyToKey software (in part 1). Which will allow you to use a Joy Stick or a controller to play the games instead of the keyboard. It simple to use.

Have fun and stay tuned for the rest of the games... Shpaz
