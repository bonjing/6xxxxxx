,micko84,2011-10-05T17:40Z,"i think the problem might be that the ripping firmware released was for benq and liteon, no sammy firmware was released yet, maybe try switching drives if you have a benq or liteon in your box, just flash with the ripping fw to that, then when your done reflash to lt2.0"
