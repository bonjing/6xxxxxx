,diverdiva,2011-10-07T10:21Z,This is a stellar effort! Thank you so much - will seed for as long as I can
,diverdiva,2011-10-10T12:59Z,"This is taking sooo long to dload and I'm not dloading all of it! The ratio of leechers to seeders is ridiculous - cmon people, SHARE!"
,Valnay,2011-10-15T20:36Z,Please seed 
,superpipe,2011-10-16T17:50Z,"Dude, you rock.  This is an amazing collection.  Thanks for the effort, man.  This is what makes Pirate Bay so damn special.  Top picks are Carrie, Insomnia and The Stand in my opinion.  "
[V],neil1966hardy,2011-10-18T02:08Z,"You are most welcome.  Please help by seeding a ratio of 1 : 1. It will help to keep this torrent alive indefinitely.

I have also uploaded this wonderful TV series of Stephen King shorts which may be of interest:

,lamer_gamer,2011-10-24T10:44Z,"This is taking forever. I really ant to get this thing downloaded, but I've been downloading for 2 weeks and it's only now ALMOST at 20%. Please seed."
,diverdiva,2011-10-28T08:42Z,"Yes it has taken weeks and I didn't dl all of it! Finally had to drastically reduce my upload limit for the duration, as the ratio of leechers to seeders is ridiculous!  Thanks again Neil, gr8 effort - just one problem with the books I've already listened to (dreamcatcher, colorado kid) .. the ends of the chapters all cut off prematurely, matter of (I think) a couple of sentences, which is a bit frustrating."
,grsdrgn,2011-10-31T04:50Z,"This is a torrent that shows true devotion.  When I download this completely I will come back and thank you for this.

Man my laptop's hard drive will despise me...;)"
,jollyjim3939,2011-11-04T01:08Z,a legendary effort - gracie
,gusstav,2011-11-04T21:36Z,"Absolutly awesome! I'm not finished DL yet, but I'm looking forward to the great day, and I'll be seeding for a looooong time!
:-)"
,Aiera,2012-01-15T00:27Z,"What an amazing job! I just finished the audio book on ""It"" and I absolutely love Stephen King, but did not dare to hope I would find this many of his books on here. Thank you!"
,LittleGod,2012-02-08T15:47Z,"Best.

Thank you for all your hard work in putting together this torrent. I will seed until my hard drive goes pop."

,arthelia,2012-04-04T07:06Z,"indeed man u r a real god, i honestly thank u from the bottom of my heart for this monster u have created!"
,SSDD2me,2012-04-06T21:57Z,"This looks good, but I already have several of his books, and this file is huge. Is it possible to choose files? 

My first time on Piratebay, but I have used Utorrent for some time and on those sites I usually am on, I always get option to choose the files I need."
,ragnarok_falls,2012-04-09T21:20Z,"@neil1966hardy Thank you very much sir, your time and effort are highly appreciated!!!"
,Dektep,2012-04-30T05:04Z,"This is truly an awesome torrent.  I downloaded it about 6 months ago and have been steadily working my way through - fantastic stuff.  My recommendations are Firestarter, Thinner and the Running Man.
Please note:  If you listen to the Running man SKIP the introduction to the Bachman books part at the beginning as it contains a spoiler for the ending of The Running Man.  Otherwise you will here the ending before you even hear the first word of the book.
And it's a very different ending to the film if you're wondering.  In fact the two stories are nothing alike at all."
,angeklaw,2012-05-23T02:36Z,thank you soooo much for this upload! it has every book i was looking for and more (including rage which isn't even published anymore) plus alternate versions. only took me 2 days to download. everything is extremely organized. thank you sooo much! will seed.
