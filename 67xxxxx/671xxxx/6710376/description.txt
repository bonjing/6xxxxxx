-------------Complete Stephen King Audio Collection v4.0-------------
For years there have been dozens of copies of Stephen King's audio books floating around on the internet -- many of them broken. Over the past two years, I have collected the complete UNABRIDGED fictional works of King. I have released several versions and updates and present the newest full up-to-date torrent here. I have processed everything in the following ways:

1. Checked for completeness. Many of the common copies on the internet which appear complete are missing large sections of audio. Notable examples include Firestarter, Gerald's Game, Cell, and many short stories. I have finally obtained complete copies of all books. :)

2. Equalized volume. Many audio books, especially ones digitized from cassette tapes, have crazily varying volumes. I have equalized volumes so there shouldn't be any sudden jumps.

3. FULLY CHAPTERIZED. This took many weeks. Each audio book was compiled into a single file (deleting bits like "this concludes disc 2, please insert disc 3") and then separated into Parts and Chapters as defined by the original books. I find this to be the best way to enjoy audiobooks and it is perfect for iPods. There are a few books (Cujo, Dolores Claiborne, The Shawshank Redemption, etc.) in which King included no parts, chapters, or numbers to separate.

4. Dehissed and noise-cleaned. When needed, I performed low pass filters and deleted pops in the audio.

5. Encoded all books to a uniform MP3 96kbps 44.1kHz.

6. ID3 Tagged. All audio book files have been fully ID3 tagged including full COVER ART. I have used the first edition covers for all books.

And so we have this 55gb monster of a King torrent. There are 9 new audiobooks and many fixes in this torrent since the 3.0 release! It is still about 99.99% complete. The only problem is I've still not found a clean copy of the short story "The Mist". I have presented two versions but they are not clean. Every other recording should be complete and high quality.

I did not intend to put out another full version release so soon, but I got such excellent feedback from Version 3.0 that I was able to FIX and ADD a good number of recordings as can easily be seen in the version history below. Those who have DLed previous versions should be able to seed most of the torrent, but there will be upgraded parts. I hope the many of you will help me seed this with the data you have as my max UL is not stellar. :)

Please leave any comments, questions, or suggestions you might have as they are HIGHLY APPRECIATED! :)

Enjoy!
