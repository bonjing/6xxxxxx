This is a poor copy and not recommended for Ebook readers, filled with blank pages and spaced text. purely for computer use I suggest.






The indispensable compendium of popular misconceptions, misunderstandings and common mistakes culled from the hit BBC show, QI.

The noticeably stouter QI Book of General Ignorance sets out to show you that a lot of what you think you know is wrong. If, like Alan Davies, you still think the Henry VIII had six wives, the earth has only one moon, that George Washington was the first president of the USA, that Bangkok is the capital of Thailand, that the largest living thing is a blue whale, that Alexander Graeme Bell invented the telephone, that whisky and bagpipes come from Scotland or that Mount Everest is the worldâ€™s tallest mountain, then there are at least 200 reasons why this is the book for you.
