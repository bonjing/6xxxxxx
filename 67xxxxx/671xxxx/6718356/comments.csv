,XPavarottiX,2012-02-01T08:49Z,"Hey, I would love to download this if you're doing to continue seeding.  I've fallen in love with folk punk lately, and this seems like a pretty comprehensive collection.

I'd also recommend looking into the Front Bottoms and Matt Pless, both of which would make good additions to the list."
,XPavarottiX,2012-02-01T10:01Z,"I would also definitely recommend that Against Me! is added to the list.  Their newer stuff doesn't really reflect it, but a lot of their more classic material is very laden with early folk-punk sounds that went on to influence a lot of the bands already in this torrent."
