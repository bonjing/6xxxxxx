Publisher's Summary
In the rigid theocracy of Salem, Massachusetts, rumors that women are practicing witchcraft galvanize the town. In the ruthlessness of the prosecutors and the eagerness of neighbor to testify against neighbor, The Crucible mirrors the anti-Communist hysteria in the 1950s.

This is a wonderfully done recording with good actors. This recording does not follow the script to the "T", but that draw back is overshadowed by the actors. They bring the play to life the way it is meant to be. This recording is superb.
