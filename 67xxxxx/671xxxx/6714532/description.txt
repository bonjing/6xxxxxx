This iso image is created by me (ivankehayov) from latest MS Office 2010 official releases and updates.
All is updated to 1st October 2011

I added automatic activation (mini-KMS Auto Activation Tool 1.13 - thanks to ZWT) for all except Project and Visio.
Use your favourite method of activation for Project and Visio (I recommend "Office 2010 Toolkit" from CODYQX4).
(If you do not need auto-activated Office mount the image, delete file ..msp from Updates folder, save the image, install)

To install use one of the following methods:
    1. Mount the image in virtual CD/DVD drive and start setup.exe (or leave it autorun).
or  2. Extract content of the image using WinRAR, 7-zip, UltraISO, etc. and run setup.exe.
or  3. Burn the image onto DVD using default Image Burning feature in Windows 7 or DVD burning software.
