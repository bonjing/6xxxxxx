Chinatown
Gone with the wind
12 Angry Men
The Sting
Charlie Chaplin Classics
Insomnia (although not a classic, yet a Nolan masterpiece with a great cast)
One Flew over the Cuckoo's nest
Wild Strawberries
Casablanca
It's a Wonderful Life
Singing in the Rain
The singing detective
Maltese Falcon 
Schindler's List

Et cetra!

Please link me the links to any existing undead torrents or any you upload now due to this request. I'd be very thankful HR!"
,beserke121,2011-10-18T03:31Z,"Thx HR. Um one more request, if that's possible. I heard LOTR Extended came out on Bluray, so would it be possible if you could upload iTunes friendly versions of that (m4v) in 1080p (rather than 720p)?"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-10-18T06:03Z,don't really fill requests.
,usamalali,2011-10-18T12:20Z,I read you responding to beserka121 in affirmative when he requested. Sorry if I bothered.
[V],HolyRoses,2011-10-18T14:00Z,"people request things that are on my general to do list so it appears i am filling their request when in actuality the file would of arrived had they said nothing at all.  that is what you are seeing. no worries, bye."
,beserke121,2011-10-19T02:45Z,"Sorry, I didn't mean a request, more like a suggestion. I'm grateful you upload such good stuff at all.

Might we see Hangover 2 and Harry Potter Deathly Hallows 2 soon (ie are they on your to do list)?"
,usamalali,2011-10-21T16:58Z,"I do understand.
Its just that I do not know how to convert AND play them in my Ipod. I do convert them to Mp4 successfully using Format Factory, but it fails to be stored in Ipod, let alone play, with the Ipod saying that the file is not MP4. I do have these classics n DVD though. Can you help?"
