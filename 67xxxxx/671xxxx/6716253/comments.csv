,Tiswatzo1,2011-11-10T15:57Z,"I got a good working acdsee 12
It got two problems a thumnail data base
what in 1 our time of surching in your files, a 2.5gig of highly fragmented file generates
I increased the database select folders and drives for exclusian as in manual written
The tools in database let you remove thumbnailbase and  orphan files but it left in defraggel block's of written data with nothing in it
So i must use wipespace too clean it up
Thats for an external hardrive 4 or 5 hour work
Is it fixed in this version?"
