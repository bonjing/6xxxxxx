the deposit is paid, and they have two weeks left to pay the outstanding balance of
?2,000. Sophie has entrusted George with her holiday savings and is keen to settle
the debt with the travel agents. The only trouble is, unbeknown to Sophie, George is
flat broke. In a vain attempt to raise cash, George uses Sophie's holiday money to
fund an ill judged deal.
