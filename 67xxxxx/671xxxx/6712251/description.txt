Proven in North America and abroad, this classic text has earned a reputation for excellent accuracy and mathematical rigour. Previous editions have been praised for providing complete and precise statements of theorems, using geometric reasoning in applied problems, and for offering a range of applications across the sciences. Written in a clear, coherent, and readable form, Calculus: Several Variables makes student comprehension a clear priority. This seventh edition features a new co-author, Dr. Christopher Essex, who has been invited to contribute his unique style and approach to the subject material. Instructors and students will appreciate revised exercises, greater emphasis on differential equations, and new pedagogical features.
About the Author
Robert Adams joined the Mathematics Department at the University of British Columbia in 1966 after completing a Ph.D. in Mathematics at the University of Toronto. His research interests in analysis led to the 1975 publication of a monograph, Sobolev Spaces, by Academic Press. It remained in print for 23 years. A second edition, joint with his colleague Professor John Fournier, was published in 2003. Professor Adams's teaching interests led to the 1982 publication of the first of his many calculus texts by Addison Wesley. These texts are now used worldwide. With a keen interest in computers, mathematical typesetting, and illustration. In 1984 Professor Adams became the first Canadian author to typeset his own textbooks using TeX on a personal computer. Since then he has also done all the illustrations for his books using the MG software program that he developed with his colleague, Professor Robert Israel. Now retired from UBC, Professor Adams is currently engaged in preparing the seventh editions of his textbooks and pursuing his interest in the Linux operating system. Dr. Christopher Essex. is Director, Program in Theoretical Physics, and Professor of Applied Mathematics, Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Western Ontario.
