You putting up #45, #40 plus any others that are missing?

Also just wandering why you changed frame widths into the season with your ripping?
Started out at 624 which is standard for tv eps.. but then changed to 640."
,liccleminkey4170,2011-10-01T11:46Z,Thank you my lovely :)
,missimpatient,2011-10-01T18:01Z,"thank you thank you, I am totally addicted to this bloody show. I am also exactly 8 hours behind so when you upload I can watch that night (my night) that days episode. Does that make sense?"

I am not the ripper, they come of a ddl dump.
The source can vary from time to time.

I'm not sure exactly which eps are missing.. It seemed as if some torrents were lost after an upgrade to the system some time ago.  

Below are the links to 40 and 45. If you come across any more missing feel free to post a comment in the most recent upload and I'll re-up.
