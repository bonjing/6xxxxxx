  This series opens a window into the lives of the children, families   
  and staff of Ty Hafan, the only children's hospice in South Wales.    
                                                                        
  In the last programme of the series, we meet families touched by      
  warmth and kindness when dealing with the death of their child.       
  These are stories of humanity shining through in a time of adversity.
