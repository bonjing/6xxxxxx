,wannabemixer,2011-10-04T03:24Z,downloading now it should be real vus its from a VIP
,Chardiieee,2011-10-04T03:29Z,"0 (157) seeds at the moment, and theres another one out there with just no one. 

Can someone actually seed this perhaps and not waste our time with a dead torrent? Terra Nova is actually decent and I would not like to be trolled.."

Thats not always the case. This is why they have trusted tags. Trusted tags are ones you can trust, VIP doesnt really mean much :|"

,PandaPear,2011-10-05T01:17Z,Great quality! So glad to see this episode online. Stupid Fox is limiting it to Dish Network customers. Will be following for future episodes. +1!
