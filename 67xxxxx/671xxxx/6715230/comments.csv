Zombiepirate101,

There is a function in your torrent downloader that lets you PREVIEW what you are downloading for FREE.

Coke and Coffee are clearly NOT for you.

Stop shrieking like an old lady in the mall harassing security guards and clerks like ""what is your ID number?""  ""your address please?""

What's wrong with you? This isn't the mall... I oughta rip through your proxies and videocap you jacking off to asian porn and spread it on facebook ya fucking ingrate. But I have self control. Download a pdf of THAT instead, something educational.

And by the way, extremezone rules but while previewing the download I thought the movie does kinda suck. Not the RIP, the movie. To each his own I suppose. It's Samuel J so I had to at least give it a shot.

Peace out and don't be righteous to one another, just be RIGHT with one another. 

Good night to all, and happy downloading

(applause) (cue music and credits)
