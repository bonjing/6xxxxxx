At about the 30 minute mark, there is a watermark in the lower right hand corner. I will not place the watermark within this comment but it appears to be a website url. This lasts for about three minutes. I did not continue to watch the movie to confirm if this appears anywhere else in the movie.

This ruins the movie and the file for me. I will be looking for another version."
