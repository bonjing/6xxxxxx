All the files can be found on bittorrent sites. 

All have been re-encoded and cleaned up.

To everyone who don't hit and run but keep on seeding - THANKS.

This is the complete 163 theatrical shorts (some censored), that were produced and released between 1940 and 1967,and which make up "The Complete Tom and Jerry Classic Collection".

This is the only version to have all 163 theatrical episodes, other versions always had episodes missing,even Disney don't have this. 

This is a 6 x dvd9 set
 

Enjoy
