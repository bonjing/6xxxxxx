A lot happens at once to Sammy, a single mom living in the Catskill town of her birth, where her parents died in a car 
crash when she was small. Her son Rudy, who's 8, begins imagining his unseen father as a hero; she picks up, sort of, 
with last year's boyfriend; she gets a new boss who imposes foolish rules; and, her wayward brother Terry arrives for a 
visit after months of no communication. The boyfriend proposes, the relationship with her boss takes an unexpected turn, 
and her brother and son bond, not always with positive consequences. When Terry asks young Rudy if he wants to meet his 
father, a crisis of sorts ensues, and brother and sister must re-frame their relationship.

*I don't take requests because I don't have time and everyone will fill the comment section with them instead of commenting about quality and other tehnical specs of the movies or say thanks.Thank you for understanding!
*For best performance I suggest you use KMPlayer(find it with google) for playback
*These movies were made especially for PC and they don't play on a PS3.If you want to re-encode for PS3 or test for other devices be my guests.
*I'll ask everybody to stop with the "it doesn't work","it's out of sync" comments because I tested the movies before I uploaded them and they work fine.
