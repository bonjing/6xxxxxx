,SignificantOther,2011-10-07T02:51Z,"audio sync is all over the place. VideoLAN can't even deal with it towards the middle and end, so I'd recommend finding another. Just my experience, and I've never had a movie that had variable sync issue, so I'm guessing it's a problem at the uploader's end, not mine."
