Treat me right
You better run
I need a lover
Precious time
Anxiety
Heat of the night
A little to late
Fire and ice
Promises in the dark
Hit me with your best shot
Heartbreaker
Hell is for children
No you don't
Just like me

Detroit rock city
Take me
Let me go rock and roll
Ladies room
Firehouse
Makin' love
I want you
Cold gin
Do you love me
Nothin to lose
God of thunder
Rock 'n' roll allnite

And the cradle will rock
You really got me
Hear about later
So this is love
Unchained

Led Zeppelin-Mothership

We're gonna groove
I can't quit you babe
Dazed and confused
White summer
This is and what should never be

Whole lotta love
Communcation breakdown
Bring it on home
Immigrant song
Black dog
Misty mountain pop
The Ocean
Going to california
In my time of dying
Stairway to heaven
Rock and roll
Nobodys fault but mine
