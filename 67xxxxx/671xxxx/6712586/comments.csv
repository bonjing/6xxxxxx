,nogard1070,2011-09-30T20:56Z,Glad to see you back. Hope all is well now. I was getting nervous that I would not be able to watch many Steelers' games this year. Thanks for keeping up the hard work.
,nogard1070,2011-09-30T20:59Z,Sorry I did not read your comment. I think 2 gigs is a good size if the quality is better. And of course my request as always is the Steelers. Thanks.
