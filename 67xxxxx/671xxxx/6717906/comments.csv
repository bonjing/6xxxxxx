,desi_superhero,2011-11-18T00:45Z,"Really disappointing quality. I used to be impressed with FASM releases. But, I've started noticing something very imp that I used to ignore. The darker scenes are too dark and heavily pixellated. There is too much use of Noise Reduction and Dynamic Contrast throughout the videos. These types of encodes beat the purpose of Blu-Ray video quality. Watching on a big screen HDTV - 42"" atleast makes a huge difference. But, if size is the only concern for you, then these are the best quality torrents available. Thanks for the entire effort. Thank you encoders and uploaders."
