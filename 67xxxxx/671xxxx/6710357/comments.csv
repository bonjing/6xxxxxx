Such dedication to create a full and efficient download deserves a heap of thanks, so thanks on behalf of all of us here, who have benefited from this upload!"

A huge thank you for this.

@renison7 -- abridged wouldn't do Twain justice."
,relevant-stuff,2012-01-09T03:31Z,Thank you!  I'm happy to leave this one seeding.
