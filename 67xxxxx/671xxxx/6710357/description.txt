-------------Massively Exhaustive Mark Twain Collection-------------
Thus far I've released many torrent collections that are, to various degrees, complete. However, as I started to work on older authors I found that the real diversity is in all the different versions that exist. Therefore, this is my fourth try at an EXHAUSTIVE collection, as opposed to a complete one.

1. Ripped and checked for completeness. All 40+ books and short stories were ripped by me from CDs over many months.

2. FULLY CHAPTERIZED. This also took months. Each audio book was compiled into a single file (deleting bits like "this concludes disc 2, please insert disc 3") and then separated into Parts and Chapters as defined by the original books. I find this to be the best way to enjoy audiobooks and it is perfect for iPods.

3. Dehissed and noise-cleaned. When needed, I performed low pass filters and deleted pops in the audio.

4. Encoded all books to a uniform MP3 96kbps 44.1kHz.

5. ID3 Tagged. All audio book files have been fully ID3 tagged including full COVER ART.

And so I present this 9gb+ torrent of Twain goodness. I have included every single version of every single Mark Twain unabridged audiobook I could find in high quality spanning over 80 libraries. This torrent was a labor of love and took many weeks of preparation so I hope people will be excited to hear these classics read by such excellent and diverse readers. This is the fourth of several massively exhaustive torrents that I intend to upload.

I consider this torrent to be celebration not only of the Mark Twain, but of many of the best audiobook narrators in the world.

Please leave any comments, questions, or suggestions you might have as they are HIGHLY APPRECIATED! :)

Enjoy!
