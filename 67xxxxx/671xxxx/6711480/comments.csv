,redback38,2011-10-01T03:22Z,"Yes its an age old problem!.....i love to share my work,very few ppl can build these things sucessfully........PLEASE SEED PPL!!!! at least to a one ratio:-)"
,foifurc,2011-10-10T13:36Z,"Thank you so much for putting these things out here. I just hope I will actually get the entire thing. Like you said, not many seeders. So sad that is.
"
,redback38,2011-10-12T16:28Z,"i seed all my torrents almost alll the time from version 3 onwards.hang in there,youll certainly get it:-)"
,irikimoss,2012-01-18T23:39Z,"hello,
sorry for the noobish question (YES IM N00BZ0R!) but is it possible to use this on a usb drive? like a persistent windows 7 on a thumbdrive?

thanks in advance"
,enterprise_f,2012-05-06T00:05Z,"It'd be nice if I could finish the last 5% of the download. I've uploaded 40% of the files, 30% of which has happened since I last downloaded anything for myself! Are ther any seeders out there?"
,enterprise_f,2012-05-06T15:35Z,"Got it, thanks. But I can't get it to boot into Win7PE on my work notebook, an Acer TravelMate 6595 with 2GB DDR3 RAM. I get Windows Boot Manager error message (Status: 0xc0000017 Info: Ramdisk device creation failed due to insufficient memory). I have tried from USB stick as well with read/write access (used Novicorp_WinToFlash_0.7.0048_beta to get it there - has worked well for everything else) Will try on another PC that is actually dead so I don't kill my work machine. Has anyone else found this issue yet? Or am I just missing something?"
,electr1cian77,2012-05-12T22:18Z,enterprise you need to head over to reboot.pro or pendrivelinux.com and check out the various bootable USB creator apps that can take the .ISO redback has provided and correctly write in such a way that your USB drive is then bootable. Taking all files from a bootableCD/DVD/floppy and copying them over to a usb drive will not make that USB bootable. 
,enterprise_f,2012-06-02T08:14Z,"Thanks for the advice electr1cian77. I got it working on a new AMD system so there is nothing wrong with the software or booting it from my USB drive. It's a brilliant collection of software and I've found it very usefull, it just didn't like my Core i5 or some older Dual Core Pentiums I've tried it on! I will persist and try it on more PC's because it's the best software package I've found.."
