Joe Louis Walker The Gift
Label: Hightone
Released:1988
Format:Flac[

Although it didn't enjoy the major label hype that his current output does, Walker's HighTone encore just may be his finest album of all, filled with soulful vocal performances, bone-cutting guitar work, and tight backing from the Boss Talkers and the Memphis Horns. Honestly, you can't go wrong with any of Walker's remarkably consistent HighTone discs -- but give this one the slightest of edges over the rest. ~ Bill Dahl
