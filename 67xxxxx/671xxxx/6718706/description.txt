The original documentary that inspired the series.
 
The crew are depicted on a three-week ghost-hunting expedition to historic mining towns of Nevada, including Virginia City and nearby Gold Hill, where they investigate the Silver Queen Hotel, the Old Washoe Club, the Virginia City Cemetery, and a cabin near the Yellow Jacket Mine. They return to Las Vegas and provide footage of their investigations to local news stations. Zak and Nick travel to Goldfield without Aaron to investigate the Goldfield Hotel, where they claim a brick was thrown by a poltergeist.
