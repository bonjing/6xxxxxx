"Working Late and Working It"

Chris (Will Arnett) tries to get Reagan 
(Christina Applegate) to bring the sexy back into 
their relationship with some advice from his new 
friend Reed (guest star Will Forte, "Saturday 
Night Live"). Meanwhile, when Ava (Maya Rudolph) 
finds out her ex-boyfriend, B-Ro (guest star 
Jorma Taccone, "Saturday Night Live," The Lonely 
Island), is getting married, she blames Reagan 
for the advice she gave her that caused them to 
break up.
