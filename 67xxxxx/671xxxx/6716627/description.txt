Henry Cole continues his quest to discover the greatest motorcycle rides in America.


1)  Americas Best Kept Secret 
If there is one route that can truly be described as one of America's last wildernesses it has to be The Deep South, a vast terrain where humans rub shoulders with over a million alligators and the stifling heat, swamps, unpredictable tropical weather and sparsely populated terrain evokes a real sense of discovery and adventure. Henry clambers aboard one of the most radical American semi custom choppers available off the shelf, a Saxon Crown to be his companion on this epic journey.
