Guess I'll try a third lot :-\

Just asking but are you checking this before uploading them?!?"
,sam_code4u,2011-10-01T21:10Z,"i cannot check every version before uploading to the site. however i do use KIS 2012 and it is what checked before uploading. other are just uploaded because they were reported working at the time they were uploaded. 

i take no responsibility of anything or any harm"
