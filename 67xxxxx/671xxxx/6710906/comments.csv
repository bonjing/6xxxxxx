Mike Savage's Positive Endorsement of Herman Cain
----------------------------

Yea, the guy is the only republican with true previous business experience but its something about millionaire Ceo's and former ceo's that want more power and run for president. Really, think about it my friend

Michael's call screener

Come on now, every call selected to be on the show is praising his book. Are they're no negative reviews on his book? Is Michael's call screener not letting you express your opinion about the book if its negative on air. The caller who called in about his union boss ripping up his ""abuse of power"" book because he brought it to work? Are you serious? Please tell me my friend, you didn't believe that story.

Agree with Michael 100%. You would think the government would slow down the loan guarantee's after solyndra. But they ramp it up.

Shout out to Papaoso42...keep up the hard work. We all appreciate it.

I have yet to read the book but I also think that not everyone can like his book. I will have to voice an opinion as soon as I get a chance to read it. Right now the wife and I are too busy just trying to keep the bills paid!"
