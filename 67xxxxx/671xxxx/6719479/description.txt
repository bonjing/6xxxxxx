This is a recording debut of a nineteen year old who started his career as a singer two years ago. Born in the very centre of Sweden, he began writing music and lyrics when he was twelve. Went to USA to study art and music. Hitch-hiked, wrote songs, appeared on two TV shows, made some test recordings without any result.
Back in Sweden he won a ticket to USA in a music competition. Played the guitar and sang at the Troubadour, Hollywood, Calif. Later he met Lars Samuelson - producer, trumpeter, arranger, conductor, music publisher - who decided Tomas Ledin was mature enough for a recording date. Through some radio and TV appearances locally was choosen as one of the Swedish participants in the Eurovision Song Festival 1972.
