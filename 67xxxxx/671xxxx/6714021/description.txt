Arohan' focuses on the issue of the Zameendars (property holders who won massive areas of farmlands) taking over the land of the poor farmers while making them work on it likes slaves and in exchange offering them a price next to nothing. Though Zameendary was 'abolished' after India gained independence, it was still heavily illegally practiced in the rural area. Benegal addresses this issue through the story of a young farmer Hari Mondal and his family. Even though Mondal struggles for justice to win back his land, it comes at a high price where his family falls apart.
