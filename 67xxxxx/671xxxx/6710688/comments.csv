Works fine for me, maybe you need to patch your version of new vagas, anyone esle having any problems?"
,Madmax545,2011-10-15T20:57Z,"Doesn't seem to affect my game at all, I placed the files in my Data folder, checked the GunRunners.esm tab in the launcher, launched the game and nothing, no new guns at any of the merchants."
,GhoStPaw,2011-10-19T10:25Z,Agree with madmax I have the same problem.. was only 50 mb thou so i don't really give a fuck if it worked or not
,Gunni420,2012-05-21T03:41Z,This works perfectly with update 7. Unpack and move to FalloutNVData and enable it in the launcher. You should get a little message window when you load up your save just like every other DLC.
