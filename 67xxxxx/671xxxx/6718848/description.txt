  Dead Rising 2 Off The Record [Multi6] [DVD-Retail!]   

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Off the Record revisits the setting of the Dead Rising 2 but instead of brining back Chuck Greeneâ€™s story, Capcom uses the setting as an obviously a contrived twist to bring back photojournalist Frank West but it doesnâ€™t run over the same ground, instead reimagining the Fortune City outbreak through Frankâ€™s eyes.

Thatâ€™s a neat way to justify new enemies, even more insane weapon choice and places to visit, including the sci-fi themed Uranus Zone. There are many zombies in Uranus. The old ones are the bestâ€¦

The team has the comedy horror balance in favour of playing it for laughs but prat-falling zombies are complemented by a nice wit- essayed through Frank and the great single player narrative.

Dead Rising 2 off the Record: Sandbox

As well as co op online and a continued narrative in single player mode, it was the new Sandbox that we enjoyed. Taking us off rails, we were allowed to run around Fortune City without time constraints and just follow challenges that can be picked up as you go.

Dead Rising 2 off the Record: Features

We were taking in to new safe spots where Frank can combo weapons as you would in any RPG. But the incessantly innovative fun keeps the gameplay fresh because there are so many ways to dole out zombie take-downs it just doesnâ€™t get boring. As well as weapons update, psychos are back and there are new vehicles and items to pick up.
