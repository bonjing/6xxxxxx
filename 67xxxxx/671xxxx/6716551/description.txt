This is my Halloween Party Mix updated for 2011. Great for atmosphere during Trick or Treating or spooking up your Halloween Party! This is one mix split into 13 separate tracks. Each track is approx 15-20 mins long and works great in a playlist "shuffle." I upload a version of this mix every year but I've added some great new songs and revamped the tracks since most people don't use CD's to play on anymore. Enjoy, seed, and let me know what you think!
