1. Mount or burn image
2. Install
3. Run the update from the UPDATE folder on the DVD
4. Copy every file from the SKIDROW folder to the game installation (not the folder, just the files!)
5. In C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\LocalUbisoft\Game Launcher delete
settings.yml before u start the game for the first time
6. Play the game
7. Support the companies, which software you actually enjoy

Thx for a great game!"
