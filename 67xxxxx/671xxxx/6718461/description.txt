Description
Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli grew up in Lajatico, a rural village in Tuscany, where his family still farms nearby.
On the slopes of his ancient hill town, a special theater was constructed for a one-night-only concert of his greatest popular 
hits along with new songs performed to honor the occasion. Some famous musical friends dropped by and the magical result is 
Andrea Bocelli - Vivere - Live in Tuscany

Joining Andrea for the new songs are "grandissimo sassofonista" Kenny G, trumpeter Chris Botti, piano virtuoso Lang Lang, Italian 
pop star Eliza, and legendary musician, songwriter and producer David Foster. Helping with the hits: favorite divas Sarah Brightman, 
Heather Headley and Laura Pausini.
