,Philonetic,2011-09-30T03:46Z,"If you have a higher end machine and can run the ""Logik's Realism"" texture pack with the water shader without lag, then be on the lookout for GLSL for 1.8.1

video of GLSL in HD with bumpmapping - search this on youtube ""Minecraft 1.5_01: nice graphics with the GLSL bumpmaps/specular mod """

BACK UP YOUR MINECRAFT FOLDER
this is a Cracked version, but it should still work for paid accounts with no problem.  

Open the game with Alt.loader.jar in the .minecraft folder, or a shortcut to Alt.loader.jar

Enjoy"
