One of the versions only has either toomanyitems or zombes installed, the other has both.  Figure out which you're missing if any, find and download from google.



To install, just replace your .minecraft folder with one of the included .minecraft folders.

If you need any other help, find me on ProtoCraft's ventrillo or in game.
