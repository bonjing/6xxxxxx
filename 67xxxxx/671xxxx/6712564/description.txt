Racing...............Game Type  Disk(s)..................1 DVD

RELEASE NOTES

Off-Road Drive, the off-road racing simulation for PC, is the first
game ever to deliver a true-to-life, off-road, extreme racing
experience. Players will take part in The Russian trophy, Off-Road
Trial, Thai Trophy and many other events through the worst driving
conditions with a variety of natural obstacles like swamps, rocks
snow and sand. No other game features this variety of off-road sport
vehicles including tuned stock SUVs and trucks, as well as several
classes of prototypes specifically built for off-road driving. The
vehicles can be equipped with an assortment of special cross-country
equipment and accessories including winches, low gear, differential
gear locking, clinometer, altimeter, tire air pressure control, sand
tracks, etc

There has never been such an innovative simulation of interactive
terrain response as well. Terrain under the vehicle will act just like
it does in real life, the car will sink in dirt, the dirt will create a
rut and will stick to the car and tires affecting its handling. Stones
will fly from underneath the wheels and damage other trucks. The game
will feature various surfaces that will not only affect tire friction
but have complex reactions based on car weight, speed, wheel torque
tire condition, time on this surface, depth of car immersion into the
surface and much more

Features:

Leading international off-road championships

Special off-road equipment and accessories (Lowered gearing, front/rear
