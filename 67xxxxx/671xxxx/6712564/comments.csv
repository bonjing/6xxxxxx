,71460,2011-10-01T04:26Z,"Well.. I had a problem with the game freezing after the intro. So I changed compatibility to windows 7, works with vista too."
[T],PirateBoy,2011-10-01T04:54Z,"@ tefobraveheart

Try changing the compatibility to XP Sp3 or something...it should work out i think...good luck... :)"
,xiIix,2011-10-01T05:10Z,"Ugh THANK YOU!! I couldn't find this ANYWHERE! Not to download, not to purchase, I literally couldn't find a single solitary online store that carried this title, not even the 1C site itself! I'm telling you, 1C did a horrible job exposing this game to Americans.

Thank you so much for finally getting to this release. I have every iteration of off road drive (""full drive"") and have enjoyed it, and finally I can try out this new one on the new engine. Fantastic."
,klord2010,2011-10-01T08:31Z,wow. uninstall.
,MichaelKnight_83,2011-10-01T08:49Z,Thanks!
,sputnikwood,2011-10-01T11:52Z,"Guys, there is no need to use the exe inside the skidrow folder. The game doesnt load at all after the intro movie.

The original exe actually works for the game. Loads and playable."
,DaztheJazz,2011-10-01T12:01Z,"Any body know how to change the input settings. I can only get k/b and mouse, even after I change input. Once I change it nothing works. Have to ctrl-alt-del  to get out of game."
,Stormfront73,2011-10-01T14:12Z,Yep. Ive got the same prob as DaztheJazz me 360 controller does nothing have to ctrl-alt-del to get out of game also...
,rolosdad,2011-10-01T15:19Z,My 360 pad works fine??? changed it in settings no problems..
,furnaps,2011-10-01T15:57Z,Please Seed! My Upload is going faster then my download lol.. This is the kind of game I have been waiting for a company to finally make. Please seed So I can try it out and hopefully like it enough to buy it. Thanks
,unbornpro,2011-10-01T17:01Z,seed
[V],.Dude.,2011-10-01T18:45Z," thanks EZ for the up. :)
n sry guyz,no Black Box up for dis from my side :("
,evoy2k,2011-10-01T20:47Z,"Did not work for me on windows 7, tried canging compatibility and not using the crack to no avail. I just get black screen and then it closes.

Anybody managed to get it working on windows 7 32bit?"
,redrumpanda,2011-10-01T23:44Z,"Is this in English? All the vids or anything I've seen of this have been in other languages, and sadly I can only speak English."
,Skidpalace,2011-10-02T00:25Z,"Works great on Win7 x64.  
I might have to buy this one."
,oobaka,2011-10-02T02:08Z,"What a POS game.
3.11 gigs of bandwidth wasted"
,NadeejaM,2011-10-02T05:34Z,"What's this? no customization, no free driving, just select a car & drive. I think 4x4 Hummer's much more better than this."
,xiIix,2011-10-02T07:50Z,"What a bummer. I was waiting for this game to finally hit the scene, and hoping it would be just as good if not better than the older versions, and it's a total disappointment. The career is on RAILS, and there is no free roam option at all. Whatever. I guess I'm done with this one. The death of another off road series that had promise."
,furnaps,2011-10-02T11:22Z,any idea why It wont let me progress past the training course? It is not saving my progress when I beat the training course so the game thinks I never beat the training course
,Arlind1998,2011-10-02T11:47Z,this doesn't work. it always asks for .dll
,tefobraveheart,2011-10-02T13:37Z,"evoy2k

,evoy2k,2011-10-02T19:13Z,"@tefobraveheart

,FieroGT,2011-10-04T05:07Z,"hmm, not working right with my xbox cntlr. mnaged to get stearing working but it wont detect the triggers right for throttle/brake. any ideas?sux with kb."

,Ghosterin,2011-10-09T15:46Z,"LOts od Dll""s are missing"

,FieroGT,2011-10-11T04:30Z,"-ThECrEeEeMaN

thanks man, will give it a sh0t!"
,WotWorx,2011-10-11T08:19Z,"Great Game and works fine. Do install all the options when the main game install completes. I would love a keygen for this, so we can LAN the game. Runs on my Win 7 64 bit laptop 100%."
,asdasdqweasd,2011-10-13T20:23Z,"Please use imgur.com for screens, it's most reliable with automatic mirror (filmot.com)"
,rahulroy9202,2011-10-15T19:34Z,"MotorM4X is a much better game...

without free-Roam, a off-Road game is simply not fun...
Water movement tries to be realistic but fails miserably..

just my view...(i am a fan of OffRoad games).."
,DontPissMeOff,2011-10-15T20:42Z,I have really crappy fps using GeForce GTX 560 - lowering settings doesn't help and other games run fine - any suggestions?
