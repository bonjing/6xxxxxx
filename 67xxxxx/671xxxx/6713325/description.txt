Zak, Nick and Aaron travel to Nevada to return to and examine the morose Mizpah Hotel, next to the location of one of their first lockdowns together.  There's a bit of tongue in cheek humor, some clips that aren't at all impressive, and then some, "Holy jeebus, what the hell would cause that?!" bits.
