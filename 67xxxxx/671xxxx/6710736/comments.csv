After she died when a bulldozer came over a pile of dirt she was behind, (out of view of the operator) her scumbag friends faked photos as if she was standing in front of someone's house, she was not. She should not have been there. She was definitely NOT a friend of everyone, and she definitely did NOT consider everyone her family. She promoted and espoused violence. This whole thing is spin, propaganda and lies. Rachel Corrie was an idiot and misguided at best, at the worst she was a friend of terrorists and a cunning subversive saboteur. Wake up."
