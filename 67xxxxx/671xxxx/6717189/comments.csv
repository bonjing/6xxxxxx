,someone13,2011-10-07T17:56Z,"HD will mean its mp4, usually when you watch a trailer there will be different qualities if you select HD the file will be mp4. I basically use IDM (Internet download manager), so when you watch a trailer it automatically picks up the file and gives you an option to download instead of watching it via streaming. If you select any other quality the file downloaded will be flv (use flv player to watch it) if you select HD then it will say that there are 2 options/file and you can save the mp4 option. I hope it helps. ciao ..."
