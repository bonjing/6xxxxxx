There is a lot of money in the international tourism industry which has annual profits in excess of $8 trillion. Until recently, most of these profits were only available to big tourism corporations. However, the internet and social networking tools have opened the doors for average individuals to share enormously from this huge tourism money.

The best option for any individual to join in the fun and begin earning money from the international tourism industry is to affiliate himself with an already existing corporate tourism brand. It is cheaper, easier and less time consuming than trying to create a new brand alone.
The best corporate tourism brand existing today is BONVOYAGE1000, an American-based Travel and Tourism Company with membership opened to individuals from all over the world. Membership fee is $350 for a lifetime membership. There are no annual renewal fees of any sort.

Your success in earning commissions from Bonvoyage1000 will depend on the level of commitment you have, how knowledgeable you are about the BV1000 packages and members compensation plan as well as the amount of team support you can get.
