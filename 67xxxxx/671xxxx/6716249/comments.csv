,ElitePandaNinja,2011-10-07T08:07Z,"I simply cannot thank you enough for this torrent. I hope the quality is worth the slow download. It's about time I got my paws on the English dubbed episodes 40 - 64! Thank you, kind sir or madame."
,Brushstroke12,2011-10-18T21:33Z,Someone PLEASE seed this. I'm getting really slow speed. I'll seed if you do! :|
,five_star_general666,2011-11-30T16:47Z,looks great...looking forward to seeing it...will say later if it's as good as it looks....
,skullriot,2011-12-03T08:41Z,"Ouch, these episodes vary in volume from episode to episode, and at least one, #53, has major clipping issues. It sounds like it was run through an amplification program to beef up the audio, but instead ""recorded"" a bunch of distorted clipping audio."
,Umair166,2011-12-15T03:03Z,"This isn't 720p though, is it?

Check out the 720p version here:

Have you ever considered that maybe you just have a crappy player and your codecs suck? 53 sounds just like the rest when I watch it. So maybe rather than instantly saying it's the file, try updating whatever crap you're using and listen again.

To recap, pay no mind to the comment about the audio being off. Get all the most recent codecs, and update your players, then try to play it and it should work fine. I run this in Media Player Classic HC and it works exactly how it should."

or it could be you're running too many cpu-intensive apps at the same time. i've experienced many a skipped frame / distorted audio just simply because i was unzipping a 4GB file (algorithm + disk access = CPU INTENSE).

if changing codecs doesn't help, try making sure your com isn't overburdened."
,-kronix,2012-01-31T04:04Z,"Ok the video sounds great and looks great but...
Its only perfect if the screen is very tiny, if I want to watch it full screen the quality goes down...so much.
I've got all the recent codec packs and am running it on MPC.  I have no cpu intensive programs running.
I don't know how to fix it please help I want to watch this in the quality it was made for!"
