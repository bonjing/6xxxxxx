Gary Lineker introduces highlights from the day's six Premier League fixtures. 
The 185th Merseyside derby between Liverpool and Everton took place at Anfield, 
with the visitors looking for their first win at the home of their old adversaries since 
September 1999. The Toffees' last success at Anfield was a 1-0 win, as Kevin Campbell 
slotted the winner in a feisty affair that saw three men red carded. Elsewhere, 
Manchester United hosted Norwich City, a side they have only dropped two points 
against from a possible 24 during the Premier League era. West Brom travelled to 
Sunderland looking for a repeat of their 3-2 comeback victory last April, 
and Manchester City visited Ewood Park, a happy hunting ground for them in recent 
seasons with back-to-back wins.
