Maybe you should consider those stats before you make your remarks about Mexicans. They're coming here for the same reason your ancestors came here illegally too."
,Tamarind777,2011-10-04T01:47Z,"I am willing to bet if millions of Europeans investigated their history they'll find that they, too, were anchor babies. Do you know how many Europeans came here illegally during the 19th and the 20th centuries? If you found out that YOUR fore-parents were illegals, would you leave? Think about that! They why do you want Mexicans to if you wouldn't? Hateful hypocrites."
