1st time on CD. Overseen by long-time Neil Young collaborator David Briggs, this Los Angeles quartet's eclectic album came and went in the summer of 1969. Spanning psychedelia, orchestrated ballads, country-rock and more, all wrapped up in a highly imaginative production. It's a lost treasure from the glory days of the US West Coast. 10 tracks
