,MailerDaemon0,2011-10-03T07:53Z,"To all you people asking EZ for help with this or that:

He's never gonna answer you b/c he's too good to. 

EZ doesn't do requests, EZ doesn't help with problems and EZ doesn't think very highly of any of you.

Knowledge is power so depend on this person for assistance, use the tools you have and be self sufficient instead of crying ""BooHoo"" when something isn't working right (or at all).

Great audio and video, but the movie kinda sucks.  special effects (costumes) are gash!  worse than Dog Soldiers film, not really good acting and unknown actors....  

Download if you wish, but i watched it and deleted after watching (and i like my movies)

Thanks to extremezone for the upload, not his fault the film sucks!

I want to upload but get the create torrent part but can't upload to piratebay....any help, guides??

Why doesn't Korea make a world encompassing computer network. OH yeah, your a bunch peasants living in mud patties and sleeping in shit piles with pigs and oxen because your paper houses can't be distinguished from a fucking barn.
