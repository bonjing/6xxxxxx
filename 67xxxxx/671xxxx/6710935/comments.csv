,RomanCl,2011-09-30T08:08Z,"God this show has gotten so horrible. It went from the best show on tv, and making me laugh all the time, to a incredibly shitty show that makes me fall asleep. R.I.P. The Office, You will be missed"

,SammoSammy,2011-09-30T18:39Z,"Another quality single-file release from VTV!

This show still holds up. Anybody who thinks that the writing or the show has gone downhill is wrong, in my opinion. I feel that everything still holds up, and the show retains the charm from previous seasons. 

I find some of the new characters annoying, such as the new CEO (adore the actor, hate the character), and feel the show was much tighter and warmer in seasons 3 and 4 when the newest character was Andy, but that doesn't mean the show has now become bad. 

Of course, everyone is entitled to their opinions. But I have a compulsion to defend things that I see as jizz-worthy. "
,RomanCl,2011-09-30T21:02Z,@SammoSammy You really think it's still good? I just think it has gotten completely boring. I haven't found myself laughing since probably season 5. I never said that the characters sucked now all I'm saying is that it is simply unfunny anymore.
,Noshkanok,2011-09-30T23:24Z,"@RomanCl I am a longtime fan as well, and I agree that the show has certainly weakened recently. This episode had me laughing quite a bit, however. To me, that big empty space left by Michael is impossible to ignore, and I'm struggling to accept Andy as the same basic character. He fits the role, though. And what about Stanley's new ""And shove it up your butt!"" punchline? Jim turning Michael/Andy's bad idea into a good idea in a hilarious fashion? That's still funny to me. I understand why you wouldn't like it anymore though."
,nick4092,2011-10-01T20:49Z,"Dude this still fucking owns, Michael is irreplacable but the others characters are still great. I don't get why people say its got shitty, I still laugh as much now as I did 3 years ago, If you want to watch a show that's turned shitty try new Two and A Half Men."
,Dreadmore,2011-10-03T20:56Z,"I agree with nick4092 the show has declined and I can't believe Steve Carrell is gone but It still makes me laugh, And I've grown attached to just about everyone on the show besides the receptionist is a little annoying :P But really NEW Two and a Half Men sucks? How bout ALL of it lol"
