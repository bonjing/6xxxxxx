,Dimmis80,2011-10-03T11:45Z,"Hey Veeken.I saw Fridays episode this episode.What do u mean about ""new"" Days..?Did u change format.I think is the same MP4.?Or do u mean about the storie about the people like Marlena and John that return and all of the stuff that hapens in Days.??"
,DvdVeeken,2011-10-04T00:54Z,"The latter one :-) 
Apparently since monday they have ''rebooted'' Days to be more like the Days we know and love from years/decades back."
,Dimmis80,2011-10-04T17:09Z,I see what do u mean.And with John and Marlena now its even better..About Mondays episode 3/10 do u think that u will find time to upload it today.??
,DvdVeeken,2011-10-06T22:56Z,"Hi, my friends.

All uploads have to wait a day I'm afraid since I just got home from work and desperately need some sleep... Have to be back at work again in 9 hours... 
I'll let my computer do most of the work during the night, and hopefully I'll be able to post the episodes tomorrow afternoon. 

Busy busy busy.... Sorry. "
