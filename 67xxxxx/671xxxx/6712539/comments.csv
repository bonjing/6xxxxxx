Thanks for your other uploads bigbluesea, educate the world."

Well,if the search function on TPB would work correctly half the time,i would have known this when searching to see if it had been previously uploaded. If it doesn't show up i post it"

[T],dynstab2,2011-12-11T23:54Z,"@CUltra  BBS didn't need his usual bogus excuse for ""duplicating"" this time because the two books are different. That said, it should be noted that BBS' upload (at 235 MB) only covers multivariable, that is 1/3 of the subjet covered by Anonymous' upload at 90 MB for full calculus [= single variable (Calc I & II) + multivariable (Calc III)]. Bloated but not a duplicate."
