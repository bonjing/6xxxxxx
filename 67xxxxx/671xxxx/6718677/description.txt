The gangs want you dead. They donâ€™t know what theyâ€™re in for.

Now you can play 9mm for Android and become John "Loose" Kannon, the leader of a special team of hardened cops that aren't afraid to bend the law to clean up the streets.

But when they kill a local drug lord's brother and steal millions in cash, the theft makes Kannon's whole team the target of every gangster in the city. Now Kannon has only one option: Take down the gang leader that's hunting them, legally or not, before his team gets taken out first.

HIGH CALIBER ACTION
â€¢ Dive headlong into this stylish third-person shooter game where youâ€™ll jump and fire clip after clip from your guns in stunning slow motion stunts to take out rooms full of criminals.
â€¢ The action simulation really comes to life as destructible 3D environments splinter and explode.

ALL IN A DAYâ€™S WORK
â€¢ These gangsters donâ€™t play games, so arm yourself with an arsenal of weapons, including a pistol, shotgun, submachine gun, grenade launcher and more.
â€¢ Set out to fight crime and corruption in varied locations like the Latino Suburbs, Night Club, Police Department, Rich Suburbs, Industrial Area and Mexico.
â€¢ Catch gang leaders and informants alive, chasing them through city streets and taking them aside for a not-so-friendly chat in the interrogation challenge.
