P.S. - better move on from vista ;)"
,Parapon,2011-10-05T06:12Z,"^ Thank you, I'll try that. I know vista sucks...I'm just too lazy to do anything about it, and I'm kind of used to it after a couple years."

,youwannaroll,2011-11-13T08:07Z,"very dodgy ""install"" batch file.. (go read it); renames several dll files to exe's and msi's (windows installer file) and executes them, while hiding these procedures, then deletes all the evidence. and uploaded by ""anonymous""? can't be sure, but probably includes viruses or trojans. "
,soundzof7,2012-01-19T08:38Z,"can anyone help me out? i just downloaded the torrent, ran the setup.bat, but when i click on the bastion application it says that ""bastion has stopped working"" apparently due to some kind of compatibility issue. any fix?"
