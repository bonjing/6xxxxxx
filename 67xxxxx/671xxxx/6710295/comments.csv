,joshingyou123,2011-10-09T22:51Z,ummm shouldn't 101 be out already?  or did 100 end the season and DisneyXD not have the next?  
,parammveer,2011-10-15T15:04Z,"Hey cheater, isn't the 101 episode was suppose to come this week......what's wrong!!!!!!!"
,x1twistedfate1x,2011-10-15T21:36Z,"Hey thanks for the uploads!!! Also, where is episode 101 its been two weeks, from what I know it airs on Disney XD tonight, does that mean we could get the torrent soon?"
,kaiser232,2011-10-16T00:23Z,"Another fan getting worried, can we expect the next episode soon?"
,bldshd,2011-10-16T07:13Z,we love you Cheater!! come back to us!!
,cheater71,2011-10-16T20:03Z,"I'm sorry everyone, i think the episodes releases are being held back by the studio. It might be a little while before we get a new episode.I'll post it as soon as its online. "
,Temporal5,2011-10-17T04:42Z,It's probably something to do with the second movie that's set to be aired on the 25. Just guessing though.
,TorrentMonster,2011-10-17T18:46Z,"damnit not again, why do they stop dubbing naruto a few months before christmas? they did the same thing last year and i needed to wait about 3 months before they started dubbing again, kinda disapointing that they used to release 3-4 episodes each week before, and then they sudenly stoped that and only dubbed 1 episode each week. =("
,ez100,2011-10-17T23:47Z,good work mate keep us updated on wats happening
,Bleachigo,2011-10-18T12:28Z,"That's right. Episode 101 won't be released until the end of October. They are waiting for DisneyXD to catch up + Naruto Shippuden The Movie 2 comes out in Dub. Then they wil continue airing the uncut Dubs on I-Tunes. 
So we have to be patient. "
,XanimeX,2011-10-20T19:33Z,When do the new dubbed episodes come out?
,Bleachigo,2011-10-21T13:49Z,"@ XanimeX

Can u read?"
,Bleachigo,2011-10-25T23:22Z,"Since today, Naruto Shippuden English dub episode 101 untill 112 have been released! 12 episodes at once!"
,luna_elite,2011-10-26T01:31Z,"cheater71, if you upload all those you will officialy be the MAAN... hear me?... ive even told my mum about you. Thanks in advance."
