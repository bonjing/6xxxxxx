--------------------------
  TPB keeps giving me database error (with Opera).  thanks assholes from asian subcontinent.  your continued harassment is SOOO mature--especially from such a mature culture.  And so is your racist non-support for clearly superior (though ""not invented here"") web browser.  Nothing incenses me more than having to switch to IE get a non-complient web page to work (or to post a comment!)  And I don't care if you DO ban me--your lack of support for Opera is so last century."
