"Geography of Global Conflict"

As Chang (Ken Jeong) settles into his new 
job as a campus security officer, Britta 
(Gillian Jacobs) is overwhelmed with 
feelings of civil disobedience when a 
friend is taken hostage in a foreign 
country. Meanwhile, Annie (Alison Brie) 
enlists the study group to help her 
defeat her new "friend" Annie Kim (Irene 
Choi) in a Model United Nations 
competition, while Professor Cligoris 
(Martin Starr, "Party Down") struggles 
to maintain decorum.
