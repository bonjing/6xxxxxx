Many critics consider this suspenseful, character-driven, erotic and cynical examination of a bourgeois marriage gone awry to be one of French filmmaker Claude Chabrol's greatest dramas. Charles is a Versailles insurance salesman who suspects that his lovely wife has been messing around. He hires a private investigator to prove it. When he learns that she has been philandering with a Parisian writer, the enraged husband rushes off for a confrontation that results in murder. He then goes back to his wife, who when she discovers what her husband has done, feels fiery stirrings for him that she thought were long gone. Unfortunately, love is no match for the long-arm of the law.
