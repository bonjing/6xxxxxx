yeah, I'll get right on that
"
,mmd123,2011-10-01T02:05Z,"The reason my uploads are one file is because I. Archive them with 7zip, and as for the previews...I would not know how to make one..."
,RL269,2011-10-01T07:06Z,"What chief is talking about is you should put some of the pictures in a separate folder names 'Samples' before zipping. 

Then put the sample folder & the zip file in another folder, and upload the outer folder with the zip & samples inside.

This way downloaders can select just the sample folder, check out what's there, and then decide if they want the full thing. "
[V],bestec1234,2011-10-01T13:57Z,"Or, better yet, don't zip the file, since there really isn't any reason to."
,mmd123,2011-10-01T14:26Z,Well then...the next time I get access to my computer...ill reupload the torrent un-archived...thanks for the tips...as for the samples folder...I'll have to find out how to do that...what I'll most likely end up doing however is uploading the samples to a private photobucket folder and give out the password for people to view...
,mmd123,2011-10-01T14:32Z,"Also, sorry for the lack of a seed...haven't been able to run my computer much due to work...will try and have it seeding later tonight after 6pm eastern...that's when I get off work at my second job... also, at that point I will try and make the fixed torrent you guys suggested..."
[V],bestec1234,2011-10-01T17:20Z,"If you don't zip the files, there's no need to include a ""samples"" folder in the torrent, since the downloader can pick and choose his or her own sample pictures.  

It's still a good idea to include sample pics outside the torrent. I use image hosting websites like http://www.imagebam.com/  and  http://bayimg.com/  ... and there are many many others.  

If you want to include a sample pic right here on the torrent page, upload a pic to bayimg.com, click on ""Settings"" and use the ""resize to torrent image"" option.  Then copy the portion of the URL after the last slash and paste that to the ""Image tag from bayimg"" box when uploading the torrent.   For the URL http://bayimg.com/AAkMHaAdE , this would be the ""AAkMHaAdE"" part."
[V],bestec1234,2011-10-01T17:22Z,"And... I was wrong, there is one reason to zip a torrent -- if it contains more than 10,000 files, which is TPB's limit.  In that case, you may also consider splitting the torrent into more than one to avoid zipping.

Now that all of that is out of the way, can you give us some idea of what kind of content this torrent contains?"
[V],joshua13,2011-10-02T21:22Z,"googled pawsru 

went to  http://pawsru.org/pawsX/

,mmd123,2011-10-04T19:44Z,"well that explains why it wont let me upload the unarchived torrent...is over 10k files... so, I shall remake the torrent, and upload some sample pictures to the image site you mentioned and then I will have to rearchive the files like I did originally... because personally, I would not like to have to make multiple torrents for this site rip..."
