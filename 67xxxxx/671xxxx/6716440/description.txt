Now available in paperback, The Green House vividly illustrates the emerging collaboration between stylish architecture, interior design, and environmental responsibility. This groundbreaking book features more than thirty-five residences in fifteen countriesâ€”and nearly every conceivable natural environmentâ€”designed by a combination of star architects and lesser-known practitioners, all of whom put "greenness" in the service of quality design, and not the other way around.
