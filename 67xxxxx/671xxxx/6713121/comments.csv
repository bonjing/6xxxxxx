,stratos80,2012-03-20T00:13Z,"The sound is definitely not ok.

Also VirtualDub has something to say (excluding VBR stuff):

[!] AVI: Truncated or invalid MP3 audio format detected (18 bytes, should be 30). Attempting to fix.

[!] AVI: A non-zero wBitsPerSample value was detected in the MP3 audio format structure. This has been corrected in-memory to zero for better  compatibility with commonly installed MP3 audio codecs."
