Dashboard Confessional is an American acoustic/electric indie rockband.
This band started as a side-project of Chris Carrraba(Further Seems Forever).
The name of the band is derived from the song \"The Sharp Hint of New Tears\" from the debut album The Swiss Army Romance.

By 2002, three other musicians had joined the band, including former Further Seems Forever band mate Jerry Castellanos, and started the process of recording the band\'s next album. After the success of his second album, Carrabba was asked to perform on MTV Unplugged, and the subsequent live release marked the first time many of the songs were recorded with a full band.
