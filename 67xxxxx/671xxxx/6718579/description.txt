The sixth instalment in the historic, hysterical and horrific Skulduggery Pleasant series. Think youâ€™ve seen anything yet? You havenâ€™t. Because the Death Bringer is about to riseâ€¦

The Necromancers no longer need Valkyrie to be their Death Bringer, and thatâ€™s a Good Thing. Thereâ€™s just one catch. Thereâ€™s a reason the Necromancers donâ€™t need her any more. And thatâ€™s because theyâ€™ve found their Death Bringer already, the person who will dissolve the doors between life and death. And thatâ€™s a very, very Bad Thingâ€¦


Enjoy
