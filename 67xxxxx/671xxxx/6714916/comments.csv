,ShamboMambo,2011-10-02T01:42Z,"Too much sex, suggestiveness and gayness in Dr. Who at the moment. I thought that it would end when the homo first producer of the series left in 2009. Obviously not. Fucking sick of this bum-gay faggot innuendo! Disgusting pooves have no place in kids/family TV or any sex in general."

,Ravenswing77,2011-10-02T04:00Z,"See, ShamboMambo is jealous ... not a single gay guy will suck him off, and he has to get his jollies wrapping his tiny little fist around the 4"" cocktail frank he calls his penis.  That's why he's spamming all the Dr Who D/Ls."
