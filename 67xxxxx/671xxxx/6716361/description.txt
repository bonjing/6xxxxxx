In March 1776, the Continental Marines performed America's first amphibious assault, seizing the British island of New Providence in the Bahamas. Since that time, U.S. Marines have stormed Derna, Tripoli; helped quash China's Boxer Rebellion; and, famously, raised the flag on Iwo Jima's Mount Suribachi. These are just a few highlights of more than two-and-a-quarter centuries of outstanding service.

The United States Marine Corps: A Chronology, 1775 to the Present touches upon all aspects of the Continental and U.S. Marine Corps since their inception. All major battles in all major wars are covered, along with innumerable smaller clashes and deployments abroad.
