,SammoSammy,2011-10-03T15:17Z,"I always come to you first, VTV. When's Episode 2 coming?"
,apenek,2011-10-03T17:24Z,seed!
,BoonesFerry,2011-10-03T17:28Z,"
The repack is much better but still a little off...a little out of sync and maybe some dropped frames.  My fingers are crossed for a proper.

,Strikefear13,2011-10-03T19:35Z,"I'd wager episode 2 is coming approximately a week after episode one, Sammo."
,humdidum,2011-10-03T20:04Z,"Strikefear: Not necessarily since this one is a pre-release.
It hasn't aired yet as far as i can understand."
,krapnek,2011-10-03T20:17Z,Where in the release name does it say PREAIR? Nowhere! 6x02 will be out in a week.
,5iTH,2011-10-03T21:58Z,Cheers!

,buddahsu,2011-10-05T09:36Z,"This is a pre-released leak, episode 2 will be out in a couple weeks"
,Nirvelli2,2011-10-05T10:45Z,Episode 2 will air October 9: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter_%28season_6%29#Episodes
,Ubler,2011-10-05T12:05Z,Yeah good quality but slightly out of sync which is annoying.
,rocco_sifredi,2011-10-05T15:41Z,thx a lot
,StanlyManly,2011-10-06T12:00Z,"Worked fine on a PS3, and I didn't notice much out-of-sync parts.  There was only one small part of the show that sort of skipped, but that was it.  Thank you so much for the upload.

,Saint923,2011-10-07T08:36Z,"Great quality, fast download."
,SammoSammy,2011-10-22T03:00Z,"Sorry Guys, I was confused. There was a fake torrent saying it was Episode 2 of Season 6 so I thought it was already out (I live in Australia and don't really follow release dates that much). I was simply wondering when VTV would release his version of Episode 2. "
,tommarvoloriddle2010,2011-11-09T12:33Z,thnx vtv..  4 agr8 upload!!
,Online.Pirate,2011-11-22T05:25Z,Downloading now... hope the sync issue isn't tooo bad.. seems like nobody has a good copy of this ep.
,Online.Pirate,2011-11-22T08:28Z,"Just got done watching, Sync issue was very minimal, barely noticeable and was only in very small parts of the ep.

Usually sync issues keep me from watching movies/tv but this ep was fine"
