i end up forgetting to delete the .rar's after im done seeding."
,Setrah,2011-09-30T08:13Z,"Thanks for the no-rar torrent. I end up deleting rars immediately after I've downloaded them and therefore not seeding much. Well, sceneline brought that upon themselves."

,maggot_corpse,2011-09-30T13:50Z,"guys, what's the point of .rar archives? i can't figure this out"
,Lainehart,2011-10-01T01:10Z,"@maggot_corpse: the multiple .rar archives are usually so if your download corrupts, it's only a small file that needs re-downloading, rather than the whole thing"
,indiyet,2011-10-01T17:01Z,gracias man!!! ;)
