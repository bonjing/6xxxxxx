TV : Reality : TV quality : English
Didn't see any scene groups put this out, so here it is, replete with US commercials, fuzz and mpeg.

note- to the slithery cretin (you know who you are) who will invariably DL the show then re-up it without giving credit to my work, FOAD. [b]Everyone else, please enjoy!


Description: The crews of Paul Junior Designs and Orange County Choppers recount some of the most frenzied fights between Paul Senior, Paul Junior, Mikey and other cast members that would normally start out about business but quickly turn personal. Original air date: 03 OCT 2011. This is SE02E14, I think - depends on how you count the series.

About the video: THE QUALITY IS CRAPPY AND ALSO HAS COMMERCIALS; IT SAYS SO IN THE DEscriptION. IF YOUR DELICATE EYES CAN ONLY WATCH HD AND YOUR DELICATE MUSCLES CAN'T FF PAST COMMERCIALS, THEN DO NOT DL AND SUBSEQUENTLY COMPLAIN ABOUT IT. IOW, WHINERS, MOANERS AND INGRATES KINDLY GO FOAD :)

EVERYONE ELSE, ENJOY!

I will seed this full throttle until it is fully seeded, but my UL speed is lousy (100 kbps), so be patient. It is the best i can do.
