,MsRed,2011-10-09T02:59Z,Everybody seems happy with the video in another Torrent site. I'll trust the usual ViSiON quality and see what happens...

Please provide a sample in the future.

sorry , but thanks for the up."
,MsRed,2011-10-11T02:10Z,There's absolutely nothing wrong with the audio (or anything else for that matter). Since I downloaded it yesterday my daughter has watched it one too many times and everything is A-OK.

Your wife must be probably deaf.
Sound is overexcited in loud sections, also is strangely disguised, plus at least at end is about 200ms out of sync."
