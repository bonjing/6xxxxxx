however tracks order is not the same by playlist and i can explain why
anyway don't worry all tracks are well present.
comes from another torrent but who was encoded on 128 kbps mp3 only.
reconverted to mp3 cbr stereo-256 kbps-44 khz
with very very latest Lame converter edition.
crc error protection and original option enabled.
without error anyway.
result : excellent sound,very pleasant to listening.
