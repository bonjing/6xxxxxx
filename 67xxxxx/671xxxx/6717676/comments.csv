When someone will provide an accusim helicopter, with all the switches working and REAL physics, I will gladly pay $40 or $60 to get it and support the team.
I never purchased any helicopter, fortunatelly, I just test them one hour or two then I loose interest in them. I can fly accusim planes and Katana 4x for hours and hours (I purchased my favorite planes after testing, to support those developpers)"

,CMH747,2011-10-21T02:39Z,"Fellow piraters, I read an article that Nemeth Designs just stopped all production of future projects because their sales have bit hit hard due to torrents like these and they can no longer afford to pay their programmers.  So if you like this helicopter, do the community a favor and buy it so we can continue to see high quality add ons."
,rra137,2011-12-14T12:11Z,"@CMH747
I will purchase any helicopter when they match the standards of accusim.
When I first tried a pirated A2A accusim plane I was so surprised I bought all their birds. I will purchase their P-40 and P-51 as soon as they are released."
