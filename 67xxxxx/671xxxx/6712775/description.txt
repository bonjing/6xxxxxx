Presented by Iain Cuthbertson, this unique DVD tells the story of the tortured genius whose poverty and passion gave birth to some of literature's greatest works.

Featuring the talents of Scottish actor Jock Ferguson as Robert Burns, this programme combines atmospheric reconstructions and delightful all-new footage shot on location in Ayrshire, with superb period imagery to bring vivid new life to the story of the Scottish bard.

It follows the poet and composer through his remarkable life, his loves and disappointments, his struggle to farm his late father's land, and his battle with the bottle.
