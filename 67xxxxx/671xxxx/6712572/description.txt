-------------Complete Thomas Harris Audiobook Collection-------------
Ever since reading the fantastic 'Red Dragon' I have been a fan of Thomas Harris. His Hannibal Lecter series will certainly never be forgotten. I have processed all these unabridged books in the following ways:

1. I ripped all of these. Most are from Library CDs. All are high-quality rips.

2. Equalized volume. Several of these audio books had volume discontinuities. I have equalized volumes so there shouldn't be any sudden jumps.

3. Dehissed and noise-cleaned. When needed, I performed low pass filters and deleted pops in the audio.

4. FULLY CHAPTERIZED. This took a several days. Each audio book was compiled into a single file (deleting bits like "end of disc 5, please insert disc 6") and then separated into Parts and Chapters as defined by the original books. I find this to be the best way to enjoy audiobooks and it is perfect for iPods.

5. Encoded all books to a uniform MP3 96kbps 44.1kHz.

6. ID3 Tagged. All audio book files have been fully ID3 tagged including full COVER ART.

This torrent represents a 100% complete audio bibliography of Thomas Harris fiction. The novel Black Sunday is the only one not in the Hannibal Lecter series, but is still quite good.

Please leave any comments, questions, or suggestions you might have as they are HIGHLY APPRECIATED! :)

Enjoy!
