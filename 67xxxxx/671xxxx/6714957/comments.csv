,souljah99,2011-10-03T12:13Z,Think people are confused with '2008' i guess when the show first began. Is a lil confusing
,souljah99,2011-10-03T12:14Z,'2008' is confusing though

,chrismyarse,2011-10-09T14:47Z,"there a few different merlins hence the merlin 2008, tv.com/rage/myepisodes etc all use this aswell"
,useitright,2011-10-10T20:34Z,so is this not the same merlin that just started with the episode the darkest hour or what
,useitright,2011-10-10T22:08Z,I cross checked the dates and the first part of the episode the darkest hour and first episode of season 4 of merlin premiered October 1st and since this was released on the 2nd I have gathered this is the episode I am looking for.  I hope that others with the same question see this comment.
,shiz55,2011-10-23T19:32Z,u should drop the 2008 for any future episodes.
