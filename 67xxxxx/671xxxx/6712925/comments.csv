,KPZ22,2011-10-01T01:29Z,anyone know the best solution for playing mkv files on xbox 360?
,staticx106,2011-10-01T03:06Z,"@KPZ22 well you have a few options

1. You could get MKV Demux and demux the movie into video and audio files then remux them into a .wmv file and burn it to dvd.

2. You can spend about a month setting up a plugin for windows Vista/7 Media Center called Media Browser (be forewarned that this plugin requires some other third party plugins in order to be fully featured and functional and in some cases a pain in the ass to setup properly) Once set up is finished you can stream pretty much any movie to your 360.

In most cases the movie has to be transcoded to play right on 360 & PS3. 360 usually needs to be in .wmv format and PS3 needs to be in .M2TS format."
[V],DownTYU,2011-10-01T03:29Z,Use mkv extract to get .h264+ .dts file and the mux it into a m2ts container with megui. Try using google  for a change.

,FreeLancer1080,2011-10-30T18:36Z,Ok so why when I look for a real 1080P movie torrent all I find are 720 videos labeled as 1080. Even most of he ones posted state in they're notes that the movie is 1920x800 (or some close proximally) which is not a 1080p video. So does any know why that is?
,LukeIsNotMySon,2011-11-15T13:38Z,"@FreeLancer1080

you know how most movies have black bars above & below the video

most smart encoders do not encode those bars because it is a waste of bandwidth and space on your harddrive since the dvd player or a media player ends up recreating those bars automatically anyway

so when you see 1280 x 528/544 etc

or 1920 x 800 etc. 

those are actual true 720p or 1080p just encoded to save time & space not to shortchange anyone

hope it makes sense 


oh btw perfect 10/10 for this rip"
