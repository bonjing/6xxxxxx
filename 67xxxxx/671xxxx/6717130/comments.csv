It is possible if you guys can throw this catshit1 out of piratebay?

and ask for in a permanent ban.

We here in the FSX community don't have to tolerate this shit!

We are talking about serious sick person here!"
,aarque,2011-10-04T04:09Z,"Jim already got him banned, that is why the screen name has the numeral, as if anybody cares that it is the same troll, as opposed to any troll.
Anyway, lorum, just keep asking Jim nicely and the troll will have to learn what number comes after one before he can troll bait us again.

And thanks for the up BTW, micky, just seems odd that you shared something so..dated. All good though. "
,aarque,2011-10-04T14:07Z,"Trolltip: I ignore trolls, don't check histories, etc. If a troll wanted to address me, they would likely have to upload something - that is the basic requirement for any measure of respect at TPB (which is an international site, not American, hosted in Belgum like trolls think); barring that, they would have to have something to offer the community. Conversationally, I am content in life, I do not need to incite angst or befriend trolls."
,Jimstalk,2011-10-04T14:46Z,They banned him temporarily not permanently which means that after a certain amount of time he could re-gain access to his account....Unfortunately....The only way to deal with little bastard is just to ignore his comments

Thanks for your post but like Jimstalk say ignore his comments, but i wonder what kind of person this catshit1 is ...for god's sake!

I mean heÂ´s waiting for someone upload a torrent here and when he see that he totally gets mentally sick!

And he hasn't upload anything here!..How more fucked up can this person be!

,aarque,2011-10-05T10:15Z,"Well that is excellent then, Jim. The first ban was clearly a warning, which obviously was carefully heeded in trademark trollish ways. 
With the justification of the initial ban, these most recent comments here should be ample ammunition to get the TPB cops to throw the troll ""back in the drunk tank"" until he ""sobers up."""
