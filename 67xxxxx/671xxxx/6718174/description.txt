With rapid progress in Internet and digital imaging technology, there are more and more ways to easily create, publish, and distribute images. Considered the first book to focus on the relationship between digital imaging and privacy protection, Visual Cryptography and Secret Image Sharing is a complete introduction to novel security methods and sharing-control mechanisms used to protect against unauthorized data access and secure dissemination of sensitive information. 

Image data protection and image-based authentication techniques offer efficient solutions for controlling how private data and images are made available only to select people. Essential to the design of systems used to manage images that contain sensitive dataâ€”such as medical records, financial transactions, and electronic voting systemsâ€”the methods presented in this book are useful to counter traditional encryption techniques, which do not scale well and are less efficient when applied directly to image files.

An exploration of the most prominent topics in digital imaging security, this book discusses:

Potential for sharing multiple secrets

Visual cryptography schemesâ€”based either on the probabilistic reconstruction of the secret image, or on different logical operations for combining shared images

Inclusion of pictures in the distributed shares

Contrast enhancement techniques
