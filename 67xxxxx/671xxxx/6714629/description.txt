Here are endgame books by Yuri Averbakh.


Included here is his Chess Endings: Essential Knowledge. A book of this sort is almost necessary for any lowly class player to evolve to a higher rated organism.


Also included is his five-volumed Comprehensive Chess Chess Endings in... algebraic notation!

Happily, the scans were of republished copies. Although they are of varying quality, this, to me, is better than working with stinkin' descriptive.  


Enjoy and Seed!!
