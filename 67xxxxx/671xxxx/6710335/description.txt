-------------Clive Cussler Complete Audio Collection v2.0-------------
Cussler is so prolific that I need to update this collection every couple of years just to keep up! This version includes 8 new novels and one replacement; it is current up to the summer of 2011. I have processed all these unabridged books in the following ways:

1. I ripped 20 of these. Whenever possible I ripped from CD. A few are ripped from high-quality cassettes. The ones I did not rip are not always of such excellent quality but are all decent and very listenable.

2. Equalized volume. Several of these audio books had volume discontinuities. I have equalized volumes so there shouldn't be any sudden jumps.

3. Dehissed and noise-cleaned. When needed, I performed low pass filters and deleted pops in the audio.

4. FULLY CHAPTERIZED. This took weeks and weeks. Each audio book was compiled into a single file (deleting bits like "end of disc 3, please insert disc 4") and then separated into Parts and Chapters as defined by the original books. I find this to be the best way to enjoy audiobooks and it is perfect for iPods.

5. Encoded all books to a uniform MP3 96kbps 44.1kHz.

6. ID3 Tagged. All audio book files have been fully ID3 tagged including full COVER ART. Thanks to a few excellent websites, I have been able to offer FIRST EDITION covers for all books.

And so here comes to you a 25gb torrent with all 43 Clive Cussler novels; it now represents a complete collection of Clive Cussler's fictional works. Since the original torrent there have been a couple of changes. First, and most obviously, I have added Clive's most recent 8 novels -- all chapterized and tagged like the rest. Also, one of the earlier novels, 1988 - Treasure (Dirk Pitt 9), was incomplete in my original torrent. I am delighted to say I have found a replacement copy and present it here! This collection is now 100% complete.

Please leave any comments, questions, or suggestions you might have as they are HIGHLY APPRECIATED! :)

Enjoy!
