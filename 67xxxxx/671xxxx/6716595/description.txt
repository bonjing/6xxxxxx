One of the top jazz albums of all time arrived with the release in 1963 of the album of bossa nova tunes by Stan Getz and Joao Gilberto, composer Antonio Carlos Jobim and vocalist Astrud Gilberto. Produced by Creed Taylor and engineered by soon-to-be legendary producer Phil Ramone, the album has proven itself a classic.
