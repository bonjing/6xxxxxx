Synopsis: An action packed martial-arts sci-fi feature film produced in the UK. Though produced on a low budget this film is highly ambitious, with everything from CGI aliens, a sexy alien ambassador with hair that can be grown at will, numerous stunts including a car jump, a duo of somersaulting attacking school girls and a racist & alien conspiracy thrown in for good measure.
Aliens appear at the UN and invite Earth to join the Galactic Federation, but there is a catch, Earth has one year to prepare and send a team of its best fighters off-world to the Galactic Combat Games to represent the planet in an unarmed combat tournament, where the fate of the Earth will depend on the tournaments outcome. This film is the first in a planed series of films. In this film we see the UK trials, cumulating in a team being picked to represent the UK in the forthcoming World selection trials.

Target audience: Teen and the young at heart. UK cert rating PG.

Content: Features over thirty, very realistic martial-arts fights, in over a dozen different disciplines. Shot on a low budget in the UK this film was a feature length pilot for a yet to be produced global franchised TV series, where national teams would be decided to then compete against each other in a global competition to find a team to represent Earth in the Galactic Combat games. 

Made as a feature length pilot intended to promote a possible global TV franchise where countries would send their national teams to compete in a global competition where the eventual world team world be decided. Since the pilot wasnâ€™t picked up by a net work this film remained in limbo unreleased till now. Enjoy.
