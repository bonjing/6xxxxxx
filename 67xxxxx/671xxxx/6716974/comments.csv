,illiria,2011-10-02T22:58Z,"Just in case I didn't make it clear enough in my ramblings above, yes, the torrent includes all the DLCs ever released.

Full list:


Pre-Order DLCs:

- CaravanPack
- ClassicPack
- MercenaryPack
- TribalPack

(these are packed in Pre-Order DLC Pack)

Post-Release DLCs:

- Dead Money
- Honest Hearts
- Old World Blues
- Lonesome Road
- Gun Runners' Arsenal

(these are packed in Game Add-On Pack)"
,Iztok1967,2011-10-02T23:38Z,"Thank you and yes please upload Fallout 3 packed same way.

I apologise for my english.

Iztok"
,illiria,2011-10-03T00:15Z,"@ Iztok1967

Okay. One complete Fallout 3, coming up. :)

I'll upload as soon as possible, but I need some time to seed this torrent. If I'll try to seed both at once, the speed may be slow."
,Iztok1967,2011-10-03T08:24Z,"No problem i can wait.
Thank you.

,Insomneac,2011-10-03T09:45Z,"Thanks Illiria.

It would have been easier and better if you left the pre-order DLC in the initial install.

Anyone who didn't want them could either delete them or uncheck them in the launcher.

I really appreciate your work, though, thanks."
,Die51,2011-10-03T11:05Z,Seeding to 2000% as per normal. Enjoy the 10 MB/s! :). 
,Insomneac,2011-10-04T00:32Z,"BTW, does anyone know where there's info or a download for the Unofficial Patch 3.0?

I can't find a thing about it, even on New Vegas Nexus.

Thanks."
,illiria,2011-10-04T00:54Z,"@ Insomneac

Including pre-order DLCs would have been easier, but would not have been proper. These items slightly spoil game balance.

As for ""everyone who doesn't want them could uncheck or delete them"" - if you would bother to read Readme file in pre-order DLC installer, you would know that due to a game bug, unchecking does not always work. And deleting all the files is a bother. So I went with a simpler way: whoever wants them can press ""Install"" button. Not hard. :)

Per ""Unofficial Patch 3.0"" it isn't called that. That's what I called it for convenience - for myself. And I repacked it.
This is the original:
http://www.ravenmodding.terminal47.net/?p=768%3Elang=en
I did not include DLC fixes though, only the fixes for main game. This patch is up-to-date and works with the latest official patch. Unlike the ""bigfix compilation patch"" on Nexus Forums.


P.S. Sorry for the late reply, PirateBay wasn't working for me."
,Insomneac,2011-10-04T01:36Z,"Illiria, thanks for the reply and information.

I appreciate your time, and I love your releases.

I normally do what you do, but I can't do it as well and I don't have the time.

So again, thank you!"
,Insomneac,2011-10-04T01:52Z,"Sorry to be a pain, but I'm confused with the unofficial patch.

What's the difference between the one you've included ""v0.3.2"" and the Community BugFix Compilation  Patch v1.10?

They appear to be made by the same person, and you'd think v1.10 is the latest, and it also has an April release date.

However, v0.3.2 includes fixes for the latest DLC and appears to be a later release, yet it has a February release date and an earlier version number?

I don't get it?"
,AnderEL,2011-10-04T02:02Z,"Thank you so mutch! i have actuely waited for this moment i hope no more dlc will come out after this cos i hate to only be abel to play a few hours of new content i want it all at the same time! ;) 

Btw guys im seading 250kbs but only downloding 12kbs pleas seed  :)"
,illiria,2011-10-04T18:22Z,"@ Insomneac

No problem. I'm here to help. Though in this case, I don't have much information to share with you. I don't know why does the patch I've used have a February release date because yes, it is definitely the latest. I haven't concerned myself with checking who is the author, they may well be made by the same person.
Maybe that person just left Nexus Forums and opened his own site?
I was, in fact, using ""Community Bugfix Compilation Patch"" before, but as it is stated, it is not compatible with the latest official build of Fallout. The patch I used is.
To be short: I haven't gone into much detail about the unofficial patch. I've tried it - works good - I've included it. Sorry I can't be of more help. :/

If I don't reply, means my Internet is down for a while. Happens lately."
,kraz99,2011-10-04T19:28Z,"Installation and DLCs work flawlessly, 5 hours into the game atm. This is of course the latest version 1.4.0.525, in case anyone is wondering.

Great torrent, fully updated, absolutely worth the download, recommend it to anyone who wants the complete game without hassling with updates and DLCs separately. Will seed."
,Insomneac,2011-10-05T00:29Z,"Illiria, thanks for the reply and all your hard work.

I really appreciate everything.

Thanks mate."
,illiria,2011-10-05T00:35Z,Thanks for all the positive feedback people. I appreciate that. It's always nice to see that my stuff is useful to others. :)
,kentcave,2011-10-05T06:53Z,"Dude..mucho gracias!!!

Rest assured that there are always some out there that have the patience (or perhaps not enough time to savour plenty other past goodies) to wait out till patch and DLC are all complete, before jumping into a perfect ""world"". I know I had sometimes waited years for some. lol

For us..you..yes YOU are our Hero/Idol/Messiah!!!

We appreciated the time, effort and love you put into a perfect compilation like this one. Thanks.

Now you can go and tell your parents/grands/children/loved ones/friends/enemies etc that..you have NOT live in vain. You bring ""purpose"" to this existence. 

You are useful, are needed by others, had some skill/dedication..you are alive. Bless ya. Be always creative and enjoy your ""fruits""!"
,kentcave,2011-10-05T06:59Z,"Psst..forgot to mention..still waiting for your F3 perfect edition. Yep..still waiting. lol

Also if there ever got another ""perfect"" edition of DA:O/2 and ME 1/2 or other worthy titles (Sims 1/2/3, MorrowW/ObliV, etc) just throw it up and we will suck up the bile lol"
,Maledepecher,2011-10-05T09:23Z,"Yes Illiria is back, thank you for Fallout New Vegas.
---------------------------
Could you make Two Worlds II with the latest patch and all DLCs???(I can't find a working copy of Two Worlds II on the internet).
Please Illiria, I will be waiting.
And by the way you are the BEST."

,hyut00,2011-10-05T22:55Z,you are the best mate. big thanks for this :)
,illiria,2011-10-07T07:11Z,"@ kentcave

Well, sure, there are complete editions for Dragon Age 1-2. I have just uploaded DLC/Patch repacks though. The rest is just the game, you can as well get a RELOADED release of it.

My DLC repacks for DA:O and DA2 zutomatically patch your game, and install pre-cracked DLCs. I have uploaded them. Is there a need to upoad the entire original game as well?"
,kentcave,2011-10-07T11:33Z,"Nah..no need for the ori..as long as you says its unnecessary (and pointing out the proper reload version already).

Its your expertise and personal experiences with the games, that we count on, to save time and headaches.

Trust me..I had d/l plenty of DA/ME editions..yet, never install it to play..just having them is enough sometimes (lol, for the ocd)
Waiting for the day (that might never come) when I have time and mood to play them all.
Since that hardly comes nowadays, having the knowledge on which edition is perfect..will keep mind at ease. Thanks."
,Faldorix,2011-10-08T07:42Z,"Want to start off by thanking you for all your hard work, keep it up man :D I'm having trouble installing the game, I'm kinda new to this so I was wondering if I'm doing something wrong.

So I downloaded the torrent and unzipped the file, and clicked on setup. After a few minutes Windows (Vista) asked if I wanted to open the file. After clicking allow, what looked like a command prompt started to pop up, but quickly closed and after waiting for a while, nothing happened. 

Can you please help me? I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

Thanks for all your hard work man :D"
,guidodi,2011-10-08T23:20Z,"Great torrent like always.
Would you consider doing a Mass Effect 2 repack?
Thanks"
,Overlawd,2011-10-09T00:55Z,"Hi illiria,

I've downloaded your wonderful pack here, But after installing the game, applying mods, and and the pre-order dlc's the game crashes directly on start up. I don't even make it past the intro. "
,TaighAO,2011-10-10T00:43Z,"""Hi illiria,

I'm having the exact same problem."
,TaighAO,2011-10-10T01:57Z,"Firstly: Thank you for taking the time to do this.

Secondly: It's not working. I'm not an experienced game pirate or whatever because usually I will just by the game.

However, I already bought this game and all of the addons on my xbox and I'm not planning on doing it again.

Downloading this took quite sometime. While it was downloading my power supply crapped out and damaged some of my computer. This whole thing has been quite frustrating.

If I were smart I would back out now but I've come too far.

After downloading this game 100% I auto setup the rest. I downloaded the game itself, the preorder perks, and the addons. I clicked the launcher, made sure all of the addons were in the data(they were) and clicked launch.

Then the game crashes. I must be missing something, please help. Thank you."
,hikarikami,2011-10-11T07:30Z,"Hey nice release, it took me a little while to download but it's done now and installed.

@people with errors:

I was keen to test it out after installing, and got through to the creation only to have it crash on leaving the docs house. However after going back to the torrent file and installing the ""Microsoft Visual C++"" distrubution file, and the ""DIRECTX"" setup file everything runs flawlessly. 

Now to see if I can get some mods working >_>"
,danilo86,2011-10-12T14:52Z,"Thanks man, i hope you get your skull soon."
,Wythyr,2011-10-13T11:19Z,"First off, thank you so much for this torrent. I can't wait to start playing.

HOWEVER! When I try to start the game, an error message pops up saying that a XINPUT1_3.dll can't be found or something. The message suggests that reinstalling may fix the issue, but I've done that three times now, to no avail.

What should I do? :("

,jtr697,2011-10-15T07:14Z,"Whenever i start it up, it immediately crashes. I dont see the intro or anything."
,illiria,2011-10-18T22:57Z,"@ EVERYONE.

Install DirectX and Microsoft Visual C++ runtimes if your game crashes. You think I've included these two just for the hell of it? They are required for the game to run.

I've tested the game on windown xp/vista/7, on 3 computers. Works perfect. So...

Let's make an agreement: IF YOU MISS EVEN THE BASIC KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO GET THINGS WORKING, ***BUY*** GAMES.

@ Wythyr

Good work at figuring you need to have DX installed."
,tomtomvdp,2011-10-25T10:03Z,"thank you so much ! it works perfectly , now i must confess that i'm downloading new vegas , because ""fallout 3 by skullpura"" made me nuts , so as you said . could you please upload an awesome torrent like you did with new vegas , but with fallout 3 ? please ! i made an account just to be able to tell you this ,so please ! thank you.

,Moebius73,2011-10-28T15:30Z,"Hi there!

Great torrent, works like a dream. One question tho: where's the intro movie? Isn't there supposed to be a movies directory under data?
"
,avatarofcain,2011-10-28T21:22Z,guys can u please seed its downloading at 200 kbps come on most great games like this are downloading faster.If i do manage to download il seed 30 gigabytes since i like this game
,thepirateike,2011-11-01T08:10Z,Works perfectly! Great job on this. I've been seeding and will do so for awhile. Thanx alot.
,r912525,2011-11-02T08:30Z,This is amazing but there is a problem im encountering everything seems to work except for the intro movie to the game. It just skips to the game start.  If that is easily fixable then this is absolutely perfect (to my current knowledge) thanks!!!
,Fearlessbro,2011-11-08T01:28Z,"Great repack, works perfectly, and is very easy to use.

If anyone is having problems:

1: Mount the ISO file with Daemon Tools
2: Install DirectX
3: Install Microsoft Visual C++
4: Install Fallout New Vegas
5: (OPTIONAL) Install Game Add-on Pack (This is all the DLCs)
6: (OPTIONAL) Install Pre-Order DLC Pack (This is every pre order bonus item, you get them at the start of the game)

Thanks alot again, great repack."
,dominic_mhd,2011-11-08T08:17Z,"re step 6) Contains latest Unofficial Patch

And thankyou very much for the torrent, it is extremely well put together."
,revrai,2011-11-09T14:44Z,Best Fallout NV torrent out there! Done installing this and it works fine. It took me 3 minutes to install. Nice work illiria and thank you.
,Fengi3697,2011-11-25T17:58Z,"Hmm... that isn't good.
Every single time I launch the game, it crashes immediatly, and yes I did install the DirectX and Visual C++ stuff. Running Windows XP, and my computer should be able to run it properly.
-.-"
,Fengi3697,2011-11-25T22:34Z,"Uh, ignore my comment. My installation must have glitched because reinstallation fixed it! :D"
