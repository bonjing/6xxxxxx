\Why best?

1) This is a complete PROPER repack of the game with the latest patch slipstreamed into the installation.
2) Pre-order DLC were excluded from the game installation and packed into separate install (these iteams are rather cheaty, not everyone wants to play with them). Repack Automatically locates game folder and enables DLC by default.
3) Fast installation (as fast, as possible)
4) Complete repack of game Add-ons (DLCs) from Dead Money to Gun Runners' Arsenal (i.e. ALL DLC released). Repack Automatically locates game folder and enables DLC by default.
5) Fits one Dual-Layer DVD
6) Contains latest Unofficial Patch (separate installation - not everyone may want it. Look in the disc's root directory, it's not in Autorun Menu)
7) Contains proper repack of Garden of Eden Creation Kit (G.E.C.K.) - automatically locates the game and installs in game folder. Contains uninstall (separate installation - not everyone may want it. Look in the disc's root directory, it's not in Autorun Menu)
8) Very pretty and comfortable to navigate Autorun and Installations.

IMPORTANT NOTES:


Some Anti-Viruses may detect all and every my installations as viruses. I don't know why does it happen, nor do I care. I know Avira did that at one time.
---
Under Windows Vista/7 game/add-on installations may take a couple of minutes before they show up. Unlike Windows XP, Windows Vista/7 fully preloads executable files into memory before it launches them.



That's it. I'm sure as hell this is the best Fallout: New Vegas torrent in the world, so grab it and SEED IT!

P.S.
If you want the same type of release of Fallout 3, with all the patches, DLC and everything else properly repacked and included, tell me about it in comments, I will upload it. I made one for myself a while ago.
