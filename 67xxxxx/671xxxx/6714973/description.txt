The Series Finale

It's the big one. How big? Well, it's the epic episode that brings the current series to a
spectacular climax, with the Doctor aware that only his death can keep the universe safe. And
so we return to Lake Silencio as the Time Lord prepares for a date with destiny...

Old friends like River, Amy and Rory return along with Churchill, Charles Dickens and Dorium
Maldovar. But enemies from the Doctor's past also feature. There's Dalek action and the
Silence and Kovarian are back with a vengeance!
