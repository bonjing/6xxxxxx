In 1974 Tomas made his most serious blunder. He was fooled to sign the dotted line of a contract that made him almost in villenage. It meant one wasted year sitting in cheap hotel rooms in London and Birmingham waiting for an artistical sun that never rised. But even worse was the reception he got returning to Sweden: no one wanted to touch him, he was someone elses goods. 
The only way to get out of the mess was hard work. And Tomas and his new performed band worked hard, to say at least, before things started to happen again. Finally he got his desired new record contract with the album Knivhuggarrock as a result. The wheels started to turn. (tomasledin.net)
