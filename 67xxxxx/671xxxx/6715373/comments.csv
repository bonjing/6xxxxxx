,bonnievilleangel,2011-10-02T16:00Z,"Love this type of movie, thank you..."
,underclock4,2011-10-02T16:08Z,"A=8
V=6-due to it's shaky nature in parts while filming
M=2
Giving this movie 2 is a bit generous. Into the first 25 minutes I ended up with a concussion....from falling asleep and hitting my head on my computer table!! The movements of the dragons is slightly more fluid than the creatures in those old Sinbad movies! But then I can't be too critical for what is bitter for one is sweet to the other.
Anyway, a big thank you to the uploader for providing entertainment; I have downloaded many, many of you uploads...but this one sucks; then again it's free so I shouldn't complain-darn i'm caught between a rock and a hard place!!!
Cheers! "

,Pdid,2011-10-02T21:56Z,Movie....bad...Uploader...great!
,hansreidar,2011-10-02T23:01Z,"@ underclock4. No. You're not caught between a rock and a hard place. However, you might very well be caught between your own two arguing brain cells. It's a shame, really, sine you you only got the pair, that they can't get along better.

My thanks to the uploader. Great work."
,forb1dden,2011-10-03T12:16Z,"and i wanted to see a dragon movie so badly!
haven't seen a good one for so long"
,DDettonattorr,2011-10-04T00:07Z,"again Thanks for the good work!

Peace"
,nightyman,2011-10-04T14:00Z,"@ hansreidar:  Your response to underclock just shows that your only braincell seems to go on fumes. I'd recommend a doctor or a new brain, but im afraid it's just wishful thinking that it would do any difference..

Thanks for the upload, nomatter if its a 1 or 10 on imdb."
,benji_d,2011-10-05T14:03Z,I rarely put bad comments up about movies but have just flicked through this film and feel compelled to say how truly awefull it looks.
,SuperWurm,2011-10-20T22:36Z,"this is real bad movie! Well not all of it Actors have enough talent for a soap but not for a movie. But the chick with the swords was okay, but only compare to the others of the cast. In a better movie she would fade away in the shadow of talented actors. But the director of this movie has zero talent. It's like there was no director at all while they where shooting this shit.
And the ones in the editting room did also a lazy job. Like they just put together some scenes without looking at them."
