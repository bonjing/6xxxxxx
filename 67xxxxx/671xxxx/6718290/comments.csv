,efwis,2011-11-07T21:22Z,"don't waste your time downloading this copy. when he created the ISO file he screwed things up. to watch the movie I had to go into the dvd as a file system, and click on the individual .VOB files. and only 4 of them were there. not even the whole movie is on the disk!!! Some people need to learn how to rip movies before uploading them to sites like this. total waste of my time. 13 hours to download this rubbish only to find that I now have a nice shiny coaster instead of a movie to watch on my dvd player."
,Win7nerd,2011-11-09T22:22Z,"first off fuck you, secondly who are you to judge when you dont have ANY torrents yourself? thirdly, at least i try to contribute to the scene and not bitch about what you can get for free, you obviously have that issue."
,demonswrath6,2011-12-23T08:29Z,"firstly u should have these to rip a dvd n to burn the iso file: Magic iso to make the iso using dvd43 for decoding, then power2go to burn the image..get a perfect dub of the original dvd !"
,LastFx,2012-01-07T17:13Z,"Burnt .iso directly using DVD Decrypter.
