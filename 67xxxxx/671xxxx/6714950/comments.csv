,jjaworsk,2011-10-02T15:21Z,"@tonn10 - the reality is that pharma companies spend most of their time and research on 'herbs' , analysing their properties for the purpose of finding and slightly altering the genetic makeup so that copyright and patent can then be claimed, then charging a fortune for the result.
You may not believe in 'herbs' , but the arrogance of pontificating what others should or should not believe, has only been seen before in religious maniacs, politicians and pharma companies - which group are you from???"

[V],joshua13,2011-10-02T19:14Z,"that explains why no diseases have ever been cured or prevented! Oh wait they have.  Do you have any idea how much fricken money any pharm company that had a cure for almost any form of cancer would make? Nobody sits on a river of gold for a trickle of copper. Not to mention this would require a conspiracy so vast, encompassing so many business people, doctors and scientist (many of whom do research for universities and others) that the idea is ridiculous on its face."
,n0dr0g,2011-10-07T00:37Z,"@joshua13 You took the blue pill didn't you? I quote from Wikipedia ""The Big Lie (German: GroĂe LĂźge) is a propaganda technique. The expression was coined by Adolf Hitler, when he dictated his 1925 book Mein Kampf, for a lie so ""colossal"" that no one would believe that someone ""could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously."" Hitler believed the technique was used by Jews to unfairly blame Germany's loss in World War I on German Army officer Erich Ludendorff."""
