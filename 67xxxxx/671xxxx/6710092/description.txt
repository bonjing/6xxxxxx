connection speed). FlashFXP uses a familiar, 
Explorer-like interface that even the most novice 
user can master in minutes. It offers features 
such as drag-and-drop, CHMOD support, SSL/TLS transfer, 
enterprise-friendly rollout options, firewall and proxy 
support, strong application encryption, speed limiting, 
statistics, scheduling, and autoreconnecting.
