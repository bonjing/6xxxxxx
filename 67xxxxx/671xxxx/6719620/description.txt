"BFF's"

Cleveland is upset when he finds out that his 
supposed best friend Peter Griffin came to 
Stoolbend and did not call him to hang out. In an 
effort to bond with his other friends, he takes 
them on a camping trip hosted by guest star Ric 
Flair that quickly turns into a dangerous redneck, 
hillbilly huntdown. Meanwhile, Rallo competes in a 
Quiz Bowl tournament after being forced to enter 
by Donna to prove that he is just as smart as the 
other kids in his class.

Evolve...or die.
