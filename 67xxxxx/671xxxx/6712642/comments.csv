Also, rather to upload all your games in one go, would it be possible to upload them as you complete them so the first game you do gets here quicker? Just a thought. 

Anyway, these 4 games look to be the pick of week 4:

Lions@Cowboys - 1pm start
Steelers@Texans - 1pm start 
Patriots@Raiders - 4:15pm start
Jets@Ravens - 8:20pm start

If you could do these it would be fantastic. Any more would be a bonus."

,nflfan,2011-10-01T00:20Z,Great! Thanks again.  
,sharifali,2011-10-01T16:43Z,"Thanks Phatwarez-keep the brfwns coming!
I pepponally like the larger file size, but whatever is good for you"
,jamarr911,2011-10-01T23:36Z,Yes I would like the larger file size as well.  The Video quality was basically identical if not better than the quality that comes through my HD DVR settop box....The sound quaility wasn't as good but who cares...the 3+GiB file size is great!
,lifes_been_good,2011-10-03T15:27Z,"Please add the Tennessee @ Cleveland game to the request list for week 4!

Many thanks in advance for you efforts!"
,flubflub,2011-10-03T19:52Z,"Thanks a lot. Filesize to video quality ratio is fine by me.

Miami week 4 game please, as and when you're good 'n ready of course! :)"
