,EngineeringTheEnemy,2011-10-05T00:42Z,"Remind everyone that its great to be able to sample music this way but the only way to keep the bands making music and touring is to support them.  Its easy to keep downloading and not buying CD's but its not just the bands who need the $.  The studio's, all involved in recording,  all those involved in manufacturing the CD's, marketing...blah blah.  Remember, the bands and everyone has to eat and live like us.  Most bands are NOT RICH! SUPPORT!! Thanks guys"
,EngineeringTheEnemy,2011-10-05T00:46Z,"Hey all... check out OUR NEW CD.  The bands name is my name :)  ENGINEERING THE ENEMY (Can hear it on ITUNES, YOUTUBE,MYSPACE)   If anyone wants to make a torrent and upload it on here for people to get just email me under the same name @ yahoo.com and i'll email the album to you.  For fans of Chevelle, Breaking B, Atreyu..blah blah blah.  Thanks everyone"
[T],L3G3ND,2011-10-05T19:14Z,"@ EngineeringTheEnemy.,
please dont spam in torrents specially mine. I am irritated because of the promoters like you. Plz stop otherwise i have to get you kicked out of here."
,EngineeringTheEnemy,2011-10-06T11:44Z,"Spamming? I made a statement about supporting aritists #1 and then I just threw out an offer if anyone was interested.  I have no ill-intentions. So ""a spammer like you"" is a little overboard.  I've seen others post the same ""spam"" over and over on other torrents again and again.  I made one comment seeing if anyone wanted to help. I didnt realize my comment would ruin your torrent.   "
,ajracerex,2011-10-06T16:28Z,awesome!!! thank you so much! 3MB download took 30 seconds. sweet! album sounds great so far
