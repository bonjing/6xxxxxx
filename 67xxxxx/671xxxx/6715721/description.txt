Sorry about the delayed upload, but TPB had broken torrent uploads for several hours.


NOTE:
This is not an HD file. The _source_ is HDTV. As the name of the file, the name of the torrent and the details below tell you, this is 272p video. A small resolution of acceptable quality that is playable on more devices than most video files. This file should be playable on all modern PCs including those with Windows, Mac OS, or GNU/Linux variants, Android smartphones, iPhones, iPod4 and up, iPad1 or 2, Android tablets, PSPs, generic PMP and MID devices, Windows Phone 7, Windows CE/Windows Mobile phones, other smart and some not-so-smart phones, XBox 360, Wii, PS3, BluRay players, many DVD players and probably your smart toaster. DO NOT EXPECT THIS SMALL VIDEO FILE TO PLAY IN Hi-Def ON YOUR 50" PLASMA BRAIN DRAIN SCREEN.
