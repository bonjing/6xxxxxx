Not totally sure of the bitrate, but I think it is 192. Either way, it sounds pretty good to me, so it's acceptable.

As with many of my other torrents, I found this on another site and spent a LONG time downloading it so I could seed on Pirate Bay. I had a HARD time finding this. Anyway, the original torrent file seemed to be corrupted or something, and it wouldn't let me upload it, so I'll be the only one seeding for a short while. The original only had two other seeders anyway. Plus, it had one of those annoying "Torrent downloaded from" text files in it. I removed that, so... Be happy, haha.

Enjoy!

PS: One last note. For those of you who have heard the Gravity version of Dirty Second Hands, this version is basically void of sound effects. It's cool to hear it once, but I like the other version better. :)
