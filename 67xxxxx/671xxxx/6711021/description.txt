"God Laughs"

Sam, Cooper, Charlotte and Amelia team up to 
save the life of their friend Pete after he 
suffers a heart attack, while Violet, who was 
in the middle of leaving Pete and LA, is 
nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, Addison's desire 
to have a baby leads her to see Jake Reilly, her 
recent mystery man, in a most surprising place, 
and Sheldon tries to help Amelia in her battle 
with alcohol.
