,Linkmrr,2011-10-02T22:06Z,I know its in a GOD container but is it ripped with 0800? as in playable on lt+ 2.0 when it comes around?
,Linkmrr,2011-10-02T22:07Z,maybe with the iso tools he's talking about?
,charincol,2011-10-02T22:49Z,"If it's in a GOD container, then it was installed thru NXE dash and transferred from the Xbox in that format. Which is why it's Jtag only."
,charincol,2011-10-02T22:53Z,NXE2GOD and GOD2ISO are programs that can only be used after it's been installed from the disc. They aren't used on an ISO ripped from the disc.
,btb101,2011-10-03T00:27Z,"any chance of a NON JTAG version?
pal of course.."

after that it will be detected by nxe, fsd, n nxetogod

then run nxetogod n then run the game from fsd or nxe

if u dont know what the above three things are then aint a jtag user"
