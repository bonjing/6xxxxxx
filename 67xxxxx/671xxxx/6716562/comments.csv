,pzsnr,2011-10-04T19:16Z,"Thank you! I've been waiting for someone to release the discovery set in flac.
Good work!"
,oretes1225,2011-10-05T01:44Z,"Get ""FLAC_STREAM_DECODER_ERROR"" on some tracks, unable to decode :("
[T],rjordan21,2011-10-05T11:50Z,^^^ There's nothing wrong with these files. What media player are you using?
,mpolemis,2011-10-08T10:20Z,Thank you! It's Great!
,Zoticus,2011-10-14T22:48Z,"This is really great, but I wonder why Ummagumma sounds better than The Final Cut. On vinyl Final Cut was awesome, state of the art."
,disimagery2,2011-10-17T03:27Z,"no cues...too bad.

how can we put humpty dumpty back together again?

EAC noncompliant cues are needed to restore the album image from these seperated tracks..."
[T],rjordan21,2011-10-17T12:50Z,^^^ why wouldn't you use software to burn a cd gapless?
,StagMan196,2011-10-24T12:20Z,"Many thanks man, you're tops."
,pravdt,2011-11-05T18:09Z,"YOU'RE THE MAN. THANKS A LOT!!

,jjmajid,2011-11-25T14:52Z,"AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME ...

FLAC is a greatest LossLess audio format ever !
and according to my surf, this torrent is THE BEST QUALITY of Pink Floyd albums, ever !

Tnx bro ... great work"
,ericu65,2012-01-08T10:49Z,Awesome set. Highest quality rip I could find!
,ericu65,2012-01-08T10:50Z,Oups. Right comment at the wrong torrent. I meant to post this here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6783651/Pink_Floyd_-_Box_Set_Discovery_(EMI_Records_Remastered_2011)
[T],rjordan21,2012-01-12T19:38Z,"^^^^ Let's not confuse quality with quantity.  At nearly 2TB of music I don't need to save anything I don't use.  These files are bit perfect to the original and do include high quality artwork.  I'll never upload .CUE because I don't use them and my CD burning software doesn't need them.  More importantly to me, streaming these files to my HIFI doesn't require them either.  My apologies again to those that would like them but I'm sure once someone opens this torrent and sees they aren't there will simply move on to another version.... no time wasted at all.

Enjoy the music people!"
[V],peaSoup,2012-01-14T19:41Z,the dogs bollocks :) thank's for this
,scottsasse,2012-01-17T02:53Z,THANKS so FLACking much rjordan21!!! One of the best torrents of all time :)  Good speed too!! This one I will seed back to at least 10.1 ratio.
,scottsasse,2012-01-17T03:15Z,...................and I agree .cue sucks. There is no need for it anymore and it can sometimes be a real bitch!! Besides these files are ready to burn to disc with NO need to bother with .cues. The artwork in this is a real plus :)  I +1 this torrent and can't believe 6 stupid dicks have -1 rated it so far. If you love real FLAC then this IS the torrent you want!! THANKS again rjordan21!!
,Tip120,2012-02-05T00:36Z,"The quality is superb, one of the best torrents ever uploaded.
Gonna seed  this for months!"
,brnblnk,2012-04-10T13:27Z,Top notch! Anyone who has rated this down should get cancer and suffer.
