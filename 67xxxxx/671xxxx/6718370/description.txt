The singer/songwriter, Lara Fabian's second English album and sixth studio album, "A Wonderful Life" was released in June 2004. The album did not make a significant impression on the pop charts in Europe and it was never released in the United States, much to the dismay of her fans. In France the album sold an estimated 82,000 copies. "A Wonderful Life" was Fabian's last album under her contract with Sony Records and she subsequently left the company.

The album consists mostly of acoustic-influenced pop tracks. Fabian had been offered, and turned down, the track "Review My Kisses" before it was recorded by US country music star LeAnn Rimes for her 2002 album "Twisted Angel". However Fabian was so impressed with Rimes' performance that she decided to record it herself.

Lara's version of Black's 1987 hit single Wonderful Life is apparently similar to the one released by Dutch singer Mathilde Santing in 1999 as a single from her album "To Others To One". Lara's version keeps the original acoustic touch of Mathilde's arrangement, adding further orchestration and drums, and changing the order of the lyrics.
