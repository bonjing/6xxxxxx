,786dragon,2011-10-02T05:45Z,is this updated version with cut-scene fixes??? 
,IFBTJB,2011-10-02T08:16Z,"Riper or cracker, whichever, he had to include frameworks and directxes separate! Why he integrate all in one? Now nobody knows what exact the game installed on our computer. I do not like this! Otherwise - good work. But i do not like this! Why that @gansuk!"
[V],gansuk,2011-10-02T09:07Z,"@IFBTJB
wtf are you going on about
it clearly says what it installs and if u still not sure you can even look at the .bat file to see what it installs kaos are not hiding anything unlike sum rippers that dont even let u see the commands being run
if u dont like it then dont download go and buy the game
and then u can moan about always online drm"
,nipunb,2011-10-02T09:44Z,"hey gansuk don't listen to those comments, you are doing a great job.... thnx very much....
btw how is this repack is 2.92 gigs whereas the old torrent with cutscenes error was 3.01 gigs????"
,joeri86,2011-10-02T11:29Z,"Thnx for the pretty fast upload! If you follow the three steps like mentioned above, the install took about 10 minutes on my rig.

Played now for about an hour and still no errors occurred. Great job man!

I ran a scan with AVG 2011 (like always) and it didnt detect anything, so its a clean download.

Game runs smooth on high specs.

*Windows 7 - 64bit
*AMD 4x3Ghz. 
*4Gb of ram
*ATI Radeon HD6570 1Gb"
