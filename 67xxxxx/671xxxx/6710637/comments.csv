Who uploaded great movies every day,
Extremezone is one and then there's Bone,
Up until now, no one can claim their throne.

LOL, I crack my self up..too many beers. Nothing like a good Zombie movie this time of year, well hopefully it's good. Will be back with the verdict."
,Stormfront73,2011-09-30T12:22Z,LOL yeah you got that right majestika bang on the money!!!
,majestika,2011-09-30T18:49Z,"I have to revise that!
There were three pirates on Pirate Bay,
Who uploaded great movies every day,
Extremezone is one and then there's Bone,
Up until now, no one can claim their throne.

Let’s not forget “Imagine”,
For they are now locked in the cabin,
Because of torrent police,
May they all Rest in Peace.

,majestika,2011-10-01T09:02Z,"Ok here goes. 
A/V = .Bone. you really don't have to ask.
M = Typical Zombie Movie. It was ok. Hollywood needs more originality. All movies, in all genres lately seem to be the same. We need a movie that you can sit back and say ""Wow that was amazing"" "
