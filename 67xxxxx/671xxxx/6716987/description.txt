ClipWrap 2.4.3 update
September 2, 2011

Fresh out of the oven, we've posted an update to ClipWrap allowing users more control over the resulting files. You'll notice a new preferences window with options to:

    Preserve you original file's creation date in the new movie
    Control audio mixdown of 5.1 surround
    Automatically open resulting files in another application




Enjoy ;)
