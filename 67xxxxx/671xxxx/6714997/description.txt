This is a collection of all the Ultimate Comics series including the newer Reborn stuff. However, please note that I did not read all of it (yet) so while everything should be alright, I cannot say for certain (yet). Please leave a comment if something is missing or wrong, so I can fix it in the next update.

Thanks and kudos to:
	- Epic Internet Heroes who continue to seed old torrents
	- Great Scanners and Uppers
		- Also thanks to those who upload to file hosters, those where a great help in completing this torrent as well
		- Big fuck you to those who upload translated comics (usually spanish) without marking them as such
	- Everybody who continues to seed this after they are done downloading

Please note that this is like the biggest fucking torrent I've ever uploaded and my upload speed is not all that great, so please keep on seeding this so others can get it, too. The initial seed comes from a seed box, so speed should be good, but it took me half a freaking day to upload this to it.

If everything works out I might occasionally update this either incrementaly or as another big torrent.

In either case, have fun reading those.

PS :
	If somebody wants to compile a reading order, please do so. I'd love to see it.
	Roughly I think it's like this here:
	
	Pre 'Death of Spider-Man':
		Armor Wars, Avengers, Captain America, Doomsday Triology, New Ultimates, Thor, X, Spider-Man
		
	Then:
		Death of Spider-Man, Avengers vs. New Ultimates, Fallout
	
	Post 'Death of Spider-Man':
		All-New Spider Man, Hawkeye, Ultimates, X-Men
		
	At least that's how I think it goes.
