[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-02T00:02Z,"MARVEL people??? I would like to get into Avengers but I am lost: New Avengers, Secret Avengers, Ultimate Avengers, Ultimates, new ultimates

Could someone give me a quick and dirty low down/chronology?

Also, could someone explain the numbering on ultimate spiderman, so Vol 2 started at #1, where did Vol 1 leave off?"
,xpgrl_uk,2011-10-02T00:47Z,"Ultimate Spider-Man ran until issue 133, then they started the ""Ultimate Comics"" Series (which this torrent contains) and started the series with #1 again (even though they never bothered to actually change the name to ""Ultimate Comics"" on the cover). After some issues they decided the new number format wasn't good enough and they went back to the old numbering starting at #150 (#16 in the new format). Now after the last ark of ""Ultimate Comics Spider-Man"" the series ended and it begins again with ""Ultimate Comics All-New Spider-Man"". Don't know much about the Avengers, but the easiest starting point would be the mini-series Issues in the UC series here."
[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-02T02:22Z,"Thanks :D I have #1-133, so I just need these to complete. 

Maybe I can find an Avengers chronology to explain all the various titles"
,Uriz3n,2011-10-02T07:55Z,"Avengers (Regular Marvel):

If you don't want to go back too far, and keep to the prime storyline, I suggest you try starting with ""Avengers: Disassembled"" by Bendis & Finch, then ""House of M"", then ""New Avengers"" Vol #1 leading up to: ""Civil War"".
From that add ""Mighty Avengers"" then ""Secret Invasion"" and ""Dark Avengers"". 
Finally, ""Siege"", ""Avengers Prime"", ""(The) Avengers"" and ""New Avengers"" Vol. #2. Optionally add to that ""Secret Avengers"".

Ultimate Marvel:

Avengers were initially called ""The Ultimates"", three series, Vol #1 and #2 by Millar and Hitch, Vol #3 by Loeb and Madureira. Vol #3 leads into Ultimatum (curse that Loeb, curse his immortal soul for that abomination). which in turn paved the way for Ultimate Comics.
(Ultimate Spiderman went back to #150 for the double-sized jubilee issue, then continued on.)

Ultimate Comics Avengers:

After Ultimatum, start with Ultimate Comics ""New Ultimates"" Mini, then the Ultimate Doomsday Trilogy (Enemy, Mystery, Doom) for the setup for:
Ultimate Comics ""Avengers"" Vol #1-#3. 
Then (maybe) Ultimate Comics ""Captain America"" (although I consider that a floater). 
On to Ultimate Comics ""Avengers vs. New Ultimates"" and ""Death of (Ultimate) Spider-Man"".
Ultimate Comics ""Fallout"" leads then to the birth of the ""New"" Ultimate Comics lines:
Ultimate Comics ""Ultimates"", ""Hawkeye"" and ""All-New Spider-Man"" (all on-going). 
Ultimate Comics ""Thor"" is mostly a prequel, I would put that wherever, but strongly recommend waiting to read it at least until AFTER ""Ultimates"" Vol#1 and Vol#2.

What can I say, I felt helpful..."
,Uriz3n,2011-10-02T08:01Z,"Oh, yeah, I forgot:

""Ultimate Extinction"" / ""Ultimate Galactus"" storyline happens sometime during Ultimates Vol.1# & #2.

""Ultimate War"" (Ultimates/Ultimate X-Men Crossover) happens sometime during Ultimates Vol.1# & #2, and is continued in Ultimate X-Men.

""Ultimate Power"" happens between Ultimates Vol#2 and Ultimates Vol#3.

Also, Ultimates had two Annuals..."
[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-02T18:02Z,"@Uriz3n

WOW, thank you :D"
,huse148u,2011-10-03T19:04Z,I seem to be getting error messages when trying to read the Ultimate Spiderman series. The reader I'm using is CDisplay and it works fine for the Ultimate X mini series...
,xpgrl_uk,2011-10-04T01:31Z,"I've tested them all with ""Simple Comics"" on the Mac and my source files are perfectly intact and work. Please try to verify the files you downloaded in your torrent client to see if it's an error that occurred during or after the download or try a different reader."
[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-04T01:48Z,"I didnt go through all, but the random spiderman comics I loaded in ComicRack worked great. 

Thank you or this torrent and thanks to everyone for the Marvel advice. Im switching over from being a long DC guy - Ill still follow Batman, but Im done with the rest and Avengers always intrigued me, Spiderman and XMen too. :D Welcome me into your fold Marvel people LOL"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-04T02:05Z,"Another stupid question... Utlimate X-Men had 100 issues (and specials) but stopped in 2009, now they are back with a new volume. was there any Ultimate X-men in between?"
,xpgrl_uk,2011-10-04T03:22Z,"The Mini Series ""Ultimate X"" serves as a sequel/spin off of the original ""Ultimate X-Men"", so you could check this out before reading ""Ultimate Comics X-Men"", but I don't think it's strictly required."
,huse148u,2011-10-04T04:22Z,"I dunno why they wouldnt work with CDisplay even though every other comic I've read has worked but it works great with ComicRack, in fact, I think I like the ComicRack interface better lol. So thanks for all the help and thanks for the awesome upload :P"
,Uriz3n,2011-10-06T20:49Z,"CDisplay Problems:

First of, this is no diss on the uploader or his commendable effort, it's just a quirk of CDisplay many people are not aware of. 

One thing that can create that problem with CDisplay is if the files are ""incorrectly"" labeled, by which I mean .CBR instead of .CBZ . The comics files are basically .rar or .zip archives full of pictures, the different formats resulting in the different file endings: .CBR for .rar, .CBZ for .zip . As far as I know, CDisplay is the only major program to have problems if the files are not correctly labeled, like a .zip archive named .CBR . I haven't downloaded this torrent, so I cannot say if this is the case, but you could try opening one of the files that give you a problem with WinRar or Win Zip or any other unpacking software, and check if the archive type (zip or rar) corresponds with the file ending (CBZ or CBR). If it doesn't, that is your problem right there. Just rename the file to the correct ending/extension and it should work.


Ultimate X-Men:

(Ultimate Marvel) Ultimate X-Men ran for 100 issues, plus the two Requiem issues resulting from Ultimatum.

So for chronology it goes: 
(Ultimate Marvel) Ultimate X-Men #1-100,
Ultimatum (with respective Tie-Ins from Ultimate X-Men, Ultimate FF, Ultimate Spider-Man)
(Ultimate Comics) Ultimate X
Ultimate Comics X-Men (ongoing)


General Ultimate Marvel Comics:

In my previous chronology for Ultimate Comics (see above) I have omitted the following:

First off, Ultimatum was the big turning point (in DC speak Crisis) of the Ultimate Marvel Universe, resulting in the new Ultimate Comics line, not a reboot, but more of a restart in a different world.
There are three main stories leading into Ultimatum: Ultimate Power, Ultimate Origins and Ultimates Vol.#3, all of which were labeled with ""March on Ultimatum"", with Ultimate Origins and Ultimates Vol. #3 being the pivotal story lines. There also was a nice, but mostly irrelevant, ""Ultimate Hulk Annual"" in that ""March on U"" group.
The second turning point was ""The Death of Spider-Man"", and from its ""Fallout"" come the all-new ongoing Ultimate Comics series: All-New Spider-Man, Ultimates, X-Men, Hawkeye.

Omitted Story Lines: 

Ultimate Origins, should be read after Ultimate Power and before Ultimates Vol.#3 and Ultimatum. 

Ultimate Armor Wars, should be read after Ultimatum, since it details events pertaining Iron Man shortly after Ultimatum.


I'm sorry, I just forgot."
,Uriz3n,2011-10-06T20:55Z,"Oh, and with ""a different world"" after Ultimatum, what I meant was ""a world forever changed"" BY Ultimatum. 

NOT like what DC did with the current ""New 52"" reboot, or what Marvel did, back when I was young and handsome and dinosaurs roamed the earth, with originally establishing the Ultimate Marvel Universe with ""Ultimate Spider-Man"" #1."
,Uriz3n,2011-10-06T22:03Z,"And some further unsolicited infos (mostly for Downtown):

Ultimate Marvel was established first in Ultimate Marvel Team Ups 1-14, then Ultimate Spider-Man #1, followed by Ultimate Fantastic Four and Ultimate X-Men.
The Ultimate Marvel Universe is different and distinct from the regular Marvel Universe, with its own different continuity, characters and events. The main architect behind its creation was Writer Brian Michael Bendis, who wrote and still writes every issue of Ultimate Spider-Man, and was also responsible, together with co-writer Mark Millar, for the establishing of the other two Ultimate Marvel comics, X-Men and Fantastic Four.
The plan was to create a different, slightly more modern ""Reboot"" of the Marvel Universe, limited to three monthly series and numerous Mini-Series. It was to be the ""ultimate"" Marvel Universe, without the need for readers old and new to know about 50 years of continuity or to buy 20 different series a month to get all that happens.
All three series were quite good, with Ultimate Spider-Man being constantly superb, and Ultimate X-Men and Ultimate Fantastic Four becoming a tad more bland after the pen was handed from luminaries like Bendis, Millar and Ellis to newer, less talented (my opinion) writers.


In the regular Marvel Universe, Bendis has by now become equally influential, mostly due to his reboot of the Avengers Franchise, and the resulting events of ""House of M"", ""Civil War"", ""Secret Invasion"" and ""Siege"", all of which irrevocably changed the Marvel landscape. 
For anyone trying to get up to speed with Marvel, any of the Bendis Books plus the Big Events mentioned are a good starting point. 

In addition, I would recommend the Straczinsky-written ""Amazing Spider-Man"" books, culminating in ""Brand New Day"" (which I thought was terrible, but still important), the ""Death of Captain America""-Event by Ed Brubaker, the ""Thunderbolts"" issues written by Warren Ellis shortly before ""Secret Invasion"", and maybe the last Fantastic Four Issues, starting with the Mark Millar stories, as well as the ""Shadowland"" crossover and ""World War Hulk"". (And, of course, the current event, ""Fear Itself"")
Personally, I by now stick with buying the Bendis Books for my collection, with the Big Events when necessary. While Bendis' quality often wavers in the big events, his monthly books are still some of the best mainstream books I have ever read. 
I dropped Amazing Spider-Man after JMS left, because Dan Slott is terrible (he's also the reason I dropped Mighty Avengers). Funny side-note, Dan Slott was personally selected by J. Michael Straczinsky to follow in his footsteps, yet Slott has not half his wit or style or imagination. Later is was announced that JMS quit at Marvel because of the ""Siege"" event, and that the separation might not have been on good terms. It puts a whole new spin on why JMS might have selected such a terrible, terrible writer...

Sadly, this, except for ""House of M"", pretty much excludes the Space/Science Fiction titles (Nova, Guardians of the Galaxy etc.) as well as the X-Men, Marvel's other big franchise. I never was one for the X-Men, there was just too much I didn't know, too much I didn't care about, so I can't really tell much, but they had their very own big events, deaths and births, with one happening right now. In addition, the many spin-offs and very confusing numbering, make it hard to get into it as a new reader. 
The only X-Men title I own, and can unconditionally recommend in the highest, is ""Astonishing X-Men"" Vol.#3, including the ""Ghost Boxes"" and ""Xenogenesis"" Mini-Series. 
The first big story line, ending with #24 and the Giant Size Astonishing X-Men #1 is probably one of the best comic book stories ever written, by none other than Joss Whedon. 
Sadly, after the end of ""Xenogenesis"" they changed writers with issue #36, and that was that.

As some further treats I would also recommend:

For a little Background on a (by now quite important Avengers member) I strongly recommend: ""Alias"" by Bendis.

For some Spider-Man"
,Uriz3n,2011-10-06T22:07Z,"Cut me off, did they now...


As some further treats I would also recommend:

For a little Background on a (by now quite important Avengers member) I strongly recommend: ""Alias"" by Bendis.

For some Spider-Man/Osborn background: ""the Pulse"" by Bendis.

""Daredevil: Guardian Devil"" by Kevin Smith and Joe Quesada, as well as the Daredevil issues by Bendis and Maleev.

""Runaways"" Vol.1 by Brian Vaughan.

""Punisher"" MAX by Garth Ennis.

""Deadpool""/""Agent X"" issues by Gail Simone.

""Wolverine Enemy of the State"" by Millar and Romita Jr.

""Avengers: The Initiative"" by Matt Fraction.

""Spider-Man and Black Cat"" by Kevin Smith.

Marvel Knights ""Spider-Man"" by Mark Millar.

""Hulk"" by Jeph Loeb (who for some reason can be just as great as he can be terrible).


These are just a few that I found very entertaining, and yes, I admit I have a certain cadre of preferred writers, namely Bendis, Ellis, Ennis, Millar, Smith then.... and then... and then Loeb, Niles, Simone, Fraction and maybe Nicieza.

Yeah, it's a lot. that was one of the biggest attractions of the Ultimate Marvel Universe: Only three series to follow, plus the minis...

Cheers all, I'm done. 

Promise."
[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-12T04:05Z,"@Uriz3n - Gracias :D

So Ive read most of the Ultimates comics so far, except Spiderman, X-men, and FF -they're longer series I just havent started yet, but everything else is under my belt - LOVE IT

EXCEPT - Ultimate Iron Man -WTF!? I dont need to go into how that was a steaming pile of non-sense. So my question is - Is there? and where? Is Iron Man's origin as it pertains to Tony in the Ultimates, because half the shit in Ultimate Iron Man directly contradicts things later on for I.M. And it was a complete 180 from ANY Iron Man backstory Ive ever read or seen. I actually deleted it -it was so bad - Horrid"
