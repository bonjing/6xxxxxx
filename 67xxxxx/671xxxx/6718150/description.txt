Alan Blume, "Your Virtual Success: Finding Profitability in an Online World"
Publisher: Career Press | ISBN 10: 1601631014 | 2010 | PDF | 240 pages 

The more virtual your business, the more flexible the hours, the lower the overhead, and the greater the profit potential. Your Virtual Success will help a cash-poor entrepreneur, a small business scrambling for expansion capital, an existing business seeking to improve profits, or an independent professional in any service business. 

Alan BlumeAâ€™s virtual model has resulted in large six-figure deals with people heAâ€™s never met face to face--and never will-- and small sales that would never be profitable in a traditional business environment. In Your Virtual Success, he demystifies the cost-effective, leading-edge, Internet-based tools that are available to almost everyone, as long as you know what questions to ask and where to look.

Your Virtual Success shows any entrepreneur, sole proprietor, partnership, or existing business how to:
Leverage new Internet tools to grow your business faster and more profitably.
Utilize free or low-cost online resources to hire, manage and expand your business.
Rapidly create a new, work-from-home virtual business while minimizing the risks of a traditional startup.
