In 1979, ABBA member Benny Andersson offered Tomas Ledin a chance to record for the group's company Polar Music. The singer joined Abba on their 1979-1980 tour as a backing vocalist, but also got the opportunity to sing his own composition Not bad at all during the show. Tomas Ledin also appeared on the Abba Live DVD and on the Super Trouper Video.

He won the Swedish Melodifestivalen in 1980 and represented Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest that year with Just nu!. The song was a big hit in Scandinavia, but also in Greece and Portugal since Ledin recorded an English version, Right now. (wikipedia)

Polar Music decided to promote Tomas Ledin internationally. The first step was Tomas' participation in ABBA's World Tour 1979. The album Looking for a good time (1980) was the first one with participation of Agnetha, Frida and Benny from ABBA as well as almost all ABBA session musicians. Agnetha and Frida were background singers and Benny played piano. (raffem.com/ABBARelatedArtists)
