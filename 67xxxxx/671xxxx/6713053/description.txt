Hall & Oates - Live at the Troubadour 2CDset  320k (musicfromrizzo)

As a fan of Hall & Oates decades ago when I managed a Stereo shop
at the age of 19, I find this 2CD set featuring their Live 
performance at the troubadour a lot of fun in many parts.

Their greatest hits are all in here so enjoy - those of you who know
or want to enjoy this music of 70s early 80s genre
