[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-02T00:00Z,"MARVEL people??? I would like to get into Avengers but I am lost: New Avengers, Secret Avengers, Ultimate Avengers, Ultimates, new ultimates

Could someone give me a quick and dirty low down/chronology?"
,Calel1234,2011-10-02T14:39Z,New Avengers and Secret Avengers are just different factions of Avengers. They came about after certain Marvel events. I'd ignore anything to do with Ultimate since Ultimate = alternate storyline.
