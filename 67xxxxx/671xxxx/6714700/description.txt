Review by Ken Dryden (AMG)

Stan Getz was invited to perform a concert with a local rhythm section in Warsaw, Poland, in 1960; he was sufficiently impressed with the trio to join them for a brief studio session afterwards. While this five-song set isn't flawless, as Getz has some problems with repeated reed squeaking in the rendition of "Cherokee," the all-standards program is otherwise very enjoyable, with excellent sound. Getz is in total control with the lush take of "Darn That Dream," as he makes a delayed entrance following pianist Andrzej Trzaskowski, who proves himself to be a thoughtful accompanist and soloist. Bassist Roman Dylag and drummer Andrzej Dabrowski also get high marks. This compilation is rounded out with two tracks from a 1974 concert in Warsaw by a working edition of the Stan Getz Quartet, with pianist Albert Dailey, bassist George Mraz, and drummer Billy Hart. The tenor saxophonist again gets a little sloppy with atypical reed squeaks in both tracks, which include an extended, exciting workout of Chick Corea's "La Fiesta" and an old favorite, Jobim's "Desafinado." Getz fans will definitely want to acquire this obscure Polish CD.
