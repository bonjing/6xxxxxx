This is the .iso image of the Intel Atom Utility DVD that came with my Atom D525 processor. The DVD itself doesn't say anything about specific processors, so I think it works with all the whole Atom series as long as it is a Gigabyte motherboard. This is version 1.1. You just mount the .iso (with DAEMON Tools Lite) and you can install. If the autorun does not work just open the "GSetup.exe"  and then you can install all the drivers. You do need this to make my Windows XP computer connect to the internet if you format you hard drive.

Is it Windows 7 Compatible?                        : Yes
Is it Windows XP Compatible?                       : Yes
Is it Windows Vista Compatible?                    : Yes
What types of drivers are included?                : Chipsets, Serial-ATA, Raid, Network, Audio 
Any Junkware included on DVD?                      : Norton, Adobe Acrobat (You don't have to install them)
