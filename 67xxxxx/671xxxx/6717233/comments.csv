,pinpirin,2011-12-01T11:20Z,"Confirming that episode 9 is corrupt. Also episode 13 has an echoing audio glitch for the first 6 minutes. Otherwise the torrent is fine, a/v is excellent quality."

Seed! All you super EGOS out there!
I have 30++ in ratio, still no one else cares but you want the fucking show- but you can not even seed after youve leeched. Getting tired of this, Ive got a lot of other torrent i could seed instead, why would I care about this one when almost all leechers is a bunch of FUCKING EGOS anyway?"
