John Gerlach earned a B.S. Degree in Wildlife Ecology from Central Michigan University in 1977. He has earned his living as a professional nature photographer since 1980.

Rather than photographing subjects that might sell well in the marketplace, he prefers to pursue subjects that interest him the most. He often photographs subjects that are not well known such as the Black Rosy-Finch which appeared on the front cover of the October 2000 issue of BIRDING.
