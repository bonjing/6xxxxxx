[V],blaze69,2011-09-30T20:02Z,"Need For Speed Underground 2 patch update 1.2

Improvement:
- Increase performance on NVIDIA 6800 series cards running on high resolution.

Bug Fixes:
- Game crashing under certain conditions in Online Lobby for game running on Windows 98 and Windows ME.
- An internet connection is no longer required to host LAN games.
- A change in the UI relating to people convicted of cheating. People convicted of chronic cheating will no longer be flagged, as there was a bug early on that would convict people of cheating even when they did not cheat."

,tbraybrook,2011-10-30T02:57Z,"Fast download for me. The actual seeders is much higher than posted. There were over 1000 seeders SEEN when I downloaded it. Not sure how many I connected to last night.
I scanned it with Avast Internet Security before burning and after burning it. NO VIRUS or trojans. Clean file. It installed without a glitch and plays fine! I have a 24"" monitor so not sure why someone here said they had problems with widescreen because I didn't. All in all, no problems at all with Windows 7 Ultimate.

Thanks blaze69!"
