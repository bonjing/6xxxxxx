NFL Week3 9-25-2011 Denver Broncos at Tennessee Titans
			
HD source. New hardware arrived and i'm running at about 60% right now. These run of rips are beta3. I'm looking for your feedback on quality. I can up the bitrate and bring games to about 2gb in size for slightly better video quality, or leave as is in a smaller size. What does the community want? 

Thanks for all your support and kind words. Keep week4 requests coming, if all goes well I should be able to fulfill. Back to football!
