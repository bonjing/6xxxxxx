[V],phatwarez,2011-10-01T00:10Z,"Your out of luck, at least from me. The work I had already started for Week two was lost when one of my hard disks decided to go kaput.

Right now i'm concentrating on week three and four coming up, and going back would put me behind."
,Hairy44,2011-10-01T02:20Z,"Please if you can, upload to the usual 2-5 gigabytes but 2 is often what most people upload. the best is 1280*720 but at least 2 gigabytes should be fine the problem with BAJSKORV's torrents is too large I don't like that which is why I download from you. Despite the setback from your earlier hardware crash, you had been a good uploader. I recommend at least 2 gigbaytes and high definition like 1280*720"

Really appreciated. "
,dstrbtwrz,2011-10-02T10:24Z,"Thanks a lot! Great work as always!

@nflfan
Use KMPlayer, never have any jerky issues with HD videos there."
,nflfan,2011-10-02T12:37Z,"I always use KMPlayer, better than VLC imo, but was jerky with both of these plus my external media player, but if it's OK with others that's fine. Fantastic job as always by phatwarez."
