,kristie76,2011-10-05T13:23Z,Hi just wondering if this is the first episode for season 3 or the 2 episode?
,hillary79,2011-10-06T13:38Z,"This is the second episode.
The first is called ""4 Houses, 4 Relationships."""
,kristie76,2011-10-09T09:17Z,thats what i thought do u know where i can get the first?
,hillary79,2011-10-09T11:37Z,Unfortunately I haven't been able to find it.  I've been looking for it.  It's the episode that I've been most interested in seeing.
,Nadlin75,2011-10-10T03:57Z,"Hey TvTeam, Please upload Season 3 episodes.  Thanks so much for all your work."
,hillary79,2011-10-10T08:15Z,"Seems like I was maybe wrong about which episode was first. It might be ""Announcement.""

The episodes weren't in order on IMDB, and it appears there were two episodes shown the same night.

Either way, I'd be so thankful if someone could share them.  Where I'm living it will take a year before they show them on TV."
,Neekagirl,2011-10-13T09:19Z,TvTeam can you possibly get Season 2 episodes 8 and 12?
,Neekagirl,2011-10-13T11:40Z,"Do you possibly have Season 2 episodes 8, 11 and 12??"
,blazinblazer10,2011-10-20T06:14Z,I Don't Know if this will help any but they have all of season 1 and 2 on netflixs streaming but they may have season 3 on dvd and for 15 Bucks for a month you could watch both 1 and 2 online and have 3 sent on dvd and for that price you can watch most stuff like this and way more but the down side is they don't have anything thats still in theaters thats y i will forever praise and worship TPB THANX to all of you that make it HAPPEN
,hillary79,2011-10-20T11:23Z,"Netflix is only available in the US.
Which is why I'm so thankful for TPB and all the wonderful people that take time to share."
