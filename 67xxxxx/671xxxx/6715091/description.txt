Hello, there - fellow Klovn fans!

I couldn\'t find any Klovn releases on TPB that had any subtitles on them, so here\'s the complete Klovn series - seasons 1-6 with hardcoded english subs. Ideally the subs would be in .srt files and not hardcoded, but that\'s the best I could find.

I kept the original folders and filenames so that those of you who already have these encodes could help seed as this is a 20 gb torrent - please help seed if you have them, and please do help seed after you\'ve finished your download.


I created a .nfo file with details of each encode and put it in the main folder.

Enjoy this hilarious series and contribute in any way you can.

Cheers.



Also, note: for PS3 compatibility; season 1 and 2, and half of season 3 works just fine on a PS3, but from the second half of season 3 and onwards you get color distortion on almost every single episode, maybe xbox as well, and perhaps on some media players, I\'m not quite sure. I watched the rest on my PC on VLC player and it worked fine, but for PS3 users beware of this issue from the second half of season 3 and on.
