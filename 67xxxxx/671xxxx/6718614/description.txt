Agian im too lazy to write a proper description ... So ima copy and paste from my old torrent! :D


Made by the same people who created "Recettear An Item Shops Tale"

"Five years ago, a witch's curse beneath the red moon turned Chante into a fairy. Now she and her sister Elise search for a way to transform her back into a human, and in their travels they come across a particular town, which is home to a number of nearby ruins, as well as a peculiar shopkeeper named Aira, and a strange, mercurial fortune-teller who calls herself Elma. Could this place hold the key to returning Chante to normal? Or will it lead to more answers than our two sisters ever wanted to know?..."

Blah blah blah...

Anywho have fun!
