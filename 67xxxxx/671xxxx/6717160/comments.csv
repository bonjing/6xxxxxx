,matttyyy,2011-10-03T08:11Z,"TPB is also the best torrent site out there. It's slow, but it's stood the test of time and has a great selection. Hootieman: Don't bite the hand that feeds. :P

,LiquidError,2011-10-03T15:50Z,Don't bother downloading this. It's password protected and obviously a scam

What planet are you on?

Nothing wrong with this, VTV is a well trusted VIP uploader, never had any issues with VTV uploads, they don't upload fakes or scams or suchlike and this file is no different, works fine.

Kindly be a good Ostrich and find a nice sand pit, there's a Chap.

,mezzam,2011-10-03T17:19Z,"Thanks for this! Great upload, nice download speed and great quality, dont understand why people behave so fucking bad when you share something, and it's not password protected, I wonder, can an .avi file even be PW protected?"

Thanks VTV"
,nicholkid,2011-10-04T16:46Z,"Well, I see that some of you guys don't have to have a password. I dl'ed it and it is a .rar (not .avi) and you need a password to extract it. It gives you a link to some ridiculous website that has 3 offers you can complete if you want the password. SO DUMB. "
,sasafurian,2011-10-04T20:26Z,ahh yeahh dudes who r saying problems with this site ..it happend to me as well today ..and let's give some applause for the team that's holding this site together ...and dnt u think there are 100 companies and people and organisations that want to see TPB crash and burn ? so stop complaining ! !

Thanks a lot VTV! :D"
,GadsdenNation,2011-10-05T04:55Z,"@icewolf72

No, I do not own a TV. I got rid of it back in 2009 after I realized it's an infiltration of homes via advertisements and news networks. Subliminal messages, esoteric witchcraft, and ancient numerological code-language poison the audience's mind.

Now, where the hell did I put my tin foil helmet.?.?."
,DeltaPan,2011-10-05T10:12Z,"@ nicholkid, aka, LiquidError, aka, mvagsae .

So you comment as LiquidError, type a load of crap, then a couple of hours laters you use another connection to make a new account and comment again to reinforce your first comment, as if that validates what is obviously utter nonsesnse, then next day on another connection you set up yet another account and make 2 more comments, as though it further validates by some sort of preponderance of 3 seemingly different users saying the same thing, well it doesn't work like that.

What, first your own connection, the others cyber cafe's or idiot mates of yours connections?

See, forums and blogs have this sort of thing all the time, mental cases like yourself, self validating BS under several usernames, all the same idiot, some may fall for it, to me, obvious sad frackwit with too much time and not enough constructive things to do, is obvious, innit geez'.

Anybody simply loading torrent/magnet into client, will see the file isn't a Rar, on completion, which will be very fast, they will find there is no password protection, no survey.

1684 seeders at time of this comment, not including those who've hit and run and others who've upped to 1-1 and stopped seeding, which will typically be half as many again, and you, under 3 different usernames, are the only one to spew utter BS about Rar's and P/W's and surveys etc, just you, nobody else.

Now you, are a nutjob, stop smoking the crack, it's frying your mind, now get some therapy, quick, before men in white coats take you away for a nice long holiday in a very comfortable padded room all to yourself.

Ay, moron!!!

,corganite,2011-10-05T18:58Z,"@ DeltaPan: Best comment ever.

Nothing wrong with this upload.
Good quality, .avi format (no .rar) and an amazing seed quality. Downloaded in under two minutes.

Gotta say though.. The episode itself sucked. Family guy has gone downhill. The amazing stories, the adventures, the great sense of provocative and surprising humour, Stewie's evil mind and his hate for other living creatures, the cut away gags... Everything is lost but for Peter's stupidity.

I hope the next one is better, or I'm done."
,Fixm,2011-10-06T13:45Z,How about you shut the fuck up hootieman. Every site needs to update from time to time. If you don't like it make your own site and see how that turns out.
,axiom187,2011-10-07T02:52Z,needs password form an advertising website.  ick.
,ANGRYUNIBR0W101,2011-10-08T23:23Z,"@hootieman

Eat a fucking dick, did you read the blog post called ""ThePirateBay being censored"" ? If you did you would know why it is being slow you ignorant retard. TPB is NOT a fail site, you are just too fucking impatient to let it load or you have a computer from 2001.

@corganite

I agree, in the older seasons of Family Guy there was more ""What the fuck? So Random!!"" moments, the new seasons have lost their luster. Looks like imma start hoarding South Park on my DVR.

On Topic:

Thanks for the upload, I forgot to set it to record and missed it. There was nothing wrong with the file and it was very high quality."
,Endetium,2011-10-09T06:30Z,good torrent. the episode however was propably the most boring episode ive ever watched of family guy... i mean the only remotely funny joke imo was the flock of jews flying away :D
,tommytomthms5,2011-10-12T12:11Z,What the fuck? did fox even air episode 3 yet?
,pallstar,2011-10-13T17:55Z,"For the people who didn't like this episode, you have to watch all three of Seth's shows to catch the humor. Cleavland Show, Family Guy and American Dad. There was a linking theme."
,xnaevs,2011-10-14T13:41Z,"I created this account to specifically address 'Endetium'. This episode of Family Guy was phenomenal, you're growing old if you believe otherwise. I don't even mean to be derogatory, think about it.."
,icewolf72,2011-10-18T01:29Z,"this site sucks.
