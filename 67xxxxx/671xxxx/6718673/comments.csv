,missyyb,2012-01-09T03:12Z,"Hey, I was wondering if u will be uploading season 10 anytime soon? 
I love your torrents! Videos quality is amazing.
Thank you. "
[V],meech,2012-01-09T05:57Z,"Yes.  Sorry for the delay.  Season 10 is ripped and ready to go.  I've just been uploading the x-files series (9 seasons), which has taken up most of my bandwidth.  I just released season 9.  So once it gets enough seeders to maintain itself, I will post season 10 of Smallville."
,bizzle603,2012-01-12T04:07Z,thanx I can't wait. I literally just finished watching season 9 yesterday and everyone else's rip's are crap
,FiSmFa,2012-01-17T22:45Z,"Sorry about asking, but when is season 10 coming. This season looks already pretty healthy. Maybe you could upload them same time soon. I think so. You have best rips."
[V],meech,2012-01-18T01:27Z,"My last x-files torrent was posted, which now gave me a chance to put up Smallville Season 10.  You'll find it here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6963856/Smallville.Season.10.DvdRip.x264.AC3.subs-MCH
