This is a full resolution, high profile x264 DVD rip of Smallville - Season 9 (of 10).  These files may be a little large for some.  But if you aren't worried about space, and want a higher quality, to output to a t.v. or such, then this may be for you.  I've previewed the episodes and they look and sound great on a 50 inch LCD/surround sound system.

Note: Season 10 won't be out until the DVDs are released and become available to rip.
