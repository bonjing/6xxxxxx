Colin Murray introduces highlights from a busy day of Premier League action. 
White Hart Lane is the venue for the 189th north London derby between Tottenham and Arsenal, 
where last season Rafael van der Vaart's 70th-minute penalty rescued a point for Spurs in an 
engrossing 3-3 draw. Across the capital, west London neighbours Fulham and Queens Park Rangers 
meet in the top flight surprisingly for the first time, while Chelsea travel north to Bolton and new 
boys Swansea entertain Stoke. As always, there is a review of the best of the action from Saturday's 
games with opinion and analysis from MOTD2 regular Lee Dixon.
