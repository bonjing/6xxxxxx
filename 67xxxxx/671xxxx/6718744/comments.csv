[T],Tyr3ll,2011-10-04T03:17Z,"yup,i wish you it !
well in fact the best method consisting to block SlySoft online server checker.
I will try to contact BBB team to know if they can
develop this or BRD team...
in most of case,this is online server checker who is our real problem so every time if you block this,
it will still be easier,indeed !
regards and let me know if it is ok bro.
ty and cu around"
,stevensnz,2011-10-04T03:43Z,"Tryed it still no luck wants to use the online database still, maybe its just these movies that have the problem? maybe they are not in the local key files e.t.c and need online databaase at this current point in time, i will try another older BD and check if its just the movies or just my install e.t.c"
,brianxxx,2011-10-04T16:14Z,"Thanks!
For uploading and for tracking the issues."
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-10-04T17:07Z,"Well it's possible that this following key has been blacklisted too now.
Will give it a try tonight on another computer to see the results so.
If i will be right,i will explain exactly how to proceed again.
Any we need an anti online server checker for sure.
Btw,i get very bad news for Belgian peers :
Belgacom and telenet isp should start a serious track for their clients,they decided to definitively
block TPB !!!
be aware so !

to avoid this problem i highly suggest you to change of dns by using those of google,for exemple,hÃ©hÃ© ;)
or switch to vpn connection too.

,stevensnz,2011-10-06T01:12Z,where are the keys stored on the system? would it be possible for you to upload the file/s that say have already loaded avatar and starwars?
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-10-09T10:55Z,"Well at first,i need to find or iso DVD of
those ones or to buy them.
Secondary my second computer is off as well as my seeds on my secondary connection.
My raid has crashed and both HDD don't want to boot anymore :s
I'm working hard actualy to change of computer and get back all data of my both HDD raid.
This will take a moment for resolve or repair and upgrade all.
Btw,i use now vpn connection but not every time anyway.
Bro if you could up both iso to me for i try that,please,contact me to :
tyrell.tpb@gmail.com
or up them to tpb.
Btw,why not using DVDFab instead of AnyDVD ?
Does not work on DVDFab ?
don't load these programs at the same time also.
Let me know dude...
ty for understanding 
cheers"
