Hey Gleeks! Here's the music from Glee S03E03, "Asian F". All files are tagged, 260kbps+, and in M4A format, perfect for iTunes.

NOTE: I'm still getting acquainted to torrenting and editing audio. A few of the files have a weird miniscule click at the end (after the music is over, don't worry), and I apologize for that. These files are higher quality than the ones I've previously uploaded, though :)
