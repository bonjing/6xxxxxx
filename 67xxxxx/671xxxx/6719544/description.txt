The Essential 80s 2CDset with (bonus) great hits - vbr

This is a Sony label offering which despite the CD title fails to
qualify as an "essential offering" for the period, in what is the lineup
they have opted for here

There are a number of songs I do not like in the least to have to listen to,
however there are some greatly enjoyable ones from this period such as
"never gonna give you up" (Rick Astley) and the ones we have added here as bonus
tracks - "I keep forgetting" (Michael McDonald) 12" 320k version and 
"The Power of Love" (Jennifer Rush) Maybe we should be making the decisions
over at Sony records instead huh?

PS Selena's "I Could fall in love" is a great song that came just after the 80s
and its here as its within the range of time we looked at as worth allowing in equally
