Also, do you think you can upload Season Two Episode One of How To Make It In America?"

Video and audio, perfect 10/10."

,Kristo-,2011-10-04T12:30Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!

The picture and sound goes to shit just in the final 2 minutes, the decisive moments. Fuck this shit."

,ZaClR,2011-10-06T05:53Z,"The video and sound fucks up at the end, download the repack instead."

,nightprowler.,2011-10-27T04:00Z,"If nuked, why are so many people still seeding?"
,garbagedrew,2011-11-27T02:20Z,not impressed with the quality verses the 500Mb rips. For 720 this should look much sharper. I even see artifacting is the dark areas. The quality isn't worth the size.
,Juelzbenz,2012-02-16T20:06Z,FINALLY SOMEONE AGREES! These 720p uploads are practically no better than 352p ones at 550mb. I downloaded a season 5 dex episode in 720p hd and NEVER bothered again. Total waste of my 1.2 gigabytes
