,johnniebrasco,2011-09-30T15:56Z,"i guess you are talking bout the rar's. unpack with winrar, play the .mkv, and take a crash course in how to use a computer."
,Grisha047,2011-09-30T17:05Z,isn't it better just to make an mkv-file and upload it here?
,johnniebrasco,2011-09-30T18:00Z,"Sure, but that discussion has been going on for many years, someone will upload only packed files like this, it's scene rules. Don't know why, has stopped caring about it."

,jctcom,2012-01-14T11:43Z,"If you are going to insist on Raring these can you at least please indicate in the title that it is rar's so we will know which ones to skip over easier?

Thank you."
