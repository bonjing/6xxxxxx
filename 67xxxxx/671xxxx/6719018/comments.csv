,JarOfDirt,2012-02-10T04:39Z,"I love this album, but am currently broke as fuck and can't go buy any CD's or music off iTunes (which I will actually never do..) so, this is the next best thing. Sorry Lights, I like your shit too much to not download it."
,pyritey,2012-03-14T02:47Z,The only reason I pirate stuff is because I have no money. If the economy wasn't so terrible and I had $ then hell yeah I would love to buy their albums/games to support the makers. Buuut as it stands....
