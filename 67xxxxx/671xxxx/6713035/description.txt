The Halloween Tree by Ray Bradbury
Full Cast Dramatization by The Colonial Radio Theatre Player
Length: 2 hours

On a Halloween night, eight boys are led on an incredible journey into the past by the mysterious "spirit" Moundshroud. Riding a dark autumn wind from ancient Egypt to the land of the Celtic druids, from Mexico to a cathedral in Paris, they will witness the haunting beginnings of the holiday called Halloween.

Featuring the evocative prose and imagery of Ray Bradbury, the fine acting of the Colonial Radio Theater players, and atmospheric music and sound effects, this story will send shivers of delight (and spine-chilling terror) through listeners young and old, long after the last candle has died in your jack-o'-lantern.
