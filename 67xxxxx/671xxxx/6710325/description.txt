-------------Complete Anne Rice Audio Collection v2.0-------------
I've always loved vampire stories and Rice's are some of the best. Therefore over 2 years ago I released my first Fixed-Chapterized-Tagged version of the almost complete fictional works of Anne Rice including books written under pen names. I have now updated this torrent with new works and a key replacement. I have processed all these unabridged books in the following ways:

1. More than half the books were ripped BY ME a few years ago. All the rips I did are from high quality library CDs and Cassettes. The other rips are done by others but are generally of very good quality.

2. Equalized volume. Several of these audio books had volume discontinuities. I have equalized volumes so there shouldn't be any sudden jumps.

3. Dehissed and noise-cleaned. When needed, I performed low pass filters and deleted pops in the audio.

4. FULLY CHAPTERIZED. This took weeks. Each audio book was compiled into a single file (deleting bits like "end of side one, please turn over this cassette") and then separated into Parts and Chapters as defined by the original books. I find this to be the best way to enjoy audiobooks and it is perfect for iPods.

5. Encoded all books to a uniform MP3 96kbps 44.1kHz.

6. ID3 Tagged. All audio book files have been fully ID3 tagged including full COVER ART.

And so this torrent represents a 97% complete collection of Anne Rice's work. That's 28 novels and 1 short story. The only fictional work missing from this collection is Rice's second novel, The Feast of All Saints. As far as I can tell, this book has not been released in audio form, so I believe this torrent to be 100% complete as far as audiobooks are concerned. Obviously, if ANYONE can possibly help me get an audio copy of this novel I would be happy to chapterize it and post it as an update and give the donor mad props!

But perhaps most importantly, I finally offer here an excellent replacement for 2001 - Blood and Gold (VC8 - read by Roger Rees) which was corrupt in the previous torrent!

Please leave any comments, questions, or suggestions you might have as they are HIGHLY APPRECIATED! :)

Enjoy!
