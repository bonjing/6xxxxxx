&lt;b&gt; Tommy Stinson - 2011 - One Man Mutiny&lt;/b&gt;

Tommy Stinson has worn many hats over his 30 years in the rock n' roll business -- from founding member of seminal band The Replacements to bassist of Guns N' Roses and Soul Asylum, and his own bands Bash & Pop and Perfect. His experience shines through on ''One Man Mutiny,'' his most textured and balanced work to date. Filled with slide guitar-laden riff rockers and lush ballads alike, Tommy shows that he is at his best when he's in the driver's seat.
