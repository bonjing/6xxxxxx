This is my most favourite of Leann Rimes' CDs if I had to pick one
in particular that I particularly fell for completely as the most
beautiful such County genre singing I had ever heard.

In addition to perfect renditions of songs previously done by Patsy Cline
and others, there's other numbers on here too.

Lovely great Country music that brings joy into your life for y'all
that know what it is to have a true special spirit in your music greats lists
