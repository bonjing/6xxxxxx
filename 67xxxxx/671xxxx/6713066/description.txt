Since there's a bunch of people wanting to try Windows 8, here you go; this is the developer preview and contains new features such as the MetroUI etc. It's the x64 w/ developer tools which was available via Microsoft. Installed into VMware, and then the files were compressed (just run the .exe to extract) and even comes with a little setup tutorial in case you're unsure.

Shouldn't run into any difficulties, if you do just give me a buzz. Cheers and remember to seed.
