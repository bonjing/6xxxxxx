Creating a great screencast happens in three simple steps:
===========================================================
-Record

-Edit

-Share


Here's a look at each step in more detail:
===========================================
Record:
--------
With Camtasia Studioâ€™s flexible recording options, you can choose to capture full screen, window or region. Add in music tracks, microphone, your computer's audio, plus picture-in-picture with your video camera, and you've got a world-class screencast.
-PowerPoint plug-in: The toolbar inside of PowerPoint makes it one-click-easy to record your presentations, either live or from your desk.
-SmartFocus: TechSmith's exclusive SmartFocus technology keeps track of where the action happens during your recording. Then it produces a video that zooms in on the parts you need to show.

Edit:
------
-Once you have your content recorded, polish it up and turn it into a professional screencast.
-Callouts: Add a graphic over your video to direct the attention of your viewers. You can even link to an external webpage or jump to a part of the video.
-Cursor effects: Highlight cursor movements and mouse clicks to help viewers follow the action.
-Library: It comes stocked with professionally-designed assets you can drag-and-drop into your video. It's also the perfect place to store your callouts, title slides, and other assets for re-use and sharing.
-Title clips and transitions: Walk your audience through your content easily with title clips that introduce or divide your video. Move smoothly between clips with over 20 transition options.
-Captioning Through Speech-to-Text: Camtasia Studio can automatically transcribe your videoâ€™s audio file into 508-compliant open or closed captions. And by "learning" your voice over time, your captions get more and more accurate.
 Want to be more hands-on? It's also easy to type your own captions or import 3rd party SRT and SMI transcription files.
-Quizzing: Ask your audience what they got out of your video. Easily add Flash quizzes to any point in the screencast.
-Table of contents & Search: Make it easy for viewers to skip to the video section they need to watch now with Camtasia Studioâ€™s smart Table of Contents feature. Just record a PowerPoint presentation as normal, and Camtasia Studio will use your slide titles to create the table of contents automatically!
 A search bar sits just above the Table of Contents, which helps you search-for and jump-to any word written within the presentation.
-Import media: Digital video clips, photos, music, animationsâ€”Camtasia Studio makes it a cinch to pull them into your project.

Share:
-------
The final step in creating a screencast is sharing it with your audience - and Camtasia Studio makes that a snap.
-Share to YouTube and Screencast.com: With just one click, your video is on its way to YouTube or Screencast.com, TechSmith's video hosting service.
-Produce to a variety of formats:

 +MP4/FLV/SWF - Flash player compatible

 +M4V for iPad/iPod/iPhone/iTunes

 +AVI for CD/DVD/lossless export

 +Silverlight-compatible WMV

Enhanced Captioning Support:
-----------------------------
Easily create 508 compliant closed and open captions, and help viewers with hearing disabilities or language barriers better understand the content in your video. 

Speech-to-Text Transcription:
-----------------------------
By utilizing Windows Speech Recognition, Camtasia Studio can automatically turn what you say into captions! You can fix anything missed in the transcription. And the more you use it, the better it gets! 

Import/Export Captioning Files:
--------------------------------
Now you can export your audio and get it transcribed into a caption file, then import the transcription back into your video. Itâ€™s perfect if you ever need to translate your captions and localize your videos. 

Create Searchable Video:
-------------------------
Produce videos in Flash or send to Screencast.com and let your viewers jump directly to the content they need! All it takes is a quick search of a word or phrase the presenter said or displayed on a slide in the presentation. 

Integration with Camtasia Relay:
---------------------------------
Harness the editing power of Camtasia Studio in Camtasia Relay! Edit Camtasia Relay videos in Camtasia Studio, then send back to Camtasia Relay for distribution. They play nicely together so your content flows seamlessly from one Camtasia to another. 

iPad Output:
-------------
Produce your Camtasia Studio videos for the iPad with a brand new iPad production preset. Your viewers will thank you while they watch in high-quality, on-the-go.

64-bit Codec Support:
----------------------
With both a 32-bit and 64-bit TSCC codec in Camtasia Studio, youâ€™ll be able to export your recording files to a wider range of 3rd party applications, and keep the high-quality look you love.
