Trying to check it with an anti-virus sw fails - archive is password protected
Very very suspicious"
,djroosta,2011-09-30T17:12Z,"@Oblomow58 - R U n00b?

This is not a virus, it is clean.

People who have the skulls near their name do NOT upload viuses, they are trusted members.

OT: Great Upoad, thanks"

,drgdlss,2011-11-25T06:28Z,"* 

This is an awesome torrent and Camtasia works - no activation issues. 

I'm sure this is not related to the torrent itself but does anyone know why parts of my video result in just a black screen after I process the video with audio? I think it has to do with a Windows 7 drivers thing because it worked perfectly on Vista...

Thanks Chatt!

Many new versions would of course be for windows 7. And of course it will work with win xp and vista but companies are not gonna just stick to those obsolete versions of windows.
Also why don't you just check the techsmith site instead of asking a dumb stupid question"
