Elvis Presley - The 30 Number One Hits CD plus bonus tracks 320k 

I recently bought this CD and have for you converted it to full stereo 320k
mp3 format for you to enjoy. Elvis was the best! 

Program note: as filler material, the CD contained an extra track
called "less conversation - radio mix" - it sounded too different from 
the main stuff on the CD so we give you instead bonus tracks of Elvis
songs that should have been #1 hits just as equally as the ones
that made it onto the list below


God bless!
