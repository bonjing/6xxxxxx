,mstr005,2011-10-02T00:11Z,Hey HolyRoses Thanks so much for the awesome torrent I was wondering how you place a thumbnail preview on the mp4 file. It looks great having that on my xbox and I was hoping to do the same with my other movies Thanks Again!
,sloera,2011-10-09T19:07Z,"awesome upload.  Was wondering, I've been looking for the Queer as Folk television series (U.S. version).  Any possibility you might be able to upload?  There's one other torrent on the site but it has like no seeds and is in .avi format.  It'd be appreciated.  Thanks!"
