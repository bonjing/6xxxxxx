I apologize for the low upload speed. It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.
I see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. 
Ok pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. 
Surely I wont always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it is up to you to help these shares to spread.

If the torrent remains stalled with DHT only, add these trackers (if not just present in the torrent you download):

udp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce

udp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce

This is a collection of video clips found on the web that are related with my other torrent:
   
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6712906/my_private__80s


The numbering sequence of the clips has a gap \'cause I was unable to find a video clip for jethro Tull:
39 - Jethro Tull - Slow Marching Band

Also you will note that there\'s no video for Ironhorse (replaced by 58 - Kim Carnes - Bette Davis Eyes) \'cause \"My Sweet Louise\" wasn\'t a 80\'s song...

I made another \"error\" too... I included 

47 - Gary Numan (Tubeway Army) - Are Friends Electric.mpg

even if I realized later that it was of 1979...
But I guess you wont be disgusted anyway...

Enjoy...
