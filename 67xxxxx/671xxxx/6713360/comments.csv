,animeshdewan,2011-10-08T05:14Z,"Thanks for the info. I did install codec pack 4 but the frame rate is really bad. 
I still wouldn't recommend downloading this.
if it doesn't play in vlc, it probably aint worth dowloading."
,honey_nel,2011-12-22T10:49Z,"That's true. this not worth downloading...!

I tried codec pack too but still it isn't watchable.

@tvd_damon I admire your compression but its not playable so try with another codec next time.."
