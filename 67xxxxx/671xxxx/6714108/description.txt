Bryn Terfel - Something wonderful CD +Bonus tracks (musicfromrizzo)

I first discovered Bryn Terfel on you-tube with a nice rendition
of "Some enchanted evening", and then was most impressed by how
he does another of my most favourite songs (which I often sing
at karaoke bars equally) "If ever I would leave you" (from Camelot)

Ive included this song and one other as a bonus track here from my own
CDs at 320k
