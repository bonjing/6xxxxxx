ps I bet tomorrow you could skip hawk& dove 2...
can I put in an early request for Sweet Tooth 26?
you the man, Mr. Dt"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-04T18:52Z,"Ill keep an eye out for it - I will be skipping MOST of the #2's to be honest. Ill be following a few of them, but other than Batman & friends - Im switching to Marvel"
[V],mirrormaster82,2011-10-04T23:59Z,"Oh,don't skip up #2's,while I agree most 50 percent is not that great you should give them a chance,at least 'till issue 3...don't go and bail to Marvel...although their issues will be better when this shit called fear itself finishes.I've seen that we'll get fear itself 7.1,7.2 and 7.3 and god knows what else.How lame is that?"
,BatDinger,2011-10-05T01:23Z,"beside red skull incarnate and kick-ass, marvel is a huge bummer lately.

meanwhile, animal man and swamp thing are quickly becoming my new favorite series. men of war, deathstroke, cap atom, mr terriffic, firestorm, resurrection man, suicide squad, and superboy are all pretty good too. its only natural that theres a few turds.

Also, ill scan #2 of animal man, swampy, AC and DC if theyre not up by after class"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-05T03:01Z,Ill still be following about half of them through #2 and probably a third permanently. But spending my time catching up on Marvel.
