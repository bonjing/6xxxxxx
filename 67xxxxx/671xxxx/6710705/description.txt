Winrar complete version & totally working forever


WinRAR

WinRAR is commercial software available for Microsoft Windows. It is the only graphical tool that can write modern RAR files (RAR version 3). WinRAR's command line equivalent, RAR, is also commercial software available for Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, MS-DOS, OS/2, and FreeBSD. Additionally, the unrar tool from the same distributor can be used on the aforementioned platforms to extract RAR files but not to write them.

Roshal created the RAR file format and developed programs for packing and unpacking RAR files, originally for DOS in 1993, which were later ported to other platforms. The main Windows version of the archiver, known as WinRAR, is distributed as trialware, requiring payment after 40 days (although it can still be used after this period, albeit with nags[citation needed]); shareware versions of this program are also available for GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, DOS, OS/2, and FreeBSD, though they are all called simply "RAR".

RARLAB distributes the source code and binaries for a freeware command-line "unrar" program, although it is not under a free software license. This program can only decompress/extract, not create RAR files.
