,RC_Ebooks,2011-10-25T18:57Z,"Damn, you people are fucking stupid! All night, there were 2-4 seeders and after 8am there are now 35 seeders! How STUPID are you idiots on the damned net, downloading when awake instead of while asleep? JUST FUCKING DUMB!"
,stealingmusic,2011-10-30T06:02Z,RE: RC_Ebooks. The seeders are from dozens of different time zones- Your 8am is a lot of peoples 3am. Showing your ignorance is never cool

Probably as stupid as some internet douchebag tough guy who comes on to call people stupid. Get a life bozo"
,Pendaws,2011-12-13T08:08Z,Thank you for making this available. :)
,Online.Pirate,2012-05-07T13:09Z,"Exactly right..
It is currently 9:09pm here, I have family living in Denver and it is 5:09am there.

So here I am starting my download before bed with people across the world awaking in a short while"
,Online.Pirate,2012-05-07T13:11Z,"Not to mention, people in your own time zone might be starting their downloads ""after 8am"" because they are heading to work for the day and are leaving their downloads to run while at work."
