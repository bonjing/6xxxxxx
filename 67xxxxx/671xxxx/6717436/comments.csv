,SwimclubOphelia,2011-10-04T21:15Z,#04 is the clean pop cheese version of the Roxette classic. I RECOMMEND Reflexion's cover on MHRC #380.

,SwimclubOphelia,2011-10-04T21:41Z,Same goes for #10 (Danger Zone) on this compilation. Check out Jettblock on MHRC #448 for some nice guitar work on the material or go straight up to MHRC #390 for Midnite Club's interpretation. Especially their intro is atmospheric beyond beautiful.
