,virus.app,2011-10-18T09:31Z,"gokstad.. i am not sure how it works in the pc world. i think u have got to format ur hard drive to a format that mkes it bootable. then restore the iso file into the bootable drive u just made. connect it, boot from it.. u can try this on your phones memory card(8 gb and above should work i think) or a flash drive first. just a suggestion cos formatting deletes everything on ur drive."

If you check in system, it will show Windows is Activated and have a product ID number. This shows PERMANENT activation. (No time/trial periods). 
@jdinh071. How are you navigating into Windows Update?  You will need to click start button, click control panel, then click action centre, then Windows Update in the left pane, near the bottom. The KB971033 update is very close to the bottom of the list. Hope this helps."
,Malasky,2011-11-03T23:39Z,"@jdinh071. Just to clarify. You will need to UNINSTALL the update first, before carrying out the rest of the procedure. When you have finished the procedure, go back into Windows Update, and you should find that the update is ready to be installed. This is when you right click it and select HIDE."

I downloaded this and burned it as a bootable image file. I got to the Windows install, and before the ""Expanding Windows Files"" even hit 2%, it gave me an error. I forgot to write down the exact details, unfortunately, but it said that some file could not be located. To restart the installation.

When I tried, the Hard Disk was no longer showing. I'm not sure what I did, but after fighting with it for 45 minutes it shows up again.

I want to try the install again, but I figure I'll just encounter that error again, and I'd rather not battle with the HD if I don't have to. Does anyone know what causes this error?

I saw the note about having two or more drives hooked up in the instructions; I only have a single SATA drive hooked up, which is the same type of drive this computer came with (My last Hard Disk suffered a miserable death. I'm trying to install Windows 7 on the new one). I burned at the lowest (2x) speed. Did the disc just not burn correctly?

Any help would be appreciated."

,Rubiksfaq,2011-12-17T07:24Z,"This torrent works for me

1.) Make sure to avoid the KB971033 update
2.) Put no Windows Product Key in when the installation asks for it (Windows is preactivated)
3.) DON'T LET WINDOWS UPDATE ITSELF!! Manual updates are the best (so you see what you're downloading)

Otherwise, this torrent/windows 7 seems to work.

Enjoy!"

1. Burn it to dvd or usb. For usb i used a program from here: http://www.isotousb.com/ Its free. Takes a long time and you might think it is not responding but give it a time. If you want to check if it is doing the job than just see properties of your usb stick. Used space will be expanding.
2.Disconnect form internet and start installation.
3. DO NOT ENTER activation code and UNTICK the box for activating when online.
3. Choose option to configure windows settings later.
4. After windows installed connect to the internet. 
5. Go to windows update and choose ""never check for updates""
6. Then press check for updates. You will see around 70 available updates. Make sure you untick Update KB971033. This update was specifically designed to identify windows bypassing activation. In my version it was unticked already, dont know why.
7. Press install updates.
Thats it. If you do everything correctly you wont have any problems."

With regards to updates: they come in 2 parts. When you press ""check for updates"" for the first time yo get around 70 important updates and 60 optional. Optional are mainly language packs. Once again do not forget to untick KB971033 but it may be unticked already. Then just hide this update so it doesnt come up again. To hide it press right click and choose hide.

,itcooleagles,2011-12-24T20:36Z,"READ THIS IF YOU'RE HAVING GENUINE ISSUES!!! PLEASE!! FFS!!!

This is, hands down, probably the best torrent on thepiratebay. You're all making it much harder than it needs to be.

First of all, this torrent comes with a few different files, not just the iso. Burn the iso to your DVD and that's your boot disc - simple as cake. THEN take the loader zip and store it on an SD card or somewhere safe. Even a regular CD should work. It's super small.

Anyone having issues with the copy not being ""genuine"" simply must've ignored the loader file already included. I did. An easy mistake. But no worries. Even if you install KB971033 (the Windows update that finds exploits in pirated copies of Windows), you can STILL use the loader included in this torrent in order to make Windows think that the copy is genuine. And the process is very simple.

Now. The info file in the loader claims that it's ""KB971033 ready"", so I have NO idea why everyone is making a big deal about the update. This loader shouldn't have an issue with the update. But, if you wanna be extra sure, go ahead and uninstall the update and be sure to NOT update KB971033. It's worthless anyone. *shrug*

After you've installed Windows, EVEN IF IT DETERMINES THAT IT'S GENUINE OR NOT,  just unzip that loader and start up the application inside. Let it make the recommended selection it feels it needs to (So wait 30 seconds). You don't have to do anything. It will reboot your computer a couple times (after the first reboot Windows may ask you for a product code. Just say ""Ask me later."") and then BAM, you're good to go. Legit as hell. Don't over-complicate things."

,dysphunktion,2012-01-22T02:31Z,"@x0myheart0,

If Ubuntu is the only operating system currently installed can use various disk partitioning utilities from inside of Ubuntu and create another partition to install Windows to. Once you do that you will have to reconfigure your bootloader (Grub, lilo, etc) in order for it to correctly allow booting of either system.
As for backing up your pictures and what not, you sure can. You can create a partition for your backup, copy them to a cd/dvd, external HD, thumb drive or even upload them to a filehosting website. Lots of options there!"
,dysphunktion,2012-01-22T02:32Z,"@glassware:

You will first want to backup anything you want to keep. Then you will simply download this ISO and use your favorite ISO burning utility to burn it as a bootable ISO. Then you simply boot from the CD and install!
I simplified it a bit but that is pretty much the gist of it!"

Some help from kadavul or someone who can help, please. 

If the vague instruction of ""Choose the third option for next step."" is referring to not allowing windows to automatically install updates, then should've really been highlighted and made much clearer, because it is the most important instruction in all the listed steps, which lots of people already know. Just my 2 cents really."
,betengan,2012-02-04T04:24Z,"Ok, for the ""not genuine"" problem, I found that the following instructions by Malasky were very helpful: summary, uninstall windows update KB971033 and make sure that you have control over what updates to install, and always uncheck / avoid that one. But there's a bit below just to make sure:

Malasky at 2011-10-30 13:04 CET:
For anyone having trouble with the ""Not Genuine"" nags, try this.
1. Migrate to windows update and uninstall Update KB971033.
2. Open an elevated command prompt (ie click start, type CMD in seach box, right click cmd, select run as administrator).
3. Type the following in command promt: slmgr -rearm. (Leave a space between the r and the -, but no space between the - and r of rearm).
Hit enter and exit command prompt.
4. Re-boot TWICE.
Works on Win 7 Build 7600 onwards. You can now set desktop backgrounds etc as normal and ""not genuine"" notices should be a thing of the past.
Malasky at 2011-10-30 13:09 CET:

,HalloweenJack,2012-04-18T09:05Z,"Hi,

Thanks very much for this.

I have had it on my desk top since Nov. However once a month it tells me it is not genuine and i have to use the slmgr -rearm to get another 30 days.

Apparently you can only do this 4 times and I'm on my last.

Has anyone else had this? I removed  KB971033 months ago and I still get this. Some people say it is like an non-activated version, all you are doing is extending a trial.

Also I have just put it on a 2nd hand laptop I just got. I started it with 'check with me before installing updates option.'

After it had installed I checked and it had already installed  KB971033 and one other update without asking. I guess that happened to my other PC. So I guess I'll have the same problem again.

Does anyone know how to either get around this rearm issue now, or to install without getting it in the first place?

Cheers"

All works fine till I run HAL7600, then I'm told I need one of the following versions of the .NET framework

v4.0.30319

Any idea?"

,roy2646,2012-04-24T22:57Z,"haissst! It's not just as simple as that. You have to install first .net framework 4 that you have downloaded and try using HAL7600. If it doesn't work you have to remove the previous stuff that you installed in order to use your OS. When it is now already fresh and your OS came back to its previous state as a trial version, that will be the right time to use HAL7600. Now there's a conflict between your previous stuff that you installed and HAL7600 that's why it did not work."

,HalloweenJack,2012-04-25T07:05Z,"Hey thanks Roy,

That sounds a bit beyond me though... uninstalling the previous stuff and all that.

I had other issues anyway so I decided to do a fresh install, so quick these days, so I'm up and running again.

I'm hoping I know what went wrong the first time. so for anyone who's wondering:

When you install this version of Win7 (64 Ultimate for me) it actually installs the KB971033 and one other update from the disk, without connecting to internet. I didn't think this was made clear.

If you install disconnected from the net, once it's finished then uninstall KB971033. 

Then hide it, reconnect and install the others.

I also found that at one point, during the updates i think, it changes your update setting to automatic, so beware of that. 

Incidentally, are there any other updates to avoid?

Thanks a lot for your help Roy, and thx to the uploader.

:)"
,Magestrix,2012-04-27T11:46Z,"WORKAROUND: Get it working once and for all.
1. Make sure you get Windows 7 back to 30 days demo mode.
2. Use Windows 7 Loader (SLIC / KEY), if under a laptop and comfortable - flash bios with key if it works first, otherwise softmod windows.
3. Restart and you are ready for fun.."
,HalloweenJack,2012-04-28T08:03Z,"Thanks Mag, but I din't quite understand: do you mean there are 2 types of loader I can use a key or a SLIC. One is used bt flashing BIOS and the other just executes in windows? This may be beyond me.


How do I tell if it's in 30 day mode?

Is that what this download gives you?

If I go to control panel / system there is no licence section saying genuine or OEM, or anything saying i have to activate in 30 days. What does actually mean?

Also, another app has said I don't have Framenet 4. How should I get this? Is it in a update I haven't got yet? Or can I just download it from here?

Ah, so many questions... sorry. Hope you can help though as I'd like to get this sorted.
