By using the blood of the Okumura brothers, Ernst opens a massive gate to Gehenna and drops a weapon of mass destruction in an attempt to anihilate it.

Uploader Notes:
============
The size of the files are very small and anyone will surely think that this is very bad quality. Well, it is not. Speedy Joe's files are all 'mp4' format and so the videos are good even in small files. If you ask me, I would give this a rating of 10 in Audio and 8 in Video. For best results, use VLC Player.
