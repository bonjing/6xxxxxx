Chicago tenor saxophonist Keefe Jackson takes his musical cues from the free bop
and approximate note theorems of Ornette Coleman to create fresh music in the
modern jazz tradition. Alongside trombonist Jeb Bishop, Jackson is able to hold
interest with his witty, heady, progressive music that knows few boundaries and
swings like mad. Crazy free bop, fast, loud, or bluesy, defines the sound
Jackson carves and crafts alongside the ever potent Bishop, the exceptional
bassist Jason Roebke, and drummer Noritaka Tanaka. "Maker" and "Turns to
Everything," with their craggy melody lines and challenging, pervasive grooves,
provide telling moments for this type of new wave, youth-oriented creative
jazz. It's directly related to what is happening -- politically and culturally
-- in Chi-Town, with Keefe Jackson at the musical center of that churning
vortex.
