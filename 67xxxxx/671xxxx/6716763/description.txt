All Hallows' Moon (Dramatized)by Thomas E. Fuller 
Performed by Bill Jackson, Dena Friedman, Trudy Leonard 
Length: 58 minutes

The setting is the Old West: Mother Lode, New Mexico. A handful of people, drovers, saloon girls, a barkeep, a preacher and a sheriff, wait in a saloon on a stormy Halloween night. They wait for the dawn, when they will go their separate ways, and Mother Lode will truly become a ghost town.

But the storm brings the unexpected arrival of a girl who might or might not be from Boston, a gun fighter who might or might not be dead, and a gambler who might or might not be the Devil.

This is an original, full-cast, soundscaped audio dramatization of an occult Western.
