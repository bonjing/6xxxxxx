Descriptions and illustrations of todays most visionary combat aircraft designs are published for the first time. The authors examine how such world events as the end of the Cold War and the challenges of recent small-scale conflicts have triggered the likelihood in the 21st century of stealthy special forces, trimaran aircraft carriers, and silent airships acting as spies in the sky.
