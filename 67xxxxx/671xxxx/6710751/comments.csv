,nordic45,2011-09-30T01:53Z,Why do you upload 1 and 1 song????
[T],TvFreak,2011-09-30T02:08Z,if you only want 1 song.
[V],vtwin88cube,2011-09-30T02:36Z,"@amarcool...if anyone wants just one of the songs they can already do that in their bit torrent client. Besides that you're uploading music tha'st already up.

For example....http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6451529/Adele_-_21_%28Limited_Edition_CD-Rip__320kbps_Bonus_Cov%29_%5BPRIME%5D this upload by Prime has over 6500 + seeders. 

We appreciate your contribution, but please just put the entire CD up at once. Thanks. Keep at it."
[T],TvFreak,2011-09-30T03:19Z,ok Sorry :-/ Will do that.
