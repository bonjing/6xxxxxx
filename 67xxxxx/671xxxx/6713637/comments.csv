,bigdump,2011-10-02T05:03Z,"the blu ray versions of the godfather films are only available in the restored format.... think about it for a minute, why would there be two versions released on blu ray when no changes were made...??"
,McNova100,2011-11-14T22:49Z,are the subtitles included in this movie?
,virtualmatrix258,2012-01-11T16:02Z,Bad quality.
,virtualmatrix258,2012-01-12T03:30Z,"I take that back, it's good quality I just had a bad download. I downloaded it again and it cleared up big time. +1"
,Ypsi_Boy,2012-02-20T12:57Z,thanks great movie
,kneel23,2012-02-29T00:36Z,"So this is great movie - great quality - I +1'ed. However I must comment on a minor caveat which is quite ludicrous IMOHO.  This is an English-only audio copy. There is a Subtitles file included, also English.  I assumed ""great! subtitles for the few tiny parts where they speak Italian"".  NOPE!! English subtitles for an English movie. And the Italian parts?  NO subtitle text during those parts.  So I must ask. ""Why?""  *sigh*"
,ewjbtz,2012-02-29T00:57Z,"English subs for the spoken Italian scenes

,kneel23,2012-02-29T01:03Z,"UPDATE - @ewjbtz I know that, read the comment again.  i was asking WHY WEREN'T there subtitles for the italian-spoken parts.  
HOWEVER: I commented too soon, it is only some of the parts in the beginning like when he is in Louis Restaurant (very important part though) that there is no english subs for the italian parts. -- I see now that MOST of the other italian parts of the movie are indeed subbed in english, just not all of them - Oh well. Still an excellent movie and excellent rip - no worries here."
,kneel23,2012-02-29T01:05Z,"Argh i hate not being able to edit comments on here :)   Anyway @ewjbtz nevermind i see you did post some other subtitles, but its mostly OK anyway just one or two parts that dont have them, otherwise the included subs are fine"
,ewjbtz,2012-02-29T03:00Z,"kneel23 - Subtitles are for the non-English parts only and includes the dialogue at Louis restaurant that is not in the included subs.
