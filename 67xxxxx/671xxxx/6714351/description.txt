Quote:
From the author of the "Ivan Monk" detective novels comes a riveting original graphic novel about violence and race in modern society.
COWBOYS revolves around a racially motivated police shooting of Deke Kotto, a young African American man, by Tim Brady, a white undercover cop, inside a swanky club frequented by hip-hop stars, gangsters, Hollywood celebs and the drug kingpins that finance the whole operation. But the victim is actually an undercover officer on the trail of the gangsters, caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.
