If Natalie Cole didn't have a famous father, would anyone listen to her stylish but safe renditions of 40-year-old standards? Well, the devotees of the genre would, for Cole has a light, satiny voice with marvelous fluidity. What she doesn't have is much of a bottom range or a hard edge, and she lacks the boldness to radically alter famous songs. Stardust, returns to the proven formula of 1991's Unforgettable, which sold 9 million copies and won seven Grammies. Once again, the engineers create a vocal duet between the dead father and the ambitious daughter, this time on "When I Fall in Love," and even splice Nat's 1961 organ solo on "Let's Face the Music and Dance" into Natalie's 1996 version.

Allmusic Review:
Continuing her successful foray into the American songbook, Natalie Cole served as executive producer on her third album of pop standards. Eighteen selections, including works by Hoagy Carmichael and songs associated with Nat, Ella, Sarah, and Dinah. Big-band orchestration and a trumpet solo by Wynton Marsalis on "He Was Too Good to Me." Guest players include Fourplay, Everette Harp, George Duke, and John Pizzarelli. Cole originally recorded Nat's "When I Fall in Love" ballad on her Everlasting album. Here she does a duet with dad Ã  la "Unforgettable." She also closes the album with a solo version sung in Spanish.
