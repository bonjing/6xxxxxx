,dlarrym1111,2011-10-17T04:18Z,"@ all who are putting Jim Carrey Down as an Actor. . . 1st) Don't like, then don't watch or download for that matter. 2nd) He is a really good actor and I like his NON comedy movies like:

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)

The number 23 (2007)

Man on the Moon (1999)

-note- it is about the life of Andy Kaufman who was a comedian form the 70's Saturday Night Live era and although this film may have some ""funny"" scenes, It is anything but funny. It is a tragic story of Andy Kauffman who was his own worse enemy. Some call him a genius, some say he just was nuts.
This movie reminded me of a movie with Dustin Hoffman called LENNY.  If you liked LENNY (1974), (A movie about the life of comedian LENNY BRUCE with Dustin Hoffman playing Lenny Bruce), you might like MAN ON THE MOON. . . If you have never seen LENNY, It is a GREAT film. You should check it out.
Another very cool movie about LENNY BRUCE, that is more of a true documentary about LENNY BRUCE then the 74' Dustin Hoffman film, check out:
Lenny Bruce Without Tears (1972);
A view into the life of an awesome comedian that was WAY ahead of his time. Sadly he died at the young age of 40 from a Heroin Overdose in his apartment in Los Angeles in 1966.
For more info check this out: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenny_Bruce

@ All the ones slamming Hindi films. I to honestly haven't seen any Hindi films that I liked, but what is all the hate about?? Lastly;

THIS FILM,  Mr. Popper's PENGUINS,  is NOT a HINDI film, so what even set off all this Hindi talk in the 1st place????

I downloaded this for my nephew and in that context, it is a really good movie. Quality is great as it usually is from SaM - A10/ V10
