-------------Massively Exhaustive Jane Austen Collection-------------
Thus far I've released 20 torrents that are, to various degrees, complete. However, as I started to work on older authors I found that the real diversity is in all the different versions that exist. Therefore, this is my second try at an EXHAUSTIVE collection, as opposed to a complete one.

1. Checked for completeness. Most of the versions were ripped by ME, but the ones from the internet were checked.

2. Equalized volume. Many audio books, especially ones digitized from cassette tapes, have crazily varying volumes. I have equalized volumes so there shouldn't be any sudden jumps.

3. FULLY CHAPTERIZED. This took many weeks. Each audio book was compiled into a single file (deleting bits like "this concludes disc 2, please insert disc 3") and then separated into Parts and Chapters as defined by the original books. I find this to be the best way to enjoy audiobooks and it is perfect for iPods.

4. Dehissed and noise-cleaned. When needed, I performed low pass filters and deleted pops in the audio.

5. Encoded all books to a uniform MP3 96kbps 44.1kHz.

6. ID3 Tagged. All audio book files have been fully ID3 tagged including full COVER ART.

And so I present this nearly 18gb torrent of Austen goodness. I have included every single version of every single unabridged Jane Austen audiobook I could find in high quality spanning the internet and over 80 libraries. This torrent was a labor of love and took many weeks of preparation so I hope people will be excited to hear these classics read by such excellent and diverse readers. This is the second of several massively exhaustive torrents that I intend to upload.

I consider this torrent to be celebration not only of Jane Austen, but of most of the best audiobook narrators in the world. The performances range from very good past excellent to downright incredible.

Please leave any comments, questions, or suggestions you might have as they are HIGHLY APPRECIATED! :)

Enjoy!
