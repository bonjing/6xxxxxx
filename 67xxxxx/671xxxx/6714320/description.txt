Based on an original screenplay by Director Lee Sales and actors Francis Pope and
George Russo, Turnout is set in Hoxton, East London where all 3 grew up. Our story
follows George and Sophie, they're saving money to go on their first holiday together,
the deposit is paid, and they have two weeks left to pay the outstanding balance of
?2,000. Sophie has entrusted George with her holiday savings and is keen to settle
the debt with the travel agents. The only trouble is, unbeknown to Sophie, George is
flat broke. In a vain attempt to raise cash, George uses Sophie's holiday money to
fund an ill judged deal.
