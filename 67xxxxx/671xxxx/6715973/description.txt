"Shingen" (ä¿¡çŽ„ï½žSHINGEN)  March 11, 2011

Logan tells Kikyo he doesn't have time for a fight, and is let to pass by Kikyo who won't fight a weakened opponent. 
Once Logan makes his way, Hideki Kurohagi announces himself and Logan throws the dart at him. The dart is stopped 
when it impacts a force field around Kurohagi. He remarks that Kikyo was hired to kill Logan, but with another 
assassin on the payroll, he is abstaining from the job. Hideki unleashes an upgraded version of Vadhaka on Logan 
leading to a fight between the two killing machines. As Logan is taking a beating from a more powerful Vadhaka, 
he uses all his strength to get out a being crushed by Vadhaka's foot. But with all his effort Logan is still 
losing and is taking a severe attack by Vadhaka. When Vadhaka rams into Logan, the wall around them collapses. 
Koh and the others meet with Yukio and an angry Kurohagi calls for his robot, Vadhaka. As Kurohagi orders his 
men to fire on the intruders, Kikyo arrives and disarms them stating that it was dishonorable and he couldn't 
abide it. Logan escapes the rubble and heals his wounds to proceed fighting, but as he does, so does Vadhaka. 
Vadhaka moves towards Logan, and smacks Min out of his way. As he is fighting, Kikyo helps even the odds. 
Yukio tries to keep Min alive, but dies in her arms saying that Kurohagi must be stopped. 
Enraged, Kikyo uses his WindBlade attack, with no effect. Logan tries to think of a weak point on Vadhaka, 
Kikyo in agreement draws a second sword from his other arm to use. Logan grabs a spear previously shot, 
and impales the head of Vadhaka.
