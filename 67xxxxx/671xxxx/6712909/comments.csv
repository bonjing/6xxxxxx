Thanks for the upload though. The sound quality twords the last couple tracks gets pretty rough, but other than that not bad."
,1RzGodz,2011-10-01T06:54Z,Yeah i know. Unofficial was meant to be taken as fan made. I cant really change it now (Wont let me edit the stupid thing) And about the sound quality it's amazing for me i don't know if there is any problem with the torrent file or if it's on your end I am not sure. Ill look into it. 
,x79animal,2011-10-31T16:02Z,Doesnt contain any of the punk goes pop 4 songs. Its mainly punk goes pop 3 with some other ones added.
