,DJBigal,2011-10-02T11:16Z,65 Mb ... better quality ... Come on !  I have this album at 320 kbps (THAT IS THE ''BETTER QUALITY'') and it's 136 Mb ... 65 Mb ...   This must be an other transcode (Do you know what is a transcode?) LOL ...

Have you opened those files in some kind of sound editor? I`m NOT SAYING its BETTER KBPS. I`m saying EVERY copy on the net got its peaks cut because of TOO LOUD AUDIO SIGNAL. Its oversampled or how u call it. I`ve just uploaded 192kbps version with minimum advancement in quality. (and sorry for my english). hope we understand each other."
