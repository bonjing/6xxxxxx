Well this is an updated version of the initial 11.10 preview release

What's new :

better Vista compatibility support
more mobility products are now supported

as the title of this file is exactly the same i decided to add "updated"
at the end of this new one for avoid confusion with previous first one initial release.
checked and tested as well after having reviewed complete file folder after
driver's extraction to be sure.
And i confirm : it is really a new updated version anyway.
This file comes directly from official AMD download link.
100 % untouched except for the name of the file as described a little bit up more so.

Enjoy

a very nice day to all with my best regards
