,charincol,2011-10-03T01:11Z,"Why is this 20.41 MB, when the official release, which is here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6716971/Latest_iXtreme_and_Stock_Firmware_Pack.rar is only 12.1 MB?"
,x5452-EO,2011-10-03T11:27Z," ""  This firmware is =NOT FOR USE IN A CONSOLE= and is provided 
 with the intended use of being in a dedicated ""ripping"" drive. ""

So, if my console is flashed with ixtreme 1.92, would i be able to play an XBGD3 that was ripped by a drive flashed with 2.0 ???

did i understand!?"
,x5452-EO,2011-10-03T13:05Z,"aha, know i get it, i think !!!

if you only want to play xbgd3 games that you download and burn, then all you have to do is to flash your console to lt+ 2.0

BUT

if you want to copy your friends original xbgd3, then you have to flash a separate drive with IXtreme 3.0 0800 firmware to be able to do so and make an ISO out of it."
,mrnexus,2011-10-04T03:11Z,"@sunblock/could u please explain what u mean by this m8 This firmware is =NOT FOR USE IN A CONSOLE= and is provided 
 with the intended use of being in a dedicated ""ripping"" drive.

 This means: 
 	a. Does not need your DVD key, 
	b. Does not need spoofing as another drive,
 	c. Does not need to use the tray half open and
	d. Does not need to use the activate.iso to use this firmware on the pc.
i will be waiting for an answer as iam confused as to what u mean."

but a great download anyway"
,leev211,2011-10-04T13:36Z,"@mrnexus all the newest firmware are included in this d/l the 0800 firmware is for loading onto a drive that is going to be a dedicated ripping drive (connected to a pc at all times) your pc wont require a dvd key

the ltplus 2.0 is the firmware you need for the 360 drive for XGD3 
if you are unsure on how to use these firmware i would suggest taking the 360 to someone who does cause it's really easy to mess up your drive if you are unsure"
,mrnexus,2011-10-10T21:58Z,"@levv211/thks m8 for the info,ive found some great tutorials on teamx site so i hope i dont mess up my drive"
,klvsa,2011-10-18T02:05Z,"Your xbox's dvd drive can serve two purposes. 1- to play games 
2 - to connect to your pc to rip games

if you're only going to be playing games then you will flash your drive with lt2.0 firmware to allow it to read copied game data from a dl-dvdr.
if you intend to rip a game then you need to flash your drive with the 0800 3.0 firmware in order for windows to detect it as a drive that you then use to rip a retail xbox disc.

ideally you should have two drives, otherwise you'll be doing a lot of flashing in between ripping and playing

HOPE THAT CLARIFIES THINGS"
