Thank you CREATOR, u-p-l-o-a-d-e-r. and SEEDERS

Extract the rar file for the crack, then run the 

crack __  Crack.exe __ IT WILL PLACE THE FILE 

W7MPCL.dll ____ IN THE SAME FOLDER. After 

you install Windows 7 manager. Then copy the 

file W7MPCL.dll to the same directory you 

installed it the default is C:\Program 

Files\Yamicsoft and REPLACE THE OLD ONE.

Nor run Windows 7 manager and all is O.K.
