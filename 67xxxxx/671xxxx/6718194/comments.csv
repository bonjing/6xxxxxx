,DubbelJohsss,2012-02-22T12:55Z,"Thank you. Idiot proof installation - works 100%.

Of course there is no need for crack with auto mount... You will have several fixes + no need for CD/mount with these patches:

,Epicfrozen,2012-04-04T06:54Z,"Also in case anyone is wondering the 1158 error with the other one is a .ini file empty in the ISO, ( It contains all the english language to display in the setup ) So this one contains a nice fresh ISO, "
,sanseb99,2012-04-10T04:07Z,works great!!
,rakhie,2012-05-14T19:40Z,plz someone tell me in detail hw to install this...
,ezelboy1000,2012-05-21T19:51Z,"1. You'll need a mounting program like MagicDisk, PowerISO or Daemon tools.
2. First download this torrent IF you don't have age of empires III installed:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6263475/AGE_OF_EMPIRES_III_COMPLETE_COLLECTION___SERIAL
3. Mount the .ISO file (instructions on official site of your mounting program)
    If you don't have Age of Empires III installed mount 'AOE III Disk 1.iso' first then run the setup, when asked for disk 2 mount disk 2 etc.
4. Now you can install the warchiefs expansion (the .iso file from the original torrent didn't work properly) 
5. If you want you can install Asian Dynasties expansion as well

(correct me if I'm wrong :)"
