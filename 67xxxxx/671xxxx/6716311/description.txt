You Can't Take It With You (1938) Adapted from the Pulitzer Prize-winning play of the same name by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart. The cast includes James Stewart, Jean Arthur, Lionel Barrymore and Edward Arnold.

The movie won two Academy Awards from seven nominations: Best Picture and Best Director for Frank Capra.

Plot

Alice (Jean Arthur), the only relatively normal member of the eccentric Sycamore family, falls in love with Tony Kirby (James Stewart). His wealthy banker father, Anthony P. Kirby (Edward Arnold), and his snobbish mother (Mary Forbes), strongly disapprove of the match. When the Kirbys are invited to dinner to become better acquainted with their future in-laws, things do not turn out the way Alice had hoped.
