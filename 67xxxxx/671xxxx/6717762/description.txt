From Wiki:

The Cash Brothers are a Canadian alternative country/folk rock duo, consisting of brothers Andrew and Peter Cash.

Prior to the creation of The Cash Brothers, Andrew and Peter Cash both had established careers as songwriters and musicians. Andrew was a member of the bands L'Ã‰tranger and Ursula, and a solo artist, and Peter was a member of Skydiggers. Although their careers were closely connected (Skydiggers, in fact, often played as Andrew's backing band at the Spadina Hotel), they never wrote or performed together as a duo.

In 1996, however, the brothers both left their previous bands, and started writing and performing as a duo. Their debut album as The Cash Brothers, Raceway, was released in 1999.
