,adi11110000,2011-12-29T12:28Z,hey djaligator14 i have a problem the problem is that fifa doesnt run but i have followed all of your steps
,CheezyBob,2012-01-09T10:48Z,It said origin not installed. I got origin but now it says you have to activate it. How? It says you need product key and if you don't have it you need to buy it. How to play the game without buying the product key?
