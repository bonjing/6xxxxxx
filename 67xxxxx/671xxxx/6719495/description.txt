POtHS Comments on This one......... Excellent


Description:

Creation Is A Scientific Fact:
45 minute documentary on the scientific fact of creation.

Most of the pseudo-atheists that prop up their agnosticism (posturing as atheism) by positing scientific consensus on things like Darwinism retreat to donning aluminum haberdashery when confronted with the evidence from physics. Sorry fellas, time and space had a beginning and there's no evidence for atheism.  Everything that begins to exist has a cause.The universe began to exist. Therefore the universe has a cause.

Why couldn't natural forces have produced the universe? Because there was no nature and there were no natural forces ontologically prior to the Big Bangâ€”nature itself was created at the Big Bang. That means the cause of the universe must be something beyond natureâ€”something we would call supernatural. It also means that the supernatural cause of the universe must at least be:

spaceless because it created space
timeless because it created time
immaterial because it created matter
powerful because it created out of nothing
intelligent because the creation event and the universe was precisely designed
personal because it made a choice to convert a state of nothing into something (impersonal forces dont make choices).

Darwin's Deadly Legacy:
This informative video provides a chilling look at the social consequences of Darwin's theory of evolution.
The documentary connects the dots between Darwin and the deeds of Adolf Hitler. It is hosted by Dr. D. James Kennedy and features 14 scholars, scientists, and authors, including Ian Taylor, Lee Strobel, Jonathan Wells, and Michael Behe.

Reviewer's comments:

Other interesting dots to connect would be the fact that it was actually a Jesuit (Bernhard Stempfle) who wrote Mein Kampf (My Struggle).[1] And the Jesuits teach this Darwinian Humanism in their schools. The Nazis were founded by the Catholic Teutonic Knight's Thule Society.[2]

It appears what happened in Germany was the Christians of Germany had the Theory of Evolution forced upon them at this time. Prior to the war the country was of mixed Christianity (Catholic & Protestant). The Jesuits use the Darwinian Humanism for their Marxist anti religion Counter-Reformation against the Bible. There are other videos of the Nazis burning school books filled with Christian truth.

From Darwin to Hitler

In this compelling and painstakingly researched work of intellectual history, Richard Weikart explains the revolutionary impact Darwinism had on ethics and morality. He demonstrates that many leading Darwinian biologists and social thinkers in Germany believed that Darwinism overturned traditional Judeo-Christian and Enlightenment ethics, especially those pertaining to the sacredness of human life. Many of these thinkers supported moral relativism, yet simultaneously exalted evolutionary "fitness" (especially in terms of intelligence and health) as the highest arbiter of morality. Weikart concludes that Darwinism played a key role not only in the rise of eugenics, but also in euthanasia, infanticide, abortion, and racial extermination, all ultimately embraced by the Nazis.

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.


RAPtURE (My transportation outta here).

The Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe That The Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)

In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed..

"And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.

"Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...

May Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed Long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.
