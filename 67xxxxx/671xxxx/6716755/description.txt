The Dunwich Horror (Dramatized)by H. P. Lovecraft , Thomas E. Fuller 
Narrated by Thomas E. Fuller, Bill Jackson, John Johnson 
Dramatized by The Atlanta Radio Theatre Company

Ah, the sweet, sweet singing of the whip-poor-wills. Surely one of the most innocent, purest bird songs one can know, plaintive and perfect in the clean morning light. Unless, of course, you happen to live near the decayed New England village of Dunwich. Unless, of course, you have seen the mad fires blazing from the ancient stone circles atop Sentinel Mountain. And unless, of course, you remember the horrible events of 70 years ago and happen to be familiar with the name "Whately". Then the singing of whip-poor-wills isn't so sweet, and their patient waiting seems anything but innocent.

This is a full-cast, soundscaped audio dramatization of a classic work by one of the masters of horror.
