Now all the missiles have smoke except the AIM-120 (the real one doesn't leave a smoke, or it's too thin to be seen) and everything is good!


Have a Falcon day!"

THIS MOD IS A MULTIPLAYER CRITICAL, SO ALL WHO WANT TO PLAY ONLINE SHOULD HAVE IT, OTHERWISE ONLY THOSE WHO HAVE IT INSTALLED WILL GET BETTER RESULTS, SO IT MAY BE UNFAIR FOR THE OTHERS!



Cheers!

Have a Falcon day!"
,FalconnerF16,2011-10-04T02:31Z,"I also forgot to mention that the F-14, MIG-29 and SU-27/30/33/37 can perform cobra manoeuvres, the F-22 can perform power loops and the F-18 super hornet can hold higher AOA's, closer to the real one! These are available when CAT III is active (USING ANOTHER CAT CONFIGURATION WAS THE EASIEST WAY TO MAKE THEM HAVE THESE FEATURES).

The Tomcat does it even more realistic now with the advanced flight model offered by BMS.

Many thanks to all of the people who worked for Open Falcon and BMS all of these years (more than a decade), making Falcon a better sim day after day!

Many thanks to MAV-JP and his colleagues for the initial .dat files, and now, for the better and amazing advanced flight model .dat files which have tremendously increased the data capability of many models, thus making them as realistic as they can possibly be...!


Now the only difference were some values in some dat files, which I'm now convinced that with this mod, they have a better value and are much closer to the real life behaviour.

All of these modifications are firmly according to the real values and I hope they are not of any harm in any way!



Cheers,
Have a day of Falcon!"
