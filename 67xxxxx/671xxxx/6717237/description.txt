-This Mod will bring most of the missile's flight models closer to their real behaviour and performance values

-The Aim-9X, IRIS-T and AA-11 (R-73) have been modified to respect the real life characteristics

-The SA-10 now has a hearable warning on the RWR when it locks on and fires

-The SA-10 now has two missiles in the air, just like the real one

-The F-14's advanced flight model has minor changes to the CG, making it more stable at higher alpha, and it's closer to the real thing's behaviour

-The F-16's advanced flight model has minor changes to the CG, and now it may do more stable loaded rolls, without departing due to the CG being too far
back initially (inertia coupling + CG combination made it more unstable than the real F-16), and it now respects the real F-16's flight anvelope
