"A Matter of Simple Duplicity"

Carol-Lynne (Laura Benanti) and Billy (David 
Krumholtz) decide to hire Doris (guest star 
Carrie Coon), a new bunny at the club, only to 
learn she has her own hidden agenda. Tension 
grows between Nick (Eddie Cibrian) and Carol-
Lynne as he get into the political race and his 
potential campaign manager Sean (guest star 
Sean Maher, "Make It or Break It") sets him up 
with Frances Dunhill (guest star Cassidy 
Freeman, "Smallville"), a wealthy socialite to 
further his cause. Meanwhile, Maureen (Amber 
Heard) gets close to John Bianchi (guest star 
Troy Garity, "Barbershop") in order to keep 
herself safe, but learns nothing is ever easy 
when dealing with the mob.
