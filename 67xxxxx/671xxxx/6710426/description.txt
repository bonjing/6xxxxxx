This is a little burst of passion in the wind of the raging so called \"debate\" on piracy...

Its a couple of pages long and yet enough to give a good amount of people the lower back parts itch.

So You have been warned, this is not for the faint of hearth or the fat in hypocrisy.

The main thing to be said about it is quote: \"this is not a sales pitch screwing around with the ideas of â€œethicsâ€ to boost revenue or a â€œgive us freebiesâ€ plea.\"

A friend of mine wrote it for and read it at a little debate in the university we are in.

He almost got kicked out over it, considering there were no officials of any kind at the event and it was quite a casual gathering.

I wouldn\'t have probably post posted it anywhere if I didn\'t see him getting hammered for it. That and looking at how infantile most piracy debates are I think this and things like it definitely should be given more visibility.
