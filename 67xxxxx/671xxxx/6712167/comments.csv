,SeedDemon,2011-10-16T20:17Z,Yeah non of the song are 320kbps
,indie_guy,2012-01-10T17:59Z,"Fix the description, friend. :)"
,indie_guy,2012-01-10T18:27Z,None of the songs are even close to 320 kbps. They seem to be re-encoded from 64 kbps which is horrible quality. Don't download this if you're looking for high quality.
,Donkeyboner,2012-01-26T18:20Z,"the songs works perfectly, but they are not in HQ"
,WhyPaywhenUcanPirateBay,2012-03-30T07:36Z,"128kbps still sounds great. 
i honestly can't even tell the difference"
