    Wannabe rock star Goldi lands in a house of three musicians, one too     
    hot, one too cold, and a third who seems just right. They let her        
    sing with their band, and she romances them one at a time, thinking      
    she's found her new home. But when she unleashes her own songs on the    
    guys, they cut her out of their scene, forcing her to discover that      
    real success means becoming your own rock and roll hero.
