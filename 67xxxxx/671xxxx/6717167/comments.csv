,galggod,2011-10-04T01:32Z,why do they keep calling it season 7 while its actually season 8
,dlarrym1111,2011-10-10T22:15Z,"@galggod:

 is 100% correct. It is season 7 for sure. American Dad is only just begun season 7. . .

No need to take my or  word, just go and Google it.    Better yet, goto CARTOON NETWORK and you will see with your own eyes. It's not that hard to confirm. , you must not be someone that follows American Dad or you would know. Not trying to be a jerk, just putting out the truth. . . . READ and HEED!  

Walk well , my same thinking TPB American Dad fan! (walk well is a Jamaican proverb which is equivalent to telling some one you wish them ""God Speed"". . . It is a good thing!)"
,kelv1969,2011-10-13T16:37Z,According to TV.com it is season 8. Who is wrong?
,kelv1969,2011-10-13T16:37Z,All I know is that it is episode 117
,kelv1969,2011-10-13T16:46Z,"according to tv.com season 1 was 7 episodes;
season 2 was 16; s3 - 19; s4 - 16; s5 - 20; s6 - 18; s7 - 19. and now we are on season 8. Other people must combine season 1 and 2 into one season of 23 episodes. bit confusing. best to go by the episode titles not season numbers."
,gangsta97943,2011-10-28T08:48Z,"In USA this is Season 7 , In UK this is Season 8"
,Saintwolf,2011-11-02T20:18Z,They did the same with Family Guy in the UK. Season 4 part 1 and part 2 in the USA is Seasons 4 and 5 in the UK
