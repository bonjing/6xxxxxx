mvpmark, bet you already found FIFA 12 over here:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6707551

Speaking of firmwares, i'm not sure which one is more stable, cuz i haven't used any of them yet. But accroding to comments, i guess you can safely pick any of these. But don't belive me, just read around the net and i'm sure you will be able to chose."
