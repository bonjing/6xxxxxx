,JetsetJoey,2011-09-30T20:03Z,"Well, they say there's a 1st time for everything & so here it is:

Something is wrong with this program/crack! The program & crack install fine; it even runs fine, BUT when you insert a disc, it will NOT be found! In fact, the program even blocks the Windows Media Player from functioning & gives the following message ""Windows Media Player cannot play this DVD because there is a problem with digital copy protection between your DVD drive, decoder, and video card. Try installing an updated driver for your video card.""

Any ideans Mr. Chitto or anyone else???"

,technofeeliak,2011-10-01T17:45Z,"Thanks for making this available. Unfortunately, it will not detect my dvd in the disk drive. On top of that, I'm trying to make a backup of the new Transformers movie and when I use an older version of DVDFab I can copy the files but they're not playable with Windows Media Player or any other player I've tried. I guess I'll just have to wait for an update from the pirates RRRR..."

,uproot233,2011-10-02T02:39Z,why are my comments deleted? Atleast say why so I dont do it anymore?
,Timewarpone,2011-10-02T04:29Z,I used the patch as explained by JetsetJoey and it worked fine. I had no problem with Transformers 3
,waterbong,2011-10-02T05:04Z,Wow this is the first time a Chatt torrent I've downloaded hasn't worked.  The links for the other supposedly working crack are all dead.  Anyone have another working crack?
,technofeeliak,2011-10-02T16:10Z,"The problem with JetsetJoey's instructions is that the link to the patch doesn't work. Once you click on the link you get a page that reads ""this account has been suspended"". Actually that was yesterday, today it just doesn't give me the page at all.

Backing up Transformers Dark of the Moon sort of works in the sense that DVDFab creates the files on my hard disk drive but they're not readable. If I can't watch the video and be sure that it is a good backup then there really isn't any point to copying or keeping the copy of the movie is there? When someone has a patch or a crack to offer as a solution... why not just upload it to this site and make a link? Wouldn't that be more reliable... everything in one place?

Whoever controls the content on this page should erase the comments with the links that don't work and make new comments with new links that do... it would be a great help anyway. Thanks just the same for the effort... One way or another, someone will offer a solution eventually. It's just a matter of time."
,technofeeliak,2011-10-02T17:05Z,"IMPORTANT - READ THIS (if you want this version to work)

These are the steps to follow
1 - Download the DVDFab Platinum v8.1.2.5 torrent from this page
2 - Use this link is courtasy of droopy702 to download another torrent that includes an old crack for version 8.0.7.3
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6140147/DVDFab_Platinum_v8.0.7.3___Crack_%5BChattChitto_RG%5D
3 - Intall version 8.1.2.5 on your PC using the package in this torrent (don't start DVDFab yet)
4 - Start up the old package for version 8.0.7 and do an automatic crack for your version either 32bit (XP and some versions of Vista and 7) or 64 bit (mostly Windows 7)
5 - Now open DVDFab and everything should work fine."
,technofeeliak,2011-10-02T17:10Z,"I was having trouble copying Transformers Dark of the Moon but this solved that problem.

If you need some good codecs to make your Windows media player play DVDs then download this... http://www.mediacodec.org/
If you need some lossless codecs to encode your videos then download this... http://lags.leetcode.net/codec.html
If you need a really good encoder then get a free copy of Adobe's Master Collection and use Adobe Media Encoder along with Premiere Pro for any editing you want to do... www.Adobe.com

,secret42,2011-10-02T19:04Z,followed 'technofeeliak' instructions when DVDFab loads and I attempt a copy I get a message the DVD Copy is out of date and only HD Decrypter is working 
,davesdream,2011-10-03T00:56Z,"Confirmed working as 'technofeeliak' suggested.
Only one tip. Use the option to open the crack and unzip the .dll into the DVDFab 8Qt directory. For some reason I tried once and it didn't work with automated cracking. After uninstalling I realized this method created another separated DVDFab 8 folder and copy there the file so the program couldn't really ""see"" the crack on this other folder"
,TheGreekGuy,2011-10-04T01:30Z,"jetsetjoey:

I ran into the same issue as you - DVDFab will not recognize my blu-rays.

I followed technofeeliak instructions and it does install/crack. The program opens, but still doesn't detect blurays  - I've read all the comments and do not see what I am doing wrong. 

Anyone have any suggestions?

So i uninstalled everything started over and manually copied the dll and the program crashes on me because of the dll. I'm running windows 7 64"

,tpb2009Nov13jb,2011-10-06T22:13Z,"Thanks guys for working out the kinks before I got here! :) This is to confirm that it will copy the Transformers3 DVD if you follow the instructions above (Windows XP SP3).

Download and install ChattChitto's DVDFab 8125 as normal, but don't use that crack. Use the DVDFab 8073 crack instead. So you must also download ChattChitto's 8073 version just to get that crack (link given above) unless you happen to already have it in your archives.

To get the 8073 crack (msvcr90.dll 617KB) run the 8073 installer and click the bottom button, named ""DVDFab Platinum v8.0.7.3 Crack"". That will show the expanded zip file which includes the needed dll file. Extract it somewhere. Then copy and replace the dll into the DVDFab 8125 directory. Job done."
