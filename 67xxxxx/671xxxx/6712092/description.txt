The highly anticipated album was recorded
at Rockfield Studios in Monmouth, (a town in Southeast Wales), and
produced by Communion's Ian Grimble.

If this new album is anything like Marcus's recent debut EP release of
"Tumble Down," which featured 4 songs including Shadows of the City,
Tumble Down, Demons and You Send Me, then I, along with fans, are in
for a real treat. His music is different. It's a mix of old world and
new world with harmonies and sounds that are oftentimes grisly and
warbly with scatting and otherworldly tones , but always jazzy and
soulful. Reminiscent of Tom Waits, Van Morrison, and other independent
"carve your own niche" artists.
