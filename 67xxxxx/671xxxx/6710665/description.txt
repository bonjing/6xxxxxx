this is a ASF Windows Media Video File, recorded via Windows Media Recorder 11 (WMR11) it plays well in Media Player Classic from K-Lite Codec Pack, and VLC, but for some reason on my machine, it locks up with Windows Media Player; this is the original recording; I did try MPEG-2 and MPEG-4, conversion, but was worse off; if it works for you, or you are able to convert it, post a note; 

Cheers
