,sarsapil,2011-10-01T05:48Z,"EXACTLY... They give you bullshit to try to invalidate atheism, but although they admit they are people in the audience eager to challenge them, THEY DON'T SHOW THAT, they fear being challenged because they know they don't have a leg to stand on.... For example at the end they try to make fun of atheists for believing in an eternal material universe, so why not accept an equally eternal god? BIG DIFFERENCE. WE CAN PERCEIVE THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE, THE SUPPOSEDLY ETERNAL INVISIBLE GOD IS JUST A FIGMENT OF HUMAN IMAGINATION..."

Just shows how worried the faith heads are!!"
,sarsapil,2011-10-01T18:10Z,"..... and they should be worried !!  A couple of centuries ago atheists were no more than 1% of people, at the turn of the 20th century with Darwin and all, about 5%, recent polls showed worldwide about 21% with no religious beliefs, with some countries atheist MAJORITY (China, Japan), so we have reasons to hope for a mostly religious bullshit-free world in the future, thanks to science."

Seconded. But somewhat interesting and infuriating to watch."
