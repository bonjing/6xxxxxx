3. Chan: Driven to drink as times have changed and people no longer care about quality craftsmanship, poverty stricken brazier maker Jukichi must find ways to make money for his family. Offers have come to join the more modern company started by former comrades, he tries to balance the pride of craftsmanship against his responsibility to support his family.
