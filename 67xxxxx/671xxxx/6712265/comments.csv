,LandHo12345,2011-10-02T23:53Z,"Holy fuck, 7.6 gigs? I love Rifftrax, but I'm not spending a third of my monthly broadband allowance on one film.. fuck.. 1 gig, maybe, 700 mb, definitely, but not 7.6 GB.."
,aParadox,2011-10-03T22:08Z,How can the quality be so  bad when it's almost 8 gigs? Even demonoid has a 2 gig file with better audio.
,Keshicus,2011-10-10T07:56Z,how the fuck is this almost 7.7gb? If its bluray you haven't labelled it as such.
,heapgun,2011-10-12T07:22Z,"Though I appreciate the currently-seeming monstrous bitrate of this version in an ETEWAF future.  

1) Not Dual Audio (which would have been easy to do) 
2) Riffing is really low in the mixed audio and, unlike the A-Class of syncers (GOLIATHSYNC, and a few others), the background audio is not attenuated when the rifftrax-track is not silent.  Repost when this is fixed, and applause is coming your way.

Oh, and just to reiterate, GO BUY THE RIFFTRAX FILE!"
,xendk,2011-10-12T21:48Z,"I made this for myself.

There were no other riff version of the movie on the internet at the time. 

The 2 gig version came after i made this one.

It is my first riff + movie that i made.

It is a full HD made from another download on TPB.

It is so big becomes i come form a country were 90/90 fiber Internet without limit is cheap and all over the place.

Yes the riff is low at times you can play it in stereo instead of 5.1 then the riff can be heard a bit better or you can buy the riff and the movie and make your own version AND SHUT THE FUCK "
