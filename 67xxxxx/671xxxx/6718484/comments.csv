[T],metalcore.,2011-10-04T18:42Z,does this repack fix the glitch near the end of the other rip? or no?

I've now downloaded the original by asap and three repacks (two from piratebay one from demonoid) and all four have been crap. Although the repacks i've tried so far have been an improvement ove the original it still has audio sync issues as well as what feels like missing frames and big square digital pixelations...all at the same two minute portion near the end of the show at an important scene. 

I will download this one too and comment later today. However, i'm not hodling my breath. If the issue was a packing issue then I can understand repacking but this one appears to be a bad capture and no amount of repacking will correct this. 

My best hope is that someone other than asap will cap the show and issue a proper.

Ok, this one is better but not error free. The pixelation is gone but the audio is out of sync and the video is not smooth...it feels like frames are missing. UGH! I have now downloaded five versions. Perhaps I'll now check out the 720 HD versinos...?

Thanks for the effort. I know you have no control over this. It's up to the scene to capture correctly.  

Still hoping for a Proper by someone other than asap on this one.
