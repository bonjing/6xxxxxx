Publisher's Summary
The struggle between the Amalgamation and the evil Consortium heats up as rebels assault the planet Quatro Cinco. Lieutanant Nancy Coy (Marina Sirtis, Counselor Deanna Troi on Star Trek: The Next Generation) is assigned to rehabilitate Kurk Manly - once the greatest and most handsome startship pilot in the galaxy, now reduced to a hopeless drunk - and put the interstellar kibosh on the rebellion. Deep dark plots, bone-rattling space battles, and rollicking Airplane-flavored humor combine with a wonderful original score to make this feature-length story a treat for the ears that will sweep you away!
