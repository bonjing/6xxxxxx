[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-01T23:59Z,"MARVEL people??? I would like to get into Avengers but I am lost: New Avengers, Secret Avengers, Ultimate Avengers, Ultimates, new ultimates

Could someone give me a quick and dirty low down/chronology?"
[V],GunningHawk90,2011-10-02T05:28Z,"I know what you mean, dude. But I happen to upload torrents at Demonoid as well. And there, you can't create a torrent without that .txt file. It'll be really bothersome if I have to create two seperate torrents for each comic (one for TPB and one for demonoid). That's why I'm compelled to put it in a folder :-("
,spazlord,2011-10-02T07:02Z,"ok first i like to thank you 2 for your post's.
quick review avenger pre civil war turned into secret avenger at start of it... new avengers was tonys team which then turned into the norman osborn version made of villians posing as know heroes when war was finally over and norman was dethroned and cap took over shield he moved secret avenger to the new avengers and made a new secret avengers team to do the ""dirty work"" the the public avengers couldn't/wont do. Also note the New Avengers have members that belong to FF (thing and spiderman) and a Red Hulk"
,spazlord,2011-10-02T07:06Z,"Ultimate comics is a parerral world (elseworlds for you dc people) Ultimates is the main world's Avengers, as people got more into to it (they had ultimate spidy,x-men ect) they decided to make a ultimate avengers which is another team set up to do the dirty work of shield ran by nick fury then removed and back and gone again.. in order to keep the ultimates name clean for the public.. tho after the hulk trying to eat new york i dont think it was working to well"
,spazlord,2011-10-02T07:13Z,"oh i forgot the New Ultimates....   they like the new avengers .. think it as a new season of a tv show.. they are now on season 3 which they dubbed ""new ultimates""... just a roster change.
Of course marvels pantys are in a bind and i do believe they are going to try to force a reset on thier comics cuase DC did. which i must admit DC is looking good on 2/3's of them. And marvel probly will probly fail if they rush it to fast."
[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-02T17:58Z,"@GH - Had a feeling  - thats just stupid, frickin Demonoid.

@spazlord - I think Im more confused LOL - But thankyou. "

new avengers, avengers, secret avengers and avengers academy is part of the main marvel 616 universe they re placed mighty avenvgers. new avengers(which makes no sence to me) dark avengers and avengers initiative....its takes place after the seige story line 

the ultimates happens in the ultimate univer and they all basically tie-in to each other...espesially durin the death of spider-man story...whick then reboots the universe with a new ultimate roster...a new x-men roster and a hal-black half hispanic spider-man"
,MuserClair,2011-10-21T11:58Z,"LOL!  just read spazlord and jap-manexpress's explanations of the marvel 616 and ultimate universes - i was gonna try to explain who they all were, but despite being a total marvel girl, i figured it was beyond me cos it's like you have to live through it to understand it!
kudos to you guys for trying - and i can understand why you're probably more confused now than you were before MrD!

and GH - thanks for the ul! :-)"
