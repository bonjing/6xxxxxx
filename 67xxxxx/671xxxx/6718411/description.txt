Alrighty then... Heres a... Well. Cant really describe the game myself. Its a damn cool game if yah ask me though.

Heres an official description:

"Fate of the World is a dramatic global strategy game that puts all our futures in your hands. The game features a dramatic set of scenarios based on the latest science covering the next two centuries. You must manage a balancing act of protecting the Earthâ€™s resources and climate versus the needs of an ever-growing world population, who are demanding ever more food, power, and living space. Will you help the whole planet or will you be an agent of destruction?"

How fancy....
