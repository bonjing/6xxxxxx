For Nick (Jason Bateman), Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) and Dale (Charlie Day), the only thing that would make the daily grind more tolerable would be to grind their intolerable bosses (Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell, Jennifer Aniston) into dust. Quitting is not an option, so, with the benefit of a few-too-many drinks and some dubious advice from a hustling ex-con (Jamie Foxx), the three friends devise a convoluted and seemingly foolproof plan to rid themselves of their respective employers.permanently. There's only one problem: even the best laid plans are only as foolproof as the brains behind them.

* What is DXVA?
 DXVA, or DirectX Video Accelleration, is a system built into Windows operating systems 
 since Windows XP that allows programs, if they support it, to offload the decoding of 
 certain media codecs to the GPU. Doing so reduces the strain on the CPU and allows for 
 even High Definition content to be played on a relatively weak system.
