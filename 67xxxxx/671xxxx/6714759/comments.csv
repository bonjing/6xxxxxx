,analjuggern4ut,2011-10-02T08:39Z,"Thank you so much for sharing. If this fixes the coupling bug, wipers not working in the rear cab and the other annoying bugs I've found so far, I'll be delighted."
,gol48,2011-10-02T10:56Z,thanks a lot !
,analjuggern4ut,2011-10-02T12:09Z,"It seems that the coupling bug has now been fixed, but the Class 47 diesel locomotive still has only front wipers working. I wonder if that's a problem with the game itself or with the Class 47 model, which was supposed to be upgraded for RailWorks 3."
