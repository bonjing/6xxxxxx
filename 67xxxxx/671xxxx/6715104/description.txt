After a brilliant debut album that showcased his versatility, Sayer drifted closer to the intimate singer-songwriter path that was by 1974 well-trodden. Fortunately, the exceptional quality of no fewer than four songs ensured that this album avoided the dry, mediocre fate of so many similarly-styled recordings. The four are "Train", later re-recorded for a compilation, "Giving It All Away", which Roger Daltrey was to take into the charts, and the hits "One Man Band" and "Long Tall Glasses". 
This is a more personal album than the debut, "Silverbird", with the theme of struggle prominent. "Long Tall Glasses" comments on the lengths a tramp will go to to survive, while "One Man Band" relates the lot of the busker. Some of the lesser tracks are ordinary, though on "Telepath" Sayer reveals that he still has the gift of imagination in his delivery. 
"Just A Boy" isn't as good as "Silverbird" but it has enough about it to make it a worthwhile purchase.
