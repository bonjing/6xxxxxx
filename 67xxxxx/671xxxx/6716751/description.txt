The Hour of the Wolf: Dr. Geoffry Stanhope (Dramatized)by Thomas E. Fuller 
Narrated by Daniel Taylor, Bill Jackson 
Dramatized by The Atlanta Radio Theatre Company
Length: 29 minutes

If The X-Files starred Sherlock Holmes, it would look like this: Colonel Horatio Fitzwilliam, late of Her Majesty's Army, finds wonders beyond imagination as the sturdy companion of the perpetually bemused Doctor Geoffry Stanhope.
It was supposed to be a simple hiking tour of the Bavarian Alps. But something is hunting the hunters in the haunted Duchy of Augsbach, and it is up to Dr Stanhope and Colonel Fitzwilliams to find out what it is.

If it doesn't find them first.

This is an original, full-cast, soundscaped audio dramatization by The Atlanta Radio Theatre Company.
