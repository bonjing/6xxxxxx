Whether you're interested in raising capital for a start-up or looking for expansion capital to grow a small, established company, access to capital on the right terms is critical to your success. As a primary source of capital for early-stage and growing companies, private investors or "business angels" are a vital resource for today's entrepreneur. However, most small business professionals have limited knowledge about the angel equity market, business angels, the private equity investment process, and how deals get done. That's why you need Angel Capital: How to Raise Early-Stage Private Equity Financing.

Angel Capital offers the extensive expertise of Gerald Benjaminâ€”creator of the largest network of private investors in the country and Senior Managing Partner of International Capital Resources, a firm recognized as the leader in accessing and cultivating relationships with angel investorsâ€”and Joel Margulis.

Filled with in-depth insight and real-world advice, this comprehensive guide provides an inside look at the emergence and creation of a capital market that could potentially finance your dreams, and describes the manner in which successful entrepreneurs must go about the business of raising capital. From examining every stage of raising capital to uncovering a segment of high-net-worth investors specifically interested in financing earlier-stage, developmental-stage, and expansion-stage ventures, Angel Capital covers everything you need to know to tap into the capital your venture needs.
