,nightprowler.,2011-10-02T04:52Z,"Thanks for all your hard work Merzedes, my next comment has nothing to do with anything you do, it is specific to the film itself.

That camera man was horrible in my opinion.  Constantly zooming in too close and missing some of the action.  Its a two girl scene, I want to see what's happening to both girls! "
