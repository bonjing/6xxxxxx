Product Description: A practical, application-oriented text that presents analytical results for the better modeling and control of power converters in the integration of green energy in electric power systems

The combined technology of power semiconductor switching devices, pulse width modulation algorithms, and control theories are being further developed along with the performance improvement of power semiconductors and microprocessors so that more efficient, reliable, and cheaper electric energy conversion can be achieved within the next decade. Integration of Green and Renewable Energy in Electric Power Systems covers the principles, analysis, and synthesis of closed loop control of pulse width modulated converters in power electronics systems, with special application emphasis on distributed generation systems and uninterruptible power supplies.

The authors present two versions of a documented simulation test bed for homework problems and projects based on Matlab/Simulink, designed to help readers understand the content through simulations. The first consists of a number of problems and projects for classroom teaching convenience and learning. The second is based on the most recent work in control of power converters for the research of practicing engineers and industry researchers.
