Theatre goers in Berlin are looking forward to the new operetta "Frau Luna". But the Berlin police privy council who observes the final rehearsal judges that the costumes of the ladies on stage are too candid. To prevent any indecent behaviour, he stops the show. The president of the socitey of the Thusneldas has made it his own business to keep a close watch on the capital's public morality. But theatre director Knoppe has already made up a plan how he could convince the distinguished society to release the long-awaited operetta. He wants to befriend the guardians of public morals, and soon the premiere of "Frau Luna" is back on schedule.

But the members of the Thusnelda society are far less decent as they always pretend to be. Knoppe even has to pull out all the stops to bail his new-found friends out. With the help of his attractive singer Vera, who is able to seduce even the most decent man, Knoppe finally succeeds to put "Frau Luna" back on stage.
