,rmorsy,2011-10-30T03:02Z,"I am a complete noob!!  I never go on xbox live, ever, not even connected.  My 360 was modded a while back and I have no idea what I have at all, how do I figure out what I have.  I downloaded agbx, image burner 2.5.6 and purchased some dual layer dvd's.   What else do I need to do?  Sorry for the ignorance, I have never burned a game in my life and don't know how."
,rmorsy,2011-10-30T03:04Z,"I also don't plan on ever going live, can I get banned still?"
