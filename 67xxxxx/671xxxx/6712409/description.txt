The latest offering from my Tony Robinson uploads.

In this documentary Tony shows that he is willing to go to just about any lengths to get to the facts behind a story. Not only does he tell the historical facts behind the "Da Vinci Code", but takes you on the journey of discovery himself and visits the actual locations and interviewing people involve at the sites... It was just an awesome work. If only people who read the book ( or wrote the Book)or watch the Da Vinci Code would demonstrate as much curiosity as to check out the facts... I can't speak highly enough of this documentary."
