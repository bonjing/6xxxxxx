I just got a letter from Charter, they SPECIFICALLY said there was ""copywrite infringement"" on this torrent, they mentioned ""World of Byzantium educational material"" as being their cause. Please save yourself and not download this. Im sure it has nothing to do, NOTHING, with the uploader. the FCC or someone is tracking all instances of TTC materials. Cease and desist everyone!"
