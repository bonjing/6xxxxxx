,f_2_o,2011-10-03T19:00Z,VERY GOOD QUALITY FOR 360MB FILE. EXCELLENT AS USUAL. THANKS AGAIN TVTEAM..
,general_monash,2011-10-03T23:10Z,"TVTEAM IS A FUCKING SCAM

That's why they put all the line spacing in the descriptions - so you can't easily see the comments calling out the FAKE FAKE FAKES.

When they first post a file the UL is a password -protected RAR file with a TXT instructing you to go to www.movies.tv for the password. They post a few fake comments about how great the UL is, then change the files after a few dupes have been to their site and given up whatever the fuck the stupid phishers are after. Later ULs are the regular unprotected avi file.

If you are downloading a TvTeam UL, CHECK that the file is an AVI not a RAR, because they CHANGE the DL after the first few ULs.

TvTeam - enough with the smartass replies. You are deadshit phasing scammers. When you fucking end it all, get someone to post the splatter after you do it. I'd seed that for fucking ever."
,Mashmodo,2011-10-04T00:35Z,"""THIS IS A GENUINE TORRENT""

Not sure why the spammers went all out on this one.
That general_monash made me piss myself. I mean, we aren't a bunch of grannies who have just got our first computer, we know how they work lol. We know AVI's can't have passwords. We know a dumb fuck spammer when we see one.

The bottom line for using TPB is if they have a skull, its very very likely the torrent is fine.

Download and seed this wonder of piracy and help fuck these spammers off."
,Kharth,2011-10-04T01:56Z,IDK what the pw/phish stuff is about but I've never had a problem with any TvTeam files. Anyway awesome episode I can't wait until next Sunday SHTF big time

,Bob__Dole,2011-10-04T03:27Z,"Thanks TVT


It's a shame this season is almost over, only one more episode, then next season is the LAST.  It was a good run, Walt."
,Balthazar7,2011-10-04T05:43Z,"ACTA, MPAA and RIAA conspirators must be very afraid of this one torrent to spend so much time deprecating it. I'll be seeding this one for a month, come and get me shit-heads."
,SodaGod,2011-10-04T08:14Z,"Ignore the cries of ""fake"". This torrent is legitimate."

,begwande,2011-10-04T08:27Z,"Fact 1: No two uploaders can share a name.  
Fact 2: TvTeam is real.
Fact 3: Anyone interested in watching this episode can download it and enjoy, like I deed. That's the logic!"
,mathimagics,2011-10-04T09:38Z,I'm confused.  I got RAR files on this and several other torrents dl-ed last night. Never happened to me before.  My files said to go to LovelyMovies.com for passwords - I'm new to this technology but that looks really phishy to me.  So I can relate to what general_monash and others have said.  What is going on here? 
,Mhenlo,2011-10-04T16:06Z,"When downloading a torrent, most programs allow you to view what's being downloaded. This is a legitimate torrent. Stop wasting time on trying to scoff the uploader and be grateful.

Thanks in advance, TvTeam!"
,Erich505,2011-10-04T16:40Z,"What's with all the hysteria? Same torrent and quality as always. It's business as usual here, folks. Lots of activists around tho, ignore them. "
,mathimagics,2011-10-04T17:18Z,"Today it looks legit, yes, and have dl-ed it ok, but yesterday both I and apparently others got a bum version. 

It was not just this torrent - it happened also on several other torrents yesterday. Somebody was/is f***ing with the system!

,general_monash,2011-10-05T14:32Z,"TO ALL YOU FAGGOTS CALLING OUT THOSE OF US WHO GOT FAKE RAR FILES FROM TVTEAM'S SHITTY SCAM

FUCK YOU. There are several downloaders here who all agree, and all of them were downloading when the torrent was brand new. I got it when there was 1 seeder and had been up for a few minutes. it DL'd an fit was a fucking password protected RAR file with instructions to get the PW from  www.movies.tv.

ALL OF US HAS REPORTED THE SAME THING.

Only later when I downloaded A SECOND TIME was the raw AVI file there. That's when all you come-lately dumbfucks came along a said (imitates retarded count) ""

TvTeam is a fucking phishing group picking off a few IDs with each upload then switching the file. That's why they do so many fresh uploads. That's why this keeps happening and nobody can figure it out (there's loads of accounts of the same shit pulled on their other sites).

And that's why all you freaks sucking TvTeam cock and defending their scamming shit can get AIDS and die. Go and suicide SodaGod, Mhenlo, Erich505, rustyrambo, Bokey_Boy. I mean it. End it all. And leave us who think, try and help others, and call out scams, to get on with it."

There is some scummy shit going on here and you pretending just because YOU didnt get the shitty .rar files that this isnt happening IS NOT HELPING the torrent community. Cunts.

,moulin1,2011-10-15T14:20Z,Same thing as every non-bullshit-scammer commenting here. This is a scam also a torrent by FQM Breaking_Bad_S04E12_End_Times_HDTV_XviD_-FQM_[eztv].6706608.TPB.torrent which now seems to be gone. PW rar. Fucking site demands javascript. Includes instructions for turning it on in IE6.  I assume that every post saying great thanks is from the scammers. Either that or pull your head out of your ass long enough to graduate to idiot.
,MRMKHS1,2012-05-07T05:19Z,Excellent Download. Thank You.
