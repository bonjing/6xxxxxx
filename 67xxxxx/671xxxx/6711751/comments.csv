Awesome video quality. ESPECIALLY for a 700~ MB file. So much so, that I'm now taking the time to comment. Even on a 27"" Hi-Def display, it still looks like a 4.4GB file... And Monster's Inc. seems to be my 3yo Son's new favorite film- or, ""RAAAHH, mon's"", as he calls it when asking to watch it again, in a demonic shout, eyes wide and hands raised high with spread fingers."
