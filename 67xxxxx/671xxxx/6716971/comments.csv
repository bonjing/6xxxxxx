,Revolver31,2011-10-03T17:56Z,"the benq 800 v3 is only for a stand alone drive if you want to rip games from the original source not to be used in a 360 the Ltplus benq v2.0 is the one you want you may want to try this
1.flash back to stock
2.reconnect your drive n update your dashboard to 13599 i used usb drive
3.the hook back up to your pc and flash to the benq v2.0.

and then that should be you also use the lastest gear jungleflasher 1.88 and with imgburn remember to follow the new instuctions for burning xgd3 games."
