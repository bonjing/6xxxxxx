,Xbox_360_Flash,2011-10-04T17:49Z,"SEED!!!!FFS SEED,i´m stuck at 98.1%...."
,KumaR,2011-10-04T18:45Z,"dude, i m seeding."
,Xbox_360_Flash,2011-10-04T18:55Z,"are u f*cking kidding me?!?There is no Binaries folder or FFOW.exe file.It has unpacked everyting but no FFOW.exe file anyware.Don´t download this torrent,the uploader doesn´t know what he´s doing."
,Xbox_360_Flash,2011-10-04T18:58Z,"There is no Binaries filder.....It has unpacked everyting but there is no Binaries folder or a ffow.exe file.Haha,and i been downloading for 2 days and it doesn´t work.Great,just great."
,KumaR,2011-10-04T19:03Z,"@xbox360 see, it has got 19 seeders."
,Xbox_360_Flash,2011-10-04T19:05Z,"There is no .exe anyware,not even in any of the compressed files,this torrent was doomed not to work even before i downloaded it.Good work uploader.

Doesn´t Work!!!!Dont download!!!!!"
,KumaR,2011-10-04T19:11Z,"oh man, u didnt read the instructions carefully! when you run setup.bat file in the root folder, the Binaries folder will be extracted from it (in which there is the FFOW.exe) So the 1st thing you do is run setup.bat.. not just go searching for binaries folder without following the previous steps!!"
,Xbox_360_Flash,2011-10-04T19:14Z,"there is no Binaries folder in any of the .7z zip files.
Uploader KKKumaRRR,look for ur self,man,u wont find it."
,Xbox_360_Flash,2011-10-04T19:22Z,"it has already unpacked everyting,i have already run the setup.bat,i got 10 diffrent folders but no Binaries,and when i look in the compressed files the folder is´nt there.And just 19 seeders dont mean it work,just that u got 19 other pissed of downloaders."
,Xbox_360_Flash,2011-10-04T19:28Z,"KKKumaRRR,did u find it?"
,KumaR,2011-10-04T19:34Z,"did u run the ""Setup.bat"" file?"
,KumaR,2011-10-04T19:45Z,ohk i m checking it once again... and i'll upload pictures of content that is extracted out of Setup.bat and post it here as a comment. wait.
,Xbox_360_Flash,2011-10-04T19:48Z,"Read my posts,Yes,i´ve run the setup.bat and it unpacked alot of folders but there is no Binaries folder,and it will never be one ethier,beacuse there is non in any of the compressed files.Look for ur self."
,KumaR,2011-10-04T20:04Z,"""Setup.bat"" is extracting: http://i1134DOTphotobucketDOTcom/albums/m607/KumarjitDey/fwfwDOTjpg

After setup.bat has completed, ""Binaries"" and another folder ""Engine"" pops up: http://i1134DOTphotobucketDOTcom/albums/m607/KumarjitDey/xaxasxDOTjpg

Open ""Language Selector"" folder and run ""English.bat"" http://i1134DOTphotobucketDOTcom/albums/m607/KumarjitDey/axxxxDOTjpg

Now, finally enter Binaries folder and there you find ""FFOW.exe"" http://i1134DOTphotobucketDOTcom/albums/m607/KumarjitDey/axxxaaDOTjpg

just put . in place of DOT to view images. so now i have proved that this upload is legit! :)

,Xbox_360_Flash,2011-10-04T20:31Z,"""Engine"" coms up,yes,but no ""Binaries"".Check ur torrent,not ur installed game,its the torrent upload thats f*cked up."
,Xbox_360_Flash,2011-10-04T20:37Z,And ur picture link´s don´t work either.Keep up the good work...Noob.
,Xbox_360_Flash,2011-10-04T20:49Z,"Picture links works,my bad,but still no Binaries after Setup.bat,and there will never be a Binaries folder in this torrent beacuse that folder is missing from the the torrent upload."
,Xbox_360_Flash,2011-10-04T20:58Z,"F*ck it,i´m downloading the game from another torrent(that works),tired of this amatur."
,KumaR,2011-10-05T02:41Z,"Xbox_360_Flash said, ""Check ur torrent,not ur installed game,its the torrent upload thats f*cked up.""

Dude, i havent installed any game. this game is kinda directplay. after extraction completes from setup.bat, the binaries folder is extracted and inside it is the FFOW.exe, which u double click and play the game !!! theres no matter of installing!

and yes... i didnt upload anything different. i copied the entire folder from the location where i m seeding it to another. there i ran setup.bat and finished the process just to show u that nothing is wrong. the pics in the links are taken from there. so nothing is different!"
