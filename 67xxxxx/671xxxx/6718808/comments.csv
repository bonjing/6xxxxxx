,96ardnas69,2011-10-04T23:52Z,"Here is a happy girl.  It looks like she got up late, didn't shave, started the laundry, and then wandered onto the set for a few pictures.  She probably went right back to bed and got bread crumbs between the sheets.
        I love it.
 I have to rate this one 9 Fabric Softeners out of 10. "
