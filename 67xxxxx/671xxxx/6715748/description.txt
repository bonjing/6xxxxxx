Patrick Sweany

Patrick Sweany first gained prominence in the late 1990s as an acoustic 
blues guitarist and singer at many Blues Festivals around the U.S. 
His first CD I Wanna Tell You was released in 1999 and drew critical 
acclaim from prominent musicians such as Roy Book Binder and Jimmy 
Thackery. In 2001, Patrick formed an electric trio called simply The 
Patrick Sweany Band. The band includes drummer Clint Alguire, and has 
featured a revolving cast of baritone guitarists, including Dan Auerbach
from The Black Keys, Ted Pecchio currently of Col. Bruce Hampton's The 
Codetalkers, and Jon Finley. Currently, Bob Basone fills the role. The 
drum chair is being filled currently by Nick Fritsch. The omission of 
a bass player was Sweany's attempt to model the sound of the band after
Hound Dog Taylor's HouseRockers
