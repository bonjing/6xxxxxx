"Twenty Vicodin"

A year has passed since House crashed 
his car into Cuddys home, and we 
find House spending time behind bars 
at the East New Jersey Correctional 
Facility under the close watch of the 
prison warden. When an antagonistic 
prison gang leader makes a serious 
threat, House solicits the help of a 
fellow inmate, but when another 
inmates unusual medical symptoms 
spark his curiosity, House must come 
up with creative ways to treat the 
patient while navigating prison 
rules. House meets Dr. Jessica Adams, 
a young, intelligent and bright-eyed 
clinic doctor, but when they are 
faced with a controversial 
opportunity to diagnose the patients 
life-threatening illness, Adams is 
confronted with a choice to trust 
House and put her career on the line 
or play by the book.
