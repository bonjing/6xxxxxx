Skip this crappy version."
[V],DownTYU,2011-10-04T00:05Z,"I got the file from HDChina...So I thought it'd be Ok. I guess I was wrong. Just download it from seedbox. It appears to be 720p Line. So the Video was from Bluray which is Ok..
If proper comes I'll try to upload a loose DTS audio track for those who got this one."
,X750F,2011-10-06T00:17Z,Do u get paid for doing this?
,shizilao,2011-10-13T18:52Z,Audio doesn't sound right indeed. Something like upscale of a mono track to DTS 5.1.
