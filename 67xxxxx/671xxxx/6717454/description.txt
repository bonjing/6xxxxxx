In 1997, before the visit of the pope to Rio de Janeiro, Captain Nascimento from BOPE
(Special Police Operation Battalion) is assigned to eliminate the risks of the drug dealers
in a dangerous slum nearby where the pope intends to be lodged. Captain Nascimento
is trying to find a man to replace him because his wife is pregnant and he intends to quit
the command and become a trainer of the new recruits. Meanwhile, the two idealistic
friends Neto and Matias join the Military Police force expecting to become
honest policemen and fight the criminals. However, they see only corruption,
lack of competence and stupid bureaucracy in the Military Police, and after a serious
incident in the Morro da Babilonia, they decide to join the BOPE. The lives of Capitain
Nascimento, Neto and Matias are entwined along the next months, first in the tough
training period and then in action against drug dealers...
