The Bee Gees' double album "Best Of Bee Gees" is converted from original vinyl discs to mp3 (bitrate 320kbps) with the help of VK-6-LiveSound audio system which preserves the whole "live" contents of these two LPs.
Play the recording via good audio equipment and enjoy the finest sound details never heard before.
To listen to more of the unprecedently natural music, look for my other releases marked with "LP rip!!"
