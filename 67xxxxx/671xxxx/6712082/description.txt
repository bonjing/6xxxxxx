BUDDY GUY BREAKING OUT
Label JSP 
Released: 1988
Format:Mp3@320

It was 1980. Buddy Guy was still out there in the career doldrums. Not starving, certainly, but not accorded his due either by the mainstream music business. This one was recorded at Chicago Sound Studios and is a true one-off - an album that confused everyone at the time but now makes perfect sense. It was a dry run for stuff he would do when he got the (next) big break and was making records for a big, rock orientated, audience again. But those later sets never had this intensity - this hunger, this danger - this sheer cry of frustrated pain. And some bonus tracks are here from brother Phil Guy. [/color]
