I have no real intention to offer support of any kind, although I could take requests for other builds and they may or may not be made at some point."

Cheers"
,jamesb845,2011-10-04T18:55Z,Nice upload thanks! Seeding!
,MCModding,2011-10-04T18:58Z,"@6patera9

These mods definitely are not going to work on a server, I believe EE and BTW don't have any functioning versions, and the other mods are the single player only versions included.

I believe there are versions of buildcraft that are multiplayer though, but not in this pack."
,MCModding,2011-10-04T19:18Z,"@6patera9,

This pack definitely won't work with a server.

There are parts (buildcraft I think) that have versions that will work, but BTW and EE definitely cannot work with any server software."
,raven49,2011-10-04T19:26Z,"great upload, but is it really just 1.8? most of these have 1.8.1 versions already. if you have that, please upload that kit please, thanks."
,MCModding,2011-10-04T20:20Z,"@raven49

it's 1.8.1.  Thanks for the correct.  First torrent :)"
,6patera9,2011-10-04T21:36Z,"Hey MCModding thanks for giving me a shout back. I spent a bit of time crawling through forums and what not looking for ways to make the magic happens but your absolutely right, no such luck. Still very cools mods either way. I wish they could get some sort of unified way to add mods built into this game sooner rather than later."
,Jayzen_Freeze,2011-10-05T02:07Z,wtf there is no minecraft file to load 
,MCModding,2011-10-05T03:15Z,"@Jayzen_Freeze

Just use the regular launcher you can download from minecraft.net."
,raven49,2011-10-05T09:35Z,"I've been playing around with your modpack and its brilliant by the way, just a bit complicated. you think you can upload this one with Mo' Creatures and Creeps and Weirdoes? Im not so sure with my modding skills you see.

i can only do the little stuff like the mod which lets me chop the whole of a tree by only hitting the roots :P many thanks if you could upload it with the creature mods mentioned above!"
,MCModding,2011-10-05T16:46Z,"@raven49,

Neither Mo' Creatures and Creeps nor Weirdoes  use MC Forge, which is a requirement for them to all *easily* mesh together.

I wouldn't be surprised if getting these two mods alone to work wouldn't be possible due to how much they change that's similar though.  If it is possible it would be quite complicated and wouldn't work with the rest of these mods.  If they start using MC Forge I would put it in a pack though."
,forsakenabyss,2011-10-05T21:49Z,"hey wuts up, this upload is awesome, didnt had luck trying to install this mods manually , but u made my dream come true xD, i loaded it and it worked, but dont hav any sound! not any, im sure its not my pc, plz hlp"
,wabisuke,2011-10-06T15:51Z,"my sound doesn't work , any idea how to fix it ?"
,Avalier,2011-10-06T21:27Z,"Same here, no sound. Game freezes if I try to click the sound controls. Might be something to do with a new sound API that IC2 has implemented, but im not an expert."
