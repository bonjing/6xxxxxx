Plot  
On the surface, it's the bleakest of lands, with ferocious winds, flightless birds, and enough ice to flood half of the planet's population if it were to melt. But below that frozen mass, a fantastic environment of indescribable beauty teems with life. Academy Award winner Hilary Swank narrates this mesmerizing program shot in high definition over a period of two years.
