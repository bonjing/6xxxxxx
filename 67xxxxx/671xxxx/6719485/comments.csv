,DeinTreeGott,2011-10-04T17:15Z,"@NBAMAN- How your download speed determine whether its fake or not? Your download speed is only 0.7 Kb/s because there are over 19,000 leechers to only 8 seeders, it has nothing to do with the torrent being real or fake.

@everyone else- If you're so concerned with this being real or fake, wait a few hours and at least 5 more torrents, from more reputable uploaders will be up. The game just came out a few hours ago, give it time."

when you download games for free MP is out of the questions unless it allows for cracked servers. which this game and many others do not.
