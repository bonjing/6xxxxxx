This is an oldy but goody for the glory days of gaming lol.  It is a little small, yet for the sheer reason it is only one game haha, but it is fun to have on a flash drive or in a conner for a rainy day.  

=====================================================================================

This torrent contains Project 64 emulator and Pokemon Stadium 2 (the good one).

It can be played on nearly any computer, which is half the fun of it.

=====================================================================================

As usual I try to make it as easy as possible.

All you have to do is open up project 64 and then open up the Pokemon Stadium 2 file.

Then just have fun.

=====================================================================================

You can play 2 players on this, I have done it lol, you just have to configure the keyboard to play with both and or have 2 keyboards.

Truely I don\\\'t know why I uploaded this, mostly to just share the fun.
