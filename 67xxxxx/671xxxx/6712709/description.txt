Filled with fish-tested designs as well as carving and painting techniques, this guide provides instructions for creating a variety of fresh and saltwater lures. Exploring the science of catching fishâ€”what colors and shapes fish are attracted to and how to replicate themâ€”the handbook tells which lure designs will attract which type of fish. Outlining the difference between surface, floating, diving, and sinking lures, this manual offers full-sized carving patterns and step-by-step demonstrations. Additional information about hardware, hooks, and jointed lures is also included, as is an elaborate gallery of historic and contemporary wooden lures. For the active fisherman, fishing lure collector, or the crafty carver and painter, this full-color handbook provides more than 20 projects to make and use.
