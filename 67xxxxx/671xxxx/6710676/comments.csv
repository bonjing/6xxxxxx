,dsafjaly69,2011-09-30T12:16Z,"Nice upload,  I have much of this stuff manually downloaded from Oblivion Nexus, but this is a GREAT collection and would highly recommend this to anyone who hasn't yet played Oblivion. Hundreds of hours of game play."
,pierat9,2011-10-15T16:37Z,"Great torrent i was reading about FCOM yesterday and now i find this lot that installs itself. Class, thanks..."
,xidio,2011-10-18T06:39Z,Does it work with Unique Landscapes... all of em and QTP3?
,TMckye,2011-10-20T07:31Z,"Thank you SO MUCH, I have wanted to play Oblivion again for some time but cant bring myself to play without FCOM, but its SUCH a PITA to install, I will seed this for quite a while."
,xidio,2011-11-01T05:56Z,"This doesnt really work, as previous attempts on TPB.

Oblivion boots, black screen, instantly back to desktop, no crashing.

FCOM is a pain in the ass even as omod(there is an omod on tpb)"

,classymusicsnob,2012-01-30T20:34Z,"I'm stuck at 99.4%, seed please!"
,classymusicsnob,2012-01-31T00:12Z,Thanks for making it super easy by packaging it into installers. I'm noobish with WyreBash but I know how to basically use it. The problem with noobs and FCOM is the amount of stuff you have to download and then try to sort out. 10/10 I'll seed this!
