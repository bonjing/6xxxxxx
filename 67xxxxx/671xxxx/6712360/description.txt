Plot:

"The Pleiades" is adapted from Japanese writer Asada Jiro's acclaimed 

historical novel of the same name. Set in the late Qing Dynasty, the 

story unfolds around a poor man, Chun'er who makes a living out of 

cleaning up dung on the streets. An astrologer tells him he was born 

under the Pleiades stars and prophesies that he is destined to bag 

all of China's treasure.

Seeing his elder brother die of starvation, Chun'er castrates himself 

so that he can enter the royal palace as a eunuch. He soon rises up 

the ranks and become the most favored servant to the Empress Dowager 

Cixi. Meanwhile, Chun'er's half-brother Wenxiu also joins the ranks 

of court officials through the national academic examination and vows 

to make sweeping changes to reform the country mired deep in turmoil. 

These two young men of humble origins, become involved in the up and 

downs of each others lives and the fate of the empire.
