Galaxy Angel EX is a \\\"supplementary\\\" videogame released by BROCCOLI. In the \\\"main storyline,\\\" Tact and all of the Angels (including Chitose) are hanging out together on the Elsior and having fun. As the player progresses through the game, the sequence of the main storyline is as follows:


First, the player plays some of the main storyline. Then, the game randomly selects the 1-star difficulty level of any of Galaxy Angel EX\\\'s numerous \\\"mini-games\\\" (said mini-games being the true bread-and-butter of Galaxy Angel EX).


Second, the player plays some more of the main storyline. Then, the game randomly selects the 2-star difficulty level of any of Galaxy Angel EX\\\'s numerous \\\"mini-games.\\\"


Third, the player plays some more of the main storyline. Then, the game randomly selects the 3-star difficulty level of any of Galaxy Angel EX\\\'s numerous \\\"mini-games.\\\"


Fourth, the player plays some more of the main storyline. Then, the game randomly selects the 4-star difficulty level of any of Galaxy Angel EX\\\'s numerous \\\"mini-games.\\\"


Fifth, the player plays some more of the main storyline. Then, the game randomly selects the 5-star difficulty level of any of Galaxy Angel EX\\\'s numerous \\\"mini-games.\\\"

After that, the \\\"main storyline\\\" ends. However, any mini-games played during the main storyline are then unlocked and can be selected at any time from the mini-game menu. However, for each game, you can only play the difficulty levels that were randomly selected during a play-through of the \\\"story.\\\" So in order to be able to select any mini-game and any difficulty level, you must play the \\\"story\\\" multiple times.


Whenever you play a mini-game, depending on how well you do, you can win differing numbers of \\\"points.\\\" The points can then be used to unlock different Galaxy Angel wallpapers from the wallpaper menu, and those wallpapers can then be either used as the computer\\\'s wallpaper or saved as pictures on your hard drive.


The \\\"overriding purpose\\\" of Galaxy Angel EX is to first unlock every difficulty level of every mini-game, and then keep winning points until you\\\'ve unlocked every single wallpaper from the wallpapers menu.

Has some nice wallpapers!
