A Complete Guide to Masonry Materials and Structural Design

Written by the former chair of the Masonry Standards Joint Committee (MSJC), this authoritative volume covers the design of masonry structures using the 2009 International Building Code and the 2008 MSJC Code and Specification.

Masonry Structural Design emphasizes the strength design of masonry and includes allowable-stress provisions. Innovations such as autoclaved aerated concrete masonry (AAC) are also discussed. Real-world case studies featuring a low-rise building with reinforced concrete masonry and a four-story building with clay masonry illustrate the techniques presented in this comprehensive resource.

Coverage includes:

    * Basic structural behavior and design of low-rise, bearing wall buildings
    * Materials used in masonry construction
    * Code basis for structural design of masonry buildings, including seismic design
    * Introduction of MSJC treatment of structural design
    * Strength design of reinforced and unreinforced masonry elements
    * Allowable-stress design of reinforced and unreinforced masonry elements
    * Comparison of design by the allowable-stress approach versus the strength approach
    * Lateral load analysis of shear wall structure
    * Design and detailing of floor and roof diaphragms
