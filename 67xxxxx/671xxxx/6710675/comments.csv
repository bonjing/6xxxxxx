,BBfan,2011-09-30T01:44Z,This has parts of eps 19 in it. Or is 100 percent eps 19 from the uploader Superseeds. Only eps  that was missing was the eviction number 2 interview.

This is not ep 17.

Ep 17 is out there on non-torrent file serv sites and can be searched on sites like filestube.

I've seen the real ep 17. 
It includes: clips from before, during, and after the eviction, and the post eviction interview.
