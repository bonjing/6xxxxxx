,TheGabber,2011-10-10T12:35Z,"When i burn this game in IMGBURN, i always get an error at start ""No Additional Sense information"".
Then it does 1 retry and everything works.
However when the disc is finalized, and starts to verify, it gives an error in every sector from 0-30.
Why do i always get this error, but only with this game?
All other games i burn dont get this error (like Gears of War 3 burns perfectly without this error).
Please help."

When I try to check the game on abgx360 for stealth it gives me the following

Error -..rrod-w4sm.iso- isn't recognized as an xbox 360 iso or stealth file!

All other games I download get stealth fine using abgx360, help me out please"
,Copnm,2011-10-17T02:47Z,"A quick tip for everyone who wants to download and for those who've already downloaded: I'd advise you NOT to burn or play this rip yet, wait for the release of C4e's PC DVD CFW to fully burn XGD3 games. If you do not, you have a probability of being flagged and banned from XBL.
