Thanks a lot for this great upload.
I'm a newbie to programming and I've found Tony Gaddis' starting with Python 2nd ed. to be of immense help.
I wish to ask for a favor... could you please upload the Solution Manuals and Test bank to Starting out with Python 2nd edition if you have access to it?
I just want to compare the codes I wrote for the exercises with the ones in the solution manual.

Thanks in advance.

Regards. "
