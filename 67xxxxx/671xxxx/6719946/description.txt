Starting Out with Python introduces students to the basics of programming and prepares them to go on to more complicated languages. With the knowledge acquired using Python, students gain confidence in their skills and acquire the logic necessary for developing high-quality programs. This book discusses control structures, functions, lists, and file I/O before introducing classes. As with all Gaddis texts, clear and easy-to-read code listings, concise and practical real-world examples, detail-oriented explanations, and an abundance of exercises appear in every chapter.

 

This book is ideal for a one-semester introductory programming course for students with limited programming experience.
