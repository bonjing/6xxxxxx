and

Myth in Human History

are TTC courses that seems very interesting. Are you able to find those dohduhdah? Two courses not really associated with my work but with my own research on my spare time. Have you been able to find any new math tutor material on your resources by the way? And i wonder if you have gotten any newly generated invites yet from bitme.org? I have so far been unlucky finding invites myself. It would have been great if i had som friends that was allowed on that site, for a ""knowledge-junkie"" like myself it is frustrating. :("
[V],dohduhdah,2011-10-06T06:12Z,"I only see an audio versioin of 'life lessons from the great myths', but the other one is available in video format. It might take me a while to upload it (upto two or more weeks).
I still don't have any bitme invites and there are other people waiting for new invites to become available, so that's also a bit of a problem.
I do have demonoid invites, and most of the stuff on bitme tends to show up there sooner or later."

Its very valuable, especially those i dont find on TPB or demonoid. As i mentioned earlier the math tutor courses are among those I look most for. Especially the course about learning to effectivelly use the HP50 calculator. I have that one and really need good instructions, the course name is

The HP50g Calculator Tutor: Volume 1

Math tutor have courses for several calculators like Texas Instruments and that one about the Hewlett Packard HP50g, and then I am still looking for the course about electronics

Engineering Circuit Analysis: Volume 1

But its good that volume 2 is soon to be released, maybe everyone are waiting for that one? If you find those in your resources dohduhdah, that would be much appreciated!"

It is people like you who make the difference."
