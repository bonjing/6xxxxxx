Omega Man (1971 Heston) You'll do what - 2011 Corp Gov Humanoids Killing Earth

History's desperately few 'sane' psychologists like Frankle, Adler, Maslow... would probably agree that clinically, all but 1 in 100,000 of us in 2011 America have been crippled / mutated, mentally sickened by our toxic culture of unlimited selfishness - rendering us nothing more than the deadly (to our selves and our children) addicted, mutant humanoids like in this grade B, but important movie.

What do you do?  Our insane corporate / government / next-door neighbors are / were / could be again - humans, part of your human family.

Punish them?  
Force them to behave as you want? 
 
Or do you devote everything you are and everything you have to the attempt to CURE them, in time?  This was Gandhi's, King's, Jesus approach, that we've not tried for many, many, many decades now.
