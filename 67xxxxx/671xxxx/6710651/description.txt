California Dreamin, The Songs of the Mamas & the Papas [2005]

California Dreamin' reminds us that '60s pop paragons The Mamas & The Papas had an appealing new sound, made some terrific records, and left behind a legacy that lives on more than 35 years after they called it quits. This hour-long documentary, originally aired on PBS, has all the standard elements of the genre: interviews (including some from 2004 and '05 with surviving members Michelle Phillips and Denny Doherty, as well as 1986 recollections by John Phillips, who died in '01, and a few brief words from Cass Elliot, who passed away in '74), photos, home movies, and a generous helping of music clips. The latter come from both television (Shindig!, Hollywood Palace, The Ed Sullivan Show) and concerts (Monterey Pop); some are totally lip-synced, some find the group singing to a pre-recorded track, and some are completely live. Almost all of the clips manage to convey the magic of a quartet that had a unique charm, both visually (the beautiful blonde Michelle, the corpulent Mama Cass) and musically (Doherty had perhaps the best singing voice, while John Phillips' songs and vocal arrangements were nearly the equal of, say, Brian Wilson's);
and all highlight their remarkable vocal blend, described by Lou Adler, their producer and label owner, as the sound of the Four Freshmen or the Hi-Lo's updated with a rock beat. The hits keep on coming, not only the familiar "California Dreamin'" and "Monday, Monday" but also "Creeque Alley," "Words of Love," their covers of the Beatles' "I Call Your Name"
and the Shirelles' "Dedicated to the One I Love," and at least a dozen more, including three bonus tunes not part of the original broadcast. All in all, this has to be the definitive Mamas & Papas video collection. --Sam Graham
