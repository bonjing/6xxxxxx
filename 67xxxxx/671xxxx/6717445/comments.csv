,Ba77l3Cry,2011-10-10T08:08Z,"i dont know whats up, but i tried running set up and it says the installer doesnt support 64bit version. to download the 32 bit... i double checked my system info and it says its 64bit. so i dunno whats going on? lol"
,Superstrac,2011-10-10T13:01Z,"@ acespades333 I don't really know what you mean. Can you explain a little further?
Ba77l3Cry: Do you have 2 program Files folders in the root drive? Program Files and Program Files (x86)? If so, you are running 64 bit windoze, if not you are running 32 bit windoze on a 64 bit capable computer perhaps? Let me know and we'll see what we can do. This is a great program, works fine for me!"
,ampttt,2011-10-10T22:51Z,"it gives me an error on instalation, could not performe instalation due an error on instaling shared components, can somebody help please"
,Superstrac,2011-10-11T14:41Z,I used to find that happened if I'd not long done a clean install of windoze. Have you done all windoze updates? I found that for some reason it would always install after I'd installed Microsoft office 2010 so maybe there is some dependancy issue. vcredist_x86.exe and/or vcredist_x64.exe available from Microsoft may help!
,EdWinchester,2011-10-18T21:42Z,Thank you Superstrac. How do I install the content packs for themes and effects? 
,digimike50,2011-10-20T06:30Z,Worked perfectly for me - no bugs or trojans - thanks very much!
