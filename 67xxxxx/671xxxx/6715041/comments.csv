,angelinio71,2011-10-19T22:54Z,"lailabagge and fairfex  stop working to your factories  because Greeks have no more money to buy cars from volkswagen,mercedes ,audi, bmw, products from Μakro,Μedia Μarkt,Ρraktiker,ALDI ,LIDL,Carrefour,Novartis , Bayer e.t.c.
the only thing they have is plenty of time to fuck your mothers, your sisters and your wifes  when they  come to Greece for holidays.

P.S
     Some Greeks can fuck your grandmothers  if they want too.
