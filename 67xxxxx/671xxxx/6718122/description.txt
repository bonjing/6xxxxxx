CAL TJADER BREEZE FROM THE EAST
Label :Verve
Released: 1963
Format:Mp3@320

After a series of storming latin-jazz albums for Fantasy vibist Cal Tjader made a series of unusual 'world-jazz music' albums with producer Creed Taylor for Verve in the early-60's. The best of these were the oriental-based albums Several Shades of Jade and Breeze From the East. The albums were lavishly presented - Breeze From the East famous print by Japanese artist Hokusai. Straddling both lounge-music and jazz the albums are immaculately recorded and Tjader always manages to create wonderful moods despite the laid-back nature of much of the compositions. Whilst Lalo Schifrin scored the earlier Several Shades of Jades, arranger Stan Applebaum added guitars, flute, celeste and Dick Hyman on organ for this session. The combination of Tjaders combo and the new instruments works wonderfully - highlights being Leyte and Fujiwhich retain elements of Tjaders' latin roots despite the eastern setting.
