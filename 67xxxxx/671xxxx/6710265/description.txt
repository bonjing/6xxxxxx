The Allman Brothers Band
Atlantic City, NJ 11/13/10

OFFICIAL RELEASE [320k MP3]

This show at the Trump Taj Mahal featured the rare Gambler's Roll, appropriate for the casino venue, as well as plenty of other treats and hot jams!

Who To Believe is another rare tune that shows up here, and this version is nothing less than ferocious!  A super bluesy Hoochie Coochie Man is another highlight of Disc One on this set.

Disc Two continues the surprises with a knockout version of Bob Dylan's classic It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry.  Perhaps the most noteworthy song from this show is an experimental Jessica that goes all the way out there before returning to the structure of the song.

This show is a can't-lose bet!
