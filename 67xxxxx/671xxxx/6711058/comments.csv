,sampiero,2011-09-30T20:47Z,It's the 40's not 60'
,musicfromrizzo,2011-09-30T20:57Z,I apologize sampiero for the error - I caught it while the torrent hadn't even finished posting yet - however it was too late to catch it without using an edit function and the folks here don't seem to think that's a better way to work it would seem. or maybe its a bug that does that years to fix - in any event the torrent files themselves are clearly labelled so no one could seriously download it by mistake I would think - unless they have difficulty seeing or reading - I submit! Michael Rizzo - these aren't great 320s - its 40s material - but someone must think they are worth more so here we have them too - our 160k vbr torrent of the 40s is great though too
