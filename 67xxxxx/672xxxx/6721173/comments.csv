,33wearhilton41,2011-10-05T07:14Z,"thanks again wmi,where were you you were missed"
,phoenix_ca,2011-10-05T07:20Z,"Thanks, WMI. Even if this set is, as you say, the Porsche 914 of FG sets, it's still Virginia.

But I agree. It seems like the photographer is using a digital point-and-shoot camera. Which is fine for vacation snapshots, but not for model photography."
,Wu-jia416,2011-10-05T07:31Z,Where's Fame-Girls Sandra Set 167? There's one but it's only 17 mb. 
,Wu-jia416,2011-10-05T09:12Z,@DigieraMandela Thank you.  I know it's the full set. I just wanted one with better resolutuion. I only did two lil searches and only found yours.  I like it when they're around 3-4 hundred mb.
,Ludwig55,2011-10-05T10:54Z,"Welcome back, WMI.
(+1 to Your posting, -100 to the quality of pics)
She wears no pants and there are a lot of nipslips pics, but today she poses like a piece of wood.
I know, that there are a lot of guys, who like Virginia because of her stripping pics, but this is stripping without any teasing.
