,ahorwood,2011-10-09T12:38Z,"Thanks sceneline people. Very nice quality.

BTW ignore the wanker who said this was fake; it is not. It is the correct episode and it is in 720p HD with excellent sound."
,vip600,2011-10-10T03:35Z,Thanks
,partmaps1,2011-10-10T10:21Z,Corrupt file you dumb fucking dopey cunt
,emeraldfiction,2011-10-12T15:24Z,"This is a fake file, all other episode released for Mentalist by this uploader are fakes too. When you try to extract it you will get a CRC Failed Error."
,kit223,2011-10-15T06:18Z,I don't know if its fake but there is definitely something wrong with this file.  It plays fine on my PC using regular Windows Media Player but will not play on my stand alone WD media player.  This is the second time this has happened with a file from this uploader.
,roumor,2011-10-17T12:23Z,"Its just all the TLA shit is not HD. they resize ordinary videos so the picture looks blurry.

but video itself works fine. i didn't have crc problems mentioned above. Fuck TLA anyway"
