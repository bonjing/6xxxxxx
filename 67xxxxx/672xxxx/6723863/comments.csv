,samvedvora,2011-10-06T22:19Z,"gives me this error: ""unfortunately we could not locate your purchase in android market. please uninstall this copy before installing a new one"""
,salmansk,2011-10-07T05:11Z,there was a fix which worked which said that titanium backup pro would freeze the market app ... so the market won't check for the license :-)
,samvedvora,2011-10-07T08:44Z,so what steps should i perform to ensure that it would work? i love this theme!
,salmansk,2011-10-07T13:49Z,"1.download titanium backup..
2.and than freez the market using titanium backup so it wont check for licence..."
,salmansk,2011-10-07T13:53Z,"and there is one more easiest way.....
if its possible for u to not use internet on your phone......
so it wont check licence....."

,world_star,2011-10-09T05:57Z,its not working on xperia arc. the app doesnt show up in menu.. what shud i do to fix it?
,salmansk,2011-10-09T06:11Z,"the problem is you connected app to internet and it check for licence in the market and licence dosent belongs to your phone so it removes the icon...so 

1.install droid wall or titanium backup......and freeze the market app using droid wall or titanuim backup whichever u like....

2.unintall and than reinstall spb shell than it will work ......done...."

,pannic,2011-10-21T03:15Z,"For anyone still having problems, you need to install titanium backup pro (not the rooted version). Droid wall doesnt work for me. When you have both applications installed, you'll want to freeze SPB Shell in titanium backup and there you have it."
,RomanCl,2011-10-25T09:17Z,This is an awesome launcher no doubt. But whyyyyy the heeellllll would anybody put off using the market or slash the internet just for a launcher? Stupidest shit I've ever heard of.
,arcaias,2011-10-30T13:25Z,"there are better apps for the ""market"" than the stock one."
,ashmactor,2012-01-21T17:23Z,"please give me the activation code for this!!
