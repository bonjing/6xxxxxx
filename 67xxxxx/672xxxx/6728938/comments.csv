,aarque,2011-10-08T18:12Z,"I was called out because it says ""ICE""??? Actually I was called out because I FREAKING CRAVE BEING CALLED OUT. HELL I WILL FUCKING CALL MYSELF OUT IF NOBODY DOES IT. WHY? WHY THE FUCK, YOU ASK?? BECAUSE I DON'T EVEN FUCKING EXIST IN MY OWN FUCKING MIND UNLESS I SEE LITTLE TEENY ASCII CHARACTERS THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY SOMEHOW RELATE TO ME. THAT IS HOW FUCKING DEPRIVED I AM, CAN'T YOU ALL SEE THAT?? YOU ARE ALL HURLING ABUSE WHEN YOU SHOULD BE PPIITTYYIINNGG MMEE!!!! I am sorry to be so brutally honest but I needed to get that off my troll chest. Now I will go back under my rock and lick my bruised ego.

And hello, ""anonymous,"" did you miss the ""pirate"" in The Pirate Bay? Or are you pirating this torrent tracker to share what is already freely available on the net? Some corsair you are.
Everyone else, don't you know it is the first rule of TPB to avoid anonymous torrents? You look for the little pink or green skull&crossbones, something the troll will NEVER have, which indicates the uploader is respected, appreciated and much less likely to share malware, sheesh.

And you frikkin Clem, ya doorknob. Your bandwidth is most likely capped by your ISP. mine tops at about 175k/sec. I don't care how many people seed it, I won't get it any faster, either will you. It clogs the torrent trackers to add torrents so there is no point in adding freeware torrents, unless you want to get TPB to add MORE banners and pop-ups to pay for the increased traffic."

Many of the repaints in this package are old and outdated - I checked.

Just to stress:  This sh*t is freeware! What kind of idiot would waste bandwidth and time downloading freeware stuff from here?"
