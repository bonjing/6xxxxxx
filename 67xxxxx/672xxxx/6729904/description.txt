The book is divided into three sections. 

Part One: Ancient Disasters, looks at disasters from long ago. The book opens, ironically enough, with a doomsday disaster by exploring the possible causes for the mass extinction of dinosaurs. The second disaster, The Wrath of Vesuvius, continues with a look at the volcanic eruption that buried Pompeii 2,000 years ago.

Part Two: Man-Made Disasters, presents in-depth explorations of the Johnstown Flood and the wreck of the Titanic, two terrifying events in which human arrogance, combined with the cruelty of nature, resulted in terrible loss of life.

Part Three: Natural Disasters, provides hands-on activities that explain earthquakes and hurricanes. The overarching theme of this section is that while nothing can prevent these natural events, people can prepare and be ready when they strike.
