,markice1,2011-11-13T18:58Z,"Thanks for the upload. Once installed it keeps asking me to activate Windows. I then click activate and it says that it is already activated. It then logs off. I then try login again and the process repeats. Why is this happening? Is it because Windows detects that I am not in Europe, so the activation is not valid in my part of the world?"
,folerx,2011-11-17T19:16Z,"markice1, use some xp activator."
,joe1897,2012-03-19T08:26Z,"This doesn't work. As markice1 said, it keeps saying to activate windows and do not let you login in. No way to activate windows xp in virtual PC environment."
