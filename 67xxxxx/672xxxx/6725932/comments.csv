,whokilledbambi,2011-10-07T15:42Z,"@drewkrew :
From what I've heard, the P stands for Pre. As in, not retail released yet. However, I've only ever seen it in reference to Bollywood movies. "
,mstikhor,2011-10-07T16:56Z,"PDVD - P stands for Pirated not Pre  :)

PDVDs are usually sold by movie bootleggers. A PDVD is usually an asian silver or, telesync copy of a movie, that has been encoded to DVD. Quality varies of course. PDVDs are widely availible throughout some countries at an extremely low price.

I've finished the download and it's a CAM source, so in my opinion it's a bit taboo to use DVDrip in the title of a torrent thats clearly a CAM but if it is labelled as PiratedDVDrip then i guess thats fair enough and it should have been me that realised it was potentially a cam source and not a true DVDrip or variant upon that.
Thanks once again.
