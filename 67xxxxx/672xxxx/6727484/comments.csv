I actually spoke with an operator and I was then put through their IVR line and given a code (ending in 037696). What I have noticed, however, is that every so often it defaults to the screen showing that is is not activated, even though after I followed your instructions it showed that Office 2010 Professional Pus was activated. At first I thought it was only happening when I was restarting my computer, but it also happens when I have an Office application open. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Sorry for the long-winded message, but I wanted to ensure that I had expalined the problem in detail.      "

if you are copying and pasting to ms-word 2010, it will be bubbling the size of your files to 7-8 larger than the original size.
has anyone realised that?
to return to its real size, i have to resave it with ms-word 2007. is there any cure to this mambo-jumbo product of micro$oft?

I seeded for a few days greatly appreciate it mate.
I have used any of the programs yet, but the installed just fine. But I have a question for anyone that can answer.

I noticed that Groove is not in the package, is that SharePoint Workspace program the equivalent? And if it is will it communicate with Groove work spaces and Groove users?

Thanks again mate!

Everything will still work even after the activation period expires. You will just get annoying notices reminding you to activate everytime you open an office application. And when you open an application you will see a red bar on your toolbar. That's all. Everything is still fully functional."
,Xeginy,2011-12-03T03:37Z,"Great download, thanks a lot.

If anyone is having trouble, make sure to download the activator (the link is in the description above.) And when you're actually installing office, make sure to disconnect your internet beforehand.

The activation code wasn't valid for me, either. But just be patient; once you get on the phone with an actual person, they'll give you the correct code. I only had to tell the guy the first few numbers of the access code I had already input, and that was enough.

Again, thanks a lot. This has been a god send."

Steps that worked for me:

2. Open "" Microsoft Office 2010 Professional Plus x86 & x64 SP1"" -- If you installed the  VCD then it should be of type "" Virtual Clone Drive "" 

3. When you double click, it should open it up as a separate drive --- look under ""Computer"" - Should be BD-Rom drive....

4. Open up either ""x64"" or ""x86"" depending on which one you want

5. TURN OFF CONNECTION TO THE INTERNET----- THIS STEP IS CRUCIAL ------

6. Run the setup.exe in the respective folder

,haveatit,2012-04-07T04:02Z,After a few years of use I just started getting the 30 day usage countdown every time I open the program... It is asking for a Reg Key. Thoughts?
,Nnaut,2012-04-14T14:23Z,"Hi guys
Okay I installed this about a month ago and only today it said i have 4 days left. Ive uninstalled and reinstalled and it keeps saying the same thing

Wat happens after it expires, does it not work, does it keep working or wat?"
,zxxxz1,2012-04-15T12:15Z,Thanks man. You are the best!
,isengoethe,2012-04-15T12:21Z,"What happens if I don't ever update, turn on automatic updates from windows security center. Does it still run a 30-day countdown trial? I'm using windows xp."

,LeoJan,2012-04-16T16:06Z,"I never had any problems with your great uploads thethingy. But this time everything went wrong. I phoned and got the answer to be a victim of a non official program after I gave my activation number. I lost my office 2007 in the progress. Now I am going to try to upload your office 2007, keep my fingers crossed :)"
,xpmule,2012-04-18T14:45Z,"WOW are you people ACTUALY phoning Microsoft and activating pirated software ?
You HAVE got to be kidding me !
That is PURE insanity !

When SP1 was released i downloaded it from here on another torrent and used this..

There is something wrong with you people if you calling anyone for activations, get your heads examined seriously"

Thanks for the upload."
,tops.c,2012-05-15T19:25Z,I did the phone in thing the lady never asks me nothing personable just if I was just using the product on 1 machine what was the key/phone # ? 
,tops.c,2012-05-15T19:32Z,"I just found to install you can use this code #  Microsoft Office 2010 (install code);
0000-0000-00000-00000-00000-00000-00000-00365

Then call."
,GrampaD26354,2012-05-16T23:38Z,"@tops.c: no, that doesn't work. 

There are two kinds of Volume Licenses for Office: MAK and KMS. 

KMS is the enterprise version, and requires a real or fake KMS server to work. This torrent is KMS.

MAK is the version that will work over the phone. This torrent is NOT the MAK version.

The Volume Activation Management Tool 2.0 says that my Windows key, which I got from Dreamspark cause I'm a student, is MAK. But it says that my Office installation, which I installed from this torrent, is KMS."
,GrampaD26354,2012-05-16T23:40Z,"@tops.c: nope, it doesn't work with this torrent."

,armchair.53,2012-05-21T02:34Z,"this may have worked at some point but does not work now.  The two product ids are no longer valid. I'm sure MS figured out what was going on after a while.  What really brothers me, however, as I went to uninstall office, it would not uninstall!!
This version of office is doing strange things even thought it does install and you can use the programs for 30 days..."

,dmnca,2012-05-24T11:13Z,"Hi guys, this is for you beginners. Most of you are trying to get answers because you did not succeed in installing ms2010. Let me tell you something first. This release is still working perfectly.
I downloaded 3 months ago however; I only did install it two days ago. It worked perfectly. Why did it work for most of us and not you? The answer is simple. You do not follow the instructions well.
I did activate it via a Dutch phone number. I did not speak with an operator. I just followed the phone instructions. What you do not know in the instructions included in this torrent download is the questions asked after providing the codes to the automated system is where you bought the software an if it was for private use or professional use. Of course the answers are, for private and at the shop.
So, guys, just try to follow the instructions. 
My thanks go to thethingy "

,delfell,2012-05-29T15:50Z,Brilliant downloaded in 36 mins and works fine and activated. I used micro torrent this time and recognised it straight away as iso. Downloaded with bitcomet last time and it didn't recognise the file? So don't know what happened there? Thanks again and keep up the good work. 
,Teritha,2012-05-30T16:54Z,"I downloaded this torrent a month ago, it worked great 

But now I have notifications saying I have 'x amount of days' left to activate this product

What can I do to stop these notifications?"
,eykei,2012-05-30T21:01Z,"1) Mount the ISO. if you dont have a mounter, download mount image pro for free.
2) Install

the product will only work for 30 days before it starts saying you need a valid license key. you must activate it with EZ activator, like others have said.
here's the link for the 100th time.
