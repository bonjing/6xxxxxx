Otis Ray Redding, Jr. (September 9, 1941 â€“ December 10, 1967) was an American soul
singer-songwriter and record producer. He was born in Dawson, Georgia, and later moved to
Macon, Georgia, where he began touring with blues guitarist Johnny Jenkins and served as
the lead singer in the band Otis Redding and The Pinetoppers. He signed a contract with
record label Stax Records and released his debut album Pain in My Heart in 1964. This
album produced several successful singles, including "These Arms of Mine".

Although he was not very successful among white audiences in the United States, the
opposite was true in Europe. His performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967 was one
of his last big concerts until his death in a plane crash at the age of 26. One month later,
"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay" was released, which sold about 4 million copies worldwide
and would be his biggest hit. Redding is seen to be one of the major figures in soul R&B; and
this eventually resulted in the honorific nickname "King of Soul" a title also given to 
American musicians James Brown and Sam Cooke.
