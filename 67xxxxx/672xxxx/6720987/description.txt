  It launched with massive fanfare and a radical agenda to change the   
  way news was reported. It offered anonymity to whistleblowers and a   
  platform to freely publish information to a global audience.          
  WikiLeaks was an instant sensation as it exposed the hidden deeds of  
  governments and corporations. But now its controversial founder       
  Julian Assange finds himself isolated - deserted by many of his       
  former partners and friends and fighting extradition. His             
  organisation is damaged and cant currently receive the leaks that    
  are its lifeblood. Can WikiLeaks survive?
