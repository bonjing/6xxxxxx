,.h10.,2011-10-15T14:43Z,-1 for it not being latest comodo tools and for one exe containing a trojan
,Sarrio,2011-10-29T16:42Z,@.h10.  People like you are so stupid nowadays -.- OFCOURSE your anti-virus will detect a cracked .exe file as a virus... why? BECAUSE IT'S ILLEGAL FFS. HOW STUPID CAN YOU BE?
,.h10.,2011-11-01T01:38Z,"Sarrio, I'm not stupid at all and I've been uploader in the past. this torrent was a total misfire and comodo is one of those free anti viruses you should avoid. especially when it's not the latest of their products."
,Sarrio,2011-11-04T02:44Z,"@.h10. Just cause you've been uploader in the past, does not make you a pro. You have absolutely no experience with Viruses.  So yes, you are stupid.  Because most Cracked files are detected as viruses but they still work, and that so called ""virus"" actually supports the file. It doesn't destroy your system. Noob -.- and I don't care? Maybe you shouldn't search for Comodo in the first place."
