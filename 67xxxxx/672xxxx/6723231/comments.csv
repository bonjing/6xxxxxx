,rsl87,2011-10-06T18:11Z,SEED.. i'm uploading 8x more than downloading.. and that's just not right
,rsl87,2011-10-07T19:13Z,"Alright I downloaded and watched it on my HD tv with surround sound. Good quality video but the audio is not true 5.1. The ""ViSiON"" 4g 720p file has much better audio and the picture quality is almost identical. Still good quality but I'm sticking with the other file I have. Thanks for the upload though!"
