,jareehDr0,2011-10-06T13:58Z,@extremezone Whats your real name please?? :)
,useitright,2011-10-06T14:41Z,the zone is so awesome that if you were to hear his real name your head would explode  
,Pdid,2011-10-06T15:32Z,Hey I sell drugs! Want my real name too? Either stupid for asking or a rat lol
,nightyman,2011-10-06T15:53Z,"@useitright  True story there mate. Had a horrible experience were a friend happened to come by his real name on the internet while i was playing wow next to him, I still havent successfully picked all the pieces of his brain from my keyboard yet..    
Thanks for the upload!"
,ashen77,2011-10-06T19:24Z,"Yeah X, could you give me your address while your telling jareehDr0 your name? I'll send 
you a xmas card "
,looneycooney,2011-10-06T19:29Z,"Thanks for these great great movies! 
I've been a fan of your work for years now , unfortunately soon piratebay will be blocked by my provider , which lost a lawsuit for not blocking piratebay...pity ..they tried for years explaining that it wasn't their duty to block it from their users . Just too bad the belgian authorities now decided piratebay has to be blocked . I do hope however our providers will have a chance to fight back in the future . 
I'll have to fall back on mIRC i guess, been years i've used it , any tips on mIRC-servers would be nice though :-) "
,myra_0984,2011-10-06T21:20Z,awesome! thank you sooo much! can u please upload the movie ONE DAY of anne hathaway pls?
,canadianlonewolf,2011-10-06T22:42Z,"Whats with the freak wanting extreme's real name?

Thanks for the up"
,bragazar1710,2011-10-06T22:57Z,thanks.
,-_-...,2011-10-06T22:59Z,I bet you extreme is Canadian.
,mickmac56,2011-10-06T23:49Z,jareehDRO.Quick message.Fuck off !!
[V],extremezone,2011-10-07T00:00Z,"no i'm romanian and i'm proud with this

jareehDr0-do you want to send you my address too?"
,Tetjes1989,2011-10-07T01:05Z,@looneycooney: Our providers won't translate the name thepiratepay to it's IP address. But i guess we can use proxyhiders like hidemyass to get access to thepiratebay from Belgium. And if that doesn't work then we'll have to edit our host file that takes care of the DNS ourselves. They won't take away thepiratebay from me that's for sure ...
,Tetjes1989,2011-10-07T01:10Z,And btw Looneycooney: Try searching for depiraatbaai. It's a new domain name that thepiratebay workers gave for people in Belgium. www.thepiratebay.org is being forbidden. So they just made another domain name ;)
,Specialhigh,2011-10-07T02:14Z,Just noticed that like 95% of all my downloads are from extremezone
,shabbamanuk,2011-10-07T02:15Z,i think his name is brian or keith.
,majestika,2011-10-07T07:12Z,"Have to post this here.
There were two pirates on Pirate Bay,
Who uploaded great movies every day,
Extremezone is one and then there's Bone,
Up until now, no one can claim their throne.

LOL, I crack my self up..too many beers waiting for another Extremezone torrent to finish!! 
But now I really have to ask out  of curiosity.Is Transylvania really a small village in the mountains that local people really fear?"
,pmas,2011-10-07T07:36Z,"Transylvania is actually this piss-ass small speed trap town on the Mississippi River in mosquito infested backass Louisiana. The water tower in the town has a big black bat painted on it. The motto should be ""this place sucks"" and I know firsthand for I got arrested there for speeding(and telling the cop to fuck off, which is why I got arrested) and spent 3 frickin days there until my budddy wired me some cash. The f@ckin jail cell had a hole in the wall and fire ants came through at night and ate my ass up while I was asleep...plus no air conditioning in...oh late August when it is hotter than f@ck. It does exist and IT DOES SUCK! Thx extreme...you could never suck and please run for president!"
,mizhop,2011-10-07T13:37Z,"What an awesome comments section!  I also think extreme is awesome, and they should make a little gold crown for him in place of the skull, because the man should be the freaking king of TPB, if he can't be in Romania.

Any comments on the file... anyone?"
,malch,2011-10-07T18:04Z,"This is a good quality RIP and a surprisingly good flick too. Well worth the d/l.
