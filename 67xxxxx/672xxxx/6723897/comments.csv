,illiria,2011-10-06T21:00Z,"Yes, of course every DLC is available in complete edition. They are all repacked.
Every DLC, latest official patch, latest unofficial patch, and a few other things. The address of the original torrent, by the way:

,trisaratops,2011-10-28T09:56Z,"is this to be used in conjunction with your previous release? If so, do I just copy an paste the whole iso to a specific directory an then run this app? No matter what download of Fallout 3 I get, I always seem to get to the main menu, start a game and in the loading screen, it just crashes an dies :/ any help would be appreciated... this problem also occured with your version of the game."
