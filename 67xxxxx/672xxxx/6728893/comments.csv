Sorry, this was compiled on a windows machine and I don't have a mac to test.  That's almost certainly the issue though."
,xidio,2011-10-09T05:40Z,"Could you by any chance do this very thing, but without the Portal mod and Optifine installed?

If I manually try to remove the portal mod and all files associated the game gets me a blackscreen.
And if I add Optifine (greatly enhances fps even on high end PCs) it also gives me a blackscreen.

I own the original game and the only reason I downloaded this was cause I never got the latest Buildcraft to work with 1.8.1, this has all I need except optifine.

One last thing, why dont my pipes function as they should? If I left click on em they just drop off and I cannot re-arrange the Iron pipes."

You should be able to take care of the portal gun by just removing both the folder and .zip file in the /mods folder.

Regarding optifine, I don't THINK it's compatible with Forge, but if it is, or becomes that way, I'll include it in another torrent.

Finally, to change direction of the iron pipe, you need a wrench.

Which is:
 Iron, Blank, Iron
Blank, Stone Gear, Blank
Blank, Iron, Blank"
