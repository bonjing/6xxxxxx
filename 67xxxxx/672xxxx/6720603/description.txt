I really like Jenna Petersenâ€™s historicals and THE SECRETS OF A LADY was no exception. Her writing is fluent and fast-paced, mixing the spy stuff and the romance nicely together, she does a great job of balancing them in a way that neither takes the upper hand, yet theyâ€™re both strong elements in the book. Especially the second half kept me turning the pages quicker and quicker as to find out what would happen next.

In fewer than 200 pages Jenna Petersen penned a well-rounded story and gives characters with depth to them. A story of betrayal in different forms, a deeply rooted love and a happy end that resonated with me because of the battle fought to get to it.
