Because abgx360 is not updated yet to process XGD3 rips, this torrent contains the XBC log as "proof" of all the stealth data being ripped properly. If you don't know what I'm talking about, just ignore my last statement and fetch the files already. =)

There's also a small PDF file included with instructions how to burn with ImgBurn 2.5.5.0, for whoever needs a tutorial.
