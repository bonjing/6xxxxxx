The Day Street Brothel busted down the doors of the Kingston Ontario Hard Rock scene in March of 2009 with their debut album, THE DAY STREET BROTHEL, a CD full of hard rock at its finest, & an essential addition to any music loverâ€™s library. The disc boasts such hits as â€œHeaven Sentâ€, which received radio play on Kingstonâ€™s K-Rock 105.7 & is featured on U.S compilation CD Auditory Assault on the Bare Metal Records label. Standout songs including â€œSpeechlessâ€, â€œUntrueâ€, & â€œTales From The Day Street Brothelâ€ have become crowd favorites at many live DSB events.

In March 2010, Doug would come in at a very close 2nd in a songwriting contest hosted by Rockstar Supernova front man Lukas Rossi, with the following statement issued by Lukas Rossi himself â€“ â€œWe would like to give Honorable Mention and a special Ontario shout-out to Douglas Smith of Day Street Brothel! Dougâ€™s entry was killer and we were very impressed. We would like to invite Doug and his mates to the next Lukas Rossi show in Ontario as our guests.

The bandâ€™s sophomore album, THE GOOD GIRL YOU WERE BEFORE, continues in the same formula as THE DAY STREET BROTHEL album, combining Dougâ€™s dynamic vocals with arena ready melodies, gravely lyrics with crowd-pleasing riffs to churn out a record full of fist-pumping rock. With standout tracks like â€œI Donâ€™tâ€, which is featured on The Kill City Vol 30 Metal compilation out of Hollywood CA on 272 Records, â€œIâ€™m Alive (Because Of You)â€, & â€œGonna Make You Mineâ€, the latter being featured on the 2008 compilation CD â€œChill Outâ€ on Quickstar Productions label out of Maryland, donâ€™t be surprised if you find The Day Street Brothel at the top of the rock charts and beyond, with their music appealing to rock fans and non-rock fans alike.
