I don't understand... Was your intent to troll other uploaders? Did you find a torrent that actually had a virus? Somehow magically were transported here before you managed to comment on this other torrent? Or you just walk around torrent not belonging to eztv and tell folks they are dirty?

I'm thinking, just maybe, you are indeed a fuckwit...."
,w-mute78,2011-10-08T00:37Z,"All that being said, I love you EZ and it's been quite sometime since i grabbed anyone else's torrents for my television. Good lookin. Keep up the good work."

,Jamesb101,2011-10-10T09:52Z,"@train wreq

I hate to admit it but you are right, this one has a cheesy feel to it. Still ok but it's different to all other episodes I have seen."
