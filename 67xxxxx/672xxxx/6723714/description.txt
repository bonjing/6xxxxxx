THE WAR OF GODS

Ancient world of Bellarion struggles  in  the  neverending
war of Gods. Conflict has aroused  when  Xarax,  ruler  of
Gods of Bellarion, was murdered.  Each  of  the  remaining
Gods claimed the right for the Divine Throne.  After  many
quarrels, they all agreed that  they  should  arrange  the
Ultimate Challenge in which all the Gods would cross their
powers to show who is the most powerful to rule them  all.
But the Gods who failed were still not willing  to  submit
to the winner. They summoned their armies and attacked the
worshipers  of  other  Gods.  By  the  deaths   of   their
worshipers, Gods lost part of their  power  and  weakened.
This deed could not have been left without reply.

After 2000 years of battles, Bellarion lies in ruins. Vast
black deserts of ashes,  chasms  sinking  into  the  lava,
earth torn and frozen into the lifeless glacier  â€“  thatâ€™s
what  most of Bellarion remained. Gods with  their  armies
fortified in the heavily protected fortresses  and  sealed
their territories with deadly magic traps. All those years
the battle was drawn. Nobody could win. Untill...

The God of Darkness, Mortagorn, found a  new  weapon.  New
Clerics from his castles  appeared  in  the  battlefields.
Each of them armed with a pale crystal at the end of their
staves. When a cold light shone at the direction of  their
enemies, soldiers just fell dead to  the  ground.  Neither
magical nor physical protection was effective.

As the last hope, Arswaargh,  the  God  of  Fire,  created
Vivien from his own astral body and sent her  through  the
space and time to seek other worlds where there  might  be
the counter-weapon he needed.

The game starts when Vivien opens her eyes in the world of
Antasion, completely unknown for her. Unfortunately,  when
Vivien traveled through  the  magical  portal  to  another
world, she disrupted the divine balance of the  new  world
and her own divine essence was scattered into  sparks  and
absorbed equally by the  gods  of  Antasion.  Without  her
divine essence, Vivien becomes a  mortal  being  as  other
inhabitants of Antasion. She must seek the  Gods  of  this
new world, gain back her power and seek the counter-weapon
against Mortagornâ€™s death crystals.
