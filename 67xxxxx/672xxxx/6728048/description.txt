Here`s a new album from the Greenwich Farm man Earl Zero, famed for some of the deepest roots from the 70`s, appearing on the Freedom Sounds, Addis Ababa and Arab labels amongst them. Some 30 years later he teams up with producer Roberto Sanchez who is based at his A-Lone Ark Muzik studio in Spain. The production befits the elder rootsman with its all live instrumentation, supplied by the Lone Ark Riddim Force, and sitting comfortabley into an early 80`s Channel One feel and style. The album comes showcase style all the way, and the dubs complement the vocals fully.
