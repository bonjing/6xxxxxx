    Honey Fisher has become a powerful man in this small Western town        
    that has grown up around gold-prospecting fields. Fisher and his gang    
    have managed, through swindling, murder, and terror, to gain leases      
    on the important gold-yielding land in the area. A state commissioner    
    comes to town to review the leases, which are crucial to Fisher's        
    power. Cat Stevens and Hutch Bessy join forces with circus performers    
    and townsfolk led by Stevens' friend Finch to fight against Fisher       
    and his henchmen.
