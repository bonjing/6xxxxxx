Apart from that, thanks for the up. Looked forward to the next episode."
,IncredibleX,2011-10-07T22:08Z,Thanks for upload but i still do not understand why youre using a rar mode. I though it ended at the begginingof the 21th century.

,Isayama,2012-01-20T18:45Z,"Same here, I really appreciate all your efforts and good torrents, but why do you keep raring them? Now if I have an alternative, I go for the unrared ones... People with slow connexion wouldn't go for 720p I guess... So what's the point? Please tell us your reason and we'll stop bothering you! Anyway, thanks for the sharing."
