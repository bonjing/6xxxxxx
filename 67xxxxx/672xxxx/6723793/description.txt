What the Nashville singer and songwriter does throughout the home-recorded and tinkered-with recordings on Novel reminds me of Mitchell, absolutely â€” the overlay of cool harmonies on oscillating rhythm-guitar figures sometimes reminds me of Mitchell's 1976 Hejira. Strangely enough, I also hear in my mind's ear a very odd combination of Carly Simon's tales of romantic disappointment and the slightly jazzy tone of Phoebe Snow. I've often mused over the result of an imaginary collaboration between Brian Eno and Simon, and Novel is almost it.

That's a compliment to Siskind â€” except I have to say I don't think she's as good as either Eno or Carly Simon. What's missing for me is any sense that she's involved in the literal aspect of her words â€” her big voice is certainly amazing. Siskind zeroes in on a note like someone very happy to be letting loose in what I'd call the Great American Modal Tradition. The melodies of such songs as "Take Me" and "I Think About Love" derive from The Beatles' "Norwegian Wood" and a thousand raga-rock hits of the past, and Siskind sings them fiercely.
