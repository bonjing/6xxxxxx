PRECALCULUS, Fifth Edition, focuses on teaching the essentials that students need to both fulfill their precalculus requirement and be fully prepared to succeed in calculus. The text presents an integrated review of algebra and trigonometry while covering fundamental calculus concepts, and providing the solid grounding in analysis and graphing that is necessary to make a successful transition to calculus. This streamlined text provides all the mathematics that students need--without bogging them down in review material or overwhelming them with too much, too soon. The authors have purposely kept this book, unlike many available Precalculus books, at a length that can be covered in one term.
