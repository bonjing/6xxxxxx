,firewithfire22,2011-10-06T19:40Z,does this include co-op or has that been removed?
,hitmanino,2011-10-06T20:22Z,"0.3 % in 2 hours :'( by the time i finished downloading this Rage 2 will be out.thx DibyaTPB i hope it's gonna work,i trust Blackbox rips."
,elturbo9077,2011-10-06T21:24Z,same here come on does blackbox have tracker or not mine says eta  in 2 years 
,Litu26,2011-10-06T22:22Z,does it have sound issues or textures issues?Former rip i installed had some sound and FPS bugs.
,mrmouth,2011-10-06T22:39Z,"^ I think the game is in serious need of patching all around, not a rip issue.

 And you guys should really just plunk down the $7 for a file sharing account if you want to DL something this popular, quickly. Worth it considering what is coming out in the next month.

 As for the game - Im having the same issue I had with F1 2011 - after using the launcher the game doesn't start after esc from splash screen. And Ive added it to the exceptions in Comodo that got F1 to work. So go figure. Attack of another shitty launcher. 
"
,dumas1000,2011-10-07T05:30Z,"$7, not that big of a deal. But leaving a traceable record of your illegal Internet activities is pretty stupid. "
,oliverklozoff,2011-10-07T05:37Z,this game is unplayable until they provide a patch as the graphic textures loading up when you turn your position in the game is annoying
,.l.l.l.l.,2011-10-07T06:03Z,"cmon i hoped black box to do it better ...
about 7 gigs but 11 is way out of my league
i better buy it"
,.l.l.l.l.,2011-10-07T06:05Z,but ya gotta admire compressing it down to 11 from 18-19 gigs
,abhi6780,2011-10-07T08:37Z,"Please can anybody tell me is this torrent work?
Is the game videos riped to low quality?
At last is the game works?"
,Dr_Nick_,2011-10-07T08:48Z,"It wasn't compressed down from 19GB. Multiplayer and the 2.2GB of language packs were removed.

Still, it's not bad getting it down to a sensible size. I'm gonna hate downloading SWTOR when it's released."
,sp4wners,2011-10-07T16:11Z,Why the fuck there are always must be less seeds than leechers if the game is good? Seed people!

Iam also downloading it from other source(direct links).By the way is it working properly?Is the blackbox rip is crash free and all the cutscenes are working properly?"
,retado,2011-10-08T18:22Z,Does this one need the crack fix + missing files like the Skidrow release?
,noni901,2011-10-08T19:00Z,"Ok , For You New Guys that are uplading at 1kbps did t ever come to your mind that uploading at high speeds get you downloads at high speeds.Because the people re getting files you have from you and ones you dont have from others and than they upload em to you. Ok thx. Btw For You mentally challenged , put upload speed on unlimited or minimum 50kbps for good download speeds"
,sr2005,2011-10-08T21:36Z,Rage-BLACKBOX uses skidrow crack and only multiplayer is ripped.So the skidrow crack fix + missing files must be worked on this.Atleast I hope so.

,dumas1000,2011-10-13T04:42Z,"You have to update your driver if you are getting the rage has stopping working error. I actually purchased the retail version and even the retail version crashes. I installed the first update too, and it still crashes. You have to download and install ""amd_catalyst_rage_performance_driver."" It has nothing to do with the pirated copy, with the rip, repack, or crack. Too bad trying to install that driver crashed my computer, leading to a blue screen of death and a system restore/startup recovery. I actually have to take my laptop down to Best Buy to get tech support. Hopefully, they will be able to install the driver for me. It is sad that the actual retail copy of Rage doesn't work out of the box for many people. That is simply inexcusable."

,Sinister181,2011-10-15T18:20Z,"Nevermind. I fixed the problem. The missing textures were the result of Catalyst AI Texture filtering. If anyone else has this problem AFTER applying the hotfix, try switching between performance and quality under Catalyst AI Texture filtering options for their graphics card."
