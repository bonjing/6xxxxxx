,chaz1996,2011-12-16T21:11Z,How do i get the audio to work? any media player i should use? someone help please
,kyosuke999,2011-12-17T19:02Z,whats the video codec for 53-77? rest work no problem
,CursedEntity,2011-12-30T14:41Z,"Kiran_1989 I originally though this would be a reupload of YIFY's parts 1-6, but this is a much bigger size. I was at first confused but now I think their are different versions of Dragonball Z Kai. A broad cast version, maybe different to 2 disc released versions, a Season 1, and Season part (1-6) as I have so far seen. Either way, the most recent part released so far as ripped from bluray is part 6 which finishes on episode 77. I think 78+ must be TV recorded. I may not be corrent as I have only been seeing Season 1 part 1-6 bluray rips and waiting patiently for part 7 rather than individual epsidoes :)"
,xPEEDLESx,2012-02-07T20:42Z,"Is this a good quality rip? similar to gamestars rips, the quality on his are amazing and id like to keep with the same quality. "
,ThatCoblerKid,2012-02-27T20:10Z,Yes this is very high quality. It's a direct rip from the blu-ray disc sets. They are all in mkv format. If the videos will not play get the k-lite codecs here http://www.codecguide.com/download_kl.htm
,skippyd,2012-03-21T00:14Z,just wondering if this is definitely the uncut version or not. i assume from u saying its a BR rip that they are but I just wanted to make sure as it is a huge dl. i dl'd the 1st ep and it is great quality but there was not enuf violence to tell if it was uncut or not. much appreciated  
,willis00,2012-05-23T13:46Z,"Can't get the audio to work on my PVR tried both audio tracks. However it works on VLC, but I need it to work on my TV.

Is episode one different in Kai to the older version, as in completely different-not about finding the dragon balls"
