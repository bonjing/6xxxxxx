Dark Meadow
Description
VISUALLY STUNNING, ENGROSSING STORYTELLING GAME EXCLUSIVE TO iOS!

A dark fairytale of intrigue and mystery, where the sins of the past must be paid forâ€¦ So sets the stage for The Dark Meadow -- a visually stunning world of deep exploration, gripping story, and heart racing combat, created with the unrivaled power of the Unreal Engine 3.

You awake in a hospital uncertain of how you arrived there or why. An old man warns of a beautiful witch whose minions roam the halls seeking the living. It is only when the witch is destroyed that you will be released from this unrelenting torment.

Using fun and intuitive fully gesture-based controls, you explore the decaying ruins of Montclair Hospital, armed with your crossbow for long-range combat as well as your sword for up close and personal melee battles.

The best elements from role-playing games encourage exploration as a wide variety of items are secreted throughout the world â€“ from hidden scraps of paper that reveal the mystery of your imprisonment, to weapons and items, to money which can be used to purchase better equipment and weapons.
