i was wondering about what you said on something about quicktransit.

""4) QuickTransit was a binary translator for Linux and Solaris, but Transitive Corp. was acquired by IBM and this program is no longer available. ""

quicktransit, just like you said is really no where to be found now. spent an hour in google but nothing.. :(

do you have it? :) or maybe someone you know..

btw, i found a vm appliance version, but not the application itself.."
