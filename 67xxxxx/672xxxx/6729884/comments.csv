I already have Office installed and just needed project. Is what I have now a trial version? I can't afford to start working with it and have the trial period dun out on me!
Thanks for your efforts, thethingy!"

I tried downloading the MS Office 2010 activator from this site but then it did not work and instead i have this notification that comes up everytime i open Project 2010 and a red bar at the top of the page that says 'Activation Failed'. How do i remedy this??? "
