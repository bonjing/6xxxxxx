This episode focuses on the Jurassic period, a time when the first giant killers stalked the
Earth and lurked in the seas; a time when the slightest advantage meant the difference
between life and death.

In North America the iconic allosaurus, an ambush hunter with a lethal bite, dominated. Not
even the heavily-armoured stegosaurus was safe from this killer, and incredible evidence
reveals a glimpse of a vicious battle between these two giants.

Life in Jurassic oceans was no easier; in 2008, a fossil was dug out of a frozen island high in
the Arctic. It was a colossal marine reptile, twice as big as most ocean predators, at 15
metres long and weighing about 45 tonnes. This was Predator X. Its skull alone was nearly
twice the size of a tyrannosaurus rex's, and its bite force unmatched by anything in the
Jurassic seas.

The balance of power between predator and prey is a fine one, as prey continually evolve
different ways to avoid predators. But for the most successful and enduring predators, the
battle to survive has always been tipped in their favour.
