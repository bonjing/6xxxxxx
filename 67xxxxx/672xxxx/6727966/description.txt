SYNOPSIS

A Quiet Revolution is the second film in the Women of Tibet trilogy exploring 
the Buddhist values at the heart of Tibetan culture - compassion, nonviolence 
and peace. It tells the story of the 15,000 unarmed Tibetan women who assembled 
on March 12, 1959 speaking out for peace, justice, and freedom in an expression 
of non-violent resistance in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, which sparked an uprising 
against China\\\'s occupation of Tibet.

For the first time on film, three generations of Tibetan women and His Holiness the 
14th Dalai Lama recount this story of survival and how these women have ultimately 
become architects and builders of the new Tibet - in exile.

Ama Adhe Tapontsang recounts 28 years spent in prison and the faith that allowed 
her to survive as she teaches new generations of young refugees. Dolma Tsering 
Teykhang describes sacrifices her parents made as exiles so that she might become 
first a teacher and then a member of the Tibetan Parliament in Exile in Dharamsala, 
India, and Tseten Choeden Schneiter, born and raised in exile, ensures that her 
Tibetan birthright is passed on to her own children as she wrestles with a culture 
in transition.

This film won an Emmy award in 2009, marking the 50th anniversary of the Lhasa uprising.
