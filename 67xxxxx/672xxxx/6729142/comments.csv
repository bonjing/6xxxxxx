,ayeshl,2011-10-08T21:15Z,I forgot to mention: This is the original ISO file without ANY change. Check hashes.
,jerryboy1,2011-10-08T23:51Z,Windows 8 Developer Preview is valid only until MAY 2012.. can u do activation so that will be forever ware....
,spockers,2011-10-09T03:27Z,This is freely available from MS at high speed. Why torrent it?
,yagnesh90,2011-10-09T05:13Z,"please seed guys  :)
my speed is low i get only 120kbps max 
so torrents is the only way i can get this, even if its ISO is available for free at microsoft site :("
,ayeshl,2011-10-09T18:21Z,"@spockers,
Don't think about Torrents as pirated stuff. 
Some people don't have download managers or own servers to download. Typically this takes a day or 2 to download in normal connections so you can run torrent and forget it for 2 days."
,yagnesh90,2011-10-09T18:52Z,"guys u gotta seed please :(

,micoyol,2011-10-11T17:09Z,"Thank you very much.
It works fine byitself
I belive this windows version is only to see how it works, I wrote that because I can not install AVG antivirus and I can not activate Office 2010 with kms.
See what happen in the future!!!!"
,ayeshl,2011-10-11T20:25Z,"@micoyol,
I too guess it's a problem with Win8. This is still in development part. final release will hopefully get them fixed."
,naruto000,2011-10-15T02:00Z,"Like no joke, i thought this torrent/ and windows 8 would be stupid and lame because its beta.

Can you post here your hardware configuration ?"
,LordReserei,2011-11-23T22:39Z,"Thanks for this torrent. 

I've been using the 64-bit version in VMware for a while and wanted to give a chance on an old netbook. 

Microsoft servers - 6hrs at 160Kbps
This torrent - fluctuating a little between 500Kbps and 1Mbps but it sure beats Microsoft and I'm going to get it in less time. 

Again, thanks!

,capnquackenbush,2012-02-23T10:30Z,"I tried downloading this twice from Microsoft's website, but it kept failing hash checks. I think Microsoft should've offered torrent files on their site in the first place. It'd save them on some bandwidth."
