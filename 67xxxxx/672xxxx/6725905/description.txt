The Art Of Frank Cho &  2010 Exhibit Catalogue 


This rare import comes straight from Chos 2010 Paris exhibition. An impressive hardcover catalogue featuring 48 pages of pen and ink drawings and fully finished color work. By turns comedic and dramatic, this collection showcases Chos broad ranging talent from his early Liberty Meadows work through more recent oil paintings and Jungle Queens art. And as with all Cho books, the beauty of the female form prevails throughout. Only 1500 copies of the exhibit catalogue were printed.
