    Ben and Charlie (Giuliano Gemma and George Eastman) are two              
    bottom-feeding criminals and ex-partners, who no matter how much they    
    hate and try to avoid one another, keep crossing paths. Before long      
    they re-team and end up embarking on a crime spree, that despite         
    their ineptitude, turns them into notorious outlaws and puts them in     
    the path of many colorful and dangerous characters.                      
                                                                             
    Very much a product of it's time (the early 70's), with it's             
    rambling, character-driven narrative, it's a bit loose and episodic      
    during it's first half. Once it gets going though, this free-spirited    
    action-adventure is consistently amusing and a lot of fun, with Gemma    
    and Eastman very appealing.                                              
                                                                             
    Production values are pretty good, as is the photography by Aristide     
    Massacesi, better known as Joe D'Amato, director of several infamous     
    sex and gore films, often starring Eastman.
