Sigil v1 from Crossgen part 2.  This has comics 22-42 with the script for 43.
One of the biggest storylines in the Crossgen Sigil-Verse, Sigil runs directly into the NegationWar.

Sigil pt 1 is already up as is the related mini Saurians: Unnatural Selection

Everything but Mystic is up in terms of Crossgen series.  I'm ULing that this weekend.  If you're new just click the Crossgen tag and all the series should show up.
Enjoy and Seed
