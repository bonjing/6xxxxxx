,Marco_Polo184,2011-10-05T23:49Z,My mouse won't go below at certain point on the bottom of the screen. I can't click the starting button nor the back button. Any Help?

Changing resolution or entering window mode and back again can eliminate the cursor issue.

I found however, that the available resolutions will eventually allow only 640x480."
,wangmanthewang,2011-10-22T23:31Z,works beautifully! thanks!

Didn't see the 640x480 issue. I'm on 10.6.8"
