In Easy MathART Projects and Activities,
children create wonderful art projects; all
based on math skills that correlate with the
standards recommended by the National
Council of Teachers of Mathematics. (See
Connections With the NCTM Standards
chart, page 6.) Whether you are making
Count-Up Birthday Candle Cards, Harvest
Corncob Patterns, or Heart-Filled Valentines,
the activities and projects in this book will
enable you to combine art with math lessons
all year long. No matter the level of math or
talent in art, every child in your class will
learnâ€”and produce beautiful and festive
decorations and gifts at the same time!
Each project focuses on a specific math skill or
concept and includes a complete list of
materials, grouping suggestions, step-by-step
instructions, teaching tips, and ideas for
seasonal or holiday tie ins. You will also find
reproducible patterns and worksheets,
Variations; ideas for altering the basic
projects, and More Math extension ideas.
Book Gallery recommends books to share with
your class that relate to the lessonâ€™s math
concept or holiday tie-in.
I hope that you and your class enjoy these
explorations in math and art. Who knows?;
you may inspire a budding Michelangelo or
Leonardo da Vinciâ€”both great artists who
used math in their work!
