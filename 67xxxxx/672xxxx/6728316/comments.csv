,uRabbit,2011-10-08T01:57Z,Is this cracked?
,cr8s,2011-10-08T08:44Z,"Downloaded, installed, works.

Thanks for a great torrent. Not bad for your first one."
,cr8s,2011-10-08T08:45Z,"@urabbit: Yes, it looks like it's cracked or perhaps just retail... you don't have to do anything other than drag/drop into Applications for it to work.

Tested on 10.7.1 OS X (Lion)."

,dlectro,2011-10-15T00:43Z,"I'm on Lion 10.7.2, almost all apps stopped Growling with 1.3.
Everything worked with Growl 1.2.2.

I followed Growl's instructions upon first use, but i guess the problem is that this isn't supposed to work with just dragging and dropping the app, since it was written to install from the App Store.

Downgraded back to 1.2.2 and now everything works again."
