Harry Palmer is the name of the fictional secret agent protagonist of a number of films based on the main character from the spy novels written by Len Deighton. Michael Caine played Harry Palmer in the films based on three of the first four of the published novels featuring this character, and also later in two original-story films not based on Len Deighton's novels.In the mid-1990s, there appeared two Harry Palmer films with original screenplays and starring Michael Caine. Despite sometimes being titled Len Deighton's Bullet to Beijing and Len Deighton's Midnight in St Petersburg, Len Deighton did not participate in these films.

3 classics and 2 not very popular movies made years later, but if you are like me you want to see them all. Personally I didn't think the two last ones were that bad. I had low expectations after reading other peoples comments though. These two are also in full-frame
