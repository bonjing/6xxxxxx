Since I was not able to find an english subtitled version of Ultraman Dyna, I decided to sub it myself by translating the Chinese subtitled version (since I am more comfortable with reading in English). Do note that some information might be missed out / mistranslated, but I did my best.

This contains only Episodes 1 to 5. I will be releasing 5 episodes at a time when I complete them. **Episode 1 was already subbed by Hikari Senshi Fansubs so I didn't sub it, but I put it here for the sake of convenience**
