Time: 11:00 to 11:45 (45 minutes long)

An audacious hidden camera series with Chris Hollins. An acting rogue tradesman tries to rip people off in their own homes using well-known con tricks to show us all how easy it can be to be taken in. The last thing Colin from Bedfordshire needs when he flies home from holiday is a blocked pipe in his conservatory, particularly when the blockage was faked by our pretend rogue plumber. Will Roger get the better of this cautious consumer when he removes the lump of grease? Elsewhere, will sparks fly when he tries to con house-sitter Carla over a new wiring job? Plus the Derbyshire landscaper whose devious tricks enabled him to pocket more than 200,000 pounds from his twenty victims.
