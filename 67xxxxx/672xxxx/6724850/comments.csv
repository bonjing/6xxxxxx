,honunet,2011-10-06T12:40Z,Thanks man.  I think it's time for Mike to retire.  i don;'t know of any host that's gone this much and still has a job
,Papaoso42,2011-10-06T14:55Z,"honunet, you just wrote what I have been thinking for a long time. If he does retire then who do we listen to for the truth? Lets just hope that his teeth are still bothering him. :-)"
