,macnerd1,2011-10-08T12:59Z,"This doesn't work. The archive is corrupted and then only opened with, The Unarchiver. Once opened the .dmg does't work either. Error -4960"
,BombaAriba,2012-01-14T10:31Z,Can anyone confirm that it works?
,FabCee,2012-01-31T23:00Z,"I can confirm that this works. It runs flawlessly on my Macbook pro running OS X Lion.

Once you download the torrent, unzip it then click on the dmg file. A box with the game's icon will appear. Drag that icon to your Applications folder. Once the move is complete enjoy =)"

,rquetzal1,2012-02-17T09:48Z,I'm able to launch in the Applications folder.  My problem is that the island won't render.  I't just a grey outline that is clickable and against a blue sky background.  Everything else seems to work fine though.
,paaablo,2012-03-18T20:46Z,Please seed!!!
,Jay_Rey,2012-03-25T07:27Z,i got the same problem as rquetzal1 and i will try to reunzip it.
,Jay_Rey,2012-03-25T07:40Z,nope doesn't work
,Jay_Rey,2012-03-26T09:22Z,"The island won't render as @rquetzal1 stated and the problem is such that it is literally pointless to play unless this is fixed
If it is a software problem, i have an iMac which i got in 2010, 4gb ram, OSX Lion 10.7.3 with a ATI Radeon HD 5750 1024 MB graphics card and 2.8GHz Intel Core i5
pls help or fix the problem jadalyn or other people who fled this, pls help"
,rejs13,2012-04-07T15:26Z,"Easy fix if the island won't render, in opening screen of game go to the options tap and the click visuals tab. under this tab there should be a heading named Scene Resolution, if this is on high change to medium, and if using iMac but screen resolution up to full 2560x1440"
,ondrashek,2012-04-15T12:21Z,"1. Download was no problem - thanks to all seeders
2. Unziping was smooth (try The Unarchiver)
3. No problem with instalation either
4. Game works!!
5. Only problem I experienced was no water rendering - FIXED by advice of ""rejs13"" (Thank you rejs13): Options / Visuals / Scene Resolution - set to Medium "
