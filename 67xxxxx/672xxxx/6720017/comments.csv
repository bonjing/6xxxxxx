whoever dloading this is wasting his time with 1 seeder while thousands free wait for him on official web site"

If you had bothered to check out the torrent, you would see that the official tracker is in the torrent file, hence you would have access to all the seeds and peers from there as well, as soon as you started to download this torrent. Try to check up on things, before going out on a rage trip next time ;)"
