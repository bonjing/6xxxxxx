,Evilution,2011-10-07T06:10Z,the 720p files get smaller and smaller :( not good for the quality.
,InNOut89,2011-10-07T06:43Z,"@Evilution I know, right? The 720p files for season 1 and season 2 were all approximately 1.09 gb per file. This past season, none of the 720p files exceed 1 gb in size. 

The quality is still a lot better than the usual 480p HDTV rips that come from EZTV or VTV but what's up with the different file sizes? "
,Silv3rblade,2011-10-07T06:44Z,Thank a lot!!!
,BielMB,2011-10-07T07:17Z,Thanks for the upload.....just one thing.....why tthe f*cking RAR ??
,caulkins,2011-10-07T12:55Z,"BielMB,

I prefer RAR because:

1. That is the way these things are officially released.
2. It provides an additional level of assurance that the file has not been corrupted.
3. It preserves the file's original time stamp."
,caulkins,2011-10-07T14:40Z,"The compression that has been used is clearly excessive.  Complexion details have been lost, making people's faces look like they are made of Silly Putty!"
,JerryGyan,2011-10-07T17:14Z,"I appreciate the upload but I have to agree with all of the above. The quality is really poor, unusually so!"
,0bb4,2011-10-07T19:07Z,I read that the quality sucks. But is it still better then the .XviD release?
,JerryGyan,2011-10-08T01:05Z,"@ 0bb4 Yes it is, but that's not saying much."
,BielMB,2011-10-08T20:07Z,"caulkins

Huumm ok, those were good arguments lol"
,JerryGyan,2011-10-09T01:18Z,"For those who are interested, there's another torrent with far superior quality:
