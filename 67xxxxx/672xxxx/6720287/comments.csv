Quality for in general - 5/10 (maybe a quarter less)

It's dark, but not as dark as some cams you get on here. Atleast you can make it out. That is about the only problem and there doesn't appear to be a lot of night or dark scenes anyway. It may ruin some of the scarier parts like faces in the dark or something, if there is any scenes like that. Other then that though its not shakey at all and it appears to be all there. The sound is pretty good as well as long as your not an audiofile or something. In other words, you can hear it and there's no annoying noises that I came across so far. 

I am downloading - Dream House 2011 CAM Xvid-BHRG         as we speak and it shouldn't be long so if you want to check in for my rating in a couple hours to see if its better here is the link...
