This time Max and Stacy talk about 'capitalist gangbangs,' JP Morgan's 'way forward,' and why 14 trillion no longer scares us. 

In the second half of the show, Max Keiser interviews Satyajit Das about the conservation of debt and slavery, extreme money and #occupywallstreet.        



The .mp3 in the torrent is audio extracted from the Russia Today video. You can watch the video online at:

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included 
the blog's web address in a file included with this
torrent named:

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
