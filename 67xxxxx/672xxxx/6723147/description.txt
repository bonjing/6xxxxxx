Another Rachel Rowan session. Personally I prefer Rachel in Dreamland but this one is not bad. Rachel starts to put you down with a pendant. Then she uses her eyes, repetitions and snap fingers. Although I don't find her as lovely as Katja, Tiffany or Mercedes, I find Rachel's style very powerful and I like it a lot. In second part, there is a third person view session with another guy. I am not a fan of participating as a viewer in a session hypnosis and so I believe it looses a bit.
