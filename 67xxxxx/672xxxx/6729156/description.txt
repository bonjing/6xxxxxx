Properly released in 1989, this film appears to have not gotten an audience when it was first made.

A story of a two-bit Jewish racketeer trying to go straight, in an atmospheric salad of ethnic crime families in NYC. Full of angst, Harry wanders around, not very energetically, trying to make up for 16 years of working in the numbers game. Plenty of parody and belly-gazing at latter-day Jewish society.

Not much in the way of familiar faces to shake a stick at, but the faces are well placed, in a sort of creepy way.

No subtitles, but a 30 odd minute making of featurette on these
