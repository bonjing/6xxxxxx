"Competitive Ecology"

As the study group sets to work on their 
first big assignment in biology - a 
terrarium - they are driven to 
distraction over how they should pair off 
to do their project. Elsewhere on campus, 
Chang (Ken Jeong) patrols the school 
grounds looking for signs of trouble and 
imagines himself in a noir detective 
mystery.

18/Slower
Evolve...or die.

Enjoy :)
