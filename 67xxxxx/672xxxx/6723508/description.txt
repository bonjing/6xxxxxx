A scientifically proven weight-loss method centered around a revolutionary 20-minute interval training program
Based on a scientifically proven interval training program incorporating eight-second sprints, this all-in-one manual provides quick, easy-to-follow guidance for increasing fitness and strength levels in a time-efficient, effective way. Most people know that balanced eating, exercise, and relaxation are necessary for good healthâ€”but how to fit these into a stressful, short-on-time lifestyle is the challenge. 

This manual outlines aerobic and strength-training exercises that can be done at home with minimal expense, and it includes simple relaxation exercises and diet informationâ€”always referring to "diet" as in eating plan, not in the excruciating, watch-every-morsel-you-eat, boring sense of the word. Readers will love the recipes for delicious, healthy, easy-to-prepare meals with a strong emphasis on Mediterranean and Asian cuisine.
