                Marty needs a job fast and turns to crime to tide him
                over, but he's not a smooth criminal, and using items
                borrowed from the Maguires wasn't the smartest plan.
                Kelly learns that there's a price on Marty's head,
                but surely Shane won't grass... Meanwhile, Billy is
                standing up for his rights as a father; he wants to
                give Cilla her second name. Mimi is reluctant, but
                offers him an ultimatum: to join her side, and she
                doesn't mean footy teams! Billy is eager to please,
                but his devotion to Father Craig is rubbing Mimi up
                the wrong way. And Mickey's flat has been raided by
                the police. Shane confronts Marty about a dirty
                secret he left behind in Spain and when Marty hears
                the sirens he runs. Kelly is heartbroken when she's
                told the truth, but who will she believe?
