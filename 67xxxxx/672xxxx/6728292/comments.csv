i extracted and used the clickonceapplication
then clicked install

but then it says it needs assembly Microsoft.Xna.Framework.GamerServices Version 4.0.0.0 be installed in the global assembly cache first."
,IAmTorrenter,2011-11-03T01:11Z,"ok i downloaded the two things in the description  but now its saying this when i try to install:

Cannot download the application. The application is missing required files. Contact application vendor for assistance."
,IAmTorrenter,2011-11-03T01:15Z,"------UPDATE nevermind its working.
i tried the application file instead of the clickonce application and it worked after i installed those two Microsoft things."
