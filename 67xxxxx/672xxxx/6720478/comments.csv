No log No Cue No Art No Thanks
Why delete rip info?"
,AllEnergy21,2011-10-04T23:47Z,"Thank you for the comment, this was my first upload ever. But I didn't delete anything just straight rip from Easy Audio Cd... maybe I have to change a setting to get the rip info, everything said A OK in the program though

Thanks for the comment"
