,gary.s,2011-11-15T19:44Z,"Hi guys,

I can't use the Waves pack with protools because of no Ilok.

PT asked me to move the WaveShell-DAE 8.0.dpm to the unused plugins folder. 

During the Installation process I saw ""no Ilok needed"" or something like that.

I search in all the attached files and there's nothing about f*cking Iloks.

Is anyone can help me please?"
,saturnia,2011-12-14T23:08Z,I am sorry but I still can't verify these in the AU manager. Any advice? I use the 32-bit version of Logic Pro. Peace to you all!:)

,tyguy182,2012-03-22T08:22Z,Does anyone know if the plugins in this version are 64-bit? I have the old version and have to run Logic's 32-bit adapter thing working in 64bit mode. Quite annoying
