Dame Vera Lynn 100 Hits Legend 5CDs 320k plus 
bonus added and/or remastered tracks (musicfromrizzo)


Here is our lovely singing gal - none better for the memories involved
and the time period concerned. Many tracks are shoddy (tonal) dated quality
if  you ask me, but there are nice ones along the way, and we got remastered versions or improved versions (for Besame mucho specifically) or added greatest
sings such as "You'd be so nice to come home to" missing from the collection
to begin with. You might be best off to pick and choose whatever you
are missing from what you have now of Vera Lynn quality mp3s in your
own collections.
