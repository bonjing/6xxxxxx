By the year 2020, the basic memory components of a computer will be the size of individual atoms. At such scales, the current theory of computation will become invalid.

â€œQuantum computingâ€ is reinventing the foundations of computer science and information theory in a way that is consistent with quantum physics â€“ the most accurate model of reality currently known. Remarkably, this theory predicts that quantum computers can perform certain tasks exponentially faster than classical computers and, better yet, can accomplish â€œimpossibleâ€ feats such as teleporting information, breaking supposedly â€œunbreakableâ€ codes, generating true random numbers, and communicating with messages that betray the presence of eavesdropping.

This widely anticipated second edition of Explorations in Quantum Computing explains the field from a fresh perspective, emphasizing lesser known quantum transforms, and practical applications of quantum algorithms and quantum information theory. The required mathematical machinery is developed systematically, and the studentsâ€™ knowledge tested through several end-of-chapter exercises. This easy-to-read, time-tested, and comprehensive textbook provides a unique perspective on the capabilities of quantum computers, and supplies readers with the tools necessary to make their own foray into this exciting field.
