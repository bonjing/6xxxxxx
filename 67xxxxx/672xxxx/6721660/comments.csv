This is for US of A = NTSC/U. You'll have to find a Japanese version yourself, I have no clue. Good luck!"

The retail box of this game has 3 discs, third disc is multiplayer stuff. Single player needs first two discs. So, of course, if you want to go through the entire single-player game, you would burn 2 discs. But maybe you burn 1 disc first, and if you start playing you'll find that the game is not worth it and then you wouldn't need to burn the second disc, right? =)"

,twicked7,2012-01-13T21:47Z,"FAKE! (OR MODIFIED)!

This ISO is BASED on the marvel release. The DVD2FIX patch for the missing replay data was needed.  After patch applied, ABGX ERRORS.

ABGX 1.0.6
--------------
Game Partition CRC does not match the verified INI!

Either BAD RIP, or INTENTIONALLY modified.  DO NOT USE UNLESS YOU WANT THAT CONSOLE BANNED FROM XBOX LIVE."
,twicked7,2012-01-13T22:44Z,"Sorry for the bad news, btw.  I waited days downloading these discs and I encourage each of you with finished copies to run them through ABGX 1.0.6 also.  

Very disappointing.  I agree."
