I've just come back to Sunville, where I grew up. Every tree and every house remembers me when I was a young girl. Now I'm all grown up, I live in another cityâ€¦but I miss my old home and my friends. I haven't been here for a while and I really want to meet up with friends! I had no idea that this journey will be full of surprises. 
* 20 day, 22 unique locations 
* 3 game modes, mini-games
