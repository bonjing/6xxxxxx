,quible,2011-10-08T18:55Z,"@ADHDerby .Hi, I would like to know how you manage do the cyberlink software so effectively, and, even though this doesn't concern youcam, how do you manage to create the skin packs?"
,chris4smd,2011-10-08T19:32Z,Thanks man! Great work as usual keep'em coming!!
,quible,2011-10-08T21:11Z,"oh yeah, working, as all of your stuff has worked for me. Thanx again"
[T],ADHDerby,2011-10-09T05:11Z,"You're welcome! :)

@ quible: I used to script unattended application installs, you can find great guides @ MSFN ;)
I modify the skins (dll's) by editing them with a resource hacker (I'm using Restorator 2007)
I've removed the Feature Icons and the New DVD Release section from the resume page by editing XML\PRELOADSKIN.XML
You can change the background by replacing the IMAGE\INITIAL PNGs"
,quible,2011-10-09T12:10Z,thank you very much. I shall take a look when I get time.

[T],ADHDerby,2011-10-14T08:43Z,"@ quible: I'll look into it

@ Gosh20: It's normal for the trial version, I'm working on a release without the tick"
[T],ADHDerby,2011-10-14T10:15Z,"New release: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6743199
Issues fixed: This release doesn't display the YouCam text in the webcam video area"
,TheUnknownCommenter,2011-10-16T14:09Z,"@ AFHDerby If this is the trail version for how many days will it work? As u said ""It's normal for the trial version, I'm working on a release without the tick"" "

[T],ADHDerby,2011-10-16T14:59Z,"This is a hacked trial version, it doesn't have a day limit.
Download and install this one: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6743199
This release uses the deluxe files and it doesn't display the YouCam text in the webcam video area."

,gawowo,2012-01-16T11:11Z,"Hi, ADHDerby could u help?
After installing, the software I missed the connection to my built-in webcam. A message says"" can't connect to HP 101 webcam"" . When I verify the driver through Device Manager, it says"" This driver works perfectly"" When I update the driver it says"" you have the latest update"". The problem is that the webcam doesn't ignite (doesn't work for short). Have u an idea?"
[T],ADHDerby,2012-01-17T18:46Z,"@ aaaflyer: Try this version: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6743199

@ gawowo: Does the webcam work if you install the trial version?"
[T],ADHDerby,2012-01-17T18:49Z,"@ aaaflyer: Sorry, I meant this version: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6962635 :/"

,C0RPSEGRiNDER,2012-02-24T04:03Z,Thank you for this upload. But... does anyone else find it funny that they put a Cyberlink YouCam watermark on a paid product?
