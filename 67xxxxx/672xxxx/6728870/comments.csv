But in the case of torrents, the idea is to get people to seed as much and for as long as possible.  Once people extract the file they want, they don't need the RARs and so they will discard them.

Some people say ""I want to keep the original format"" but RAR is not the original format -- the file is the original format.  The RARs are just for sending across Usenet.

The only torrents that live a long life are the ones with whole content do that they can be verified as not being spam are they can be previewed while downloading."

You are absolutely right and only l33t w@nn@b33s distribute stuff outside usenet as rar.

On the good side, just search on the donkey network, you usually find the file also unpacked and mint with decent downloadspeeds.

And yeah, I'll delete the rars too but leave the mint file online in the donkey network for a month or so."

,tempura_b,2011-10-08T22:25Z,"Gee, there a lot of whiny bitches around. If you don't like RAR files then go and download somewhere else. Good work as always, sceneline."
,freeware-uploads,2011-10-09T14:54Z,"People put time and effort in uploading stuff for free and than you guys come in and whine about .RAR files??? 
BE THANKFULL because it is pointless to whine about rar files while the file simply works and you can enjoy your download.

Keep up the good work sceneline ;)"
,07paul,2011-10-15T21:46Z,"Apparently from what I've heard, when files are split up into multiple .RAR files it helps keep the video quality higher than it would have been if it was not split up. On the down side many people chose to delete those .rar files after they have downloaded the video, meaning they cannot seed :("
,fuckfrank,2011-11-23T08:54Z,"Compressing files for torrents to save space makes sense, however x264 files are already compressed.

Splitting files into multiple RAR segments for torrenting is pointless, since the bittorrent already splits files into many pieces so as to pull them from whatever peers have them available rather than downloading a single monolithic file from a single site (that's the whole point).

All RARing does is add to the time it takes to create the torrent (since the original file has to be split up), add to the time it takes to use it (since it has to be put back together), and reduces the number of seeds (since most people won't waste disk space keeping two copies of the file).

@tempura_b - This isn't whining, it's education. Some people just don't know any better.

@07paul - The content is in digital format, RAR will have zero effect on quality (unless there's an error compressing or decompressing and data is lost, in which case the quality will be worse)."
