    Entertainment announced Batman: Arkham City - The Album will be released in
    conjunction with the highly anticipated forthcoming videogame Batman: Arkham
    City. The artists featured on Batman: Arkham City - The Album approached
    their contributions to the album with their own unique interpretations of
    the stories surrounding Batman. The result is an eclectic mix of dynamic,
    atmospheric songs for an album that will appeal to fans of both the artists
    and Batman: Arkham City.
