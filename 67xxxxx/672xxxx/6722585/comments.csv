@LuigiVuoto nba2k12 is the best basketball video game on earth. it has several game modes like myplayer (you only control one player) and the association (you control the whole team). you'll definitely like the myplayer mode, where you create your own player (your alter ego) and fulfill his dream from being drafted into the nba until his retirement and induction into the hall of fame. several better reviews are posted online, you may want to check it out :)"

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6721235/NBA_2K12_CRACK_FIX_by_Sonuyos__amp_amp__TOMEK1166

Hey everyone I was able to find a crack that fixes the freeze bug.
I can play the entire match without freezing.
For now this seems to be the best solution to the freeze issue that I know of.

It's to early to tell if it's 100% fixed.
I'm planning to play the entire season and if I encounter any other bugs, I'll post it.

All you do is dl the crack, copy and replace to your installation nba2k12 folder.

The crack is all you need if you have the game already downloaded.

It shouldn't matter if you have the reloaded or 3dm as long as you use the crack above you should be good.

Best of luck guys."

Step 4 means that you go on the disc that you mounted, you find the CRACK directory, you open it up, then you copy everything from it to where you installed the game on your harddrive. 

It'll ask you whether you wish to overwrite, simply click yes (as many times as neccesary) and that should do it. After that just click the game's exe icon and play.

Hope I helped you, if not.....ask again and I'll help. (if I can)"

,DKTOXO,2012-01-07T14:32Z,"@petarm93 : It could be that your computer doesnt meet some of the requirements to run the game?

@GiorgosP: You cant play online because you didnt buy the game. Torrenting is technically illegal (i could be wrong) or at least frowned upon by game developers. If you really want to play online then go buy the game.

Thats why im asking if theres any alternate ways of getting this done or maybe im doing something wrong? if so, what?"

Extract the torrent file to any folder.

Use MagicDisc to mount the image. 

Install the game.

Use MagicISO to then extract the crack from the torrent files. In MagicISO, you will see the crack file with in the torrent data. Inside the crack file, simply highlight the entire contents and right click highlighted content and select ""Extract"". Choose or make a file where these item(s) will be extracted to.

Once done. Simply CUT and paste into the game directory. I mean CUT and paste...not drag and drop or copy and paste. Cut and paste.

Good luck, man!"
