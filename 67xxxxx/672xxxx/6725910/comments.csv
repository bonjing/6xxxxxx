,Yashini,2011-10-21T05:58Z,"hey well, downloaded fine it's just asking me to install babylon 9?? i did and now when i run the setup nothing happens??? please help"
,Yashini,2011-10-21T07:03Z,"really i've tried absolutly EVERYTHING, tried it as admin, tried installing everything else on the iso but nothing happens and when i run the setup.exe a babylon installer pops up, relises that i've already installed then it all disapears. PLEASSE HELP"
,AnonymousJim,2011-10-22T00:43Z,"@Yashini
I tried mounting the .iso, but the installer kept on closing on me. Make sure that you either extract the contents to a folder on your desktop or something once the .iso is mounted, or extract the .iso before trying to run the installer. Hopefully this helps =)"
,Yashini,2011-10-22T07:11Z,"@anonymousJim. first off thank you so much for replying. the funny thing is that the .iso didn't come in a zip file, it came in a folder, so i cut it out the folder and put it on the desktop and alas still nothing (sad face). the .iso mounts fine it just (as you say) keeps on closing. and by the way did it also ask you to install babylon 9?? "
,AnonymousJim,2011-10-22T07:43Z,"No, I didn't see anything about babylon 9. Not really sure what that's about.

Yeah, the .iso came in a folder. Just checking-- you didn't put the .iso on the desktop, but the files it contained, right? The setup file tries to create another file in the same directory. This is problematic if it's being mounted virtually, since it can't write to a CD. I'm really not sure why the packagers distributed it this way, since mounting it isn't the way to go."
,Yashini,2011-10-22T07:58Z,"oohhhhh, gona try putting the files into another folder now, thanks alot, will keep you updated"
,Yashini,2011-10-22T08:06Z,YES! it works!! thank you soooooo much!!! you are an awesome person! i shall now refer to you as awesomJim!

,jmg434,2011-10-28T03:37Z,"I've installed the game and when I try to launch it via the launcher, it just opens up the launcher again. All of the files are in the same folder. What do I do?"
