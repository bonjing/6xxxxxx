Many documentaries have told the story of the early life of Presley, his army career or his death, but Destination Vegas is the first and definitive documentary to tell the story of Elvis's residency in Vegas, a town that was to become synonymous with him. Using previously unseen and unknown private footage, we peel away from the facade of the formal camera to explore a defining, yet controversial chapter in Elvis' life, which not only stifled him, but also defined him as the superstar that he would forever be known.

This documentary gives Elvis fans unprecedented access into the years when the singer worked and lived in Las Vegas. Packed with intimate home movie footage, the documentary aims to shed some light on a period in Elvis's career more often mocked than seriously examined.
