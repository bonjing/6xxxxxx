An American in Paris [1951]

Jerry Mulligan, a struggling American painter in Paris, is "discovered" by
an influential heiress with an interest in more than Jerry's art. Jerry in 
turn falls for Lise, a young French girl already engaged to a cabaret singer.
Jerry jokes, sings and dances with his best friend, an acerbic would-be
concert pianist, while romantic complications abound.
