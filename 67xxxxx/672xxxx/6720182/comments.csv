03 	""Beware the Physical Exam!""

The time has come for the school's physical examinations, so the host club must find a way to protect Haruhi's secret for being a female. Their attempts, including Tamaki disguising himself as Haruhi, fail miserably until Kyoya Otori steps in, with a doctor who promises not to reveal her secret. Meanwhile, someone accused of attempting to ""make a pass"" on one of the female students, Dr. Yabu, is actually searching for his daughter after she and her mother left him due to financial problems. Kyoya points out that, if the man's family is really that poor, the girl would be attending Ouran Public High School, rather than the prestigious and very expensive Ouran Academy. Tamaki gives him directions, explaining that, even though he might get hurt later, it's up to him to find the truth. "
