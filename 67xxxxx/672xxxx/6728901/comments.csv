[T],Ferrelas,2011-10-15T09:40Z,"Use mplayer, vlc has always been low quality imho, are you sure that the version you have of vlc is new enough to have an implementation of x264 supporting the one this was encoded with? This encode is legit.

Also, if you're going to report on this not playing you _have_ to report what version, otherwise the report is totaly pointless."
