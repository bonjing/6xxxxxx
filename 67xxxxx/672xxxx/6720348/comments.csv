....Jesus wasnt a jew, he was born in Bethlehem...which was in Palestine at the time and is in Palestine now..."

A Jew isn't a nationality, its a race. If your black born in america it doesn't make you white...

Atheists admit the possibility of virgin births, it's called Parthenogenesis.

As for timelines, its documented that they differ in the bible on occasion. They did not have computers then. The amazing thing is that they agree at all! They were handed down by tradition.

I don't know how you debunk ""wise men"" or Magi to be more specific, chinese astrology supports that there were many such star watchers. some even speculate that noah was chinese because anchient chinese texts speak of a global flood.

Anyone can google support for ANY position, thats not logic, its lemmings. Rationalize it for yourself and make your own opinions, not spouting off the traditional talking points. Especially when they're wrong.

I won't be checking on this post, flame away."
