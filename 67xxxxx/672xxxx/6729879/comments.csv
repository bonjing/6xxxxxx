,xTwilightSky,2011-10-09T10:09Z,"Thanks!

If you live in England can you please record the repeat Sunday race on BBC One at 14:40?
They completely screwed up the live version >.<
Particularly the drivers' press conference..."

,Maritow,2011-10-09T21:14Z,Shame you didn't get the race... Thanks for this! Did you by any chance get the F1 Forum? It was pretty epic apparently!
,vinegar15,2011-10-09T21:56Z,"+1 thanks a lot anyway Jorrell!!! 
I've watched the race live in crap image quality via fox sports with crap satellite transmission, the signal was completely out and unstable about three times through the race for several seconds... I wonder if it was the cause of the crash of your PVR.
Hopefully you can catch the repeat or the highlights of the race.
Thanks again you are the man!"
