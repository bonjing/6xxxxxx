The materials in this resource invite students to appreciate and learn about ancient
Greece; its geography, its history, its culture, and its impact on modern life. Each chapter opens with background information on a specific aspect of ancient Greece and is followed by related activities that help students understand key ideas presented in the chapter. The first chapter aims to give students an understanding of where Greece is located and how the ancient civilization developed there. The subsequent chapters highlight details of Greek culture and everyday life: how people dressed, what they ate, how they entertained themselves, what they thought about, and how they ran their governments.

As you lead students through their study of ancient Greece, be sure to use the enclosed fold-out map, which shows the extent of Greeceâ€™s political domain around 500 B.C. Point out to the class that Greek colonies stretched from the coast of Spain to the Black Sea. Also encourage the class to explore some of the Internet sites described in the â€™Net Links sections of this book and visit your school or local library to obtain some of the books and videos listed in the Library Links sections.
