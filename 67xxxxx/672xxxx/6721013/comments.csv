Thanks in advance to everyone helping me seed this back :D"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-06T05:28Z,"So, Week 5 with Kettleworx Core and I finally got my hands on a working copy of Resistance and Cardio. I thought I had seen all the workouts Shanahan could make up but these are all new, resistance was fun and cardio kicked my ass today ... Now that Ive got the full program - Beware LOL"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-07T04:57Z,"Come on People.. PLEASE seed back!

Ive been Super Seeding for 48 hours and have had three people reach 100% and immediately stop seeding ...

Im helping you guys, help me back"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-10-18T17:51Z,"Week 7 - So after doing 6 weeks with JUST Core, I now have the Full Program and decided to restart at week 1. I guess I kind of used Core to be my 6 week body transformation - and it worked, Ive lost pretty much all my extra (unwanted) weight and flab, I am really well toned and my arms arent as girlie as usual - I actually have a decent amount of muscle. Going back to week 1 was strange, i thought it would be dirt easy but I hadnt done these exercises in a month an a half, barely remembered them :D Im always surprised at how many different kettle exercises shanahan can come up with. I have moved to using my 15lb for pretty much every exercise now. Maybe thats why week1 was hard again, I originally did it with 10lb. After another 6 weeks Im going to have to get the even heavier kettle :D"
