"What is it About Men?"

The doctors of Seattle Grace are called upon 
to man up when a stampede at a comic book 
convention causes an influx of colorful 
characters in the ER - blurring the lines of 
fantasy and reality; Mark shows his softer 
side with baby Sofia when Arizona and Callie 
go out of town, but at work he continues to 
give Jackson a hard time; Ben returns to the 
ER, only to find that Nurse Eli has moved in 
on Bailey; and the male doctors bond over 
their frustrations with women.

18/Slower
Evolve...or die.

Enjoy :)
