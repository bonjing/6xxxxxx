,atlas81,2011-10-05T09:13Z,does this work? 
,NLMichel,2011-10-05T14:15Z,"It does work, just remember to ALT or OPTION (on mac) click on ""Restore"" and select the .ipsw file. So DONT click on the UPDATE or CHECK FOR UPDATES button. That will give an error."
,bjaerk,2011-10-05T16:16Z,Thank you for this.. I'll seed until I get 3 in ratio on this file

,Kanyu88,2011-10-06T04:50Z,"Doesn't work for me, gets an error 21 message after verifying with Apple servers...

I gather it only works for those with iOS Developer accounts. If that's the case. Why not just download it from Apple anyway?!"
,Kanyu88,2011-10-06T05:29Z,"Scratch my previous comment.

Get iTunes 5.8 beta first.

Then, hold Option and click ""Restore"" button to choose this file. Works perfectly!

Thanks heaps -Smegma-!"
