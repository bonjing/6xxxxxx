slowing it down seeding out :((

just watched it.. looks a great show..

should have some amazing results and expose the frauds

somehow that guy went in a straight line to find the object in forest was interesting

cant ait to see what others tests they put them through and who wins the challenge

bit like paranormal challenge series but for psychics lol"
