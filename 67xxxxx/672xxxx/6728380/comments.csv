Anyone can redeem that on steam and congratulations your legit game just got taken by someone else."
,zzdjchris,2011-10-10T12:56Z,"Why even say that? Not everyone knows that, but they do now, and look what YOU'VE done. It's gone now. Game and all. Well done."
,enforcer_802,2011-10-11T17:04Z,"Its stuck at 88,6% for a while, and no one logged  have it 100%. I think this torrent is over.
BTW, zzDJChris, if they took ur account with the key, why cant u take it back?
Hope u fix it. Best of all."
,Denzil,2011-10-12T16:12Z,"Yes I'm pretty sure that will go down well with Steam support:

""I posted my CD-key online, on a torrent site, and somebody stole my game!"""
,zzdjchris,2011-10-14T07:46Z,"denzil. Your an IDIOT! I already have another key. What are you, a NOOB?"
,zzdjchris,2011-10-14T07:50Z,"Quote ""I posted my key online"" P.s. ""I'm an IDIOT""!
Give me some credit man?
1st of all. I have a steam account already.
2ndly. I don't even like, let alone USE steam (That part shows your DUMBASS NOOBOSITY, Denzil""
Oh, SNAP!
PFFT!"
,zzdjchris,2011-10-14T07:53Z,"Enforcer, I have, but I gave it for the NOOBS to fight over, as I don't use it anyway, but atleast your with me.
Children get BIG when they can hide behind a keyboard.
DENZIL. YOUR SOOOO SMART. I wanna be more like U.
Your AWESOME!!!"
,zzdjchris,2011-10-14T07:57Z,"In conclusion. The ISO is still avail, Just NOT TO DENZIL. He can get it elsewhere. If it's wanted, there are links around to get it.
Peace Out to the Initiated!
(Soon Denzil, One day it'll happen...Promise)."
