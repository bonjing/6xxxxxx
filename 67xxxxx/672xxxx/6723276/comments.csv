,kclayr,2011-10-06T04:08Z,"hey, I love your uploads, I can barely get them fast enough. Sadly, I can't rss your uploads. I have to manually get them which frankly sux since it takes longer until I can read them. Anyway you can fix this?"
[T],wowcabbage,2011-10-06T05:09Z,Unfortunatley not. it's a problem with the website it's self and hasn't been fixed in a long time.
