,Wetmouse2,2011-10-17T13:30Z,"Well done, McUnfunny. By entering a childish title you not only made Cshit seem the mature one, but you also made it impossible for anyone searching on McPhat here to find these liveries. You're better than this. You're better than Cshit. Please work on your maturity before your next posting and leave the nonsense to the now-banned-for-the-second time Cshit1."
,Espana25,2011-10-19T13:11Z,@Wetmouse2......you haven't posted a shit yourself ever why would you say that and criticize someone like that for putting all the effort and uploading great stuff for all of us here ....wasn't just FSX quite obvious enough for all of your own childish searches ? now shut your mouth and sit back and relax OK ! 
,ezlaz1678,2011-10-21T18:35Z,more shitty liveries @t silverwingz.net
