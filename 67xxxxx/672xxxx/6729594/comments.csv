,jorgy2612,2011-10-15T19:26Z,"amazing quality :) and i'm not sure if it's your type of music, but do you think you could upload 2AM Club's album What Do You Think Was Going To Happen? in 320 kbps? i've requested it on suprbay but it didn't have any responses. seemed like you'd be the perfect person to go to."
[T],theLEAK,2011-10-15T20:53Z,"@jorgy2612

It depends if the artist itself is popular."
,jorgy2612,2011-10-16T00:09Z,"@theLEAK

they kind of are. which i'd like to say they are, but they aren't as popular as most bands. they're still pretty good though. i understand if you don't upload it though."
