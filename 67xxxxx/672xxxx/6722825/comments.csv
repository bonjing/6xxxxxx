,1dissident,2011-10-12T01:51Z,"This movie was horrible.  The acting was awful, the plot was lame, and even the action sequences were boring and poorly performed.  This is nowhere near the production value of 300 and the martial arts capacity of the actors was just plain embarrassing to watch.  Thanks for the upload anyway, the quality of the video and audio is fine... but I'd recommend people not waste their time and bandwidth on this crap."
