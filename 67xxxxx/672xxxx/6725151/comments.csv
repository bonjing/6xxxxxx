,Enolena,2011-12-26T22:41Z,"It took only 1/2 a day to download all of grandy88's Lost Season 1-6.  

After 2 days, I only have 16.4% of these SRT files.  Would someone please seed this for me?"

,eumaios,2012-02-22T17:41Z,Downloading at less than 2kb/s. Anyone know if these are hosted anywhere else?

,LakersCentral,2012-05-01T07:25Z,"I haven't watched Lost, but I download it all for my mom (she has a WDTV). 

What I'm wondering is... are there parts in the show where languages other than English are spoken? In other words, are the subtitles necessary to the storyline?

If so, are there any subs out there that contain non-english parts only? These subs seem to contain all dialogue. 

In any case, thank you for providing these."

there is some moments in Lost where there was no translation by the showrunners on purpose for dramatic purposes such as Dogen's Japanese, some Latin, Korean etc.  you'll need to look at lostpedia for those, or download fan translated subs

then there's the ones they want you to see like different Latin scenes, most of the Korean.  you don't have to worry about subtitle files for those like you do with some TV releases if that's what you're asking.  the showrunners or the networks embedded them into the show"
