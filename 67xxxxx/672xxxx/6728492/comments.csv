,marco699,2011-10-07T22:58Z,"This method was tested with the STEAM_UNLOCKED and SKIDROW versions.

,Torx8,2011-10-07T23:23Z,Why do you upload something you haven't tried? makes no sense..
,AdrenaLiNv2,2011-10-07T23:43Z,@Torx8 Good point.
,OmniNegro,2011-10-08T00:20Z,"Hmmm. Only works for those who would have something to lose if it is not legit... Yeah. Pass.

Scammers everywhere. Never give in to idiocy.

@marco699 I do not know you. You may be legit. But this does seem suspect. Thanks anyway if you are not a scammer."
,yoshiw,2011-10-08T12:12Z,"You can not add friends in Steam when you do not have at least one legit game already bound to your account. This means even IF this works, the moment Steam bans you, you waste at least one legit bought game. 

Avoid this and try green luma or such"
,deftond,2011-10-09T03:06Z,"YA LOVE THAT

HAVE NOT TRIED IT YET BUT IT WORKS.

""YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOOSE"" LOL....EXEPT YOUR FUCKING STEAM ACCOUNT YOU FUCKING IDIOT"
,marco699,2011-10-10T01:09Z,"Sorry guys, I will never again upload anything I have not tested myself.
I have tryied to remove this torrent but it still up here?
If I ever get a skull I shall remove this torrent, Maybe another skull could remove it for me. I would never go out my way to hurt anyones PC, just trying to help.
"
,deftond,2011-10-13T00:35Z,"Sorry marco699

I just hate seeing people upload things that could damage someones computer.

It would be our own fault if we actually tried it and got banned from steam...but don't suggest it to people....just state I am only the uploader use at your own risk or something."
,reggiereggie,2011-10-14T11:51Z,"Just make a new steam account, and you can download TeamFortress 2 which is now free, then you can add friends perhaps?

Just a thought"
,Dufox,2011-11-02T18:37Z,"A for effort tho man
ty for trying"
,Andendre,2011-11-17T01:45Z,"Click the ""X"" on the far right side of the Torrent's name (In the top), that should delete it, make sure you're logged in first or it won't show."
,TaZeRz,2012-01-13T08:30Z,"Uhh but I don't have any friends, can't you make it a server list?"
