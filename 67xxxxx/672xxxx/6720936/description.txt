    Charming, blithely amoral devil-may-care rogue Jesse Smith and           
    peaceful, devout straight-arrow Mormon Lester O'Hara are estranged       
    half brothers who are reunited after receiving a sizable inheritance     
    from their deceased mother. The wildly contrasting mismatched duo get    
    into all sorts of trouble while trying to claim said inheritance.
