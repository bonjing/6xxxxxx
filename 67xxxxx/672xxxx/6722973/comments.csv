,fasttoy07,2011-10-11T12:15Z,"@ bobnjeff: This Torrent is corrupted, I have downloaded this file several times over the past 5 days from different sources from both an iMac running Snow Leopard and a VAIO PC running windows 7. 

This .mkv file is not recognizable by VLC Player, Mac Blu-Ray Player, Windows Media Player, Western Digital TV HD Media Player, HTC EVO running Android, Video Spec 0.8.2,  PavTube Media Converter, Tipard Media Converter, Aunsoft iMedia Converter, HandBrake and MKVToolnix. 

If at all possible re-upload and add ""FIX"" to the title.

If you doubt this try downloading yourself and opening it. It is a 13.32 GB brick. I bet it was corrupted during the upload process.

Any assistance will be greatly appreciated. Thanks."
[T],bobnjeff,2011-10-11T13:57Z,downloading now
[T],bobnjeff,2011-10-11T19:16Z,"well sad to say it would not play and i tried a few fixes but no go.
so i will upload it to a new sever i just picked up last night with fibre networks. not to say it was the other seedbox but it gave me problems for the 2 months that i have tried it. bluseed was always freezing up and going dead for hours at a time with almost no support. 

so i do Apologize for the problem and will look into  issues more promptly"
[T],bobnjeff,2011-10-11T19:36Z,"i downloaded this and yes it is a bad file could not fix it. i just picked up a new server last night with fibre networks so i will upload it to that.not to say it was the other seedbox but for the 2 monthe i had it slowing down not working for hours at a time was very common

so i do apologize for the hassle and the new torrent should be ready some time in the morning

and i will look into possible problems a little faster next time"
,fasttoy07,2011-10-11T23:58Z,"Thanks allot. I will try again in the morning. 

I never had any other problems with your other uploads. They were perfect. That is why I figured it happened somewhere during the upload process. And once again Thanks."
