The history of the Buddhist Dharma Protector Dorje Shugden, presented as a graphic novel.
It is correct in the details, although the presentation and storyline are a little cheesy in a Jehovas-Witness-Leaflet kind of way.
Don't let that put you off though - if you want a presentation without any of the political baggage that seems to accompany Dorje Shugden related material lately then this is it.
Thanks to the people who put this together and released it for free.
