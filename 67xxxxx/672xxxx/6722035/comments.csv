,Maledepecher,2011-10-05T16:50Z,"Thanks for Fallout 3 Complete Edition Illiria.
------------------------
Can you release Two Worlds II best repack with
all the patches and all the DLCs.
I really hope you can make it because you are the smartest one from the internet.

"

I'll look into it. Proper repacks are not something that is being done is a day (well, depends on a game). It requires thorough testing and understanding of game resources. And I haven't even downloaded Two Worlds II yet...
I'll look into it, but thats all I can promise for now."
[T],gunnersrock,2011-10-05T17:24Z,"@illiria

First off thank you for all your time and effort you put into these wonderful repacks.....

Does this repack improve the Game of the Year edition in anyway ? 

Can you kindly do a single player only repack of ""Rage"" ?"
,illiria,2011-10-05T19:56Z,"This isn't entirely a repack - game installation is left as is. Didn't want to mess with the stuff that works well already. Only DLCs are repacked, basically. And some other stuff is improved.
But in this particular case, I don;t deserve that much praise.
I am unaware of any differences between the retail version, and GOTY version. Are there any?
There is Patch 1.7 and all DLCs - which, I assume, already present in GOTY. So I don't think it improves GOTY in any way.

Asd for ""Rage"" - I've downloaded it, and am installing right now. I'm not sure about a repack right now. I have discovered a compression bug in my program, I'll need to do a thorough testing first. All I can say is - we'll see."
,illiria,2011-10-05T19:58Z,"I usually repack only STEAM versions of games, which do not have a normal install to them. Like New Vegas."
[T],gunnersrock,2011-10-05T20:33Z,"@illiria

ok... thanks for the reply.

small doubt- when you say you didn't repack the game,only dlc'. Do you mean that the full ""fallout 3"" not the repack is included in this release  or that this release contains only the dlc's?"
,illiria,2011-10-06T02:10Z,"Full Fallout 3, latest official patch, latest unofficial patch, proper games for windows live, all the DLC (repacked), and the GECK. Everything, of course."

,Insomneac,2011-10-06T05:58Z,"Thanks as always, Illiria.

Is is possible to list the autorun options for this?

And sorry to ask here, but does the Duke Nukem repack contain Update 1?

Thank you for your efforts, they're appreciated.
"
,illiria,2011-10-06T07:49Z,"@ Insomneac

I should have made an Autorun for it, yeah... Not sure why I haven't. Maybe I'll do it right now. Maybe I won't. I haven't decided yet. If I will, I'll make a new torrent with it. Keep an eye out.

And No, Duke doesn't contain Update 1."
,illiria,2011-10-06T08:41Z,"*********************************************

Okay, MADE AN AUTORUN FOR THIS EDITION.

This torrent appears to be of very high quality, and I'd love to run it, but the game crashes when I start a new game. I've updated with V1.7 and used your version of Windows Games - LIVE. My computer meets the system requirements.

Here's the process I took to install the game:

1) Installed via SETUP. 

2) Installed G4WL

3) Updated to V1.7

And the final result is the game crashing when click the 'new game' and windows telling me ''fallout 3 has stopped working..."" I'm running Windows 7 64bit is 64bit supported? Thanks! "

,xxmastermushxx,2011-10-13T02:27Z,"This still doesn't work. It crashes and windows states ""fallout 3 had stopped responding..."" until I close the program. 

Fallout New Vegas work fine, but not fallout 3. "

,vicecityfreak,2011-10-27T00:17Z,"This, and your Fallout: NV torrent, are amazing! Quick download and easy installing of all components. The only problem I had was I have to run Fallout 3 through Fallout Mod Manager in order to load the DLC's, but that's a problem with the game launcher, not the torrent. Thank you and keep them coming!"
,belikovalex,2011-10-27T01:24Z,hey when i go into new game it starts loading and then just stops working. what should i do?
,James.P,2011-11-12T05:52Z,"So can someone either tell me how to run this or install and give directions, or just tell me how to create this into an ISO with the auto run illiria made many thanks for any help the NV works perfectly fine though"
,MadnessLol,2011-11-26T02:28Z,"Mmm I've been trying to get this to work for 2 days lol.. I downloaded this last night and then deleted it because I thought it was missing files.. there are no DLC's and theres no update in the game.. also when I try to play it the game crashes.. I downloaded it again tonight and the same thing is happening.. I read all the comments and found the auto run.. but when I try to use it I get an error with ""The specified file was not found."" I'm not very good with this kind of thing. I've only downloaded a few games so far. Err please help me. :)"
,squazify,2011-12-11T23:29Z,i downloaded another that constantly crashed. would this one be just as bad. i had alot of problems with the other. does this crash as much?
,SahibIncitar,2011-12-27T20:01Z,It keeps crashing after I click the New game. I've installed everything on the autorun installer. 
,OneBadBasterd,2011-12-28T21:05Z,"Ive just finished the download , good speed , enough seeders , no trouble on instal of the game , just need to instal the updates and everything , going to leave another comment if i encounter any problems."
,bunkyboy,2011-12-30T07:49Z,OK im new at this but i got almost all of this done i do believe but i think im missing one step. I can play the game by itself i have downloaded both updates the live file and i have the DLC in the main file but when i go to the section to click the boxes it lets me click them all but it doesnt do anything... i just go back to same original game with no DLC. even when im at the screen that i click on the data files option if i check them and then go to play game if i go back to the data files they are all unchecked. did i put the DLC files in the wrong spot? plz help
,MrDEA666,2012-01-22T08:46Z,Thanks for uploading the game. :)
,MrDEA666,2012-01-22T09:54Z,"I've got a problem. The game keeps freezing in different places, the place is when your having you birthday party, when they give you your BB Gun. No matter what I do, it keeps freezing. I tried differents answers but it didn't work. The first tipe it froze was right after I shot the bug with the gun when It tried to go to the next scene, from then on it freezes in different moments. Like trying to talk to the robot that makes the cake, right before I go to the reactor, every time is different. How am I supposed to fix this. I've installed the uptade, the G4WL thing, and the DLC's. Anything else?!"
,JussiWarcon,2012-02-08T00:17Z,Why don't you have a green skull yet?! Jesus Christ you put so much work into this and they are all great but no skull? that's sad :( Anyways I was looking for a fallout 3 torrent since I knew you had made a complete edition of FNV I crossed my fingers and here it is. You are a blessing my friend!
,JussiWarcon,2012-02-08T00:21Z,Oh yeah and a question. Is it possible to download mods to this one and the fallout new vegas torrents that you have uploaded? 
,traceurhull,2012-02-13T16:14Z,"Thanks Illiria! I downloaded with ease, have seeded. I am very new to all this, so i have a question if anyone can help. 

After finishing the download, i simply used daemon tools to be able to activate the installer for the game. all installed fine, and i have been playing with no crashes all is great, however, i didnt do anything to install any of the DLC packs, how do i know if they are installed? Thanks"
,alexlester9,2012-02-23T21:53Z,"Attention people using Windows 7 with more than 1 core!

To stop the graphics from freezing do this:

1) Go to task manager and find the fallout3.exe process. 
2) Right click fallout3.exe and click ""set affinity""
3) Select CPU 0
4) You must do this everytime you launch the game."
,Witiko,2012-04-02T19:44Z,CAn't get it 2 work on seven crashes every time i stat it up I have done every fix   however that is just on my comp I guess so good torrent fast dl and good install
