We need letters. Somehow, these 26 abstract building blocksâ€”each with its own
unique arrangement of lines, curves, or dotsâ€”work together in endless combinations
to represent ideas. We need to copy these forms clearly and consistently in order to record our thoughts on paper in a way that others can understand.
We all know the pride young students (and their teachers and family members!)
take in their first attempts at writing these forms and in the important steps they take in kindergarten and first grade on the way to becoming writers. Children are highly motivated to learn to write.

But how do we keep that sense of wonder, that joy of getting lost in the letters
alive as second and third graders take on the new challenge of writing in cursive?
Nurturing a love of writing is one of the many things teachers already do; how
can we integrate this new form of written communication into our work and create
another strong, fun diving board from which children can jump into the exhilarating
pool of literacy?

Welcome to Cursive Writing Made Easy and Fun!

Curvy letters, script, fancy writing, grown-up lettersâ€”no matter what students call it, cursive is a writing system that requires practice to learn. Like all writing systems, it is full of random, abstract symbols requiring our attention.
Students can explore the beauty of our writing system and take pride in their written work when they are having fun learning and creating cursive letters. Coupled
with their strong desire to learn to write like adults or older brothers and sisters,
learning cursive is a motivational building block for studentsâ€™ future literacy development: when students enjoy putting pencil to paper, and see their writing as a form of individual expression, they are more likely to do more of it!
