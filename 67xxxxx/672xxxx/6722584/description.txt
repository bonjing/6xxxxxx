Building a Better Path to Success!
Connecting Knowledge â€“ Sherri prepares her students for success by refreshing their knowledge of arithmetic. By helping students see the connection between arithmetic and algebra, Sherri found that her students were more confident in their abilities as they progressed through the course. This classroom tested practice was integrated into the texts so that both instructors and students could benefit. Messersmith accomplishes this by including arithmetic examples for most sections before the use of algebraic examples. Also, the author has developed through classroom use a series of Basic Skills Worksheets that can easily be integrated into the classroom.
Presenting Concepts in â€œBite Sizeâ€ Pieces â€“ By breaking down the sections into manageable pieces, the author has identified the core places where students traditionally struggle and then assists them in understanding that material to be successful moving forward.
Mastering Concepts - With the textbook and Connect Mathematics hosted by ALEKS, a new online homework and assessment tool, students can practice and master their understanding of algebraic concepts.
Messersmith is rigorous enough to prepare students for the next level yet easy to read and understand. The exposition is written as if a professor is teaching in a lecture to be more accessible to students. The language is mathematically sound yet easy enough for students to understand.
