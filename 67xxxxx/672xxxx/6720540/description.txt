The body of a dead man, later identified as 35-year-old Connor Ryan, member of a fishing
trawlers crew, is found floating at sea. When Eve arrives at the harbour to examine the body,
Hale tells her that the trawler and the other crew members, Patsy Fay and marine biologist
Tom Wilkes, are missing.

The trawler was originally hired by Wilkes to collect samples for a study of local geological
features, but Hale, Eve and the team soon realise all is not what it seems. They work together
to investigate the disappearance of the crew and determine the cause of Connor's death.
