Information
------------------------------

Wildlife presenter Steve Backshall comes face-to-face with some of the world's deadliest animals.
This is a childrens wildlife series shown on CBBC and BBC HD.


1)  Costa Rica 
Steve Backshall embarks on one of his best ever missions, to the steamy rainforests of Costa Rica, where he sets out to hunt down some of the deadliest animals in Central America. The mission gets off to a breathtaking start when Steve is almost strangled by a giant boa constrictor, is struck dumb by the strike speed of a viper, and plays hide and seek with a deadly bushmaster. And as if that wasn't enough, he gets hands-on with the world's most poisonous frog, nearly gets a nip from a blood-sucking vampire and has a dramatic encounter with a huge American crocodile.

2)  Argentina and Peru 
Join Steve Backshall on one of his best ever missions, this time to the heart of South America. A hunt for the mighty anaconda goes badly wrong when Steve is attacked by an unseen predator; when he does find his snake it almost breaks his hand. Steve takes a dip in piranha-infested waters to see these voracious predators up close, and has a surprising face-to-face encounter with the creature that bit him. Steve's mission then takes him over the border into Peru, where he meets the fierce giant river otter and another very different - but equally formidable - snake.

3)  Mexico and Panama 
Steve is in Central America for another of his best ever missions. First, he takes to the water in search of a monster of the deep seas. It is so dangerous that he has to wear chain mail to stop it from ripping him to shreds, and be tethered to the boat in case it drags him down. Back on dry land Steve goes searching for the biggest wasp in the world, before setting off for what turns out to be his best ever day of snake hunting. Then he heads out to Panama to track down one of the largest, and most impressive, birds of prey in the world: the harpy eagle. Finally, Steve faces his fears to handle some giant bullet ants, who possess the world's most painful insect bite.

4)  Philippines 
Steve Backshall is in the Philippines for another of his best ever missions. He has a tense and intimidating encounter with a living dinosaur, and delves into a subterranean world to find an arachnid with legs four times longer than its body. An early morning dive in the beautiful waters of the Philippines rewards him with a stunning shark that spends most of the day 550 meters below the surface. There is a swim with one of the deadliest snakes on the planet, and a nocturnal search in the jungle reveals a Tarsier, a deceptively cute predator who eats its victims head first.

5)  South Africa and Namibia 
Join Steve Backshall on one of his best ever missions to find some of the most exciting and deadly animals in Southern Africa. Steve braves the big waves of the Durban coast to get almost too close for comfort to a pack of 30 hungry blacktip sharks. Next on his list is a flight with the mighty black eagle, and then he abseils down a cliff to come face to face with a huge swarm of angry killer bees. Undaunted by a painful sting, he heads over the border into Namibia, where he has a close encounter with a sidewinder before getting hands on with the ultimate Africa predator, the lion!
