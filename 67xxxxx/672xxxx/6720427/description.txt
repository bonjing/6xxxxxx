Release Notes:

Voluspa is the first full-length album from The Golden Filter, an
electronic duo from New York. The bandÃ†s first single, Ã´Solid Gold,Ã¶
came out in February 2009 and for the rest of that year the bandÃ†s
newfound fansÃ¹many gained through performances at SXSWÃ¹had to mostly
content themselves with The Golden FilterÃ†s interpretations of other
bands' music, remixes of songs by Cut Copy, Little Boots, and Peter
Bjorn and John, among others. For Voluspa, The Golden Filter signed
with Brille Records, the label that The Knife also call home. Like The
Knife, The Golden Filter is a mysterious and secretive boy-girl
electronic band, but with a heavier accent on synthesizers and disco.
