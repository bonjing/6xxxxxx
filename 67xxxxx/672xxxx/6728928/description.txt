This book has been written to give you lots of ways to help your students learn
about Ancient Rome. It combines background information, primary source material,
and hands-on activities so your students have a variety of ways to learn about this
time period. Although hands-on activities may take time; reading about Roman food
is certainly faster and easier than making some; they do make learning more memorable.
The closer students are to a real experience, the more likely learning is to stick.
Of course, a good activity should be more than just fun. It should have a clear purpose and leave students with a deeper, more meaningful understanding of a concept.

This book also has been designed to let you give your students a feel for Roman
life while at the same time helping you meet the five national World History standards. The material and activities give you ways to address the following standards: chronological thinking; historical comprehension; historical analysis and interpretation; historical research capabilities; and historical issues analysis and decision making.
