,ayeshl,2011-10-09T18:18Z,"Windows 8 is in early release ages so we don't know how they are planning to protect the OS with licensing issues.
There will be beta releases before May, next year (so they will be bug less and sorta stable - no licenses.)"

Sorry for your disk, time and Internet bill.
As the name says, this is not the final release. at least not a beta release.
Windows8 has a great new touch screen support with metro UI. If you are eager to test it, this torrent is for you. Else, Windows 7 is still your solution!"
