,artinusa,2011-10-08T20:39Z,Not sure why the download is so slow..will take me another 48 hours at this rate of 7-14 KB/s ..anyone?
,robbarrow,2011-10-09T13:23Z,thx! 
,trunksy,2011-10-15T22:07Z,"Um, the Installation ID was invalid but when I was transferred to the agent, they only asked for the first six digits and she sent me back to the automated system for the code. I don't know if my VoIP number is now logged with Microsoft or not but I guess you have to grin and bear it if you want this method to work and you're not ""scurred"" of an Indian Microsoft agent."
,devilcrow,2011-10-20T01:41Z,"Struggling to get this to work, any suggestions?"
,SapphieBlue,2011-10-22T02:12Z,"This worked amazingly! Although I did have some problems when I tried to call in with my installation ID.

The machine told me that the code was invalid or something so it connected me to an operator. She obviously memorized everything from a script because the only things she asked me were what program I was trying to activate and what the first 6 digits of my installation code was. It was like a 2 minute conversation and then she transferred me back to the machine and it read out the confirmation code to me. 

So to anyone who's scared to call: Don't be! It's not that bad XD"

,SteinGalen,2011-10-22T10:47Z,Is there a permanent activator for Proffesional Plus?
,coolnsexy19,2011-10-23T16:12Z,does not work
,mitgarand,2011-10-29T11:42Z,Works! I was transferred to an agent who asked for the first and last sets of numbers. I was asked why I needed to activate. I told her I was working on a friend's computer and Office needed activation. I was then transferred to a computer which gave me a working activation code.
,m0k3d,2011-10-30T00:54Z,The product code in the instructions no longer works? anyone got a valid one?
,LoVeLyMaMa,2011-10-31T05:52Z,agree. also having same problem...can't get code to work that's in activation!! Please Help any would be greatly appreciated!! I'm not good at this stuff and spent so much time finally thinking I would have it work:( and to find out not valid :( I know your work is awesome!! Just really would love to get this working!!
,NichB77,2011-11-02T01:30Z,Doesn't work for me anymore either. I used it on my old computer.
,RobertoHN,2011-11-04T23:06Z,"The serial given into the rar file does not work, but I found another serial by googling and then I used the telephone method you described in this file and it worked just fine, the automated machine asked me the installation code and then it gave me the activation code... there was no need to talk with an operator. Thanks a lot."
,skaterfreak186,2011-11-07T22:18Z,and so this works with professional? i dont know what standard is.
,AmuLight,2011-11-15T23:53Z,"This is the real deal. You'll get denied and you'll have to talk to a real person, but they won't ask any questions and will give you the ID. Don't be afraid to talk to them!"
,AmuLight,2011-11-15T23:54Z,And this works for pro plus!
,scele,2011-12-13T09:15Z,Works perfectly for me. Thanks!
,justmealwatts,2012-01-02T04:34Z,"Activation works as described and was used on Win7 Standard x64 by thethingy. Yes, you have to talk to someone. Thanks!!!"
,Mr.Quipster,2012-01-05T12:31Z,I can't get past step 3. The product key is invalid. Anyone care to lend assistance? 
,RMG02,2012-01-13T04:57Z,"Activator works great!!!! Someone in India asks for the first 6 numbers, then puts you back to the automated system that just reads you the #'s to enter. NO QUESTIONS ASKED!!!!   I don't know what thethingy is, but my wallet thanks you greatly!"
,MmboJambo,2012-01-18T22:01Z,"It worked!
This is not any kind of software, it's just instructions on how to permanently active MS Office 2010.

I had trial version I downloaded from official website. I followed the instructions and an automated service asnwered the number. It was done in 5 min. Thank you The Thingy, all your torrents are 1st class!"
