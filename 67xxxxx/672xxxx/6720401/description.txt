These practices form the basis of a profound journey that reveals the link between the breath, the life force and the mind. You will learn how to use your breath to to generate energy and to direct this energy for greater health and healing. This energy is the basis of a more vital, creative life.

Prana and Pranic Healing teaches how to consciously generate and direct the energy (prana) in your body to achieve greater vitality and health.

You will learn to identify and remove blockages from your body, mind and emotions that prevent the natural flow of energy. You will feel invigorated.

As you increase your energy and your body becomes healthier, you are better able to cope with the stresses of everyday life. This reduces the effects of aging and supports the management and healing of chronic illnesses. Pranic healing meditations are the beginning of self mastery.
