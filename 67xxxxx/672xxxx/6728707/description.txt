[/b][/color] In the search for truth, there are certain questions that are not important.
Of what material is the universe constructed? Is the universe eternal? Are there limits or not to the universe? What is the ideal form of organization for human society? If a man were to postpone his search for Enlightenment until such questions were solved, he would die before he found the path.
QI explores the answers that are completely pointless but  Quite Interesting
