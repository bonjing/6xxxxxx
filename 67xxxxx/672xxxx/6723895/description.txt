
Since BAYIMAGE seems to not like me at random times, and this being one of those times I uploaded the cover for the DVD to imgur

Basics about it. NTSC, in English, a 4.7gig DVD format in a iso file, mount it or burn it or whatever, it is assumed you know the routine. 
It is rated R and it is a pretty cool retelling of a actual historical incident. Based on a real historical point in time and it is 

believable.. Run time 2hours and 35 minutes. Widescreen 1.85:1. 5.1 surround sound.

According to the IMDb. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118607/

I know there are other torrents of the same name but this is different that all the menus and the special bonus\'s are included. Even behind 

the scenes and interviews.


ANY questions about how to mount or burn the ISO file?

They have all sorts of tutorials to help for things like this.
Knock yourself out. You will have a more pleasant experience if you look for the
answers yourself before you ask the admins.
