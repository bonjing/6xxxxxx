Not sorry...  - It needs to be said.

Easy for you to spout off smart-ass comments about a man who did an incredible amount in his lifetime, while you sit at home leeching movies and software.

Classy. And mature. And real respectful.

Asshole."

It's filled with many inaccuracies so don't believe everything you see, especially the later years. Many dialogs were out of place with real events. You can even compare the in-movie Macworld event to the real one on YouTube.

Also the info at the end was wrong. Microsoft never owned any part of Apple. It was an investment into non-voting shares."
