The plot was rather typical and predictable, not forgetting kinda "crazy" too.. Whatever it is, the movie focus heavily on the race unity value that you will get what Namewee trying to convey in every corner of the movie.. Look, even TINY little like his T-Shirt convey such message too!

An ethnic Chinese rapper accused of stirring Malaysian racial tensions has brought his social commentary to cinemas with a food-themed comedy celebrating the country's mixed cultural recipe.

But Wee Meng Chee - better known by the alias Namewee - characteristically pulls few punches in Nasi Lemak 2.0, an unusually daring exploration of a tide of racial distrust that has stoked concern in multi-ethnic Malaysia.

The comedy, named after the national rice dish and which opened last week, takes an unflinching but ultimately fond look at many of the racial stereotypes that Muslim-majority Malaysia's various ethnic groups aim at each other.

The main character, an arrogant chef played by Wee, expresses revulsion at Islamic practices such as circumcision.

In another scene, an ethnic Chinese student complains of difficulty getting into college, a reference to quota policies and other privileges favouring the dominant Malay ethnic group.
