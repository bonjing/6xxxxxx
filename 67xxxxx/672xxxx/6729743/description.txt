Neighbours from Hell 1:

In the game Neighbours from Hell, the player creeps around the neighbourâ€™s house performing tricks upon the unsuspecting resident. The player is the star of a new TV show with the same name, with cameras that track every move as the player sets traps such as sawing the chair, banana peels/soap on the floor, smeared paintings and messing with home equipment. The game\\\\\\\'s objectives are to create disarray, increase ratings, and win awards. Obstacles in the game include the watchful neighbour himself, also - his guard dog, and a parrot called Chilli, both of whom will try to alert the Neighbour of Woody\\\\\\\'s presence.

GameplayEach level\\\\\\\'s goal is to play some crude tricks on your neighbour by using every item near your character. Each stage has 4 or 5 zones (Not including the training stages). You must move Woody to zone from zone, The Neighbour moves with them as time goes by. Sometimes you can distract him with different ways (such as call him to make him go downstairs) or he gets distracted automatically (For example, painting, washing clothes, and so on.) He has pets watching over him, such as a parrot named Chilli.
