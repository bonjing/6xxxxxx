Our Atmosphere:Earth Science
Atmosphere The scientific marvel that is Earth's unique and complex atmosphere we reveal the scientific marvel that is Earth's unique and complex atmosphere. We investigate how this thin but vital blanket of air, the equivalent thickness of a lick of vanish on a model globe, came about. How a chance interplanetary collision and a remarkable plant mutation created the only planet in the solar system with an atmosphere rich in oxygen- the potent gas that powers our planet. We uncover how our atmosphere carries rivers of life-giving water, acts like an invisible wall against deadly space matter. And we meet the only man to have ever braved its hostile upper reaches and survived.
