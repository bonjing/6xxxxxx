,digs5446,2011-10-05T23:59Z,"wow, what a great idea!  is this all of the extras from the box set, or just the ""main"" documentaries?  thanks either way!"
,sledgeDJ,2011-10-06T08:27Z,just the main docs
,sledgeDJ,2011-10-06T08:30Z,The other main extras (deleted scenes and spoofs) are already available in other releases/torrents so I did not feel the need to include them.
,lastjedi,2011-10-06T19:42Z,152 leechers and only sledge seeding.that guy digs downloaded this this month and he couldnt even seed it.what an asshole.i hate people like him.i can't seed this because i'm still trying to download this.it says my download speed is 0.2 kb/s so this will take like 1 year and 30 weeks to finish.i'm about to give up.
,Madmateo,2011-10-06T23:00Z,"Thank you for your torrent!!!
