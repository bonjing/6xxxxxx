"How To Love"

Cut the music up a little louder

You had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldnâ€™t ever figure out
How to love
How to love

You had a lot of moments that didnâ€™t last forever
Now you're in this corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love

For a second you were here
Now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Never had a love

When you was just a young and your looks were so precious
But now your grown up
So fly it's like a blessing but you canâ€™t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
Itâ€™s seems like you came back ten times over
Now youâ€™re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldnâ€™t ever figure out
How to love
How to love

See you had a lot of moments that didnâ€™t last forever
Now you're in this corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love

For a second you were here
Why you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love

You had a lot of dreams that transformed to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasnâ€™t your fault
Wasnâ€™t in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me
Be the one listenin'
But I admire your popping bottles and dippinâ€™
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so donâ€™t be mad
Nobody else tripping
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook

See You had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldnâ€™t ever figure out
How to love
How to love

See you had a lot of moments that didnâ€™t last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love

Oh,
See I just want you to know
That you deserve the best
Youâ€™re beautiful
Youâ€™re beautiful
Yeah

And I want you to know, youâ€™re far from the usual
Far from the usual

You see you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldnâ€™t ever figure out
How to love
How to love

See you had a lot of moments that didnâ€™t last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love

See you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldnâ€™t ever figure out
How to love
How to love

See you had a lot of moments that didnâ€™t last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love
