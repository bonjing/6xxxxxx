,enonumus,2012-02-18T21:37Z,"After a 3 day download.... HUGELY disappointing if you speak English rather than Hindi.  The video is a PERFECT DVD rip @ 1024x576, however the ripper totally flubbed the audio and specified the wrong FPS when they ripped the English audio track.  That or they just snagged an English audio track from some other torren that had a different FPS for whatever crazy reason.  

It's not a matter of just being out of sync by x number of seconds, that would be easily correctable.  It's the wrong FPS, so it gets further and further out of sync as you go along.  By 20 minutes into the movie you're a good 20 to 30 seconds out of sync, and you're already way out of sync  1 minute into the movie.  The Lion's roar in the first couple seconds is about the only thing that appears in sync.  If you can find another 25FPS copy and steal the audio track from that, this is definitely the best video track to have.  Unfortunately I think this is the only 25fps torrent around."
