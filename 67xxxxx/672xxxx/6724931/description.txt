Explorations in College Algebra, 5/e and its accompanying ancillaries are designed to make algebra interesting and relevant to the student. The text adopts a problem-solving approach that motivates students to grasp abstract ideas by solving real-world problems. The problems lie on a continuum from basic algebraic drills to open-ended, non-routine questions. The focus is shifted from learning a set of discrete mathematical rules to exploring how algebra is used in the social, physical, and life sciences. The goal of Explorations in College Algebra, 5/e is to prepare students for future advanced mathematics or other quantitatively based courses, while encouraging them to appreciate and use the power of algebra in answering questions about the world around us. Explorations in College Algebra was developed by the College Algebra Consortium based at the University of Massachusetts, Boston and funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation. The materials were developed in the spirit of the reform movement and reflect the guidelines issued by the various professional mathematics societies (including AMATYC, MAA, and NCTM).
