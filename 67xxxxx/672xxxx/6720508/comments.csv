,jonmobrien,2011-10-16T14:28Z,"FAKE!

Ok, since the uploader and none of the downloaders bothered to answer or comment, given it is such a small download, I took the plunge and downloaded this.

And I am sorry to say - it is a fake - it is NOT a 3D Video so should not be in the 3D Video section. The ""3D"" the anonymous uploader is referring to is the 3D computer animation, like say: Toy Story and other Pixar animations as compared to flat ""2D"" Simpsons, South Park, Bugs Bunny, but 3D animation simply refers to the renderring of the animation, it is NOT a 3D film like Avatar 3D, Toy Story 3-3D, Imax 3D, etc."

,jonmobrien,2011-10-20T17:55Z,"See the section this idiot upload FAKER put it in?
Type: Video > 3D
This is NOT 3D Video.
Hence FAKE claim.
FAKE FAKE FAKE

@zippospam - read your own post that you wrote:
""see the tittle? ""3D Comedy Animation "" --> AAAANIIIIMAAAAATIOOOOOOOOON""

EXACTLY - so why are you calling me a fag when you agree with me - since as you are well aware, a 2D video of 3D animation it is NOT 3D VIDEO.

There are thousands of 3D ""animation"" 2D videos out there, do you propose to flood the 3D Video category with all these 2D videos?"
