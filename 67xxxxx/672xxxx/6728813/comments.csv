,Digee,2011-10-08T04:58Z,"wtf is with all these messy torrents? (loads of rar files and excess bullshit?!)
I only want 1 file, its a .mkv of a TV show called Fringe.
Instead we have:
32 x rar files
2 x text files
1 x sample
1 x .nfo
but why?"
,Digee,2011-10-08T05:08Z,"thankyou for the upload btw. Am just offering constructive criticism/feedback... Still grateful that I'll shortly be watching a great quality copy of Fringe shorty after TV showing. however I am left with a problem of keeping two copies... one .mkv I can add and keep in my TV collection/playlist, and one torrent in a format of .rar's that are no use (so I am drawn into delete the .rars after downloading, rather than taking up twice the space on my HDD) ...Just a suggestion for future, if you want seeds."

But im here to coment the following:
dling at freaking 1kbps and uploading at 120kbps FUCK YOU GUYS! :)"
,sanga81,2011-10-08T06:17Z,It's not that hard. Simply STFU and enjoy the show.

 If your using VLC media player look in media options, you dont even need to unrar to play the video... Long live the  R.A.R"
,useduser,2011-10-08T08:59Z,"@John8611 Didn't know that, great tip! Thanks."
,useduser,2011-10-08T09:01Z,"@ Digee, why don't you upload yourself before criticising others?"
,Digee,2011-10-08T11:26Z,"@john8611 thanks thats actually AWESOME!!! :D

@useduser Thanks for the advice but that was my intention... several reasons why...

-Because constructive criticism is supposed to offer feedback to the uploader so that he can think about changing his own practices. Offering an alternative is good as well but they are two different things. I want to see more people seeding and I felt explaining why torrents like this arent seeded for as long. (not everyone understands the mindset)
-I *still* havent finished the download so I actually cant clean and re-upload yet
-eztv beat me to it (only 1 clean .mkv file)
-UnRAR'ing turns out to be unneccessary :D
-fuck you
-I dont think I need to be a torrent maker to gain the right to offer an opinion on it
-Feedback is useful to EVERYONE regardless of what I upload"
,Digee,2011-10-08T11:29Z,"@useduser

-You criticise me/my comment without having uploaded anything yourself! hypocrite!"
,Digee,2011-10-08T11:43Z,"btw I was genuinely asking *why?*

We came here for a single file. It began as a single file. until it was processed into more files (for which I dont see any potential)"
,semontrax,2011-10-08T12:57Z,"I really enjoy the file names on these torrents:
""peter scares walter"" made me lol"
,john8611,2011-10-08T23:50Z,"@Digee..

 The files come this way as the guys on the scene use this method in old days, remeber back when modems screamed and you pulled your hair waiting 20 minutes to see one high def boob. It was easier in them days to chop files into pieces so if there was a download problem you could grab the bits missed. "
,john8611,2011-10-08T23:52Z,Also those of us with O.C.D love rars
,Digee,2011-10-09T01:17Z,"@john8611 I do remember that being useful in P2P days!! :) Actually I was very grateful and impressed by it back then the first time I encountered split RARs.

Hang on.. is that last bit sarcasm?!? I label and categorise my entire media collection, and work my hardest to achieve efficiency and minimalism with software and data. So I'm surpised you say that about OCD cause thats what I blamed for my original post and I worried I was alone on that!! But I suppose OCD is stereotypically seen as people repeating good habits past their usefulness.

Each to their own ^^ I'm gonna stick with the single files properly labelled, and when theyre not avaliable, I'll make them as alternatives for like-minded people."
[V],meech,2011-10-10T01:53Z,"Digee, you're not alone. The times they are a changing.  Actually, they've already changed.  I never understood (still don't) why people continue to use rar'd torrents on thepiratebay. I've kind of given up.  The uploader doesn't seem to care (never comments back defending the use of rars.  Sometimes I wonder if he's doing it on purpose to provoke a response, for s's and giggles...i dunno).  Anyway, I don't think it's going to change any time soon.  At least we still get the great high quality shows as you mentioned.  Just takes an extra step and decreases seeding.  Oftentimes, there are unrar'd alternatives.  But when there isn't, we just gotta make due."
