Hi,

It was a bit harder this month, but the result is quite good. Good enough to releaase some of the playlists already, although it is not finished yet.

But what the h..., I can always make an addition. Like last month.

Enjoy and share.



Background.

This download is meant for people (like me) who hate (or have no time) going through the various Indie playlists every month.

Running a bar I do this every month trying to find something nice (and new) for my customers. I usually end up with three lists.

@1. Nice, clear and easy for people who like to talk while listening.
@2. A bit louder for people who are not able to talk anymore (too crowded).
@3. The ones I like myself and do not fit in one of the above categories.


VHQ (Very High Quality).

Only the best (sounding) tracks are selected. They are in 100% clean and fully labelled MP3 VBR format. This might save you some time.

Enjoy and keep the Indie spirit high (by promoting, sharing and seeding we can enjoy these songs together).
