Why I Am Not a Christian is an essay by the British philosopher Bertrand Russell hailed by The Independent as devastating in its use of cold logic, and listed in the New York Public Librarys list of the most influential books of the 20th century.
Russell begins by defining what he means by the term Christian and sets out to explain why he does not believe in God and in immortality, and why he does not think that Christ was the best and wisest of men, the two things he identifies as essential to anybody calling himself a Christian.

He considers a number of logical arguments for the existence of God, including the cosmological argument, the natural-law argument, the teleological argument and moral arguments following what he describes as \\\"the intellectual descent that the Theists have made in their argumentations. He also goes into specifics about Christian theology, alleging defects in the teaching and moral character of Jesus, in particular because he believed in hell and everlasting punishment.
