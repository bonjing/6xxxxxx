Agnostics are intellectually honest.

,bdwilson,2011-10-13T18:51Z,"You don't need to be certain there is no god any more than you need to be certain that there is no Santa (who has never been disproven).  All that is sufficient to establish atheism is to point out that theists have not made there case, and there is no reason to believe in a god.   Agnosticism and atheism are completely compatible, since they address different issues.   If you don't accept the claim ""fairies exist"", that makes you an a-fairyist.  Despite not being disproven, you don't currently believe in them.  Ditto for gods. "
,nwo777,2012-02-26T13:12Z,"What is the point of even writing a book to say what you are not? Talk about negative.  Unless of course Bertrand Russell is trying to discredit the overwhelming evidence that God does exist.  Perhaps the author would like to explain some of the undeniable facts in this torrent :)

and then he can write a book about why he is no longer stupid !"

@nwo777: B Russell died in 1970 which has, sadly, adversely affected his ability to pen new books.

For anyone interested, here is a nice wiki article about Russell.
