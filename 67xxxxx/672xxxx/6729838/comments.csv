,frijolito,2011-10-08T18:59Z,"I downloaded the sample file to check out the quality (with the current 1:54 leecher:seeder ratio on this torrent you can expect this to finish downloading next week)

Still looks pretty low quality to me, I'd give V: 6.5/10. Audio quality can't really tell, since the sampled scene has no dialogue and little sound anyway.

I'm staying away from this one, thanks anyway I guess."
,simon200,2011-10-08T19:06Z,Cheers for the up

,thugking8,2011-10-10T06:51Z,The sample looks good V: 8 A: 8 fuck the homo's who are moaning fuck off u winging fags
,UKMadDog,2011-10-10T07:22Z,"@thugking8
Not moaning just saying what the quality is like ,as i have said on previous torrents uploaders are top but just don't overstretch the truth if its a cam or Ts just put it in the title if this is as stated a ppvrip then it is one of the worst i have seen.

I have never and would never knock an uploader after all if not for them all of us would not be  here. What i do knock are little boys like yourself who find it makes them feel big about themselves if they curse and put down everybody with there foul language. 1 sentence and 4 put downs WOW you did good "
,5amjr,2011-10-10T08:58Z,"This one joins iwannafan2's attempt at transformers, green lantern, rise of/apes, capt america, all VHS quality shit.

I'm all for givin big thanx for good files but those who thank just b'cos he uploaded a file need a backbone. Fakers upload unwatchable torrents too, gonna thank them twats??? lol"
,drewkrew,2011-10-10T11:37Z,"sadly i agree with that. 
The reent spate of files tagged as ""iFLIX - PPVrip"" just seem to be a cam sat infront of a tv showing a PPV, so it ends up no better than a straight cam, and most have been in 4:3 ratio and in this day and age, EVERYONE expects 16:9!!!!"
,Phatfish,2011-10-10T16:54Z,A/V - Sorry but it's past the watchable point for me. All the indoor and night scenes are basically just almost all black.
,thugking8,2011-10-11T06:29Z,Sorry this is not a very good copy dark in places not worth it if you want to enjoy the whole film.
,Fallen_Gri,2011-10-11T13:33Z,Thnx but its just incredibly dark. Not worth it. Best to wait for a better rip. 
[V],vAin4us,2011-10-11T22:30Z,"Very dark in some spots, movie itself is the worst.

A/V/M: 7/6/2"
,scottsasse,2011-10-11T23:21Z,"@drewkrew, Sadly you are right!! They DO all look like some asshole set up a cam in front of a glossy old TV screen!! I would rather watch a crappy cam any day. My advise to others would be to find a cam until an R5 is available. Plus in this torrents description it actually says ""Another quality release from IFLIX
"". (Nothing quality about it). Uploaders, if you are going to use the word quality at least mean it!! Otherwise no bitching when people complain. It is perfectly acceptable for complaints on deceptive torrents!! Only reason this is on TPB top 100 list is because most people blindly trust uploaders with a skull. The truth is those of us without the skull are much more likely to be careful when uploading, at least I am!! Much Love, DrScott"
,ccapehart,2011-10-12T09:01Z,quality is good but the night scenes are really dark hard to see whats going on wait for r5 for dvd to get full affect great movie
,murdoc24,2011-10-14T20:50Z,very dark. unwatchable
,Dapped,2011-10-15T10:43Z,IFLIX = a waste of my time!!!!
,SirFuse,2011-10-16T06:26Z,"Another one trying to pass a low quality cam version off as a PPV.

A:8

,touchwoodblues,2011-10-19T14:48Z,YYYYYYYYYY Advertise it's a PPV when it is NOT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
