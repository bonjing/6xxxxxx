Each is left completely alone in a remote location, with just a handheld camera to film their struggle. They must find water, food and shelter, and battle against the elements and local wildlife. Forced to confront their innermost fears, will they survive being Alone in the Wild?

Its time for the ultimate team player to go it alone as England Cricket hero, Freddie Flintoff, is dropped in Botswanas Okavango Delta to survive for seven nights, with just a handheld video camera for company.
