,rikkusguardian,2012-03-18T04:19Z,Alright! This torrents going by at a great speed! I cant wait to try it out on HDloader when it's done!
,rikkusguardian,2012-03-19T01:34Z,"Torrent downloads fast, it's clean of viruses, and HDloader freaking LOVES it! Definitely seeding!

Just make sure you guys have 7zip or Winrar, and simply extract it, then use WINhip to place it on your hard drive! 

Magna Carta has all i ever want in a game, RPG elements, Japanese style are and culture, stylish fighting, and lovely, buxom ass kicking females!"
