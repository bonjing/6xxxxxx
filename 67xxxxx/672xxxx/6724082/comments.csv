,SeanHolt,2011-12-24T17:04Z,"Same for me, keygen process is listed in task manager, but no window is displayed."
,Sephiroth93,2011-12-26T03:40Z,"Funny, as soon as you close your Browser, it starts work.. Try that.. or close something else, I am not sure why it does that... THETA either failed or keygen has corrupted during seeding or something."

,Creeper12,2012-01-16T09:33Z,"Warning, the keygen is a trojan! It does not show positive on the antivirus, but I ran it in a virtual machine and monitored the packets. It does indeed try to phone home, but not sure to what extent. Anyways, I created a bunch of keys so you don't need to run it anyways:
