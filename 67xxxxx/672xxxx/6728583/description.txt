The prompts are organized by the 10 months of the school
year, September through June. Many of them relate to either
holidays or the anniversaries of famous events that occur during
those particular months. But sprinkled throughout the book are
also plenty of random prompts, encouraging kids to do everything
from write about clouds to keep a diary. Happy writing!
