,godfate,2011-10-08T07:11Z,"I'm getting really slow d/l rates right now (>10 kbps) but im gonna leave this on all night and once i get it, I promise I will seed like a whore, because this season is EPIC!"
[V],manOtor,2011-10-10T00:20Z,"Everyone please check your settings, if speed is slow - 100 seeds should be enough for fast download, and also seed as hell when you got this!

Just finished the season and I got to say, although I had to grow custom to Matt Smith as the doctor in season 5 he really made it up to me through season 5 and definitely season 6!
How wonderful a doctor's companion IS able to find true love besides the doctor :D ...
And Karen Gilla is sexy as hell - Arrrrrr!

I agree with godfate: This season is EPIC!"
,av5498,2011-12-28T02:26Z,Why in the fuck would you upload only a few episodes in .WAR and FOV files???????????? waste of a fucking download some are acceptable but not by much. No seeding from me torrent +data removed. Weak sauce manOtor
,kitchwench,2011-12-29T10:48Z,"Thanks for uploading this, had the season but grabbed space and time.  Can you upload the season extras (mini-episodes) Night and the Doctor or point me where to find them?  They've been taken off of youtube."
,afrogee,2012-02-16T21:20Z,loved this.... :D will be seeding it for a while.. :D :D :D
,FireGoddess1969,2012-03-09T00:54Z,thanks
,darkscale,2012-03-17T11:57Z,av5498: you abviosly have no idea what you are talking about. manOtor has simply collected what he has into one group and put it up for everyone. If you don't ike it feel free to download all the files one by one yourself and quit whining.
,Ultralazuli,2012-03-18T20:51Z,How can it be more epic than the TaRDiS removing all traces of existence in the universe?
,Ultralazuli,2012-03-18T20:53Z,How can this be more severe than the tardis destroying all of time and space? that's pretty much the epitome of epic
,thesleeper2003,2012-03-26T17:17Z,"Just want to say how gratefull I am to you for being one of the few people who uploads good shows like this.

Many thanks to you sir. I miss one episode on TV and never finish a series otherwise. so "

,Zythrone,2012-04-23T05:18Z,"There is no season 7 yet.
