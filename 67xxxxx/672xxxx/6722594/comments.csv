"
,toxic_elvis,2011-10-22T17:44Z,"@bretspark Just follow the instructions dont worry about the lenght, because when you click mem patch it will work."
,sakakaki,2011-10-27T18:38Z,it works follow intructions follow instruction you idiots
,scorpio33,2011-10-31T01:53Z,"Followed the instructions to the letter and cannot activate it.  Tried on my desktop and just for kicks, on my notebook - both running Win 7 x64.  Get as far as Step 14 and get the following window every time: ""You can only apply patch when licence screen appears"".  Well, I am at the damn licence screen since I was following the instructions here.  The licence screen appears after Step 11.  Anyone know of a ""real"" method of activating?!?  Thanks!"
,Fatty_Batter,2011-11-06T15:12Z,"I cannot down load the 32 bit Keygen as there is a trogen in it ad the antivirus imediatly removes it.  What do I need to do to sort this out, with out downloading a Trojan?"
,Fatty_Batter,2011-11-06T19:05Z,"Well I took a punt a turned off the antivirus to download the Keygen and now have cad up and running.

No signs of issues with a trojan yet but I will have to see."
,crillybeef,2011-11-12T14:32Z,Hey I can't get either of the product keys to work the serial works fine but I get a red cross for the product key and can't continue any ideas?
,rizbiz,2011-11-13T05:56Z,"i keep getting this message when i click mem patch ""could not get debug privilege! Are you admin?"".......... what should i do???"
,Gachinto,2011-11-19T04:55Z,"Installed and working perfectly. Should I update / download update patch and install?

Installation got a bit ""sticky"" when I tried to choose to activation option, since it won't let me because no internet connection was not detected. I did manually and a local file was generated with the request code. When back to activate it; somehow it worked.

Thank you very much for your share!"
,Gachinto,2011-11-22T03:26Z,"Everything works like a charm!

@toxic_elvis: can i update this using the auto update function or manually download an update pack?"
,mobilius,2011-11-25T15:07Z,i have Autocad 2012 Mechanical and I cant get message that the product key is wrong. Does anybody have a working product key?
,mobilius,2011-11-25T15:15Z,I have problem with the Product Key in Autocad 2012 Mechanical. Does anybody have a working key?
,beeohat,2011-11-27T22:28Z,"Followed inst's exactly. generated the activation code, copied and pasted it in program (although it appeared to be 7 or 8 characters short). When I tried to activate, msg said ""Registration-Activation error"". Any thoughts?"
,house_team,2011-11-30T12:36Z,"@beeohat
you forgot to click mem patch
@all toxic_elvis account have been shut down for no reason, thats why he cant ansver your questions..."
,bobhead82,2011-12-06T14:09Z,"The instructions are very accurate up until step 11, the process of getting the request code was far more involved than ""choose activate option"".

That being said, if you follow through with the offline option, provide information and get to the last page, there is a file saved that will have the request at the bottom of the page. 

From there, you can close out that window, start the keygen, get the code, and with THAT window open, THEN you click mempatch. It does work, the instructions just became vague and out of order"
,ghavelus6,2012-01-02T07:03Z,"hello when i run xf-adesk2012x64 and  push the mem path botton it tells me ""could not get debug privilege!"" are you admin?"" and i'm admin"
,Blacker.Death.Metal,2012-01-18T08:54Z,"Well Vipre detected the thing as a trojan, but a type i didn't recognize... regardless it seemed pretty generic, and seems harmless.

I dont know how people were having trouble with this, i installed so easy. Click mem patch - yeah its short, so what? It works.

Absolutely no trouble installing - its a 3 step installation really, so i dont know why people seem to say it gets difficult around step 11 when following some douches install method.

So recap!

1. Run Set-up
2. Use serial provided, and install
3. Attempt to register, claim you have a code.
4. Use X-Force - Number comes up short
5. Click Mem Patch, and then click register.

,skiffbug,2012-01-25T10:25Z,"Hi, After finishing my install, when I re-open the Autocad program, I am asked to put in the serial and Product key. The key comes out with a red cross and I am stuck there. Any help here?"
,asteve78,2012-01-28T12:43Z,I'm sorry usually i never have problems with torrents but every torrent i get from pb doesnt start downaloading...it turns red and it's writtent zero seeds and zero peers....... I use utorrent.. can anyone help pls???
,shmuntz,2012-02-15T19:25Z,"If you can't get it to work you might be doing what I was doing wrong:

Make sure to ""Delete"" the text in the ""Paste Authentification here"" box.
I was just clicking in the box and pasting not realizing it still had the ""Paste Authentification here"" in the box along with my pasted code... so the generated activation code didn't work.

Hope that helps"
,remista,2012-03-14T11:31Z,"For some reason, I am not able to complete the activation. My windows is 64 and my requested code is: 732J GGL6 ZKJX F2HS 98CP XSTN 79RV 4XPZ
Could someone please help me? Thanks in advance! "
,ice_momo,2012-03-14T20:24Z,Just followed the instruction step by step and work perfectly for me!
,ice_momo,2012-03-14T20:28Z,"@remista

Copy your request code and follow step 13 onwards. If your computer has already login as administrator, just double click on 'xf-A2012-64bit'  (commonly your computer will start up as administrator if you are not sharing the same computer with anyone). Then follow through step 14, 15, etc etc....."
,metalfix666,2012-03-16T20:36Z,"This kegen doesn't open for me either i keep getting this message:

windows cannot access the specified device, path or file. you may not have the appropriate permissions to access them. 

why is this happening. I ran it as administrator. "
,remista,2012-03-21T11:19Z,"@ice_momo

Thanks for your answer. Unfortunately it did not solve my problem as seems that my ""xf-A2012-64bit"" file isn't working as I got the following message after right clicking and attempting to run as adm ""Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the permission to access the item"". 
I know I HAVE THE PERMISSION though because the IT guy is here and checked everything to me... he confirmed that I have access to everything!
Funny enough, the 32bit is working... I can see the black icon with a white X on it.. as for the 64bit, I got an strange white folder with a green square in it.. not as it should look like."
,Barkshite,2012-05-02T03:26Z,Worked perfectly the first time! Well second. Forgot to delete the text when pasting the request code. Cheers mate!
