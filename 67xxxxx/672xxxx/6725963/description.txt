An immersive, 3D wildlife simulation game, WolfQuest challenges players to learn about wolf ecology by living the life of a wild wolf in Yellowstone National Park.


The single-player game consists of two episodes. In the first episode, Amethyst Mountain, players explore the wilderness, hunt elk, and encounter stranger wolves in a quest to find a mate. In the newly released second episode, Slough Creek, players find a den, establish a territory, raise pups and defend them from predators such as coyotes and grizzly bears. Online multiplayer games let up to five players form a pack to explore and hunt together.

This version, 2.5, released on October 5, 2011, is a major update with weather effects, changing times of day, a new phrase chat, improved lexicon chat safeguards, and more. It includes both episodes: Amethyst Mountain and Slough Creek.
