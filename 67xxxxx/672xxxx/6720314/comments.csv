,fizdude,2011-10-04T22:08Z,Thank you so much WillKane!!! Yeah it would be nice to know what site you'd use in case the pirateship is down here in the bay.  Please let us know where to find you.  I could hook you up with a Demonoid invite if you like.  We love your work!!
,WillKane,2011-10-04T22:40Z,"I am blocked from downloading or even replying in comments @demonoid. I called out an a-hole for posting jihadist crap, he editted out his crap and I was restricted. I refuse to contribute to Demonoid."
,WillKane,2011-10-04T22:41Z,"sorry, I am restricted from uploading, not downloading @ demonoid.."
,UncleBeer,2011-10-04T22:46Z,Thank you!!!

,Arsventure,2011-10-05T00:29Z,"@WillKane - Thanks again for the posts!

Are you still able to receive PMs at Demonoid?

I'd like to help out if you are considering renewing your sub in the absence of JWhitt.

[T],Nicodemus75,2011-10-05T17:37Z,Why not post to kickass torrents as well? That is what I do with the Glenn Beck podcasts (I also seed them at demonoid)
,thunderbum,2011-10-05T23:02Z,"@Nicodemus 75 - kickass is a great site, torrentzap is good in a pinch... but I sometimes have one hell of a time with 503s and other irritating time-outs. Couldn't get in day before yesterday at all.

And just wanted to send along another thank you for the Glen Beck ups! :)

I sure wish someone knew how to reach jwhitt - I tried sending a PM not to long ago and there was no replay :(

Anyone having any luck in that regard?"
