Method:
 - Record cleaned on Vpi machine.
 - Audio sampled at 96/32 float.
 - Filter to roll-off frequencies below 20 HZ (only below audible frequencies).
 Audio restoration:
 - Manual declick and deglitch - my method is to scan through the audio with ears and eyes, looking for anomalies and try to only declick when I know it's the right thing to do.
 - Denoising treatments are sometimes used near fades; centreing the bass info; centreing sampled noise patterns, gradually fading in NR if it's bad... as little NR as possible!
 - All whole sides normalized to 100% NEVER using compression or limiting.

Synopsis:
 A perfectly reasonable pressing from EMI/Island and good mastering from a decent live recording. Could it have been better? Possibly but it's such a joy anyway.
