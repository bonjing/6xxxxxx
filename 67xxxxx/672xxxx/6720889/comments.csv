,Dracoprimus,2011-10-05T05:19Z,"don't download, it has a password."
,Sklyn,2011-10-05T05:49Z,"Sure. An .AVI has a password...

Thanks, VTV!"
,LittleTinyBirds,2011-10-05T06:35Z,"Dracoprimus, you're a douche. Another awesome upload from VTV thanks guys!"
,PS3please,2011-10-05T06:39Z,Don't listen to Dracoprimus. There isn't a password.  
,chriscoon,2011-10-05T07:40Z,"Dracoprimus is the president of the Fox network, don't listen to him."
,suesg1,2011-10-05T07:43Z,"thank u vtv
no password needed"
,ianblank,2011-10-05T08:07Z,A password IS required to open this video! 
,TheTrekhippy,2011-10-05T08:30Z,I will bet it is another fabulous upload by VTV and that it Does Not have a password.
,minastirith,2011-10-05T10:38Z,Everyone should start using the 'quality' button to indicate if the file is real or not. Makes it much easier to tell if a torrent is legit than reading comments. Thanks for the upload :)
,M1ck3yM1ck3y,2011-10-05T10:59Z,"Perfect quality. Thanks a bunch VTV! :D:D:D

@minastirith - I've taken your advice and started  hitting the quality button on torrents. :)"
,AverySingh,2011-10-05T13:13Z,"It's true, it's a RAR with a password. First time I've seen this for VTV. Very annoying. I'm going to go download it from another source as I don't want to go to a website to get a password."
,AverySingh,2011-10-05T13:17Z,Why was my comment deleted? It is a RAR file with a password. The accompanying TXT file says the password is to prevent automatic leeching and that you have to go to a website to get the password. No thanks. I deleted and am now downloading a different torrent.
,Jack0ff,2011-10-05T13:52Z,the password is: THIS SHOW IS 4 FAGS
,devilishdeath,2011-10-05T14:11Z,"I think people are getting confused, earlier on there was a torrent that was very similar to this one but had a .rar file with a password attatched, that torrent wasn't uploaded by VTV and was removed, this torrent only contains a .avi file"
,standishgal,2011-10-05T15:14Z,this is NOT a rar file and it DOES NOT require a password!!!! it is a GREAT download and if you love the show don't hesitate. i just watched it and LOL did a terrific job as always.

,quain88,2011-10-07T07:41Z,"only an idiot would believe that this file has a password, how come a plain avi file can be protected of password? this isnt an archiv file like rar or zip. thistorrent is damn real.......you fool if you believe someone tlaking shit"
,wirama,2011-10-12T16:29Z,"look... this file is legit. the extension is .avi, not .rar or .zip so it doesn't have any password

I have downloaded it and it runs perfectly with great audio and video

,EastLink,2011-10-26T22:10Z,"People are complaining that this download is a RAR file with a password, let me explain what is going on. Peer Media Technologies, a faggot anti piracy company is spoofing on this torrents. That means they are seeding fucked up version of the file on this torrent. I think the best way to stop this is to make sure your hash check is on. Please add the range 173.201.0.0-173.201.255.255 to your IP filter. It's PM's website range, although I cannot confirm that it is the IPs they are using to deface this torrent. I will help to find out which ones they are."
