,amdsquad,2011-10-05T19:39Z,"After installing this, my in game sounds are fucked up. Even if I choose English there is no character voices, only some loud noises instead of it, other sounds are okey (ATM engine,guns,walk etc.). I dont know, stock version of game works perfect. I'll try to extract only 2 language files that I need, change name of it to ""english"" and replace them in game directory. I'll see if that work. BTW. reinstalling game third time now :("
,amdsquad,2011-10-05T19:53Z,"swaping language files didn't work out so I can clearly say that Polish language files might be corrupt or so, I didn't check others language. Subtitles works fine tho. Any ideas ?"
,Brenms,2011-10-05T23:37Z,I have the same problem as amdsquad. Japanese does not work as well. All other sounds are fine but speech.
,szembor,2011-10-06T01:59Z,"@ amdsquad:
Any solution to this problem?
Have you tried reinstalling the game?
I think you need to do so (me too, same problem) But I'm not sure if you will keep the save game files :( someone knows where you are saving files?"

,luxsic,2011-10-06T17:57Z,"plz , skid .. i've tried all the possible things that could affect the sound , but there's no way to make it work.. i've tried just CZECH LP , but there are a loud scratches during conversation.. , ive tried download DirectX SDK, updated sound card drivers but nothing changed, any advice plz?"
,zxkb4s29,2011-10-06T23:59Z,"""""""Selectable languages are: English, Czech, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Russian and Spanish""""""

,momolb,2011-10-09T11:34Z,where is french language... not included :S
,technospinner,2011-10-09T21:27Z,"For everyone having sounds issues after installing the language pack! Use these Steps:

1.) Change the Ini (SKIDROW.ini) to following (in the Rage InstallFolder)

[Game]

# Environment Application Id.
AppId = 9200

# Change the language only if the game uses steam_api/steamclient to decide it.
Language = "" Your Language in English""

[Settings]

# You might want change this.
PlayerName =*Your name* (without*)

2.) Use Launcher.exe (as Administrator) and change into desired language 

3.) Have Pfhun !!! ;)"
,Brenms,2011-10-10T01:20Z,"@ Technospinner  -  I tried that, and it says I don't have permission to save the file..."
,SphekS,2011-10-10T08:53Z,"this torrent is a bunch of fucked files .
if i have them all in the base folder then game crash .
i tested with english only and game start but voices are crashies
best of all the both ""czech.streamed"" have a size of 0
i reinstall the whole game to see if your ""work"" is playable [ 5 hours to unrar isos ] but i bet it will be the same .
looks like AiTB is an hacked account now and deserves no confidence "
,soulchaser74,2011-10-10T14:52Z,"I have the same problem with audio crackling/static sound. I will test today newest HD audio driver, maybe it can help."
,technospinner,2011-10-10T18:45Z,"@ Brenms
Copy the file to an other place! Delete the old one and replace it with the new one!"
,SphekS,2011-10-10T20:01Z,"soulchaser74 , don t worry about files of this torrent . update1 has them , at least the [Alex] .
for the 18Go release of AiTB , the install works without error ."
,sklflkf,2011-10-12T02:28Z,is this the full game
,sn4k3l,2011-10-13T20:01Z,"To the people having the audio scratches issue: apparently this language pack needs Rage Patch 1 to work. Search for the Skidrow upload.

The game is now flawless for me, hope this helps!"
