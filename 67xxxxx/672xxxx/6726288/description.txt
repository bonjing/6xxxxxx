Disco Dance Classics 3CD volumes - BoxSet 320k (musicfromrizzo)

This is a set with some nice filler material for an evening of
enjoyable Disco, and some great Disco songs picks too such as 
from "The Whispers" and others. Its fine quality too - all at
320k for the first time in any such offering we've put up thus far 
in this line-up and so the filesize is over 1GB for just 3CDs
Its worth having if you are serious about building up a disco
library (we've even added a couple of bonus tracks here for you
at a full 320k this time around too)


enjoy, and have fun - in great taste only! cheers!
