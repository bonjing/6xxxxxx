Manzanita is an album by American guitarist Tony Rice, released in 1979. It is credited to the Tony Rice Unit.[2]

Manzanita is considered a breakthrough album combining traditional bluegrass and folk songs with more progressive playing. It shows not only Tony Rice instrumental and vocal talent, but also his strong all-star back-up band, consisting of Sam Bush, Ricky Skaggs, Jerry Douglas, David Grisman, Darol Anger and Todd Phillips. The album was both refreshing and controversial, in that it is a true bluegrass album that doesn\'t feature a banjo.
