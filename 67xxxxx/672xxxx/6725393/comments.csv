,zeone31,2011-10-06T18:30Z,can you please keep uploading all the new blu ray criterion releases in 720p? The phantom carriage has been released but not uploaded by anyone yet. Thanks!!! 
[V],GoodFilms,2011-10-06T19:19Z,There's no point asking for things till there's a scene release.
,zeone31,2011-10-06T22:46Z,Who do you have to request in order to get a scene release of a title that's already on blu-ray? Thanks. 
[V],GoodFilms,2011-10-07T00:18Z,You don't. You just wait :)
,zeone31,2011-10-09T17:37Z,"Thanks goodfilms. I did a little searching and found out that HD-BB.org upload a lot of Criterion blu-ray films shortly after they are released on websites like fileserv.com. You need to register for free to see the urls. I don't have a fileserv, filesonic, uploadstation or wupload account but if you do would it be possible for you to download the files and upload them on tpb? That'll be awesome since they have pretty much every new Criterion blu ray release. Thanks!"
