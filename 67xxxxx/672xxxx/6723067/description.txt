Since this episode is not available anywhere on the web I UL'd it from my dvdrec. It's a TV-rip from analog TV (hence the interlacing) and I wasn't able to cut out the commercials. Please don't blame me for that, I'm just a noob; better something than nothing. We can watch this until a better version comes available.
