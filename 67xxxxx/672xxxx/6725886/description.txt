This is the original install folder directly from my Windows 98! I couldn\\\'t leave it behind because I used it to make calendars for my parents all the time!

Use this old program to create designer Pokemon-themed paper airplanes, calendars, custom cards, birthday cards, and much, much more!!!

Note :This game is OLD and may have a glitch or two on newer PC\\\'s but it works great on my Windows 7! HOWEVER!!! It must be ran from a flash drive or other portable device or else it will ask for the CD! BE SURE TO RUN FROM FLASH DRIVE! Also, when you open it, a popup window will say: \\\"The application default font (Techno) is not installed on this system\\\"... Just click Ok and the program will continue normally. Start the program with the executable \\\"PPSRed.exe\\\"

It WILL NOT WORK on anything but a flash drive or equivalent device. Even portable hard disks will not work.
