,khaledezzat,2011-10-08T10:29Z,from the sample a9 v 5
,mantronixlives4ever,2011-10-08T18:50Z,"All these early releases of PPVRIP's! I mean one after another! The idea behind it is great! But, I mean the DVDRIP's usually follow a week or two after!

So, not that im complaining but, it kinda is not worth the effort for IwannaFan becasue the Video Quality is worst than a VHSscreener!

Just wondering what source to record these is being used? I Mean they cant be that fuzzy when they are being recorded from the original source can they?

There has to be a way to record them in a better more clear resolution?

Other wise not really a big deal to just wait for the DVDRIP coming a few days later!!!!

,doug1979,2011-10-09T04:03Z,Wow. Just horrible quality. Worse than an R5. Better off to wait guys.
,ekapan,2011-10-09T17:44Z,u stupid doug1979?? R5 is like a dvd rip
,colddayinhell,2011-10-10T06:15Z,"An R5 release is basically the same as DVD Screener. This kind of release is legal DVD released in Russia to decrease the level of pirated movies in this country. Retail is rushed out by the studio, so there is little to no cleanup of the film after the telecine process. As a result, you can see some scratches, hairs or other mess on the picture, but you will hardly notice it while watching. External English audio is often used, as these are supplied with Russian sound by default. "
