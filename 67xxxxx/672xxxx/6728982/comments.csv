,D0ct0rFun,2011-10-08T07:13Z,wrong category dumbshit
,podkayne,2011-10-08T07:33Z,"I didnt know Sepultura had written a book, doesnt say what language its in though. Would think Spanish or Portuguese  is the first language for most of the band which is no good to me. Doest matter like them it will start out good wander into average tripe eventually get back to good and then fall apart as the band splits up"
,podkayne,2011-10-08T07:34Z,Put things in the correct category you retard!!
[V],totomas1,2011-10-08T13:39Z,"Why are you writing such angry words to fscontato? Do you know how easy it is to put the torrent in the wrong category by mistake? Neither you D0ct0rFun nor you podkayne seems to have uploaded a great number of torrents. I think it's good that you write that it is in the wrong category, but you ought to write it more nicely."
,reflexes,2011-10-09T12:47Z,"please dont be harsh to anyone who is going to the trouble of sharing so much with you.. if u cant say thanks then u can just chose not to write anything any move to other torrents.

fscontato bro..

please post this torrent in the audio/music sections and there they would love you since they like this band"
,fscontato,2011-10-10T20:37Z,"ok, i'm trying changing the category but it keeps saying ""EDIT - Temporarily disabled !""
i'l keep trying"
[V],totomas1,2011-10-10T20:55Z,"I think you have to delete it and upload another. Editing have been disabled for months, so don't wait for it :)"
,fscontato,2011-10-12T13:48Z,"delete button doesn't work either

sorry for the mess, i'll be more careful next time"
