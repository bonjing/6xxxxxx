Zurich, Switzerland 1997
Date: 97-06-01
Venue: Hallenstadion

Recording: AUD
Quality: 7(+)
Menu: YES
Extras: None
Comments: Single cam on the balcony stage right. Closeups are extremely shaky and it's not that much better for the rest. Picture quality is more than OK but the shaking is really tiring. Audio is a bit muffled and distant but OK. Listen for Gene's mistake in Let me go, rock 'n' roll (first chorus).
