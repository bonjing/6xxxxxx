I got ""Inferno"" by Dario Argento from you sitting on my ipod now. Great quality from what ive seen so far....No one has put out as much obscure horror in this format to date on The Bay..."
,bog23man,2011-10-06T10:08Z,"No not really going.. I've still got lots of old horror in M4v format, but I'm going High DEF (BIG M4v), a lot of my old stuff is being published here http://www.bogboy.com/forums along with lots of aXXo stuff I have collected (Respect to aXXo - Mate you are the best )

Please try and remember nothing is instant! 

Any new stuff  I will publish on TPB because they are the greatest!!! but where to put the HD m4v's ??? handheld or as Holyroses does HighDef???"
