Fight for Life
--------------
Episode 4 of 6

This episode focuses on the Jurassic period, a time when the first giant killers stalked the 
Earth and lurked in the seas; a time when the slightest advantage meant the difference 
between life and death.

In North America the iconic allosaurus, an ambush hunter with a lethal bite, dominated. 
Not even the heavily-armoured stegosaurus was safe from this killer, and incredible evidence 
reveals a glimpse of a vicious battle between these two giants.

Life in Jurassic oceans was no easier; in 2008, a fossil was dug out of a frozen island high 
in the Arctic. It was a colossal marine reptile, twice as big as most ocean predators, at 15 
metres long and weighing about 45 tonnes. This was Predator X. Its skull alone was nearly twice 
the size of a tyrannosaurus rex's, and its bite force unmatched by anything in the Jurassic seas.

The balance of power between predator and prey is a fine one, as prey continually evolve different 
ways to avoid predators. But for the most successful and enduring predators, the battle to survive 
has always been tipped in their favour.
