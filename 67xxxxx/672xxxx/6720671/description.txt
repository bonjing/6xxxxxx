Thin Lizzy-Black Rose[Deluxe Edition]2CD(2011)ICM369

Audio CD (27 Jun 2011)
 
Number of Discs: 2
 
Format: Deluxe Edition

In case you\\\'re wondering, all of those deluxe editions did not feature 
the newly remastered material, but the 1996 remaster. 

Blame Scott Gorham on that one. Disc 1 features the remastered original 
Black Rose LP, and it sounds fantastic, very nice and dynamic, and you 
can hear alot of the subtleties that were more or less buried in the 
original mix. Fine remaster. 

Disc 2 has an abundance of great material, including an unreleased track 
entitled Rock Your Love, which has been out on the net for quite some 
time, but this one is vastly superior as it\\\'s cleaned up significantly,
sessions from 1978 in Nassau including an unreleased track entitled 
Cold Black Night plus more, and a different version of Toughest Street-
In Town. 

It features different lyrics and an overall different sound.
