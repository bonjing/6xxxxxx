Dedicated to BOSSta and MiMI PUPU

I have received this dvd in a trade
it is probably made from youtube clips, but the quality of the songs ranges from fair to good
this is forcollectors or persons that were at the show
DonÂ´t say I havenÂ´t warned you

the dvd is made by Eternal Dark Rock Bootlegs
I donÂ´t have a cover for it and wonÂ´t provide samples or screenshots
