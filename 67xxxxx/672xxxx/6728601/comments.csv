,carlitosv.1.0,2011-12-09T20:28Z,"also thanks for the upload, neil1966hardy. been looking all night for a torrent that contains all the power rangers seasons. will comment back on quality. :)"
,atik0786,2011-12-24T16:05Z,thnx so much man..really wanted this
,joo108,2012-02-14T11:22Z,"Great torrent.  Everything's where it's supposed to be; quality is up and down, but it's all watchable.  Other previous PR collections have had missing or repeated episodes (such as the Island Of Illusion story arc in season 1) and almost cell phone-level quality, but this is 100% complete and a great add for the 90s kid seeking nostalgia or the new fan wanting to catch up on the pre-Samurai days.  As a longtime Ranger fan, I'm glad to finally see this up and active.  I'll be seeding indefinitely.

Also, don't worry about the lack of seeders that TPB is reporting; I'm currently reading 80 seeds and 300+ leeches.  Come and get it!  And may the power protect you!

IT'S MORPHIN TIME!"
