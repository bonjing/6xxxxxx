,SimStim,2011-10-05T12:28Z,"@kidmagic11
Yes, LT+ 2.0 will play XGD3 rips (like this one). ""0800"" just means it was ripped with the ""0800"" firmware (""LT+ 3.0"")."
,kaparahia,2011-10-05T12:30Z,kidmagic11 it will played on your xbox
,kaparahia,2011-10-05T12:31Z,"How soon PAL?
Is it today?"
,stuntz0rZ,2011-10-05T12:42Z,"kidmagic11, 0800 is the firmware used on a xbox360 dvd drive to rip games. Without this latest XGD3 0800 firmware you wouldn't see any of these new games in the usual places"
,SimStim,2011-10-05T12:52Z,"@kaparahia
When this one doesn't require seeding any longer...could be 1-2 days, or before the week-end. Cannot promise a fix date, but ""soon"" =)"

,Bozznii,2011-10-05T15:12Z,"I never knew how to burn/play games when they are on two discs. How does on do it? 

really want to play this here game, but do not know how i play it afterwards.

do i just burn both discs on separate discs, and then play disc 1 until it tells me to put in disc 2?"
,noob901,2011-10-05T15:38Z,ntsc-j?
,shediyo,2011-10-05T16:07Z,"@Bozznii
yes  , i played dead space 2 and L.A. NOiRE  and thats more than 1 disc , the idea is to play at first with the first disc , in the middle of the game it will ask you to put in disk 2,  you put it and it works without problems.
as for burning - you burn every dvd on 1 disc - just like all other disks - using imgBurn."
,SimStim,2011-10-05T16:10Z,"@Bozznii

You burn a multi-disc game as if it were separate games, i.e. just burn each disc separately. When Xbox tells you to insert another disc, you change discs, that's all.

@noob901

I don't know about Japanese version. Good hunting!

,Token88,2011-10-05T16:24Z,"@Bozznij
Isnt it obvious? You just burn both discs on separate discs, and then play disc 1 until it tells you to put in disc 2. Simple as that."
,Metalprofi666,2011-10-05T18:47Z,"OK. updated to LT 2.O
just a question regarding the burning? Is it the same as previous games (2.4x) or you need to do it differently? thnx"

,kidmagic11,2011-10-05T21:00Z,"Thanks guys... one more question, im know i flashed my xbox but is there a way to make sure its flashed by looking at the system settings? i just want to play it safe"
,SimStim,2011-10-05T21:18Z,"@kidmagic11

Funny thought there LOL If it were visible in the system settings, it would mean Microsoft would have a way to tell it's flashed. Heaven forbid, I sure wouldn't want that, even though it sounds very convenient.

No, but seriously, hook of the drive to the x360usb (or other device of your choice) and let JungleFlasher tell you the version by reading the flash, there's no other way I'm aware of."
,SimStim,2011-10-05T21:41Z,"@salazam

There is no other torrent of this. If you see one, please give link. Thanks. Third disc will be made available when first two are seeded well. Only needed for multiplayer."
,kidmagic11,2011-10-05T22:49Z,i know i sound like a dumbass but if i dont stealth patch this could i get banned even if i am just connected to live but playing campaign
,alex22408,2011-10-06T01:43Z,foward this to all. YOI GUYS SHOULD DOWNLOAD THE GAMES THAT ARE XGD3 0800 RIP onlyy if they are 0800 . and I RECOMMEND YOU GUYS WAIT TILL THE NEW ABGX IS RELEASED TO PLAY XBOX LIVE SAFELY .
,SimStim,2011-10-06T09:57Z,"@kidmagic11

Yes, you should patch this, like every other release, with abgx360 before burning. Somebody else released a stand-alone patch for this one, look there:

@83JB

If you want to play extra DLC, you need to buy it. If you want to play DLC for free, you need to have a JTAG and download the DLC separately. This message is not connected to stealth/cfw issues, if that's what you were asking."
,SimStim,2011-10-06T15:42Z,"@83JB

You already said it yourself, but let me just point it out once again (especially for others who might not have your apparent background).

This is the thing: You buy the retail box and get a code with it for DLCs. You will use up the codes during play. If you sell your copy, those codes are not valid any longer. (Also, if you rent a copy, the codes are probably invalidated already.) They did that with other titles before, e.g. Dragon Age Origins. But for all those people who buy a copy second hand, they need an option to purchase the DLCs separately, so that they can enjoy 100 % of the game's content. That's all there is to it...you can't really expect a torrent to contain valid DLC codes, right? ;-)

BUT, as far as I know, all that DLC is not strictly required to finish the game; you can play through the single-player campaign without any DLCs. That's just how I heard it, so I might be wrong. I haven't played through Rage yet, so I cannot say for sure."
,babbleM,2011-10-06T19:05Z,why r the downloads of the new xg3d games so slow? this is only running at 9kbps

,SimStim,2011-10-07T00:09Z,"@warwind74

Use ExtracXISO: http://sourceforge.net/projects/extract-xiso/?_test=beta

,SimStim,2011-10-07T00:32Z,"@Pumbiii

Thanks for the info, I checked the RAR and you are right! Header corruption and CRC fail. :( I removed the D3 torrent already. Wait for TPB to be updated..."
,warwind74,2011-10-07T02:06Z,i tryed that extracxios and i dont know but its not a program can you give me a little more info on it or can i jest use cdclone to get in to files to put on my jaytag
,SimStim,2011-10-07T09:35Z,"@warwind74

What do you mean it's not a program? There are binaries for Linux, Mac and Windows. If you know/have other programs that can handle XBOX ISOs then use them, I didn't say this was the only one! ;-)"
,HawkguyTK,2011-10-07T11:17Z,"I've tried opening the iso with Modio, gXiso, & Xbox Image Browser and I get an error which says not a vailid xbox image everytime. Does anyone know what is different about this one? "
,Zenman1976,2011-10-07T13:37Z,"Three tries not and the game will burn (slow burn) and I can start the intro but soon as the meteor comes over the moon it crashes (acts like a scratched disc, stutters then freezes up image with some square blocks like ""old arcade ROM errors""). 

Cant understand why it wont burn proper, I never had game fail on me before. Tried my back up burner and the fucker woudlnt finalise.. 

Am using ImgBurn (latest version) with an LG securdisc burner and not verbatims (""light scribe ready"" DLs dont know manf but they worked for all my other games).

Any ideas anyone, shoot my xbox and buy a decent grahpics card perhaps lol.. "

,Zenman1976,2011-10-07T13:42Z,"OH yeah and I ""truncate"" then press continue ignore the errors (as per onlint tuts) and it burns fine, I dont even get error check at the end when finalising (it optimises layerbreak as expected during burn also). 

All in all is should work find but for some reason.. Cant be a dirty laser or why would all other games work and this one game go all retarded in the exct same spot on 3 different burns (well within a second or so of the same point in the intro).. 

Maaaaan this has me fuckin rippin hair out I WANT TO PLAY SO BAD (hope its not as shit as some have been saying) >_< 

Ahh well off to double check burner with Driver SF. "

Before you rip out your hair, buy the retail LOL No, but seriously, I have no clue what's going on with your configuration. Though C4Eva himself confirmed that LG burners might have issues, but I don't know any details. Good luck!"

,wannapod,2011-10-08T16:15Z,Does anyone know why most if not all the XGD3 titles have so few people seeding and or downloading? Even before LT2.0 came out it seemed like most people were not downloading them. Now that LT2.0 is out there has not been much of an increase. Sure there are some issues to overcome burning them and updating to LT2.0 but that has never stopped anyone before. Multiple disk games have come out before as well so thats not the issue. Why do these games  seem to be different and not as many people are downloading these. For the record I owned two copies of Gears 3 from the midnight release.
,SimStim,2011-10-08T17:51Z,"LT+ 2.0 has been out for just about a week, and only for phat drives. Slims still waiting for it (announced for this weekend). I think it's just too early to tell, wait a few more weeks and more people might update to 2.0 (and then there might be more seeds for BF3=). Certainly, also, burning is not as straight-forward as it used to be, and especially ABGX is in need of an update, so there's uncertainty about safety of rips. And there have been a lot of fake rips, so the downloaders wasted bandwidth on those, too.

Again, it all makes kind of sense to me, considering all the factors involved. And again, it won't last forever. No need to worry, really. =) Imho, new ABGX will be the major push with this situation, as well as LT+ 2.0 for slims."
,wannapod,2011-10-08T18:58Z,@SimStim ah! I knew there had to be a reason for it and since I had not figured it out I thought to ask. I knew there was some talk about abgx needing to be updated but I thought I saw something where the XGD3 titles were added and could be verified. I have been too busy playing gears 3 to mess with any of the LT2.0 stuff but I intend to. I figured the burning was not much of a reason and most people have phat's as primary or secondary so I figured that would not be a reason as well. I was under the impression safety of live was not a concern because they could be verified with abgx so that I can see being the primary reason why there have not been as many downloads. Guess I have to do a little research in that area. Thanks for pointing me in the right direction. I am sure google will be my friend but if you have any specific links to this info it would be appreciated.
,SimStim,2011-10-08T20:18Z,"LOL, you're right! How could I forget about the most important reason? People are playing Gears these days and have no time to download stuff! =D
