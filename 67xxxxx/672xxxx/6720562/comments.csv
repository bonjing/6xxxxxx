,bti7a1337,2011-10-07T17:47Z,"Awesome, thanks for sharing. It was about time for a new album. But I want to tune in before I buy the CD. Nothing digital is more awesome than to hold an original piece of art in your own hands."

you guys are doing an amazing job with your uploads.. you are one of the very few uploaders who come back and reply to all the comments..
keep up the good work and thank you.."
,Usernamenamename,2011-10-20T06:26Z,"Good torrent, downloaded the whole thing in all of thirty seconds, clean.  Only problem is the 'Say You Will' track is indeed messed up.  Doesn't hurt the whole song though, it just happens for a few seconds towards the beginning and the end.

Honestly, if it makes it hard for you to listen to the song, buy the thing instead of complaining that it's a little bit goofy.  It's a pretty solid album and the artists appreciate the support."
,RisingPhoenix-Me,2011-10-20T11:29Z,"You guys having problem with ""Say you will"" track too?"
