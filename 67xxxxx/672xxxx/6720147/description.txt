Texas & West Coast blues legend Lightnin' Hopkins delivers an amazing set with his 1970 "Dirty Blues" album. There was nobody quite like Lightninâ€™ Hopkins. John Lee Hooker may have made more records but even he couldnâ€™t match the consistently high level of Hopkinsâ€™ creativity. Lightnin' and his vast repertoire represented the epitome of Texas country blues. No question. He came from a musical family and his unique guitar style was fashioned from the traditions he learned in the presence of Blind Lemon Jefferson and Texas Alexander, a distant cousin. His guitar both underscored and complemented the songs he drew from his own life and the lives of those around him.
