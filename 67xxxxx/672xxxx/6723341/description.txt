This world-famous work has been enlarged and updated without tampering with its tried and tested format. Around 500 alphabetically ordered, monographic entries consider the physicochemical properties, production methods and safe applications of over 120 explosive chemicals, while discussing 70 fuels, additives and oxidizing agents and describing the relevant test methods.

The extensive thermodynamic data has been thoroughly updated and now also provided on a CD-ROM compiled by the Fraunhofer Institute of Chemical Technology. This excerpt from the ICT Thermodynamical Database not only includes additional thermodynamic data, and references to further reading, but also features enhanced search facilities.

Other key features include a 1,500-entry combined index and glossary with terms and abbreviations in English, French and German, conversion tables and numerous literature references.

A handy reference for explosive experts and also for translators, public authorities and patent lawyers.

From reviews of previous editions:
"...This wealth of information and an index that comprises some 1500 keywords and several conversion tables make this a unique source of knowledge for anybody working with explosives."
