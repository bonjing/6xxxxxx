But those who got it first have hit and run.
Unless of course the original seeder has yet to finish or something. But if not we all are stuck at 73%
2 is great but 1 would would be nice.
I know by now Q is out but time shift is fun."

,Mesohappy,2011-10-09T00:38Z,"All right reach 99.8% along with most.
Whats up with that.
I got Q. But I like all the pre stuff as all of use seem to. But if it is this then that is that. Hummph"
,Mesohappy,2011-10-09T00:51Z,"I just tryed my 99.8%
Plays ok a little puzitez once and a while."
,OrderXsoL,2011-10-09T09:16Z,I managed to watch mine entirely and it only downloaded 99.7. Even got to see the Vettel crash which is pretty much all I wanted to see. :P
