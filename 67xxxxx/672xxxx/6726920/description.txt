Born into a show business family, Nelsen was already a professional musician at 15. A true "Blues Journeyman" Nelsen earned his stripes playing tough, gritty joints and taverns of the East Coast Blues Circuit. He shared the stage with such greats as Muddy Waters, James Cotton, Matt "Guitar" Murphy and Johnny Winter. Inspired by these legends, Nelsen developed a melodic driving style on both guitar and harmonics. A world class blues vocalist, Nelsen's voice is truly an expressive instrument. Striking the right balance of torment, and tenderness so essential to this style.

His new album is a send up to the Louisiana style of Blues that has influenced Nelsen throughout his career. "Take Me Back" is a true showcase of Nelsen's vocal ability as well as showing off his songwriting skills, and his proficiency on guitar, harp and piano. His latest album is definitely his best!
