[/b][/color] A GIFTED MAN is a drama about a brilliant, charismatic surgeon whose life changes forever when his deceased ex-wife begins teaching him Michael Holt is an exceptional doctor who lives a materialistic life of luxury thanks to his work-obsessed career and powerful and wealthy patients; however, Michael's ordered world is rocked when his ex-wife, Anna, an idealistic free-clinic doctor and the love of his life, mysteriously appears to him.
Michael's off-beat sister, Christina, a single mom to her teenaged son, Milo, is thrilled that Anna's back in her brother's life, even as an "illusion," because Michael was always a better person with her.
Curious about Michael's sudden change in behavior is his efficient assistant, Rita.
When Anna asks Michael to go to her clinic to help keep it running, he meets Autumn, a volunteer carrying on Anna's work with the underprivileged.
Touched by those in need and accepting of Anna's compassionate "presence," Michael's attitude toward serving the rich and poor is turned upside down, and he begins to see that there's room in his life for everyone.
