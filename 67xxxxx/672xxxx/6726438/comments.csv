,roiskopp,2011-10-21T18:03Z,Hope this is the real deal. I anticipate this more than anything else... more than the new seasons of Venture Bros. and SouthPark combined.

Episode 73s audio appears to be louder than the rest of the episodes.

Video is flawless. Audio is best on episode 73 and good otherwise."
