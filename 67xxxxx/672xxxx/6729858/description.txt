
Developing Students' Multiple Intelligences Â© Kristen Nicholson-Nelson, Scholastic Teaching Resources (K to 8)

I wanted to provide students with an environment that would help them see themselves as a wonderful amalgamation of intelligencesâ€”not one that would restrict their learning by labeling and separating their intelligences into inflexible categories.
I want this book to help guide other teachers through the complicated process of teaching with multiple intelligences. I started out to write a logical, sequential set of guidelines and ideas that would provide a detailed road map for those just starting their journey. Yet as I thought and wrote, I realized that there is no one road map. Your journey will be different from mine. It will be a unique experience based on your own beliefs and philosophies. I can only write about what has worked for me. Take what you like and leave the rest.
