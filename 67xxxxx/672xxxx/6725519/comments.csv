then why not upolad something non bullshit, accurate and detailing the ""christ"" myth instead?
Killawife is correct ""Christians don't believe that a movie questioning their whole belief system has any truth in it"". 
in this day and age with the world being the way it is, who are we to believe and trust any government or religious authority. live, love, laugh and enjoy your brief appearance on this planet.
