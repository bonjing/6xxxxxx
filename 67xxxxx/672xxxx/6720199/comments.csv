,sistromo,2011-10-05T01:01Z,"What does this contain, at 45GB, that man of the other BluRay Star Wars torrents here, at less (sometimes much less) than 10GB, don't? Surely the extra soundtracks and subtitles can't account for over 30GB, can they?"
,jenchai,2011-10-05T05:17Z,"@sistromo. This is the whole Blu-Ray. Ever heard of Blu-Ray before in your life ? 

""""Think I Not """""
,sistromo,2011-10-05T15:08Z,"@jenchai: The question is still valid: What do you get in those additional 30GB? Is it extra material? If so, what? Is it the result of no compression? None of the above?"
,RPO1973,2011-10-05T17:11Z,"You should get the disk as its makers intended, being sure that no one ""messed"" with it (even though there รยกre those that can do a good rip).
I'll never use all the audio tracks and/or subs, but I don't care. I have plenty of storage space.

My reason for uploading this is the same as why I prefer downloading complete BRs: is you have really nice equipment, you also want the best quality movies.
If you want the best, download this. If you have other priorities, DL a smaller file. 
Be glad you have the choice....."
,sistromo,2011-10-06T21:48Z,"@RPO1973: Your upload is much appreciated, but my question still stands: What do those 10GB rips don't have that yours does? I know about the extra soundtracks and subtitles but, as I said, they can't account for the extra 35GB. What does? Extra material other than the movie itself? Image quality? Sound quality? Anybody know?"
,Warshine,2011-10-06T23:50Z,RPO1973 You've The Clone Wars Season 2? you can uploaded?
,RPO1973,2011-10-07T16:16Z,"Sorry....only the ""real"" movies."
,IIIIIIIII,2011-10-25T10:51Z,@RPO1973: Can you seed a bit please?
,IIIIIIIII,2011-10-25T23:39Z,"Thanks to our Norwegian, Finnish, Swedish and Dutch seeders. Keep up the good work - Proseed with it :-)"
,IIIIIIIII,2011-10-27T20:12Z,Seeeeed!
,RPO1973,2011-10-30T13:07Z,Re-seeding
,Gulftown,2011-11-05T16:26Z,@RPO1973: What about the extras? Are you going to release it soon?
,RPO1973,2011-11-06T15:37Z,"Okay, I hadn't realised there was interest for the disks with extras (seeing they were already uploaded, but with different languages).
I'll get to it. 
Expect them beginning of next week.
Oh and, thanx for asking."
