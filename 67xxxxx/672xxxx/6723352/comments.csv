,DirtyDub,2011-10-11T00:50Z,"Seed please, I'm stuck at 91.8%"
,spencer9997,2011-10-11T04:21Z,"Sorry DirtyDub, but since this torrent is still newish and I'm the only real seeder, downloading rates are very slow. I only give out about 30 kb/s at max. Please be patient."
,DirtyDub,2011-10-12T21:27Z,"it's all good, the torrent downloaded completely and it is an excellent English dub, haven't checked the German, because I don't understand that language. Lol. But it's good, seeding as well, kinda sucks though, now that there are 9 seeders, AFTER I finish downloading it. Can't wait for more uploads you come out with."
