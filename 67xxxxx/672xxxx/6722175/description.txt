 Âº  Description  Âº


WinRAR is an archiving utility that completely supports RAR and ZIP archives and is able 
to unpack CAB, ARJ, LZH, TAR, GZ, ACE, UUE, BZ2, JAR, ISO, 7Z, Z archives. It 
consistently makes smaller archives than the competition, saving disk space and 
transmission costs.

WinRAR offers a graphic interactive interface utilizing mouse and menus as well as the 
command line interface. WinRAR is easier to use than many other archivers with the
inclusion of a special "Wizard" mode which allows instant access to the basic 
archiving functions through a simple question and answer procedure.

WinRAR offers you the benefit of industry strength archive encryption using AES 
(Advanced Encryption Standard) with a key of 128 bits. It supports files and archives 
up to 8,589 billion gigabytes in size. It also offers the ability to create 
selfextracting and multivolume archives. With recovery record and recovery volumes, 
you can reconstruct even physically damaged archives.

  Âº   log.        Âº

* WinRAR can create ZIP archives of practically any size.
- 2 GB archive size and 65535 file number ZIP limitations of previous WinRAR versions 
are not valid anymore.
* WinRAR can create multivolume ZIP archives, which are also known as split ZIP files.
- ZIP volumes have names like 'volname.zip', 'volname.z01', 'volname.z02'.
- Use a volume with ".zip" file extension in all archive processing operations 
like starting extraction or opening an archive.
- Unlike RAR volumes, ZIP volumes cannot be self-extracting.
- WinRAR needs to have access to all ZIP volumes of multivolume file set at the 
same time, when creating or unpacking them. So it is impossible to create or unpack 
ZIP volumes on removable disks, one volume per disk. You need to create them all in 
the same folder.
* Added the high precision file time support in ZIP archives.
- WinRAR can store and extract modification, creation and last access file time in
ZIP archives with 100 nanosecond precision.
- You need to set "High precision modification time" option in "Time" part of 
archiving dialog to store all 3 times in archive.
- Set appropriate "File time" options in "Advanced" part of extraction dialog to 
choose times to extract.
* Added support for Unicode names stored in ZIP extra field data. 
- Different ZIP tools store Unicode names either in file header or in ZIP extra 
field and now WinRAR can correctly process both types of Unicode names.
* "Synchronize archive contents" option and -as command line switch are supported 
in ZIP format.
