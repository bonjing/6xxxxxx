,van0014,2011-10-08T12:41Z,i better watch the trailer before saying anything about it though
,cockn1pples,2011-10-09T19:48Z,"The production of movies these days has went to shit. sometime quite literally.

This isn't so much 'scary' as it is gross... kinda like A Serbian Film..  they aren't trying to scare you, they are trying to DESENSITIZE you. "
,Makenshi84,2011-10-10T18:10Z,"How long till someone UL a torrent for the full movie????? I want to see this film so bad!!!!

,davthepunk,2011-10-13T08:59Z,"Is anyone working on getting a VOD rip of this up? Started showing yesterday, AFAIK."
,i_steal_media_hohoho,2011-10-22T19:20Z,"Is it out in the USA yet? Please can some one from America UL the torrent, pleeeeze... "
,McFearless,2011-10-24T11:11Z,It is out in the States but only select theatres and is exclusivley played after midnight.
,davthepunk,2011-10-25T02:45Z,"It's been shown on PPV in the USA. Not really sure why no-one's ripped it yet (never usually takes this long, does it?)."
,i_steal_media_hohoho,2011-10-25T04:26Z,"Or taken a camera into the cinema... I never bother with cams usually... But would for this, driving me mad hearing all this hype and not being able to see for myself..."
,BaronVonWatermelon,2011-10-26T18:12Z,Why in the fuck is this god-damn movie STILL not uploaded here...? It came out 2 fucking weeks ago for Christ's sakes!
,i_steal_media_hohoho,2011-10-26T22:17Z,"@BaronVonWatermelon

It's really pissing me off, I'm in the UK, and would happily wait until it comes out here in Nov, only they have cut it for here! And I really wanna see the uncut. I have checked US site xfinity and they have it and although it won't let me access from here, I'm sure netflix have it too. Are you in the US? Any chance you could get hold of it via PPV? I think a lot of ppl would be seriously grateful if you could! Put it in windows movie maker first and add a title at the beginning crediting your pirate bay ID, so everyone knows who the thank!"
,OGradz,2011-10-27T18:25Z,I highly doubt it will make me mentally disturbed. I'm just going to download the crack when the DVD comes out in the US.

Mate, you need to calm the fuck down. Your obsessiveness with this movie is concerning."
