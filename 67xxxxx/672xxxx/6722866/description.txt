36 "A Family Holiday"   September 30, 2011 693-036 

A cure for incurables is offered by Dr. Branden Moses, and Dr. Holiday shows complete interest, although Six, Rex, and the White Knight grow suspicious. While trying to cure her younger sister, Beverly, Holiday ends up losing her to Moses, who takes her to be overpowered and sold. Six and Rex arrive from Moses labs, where they looked for clues, save Holiday, and explain that Moses was overpowering Nanites to make Evo's supercharged. The trio head to Moses' arctic labs to save Beverly. Moses escapes and Six almost loses his life to save both Holiday (whose name is revealed to be Rebecca), and Beverly. In the end, they cured Beverly and Rex go to the mall together, and Holiday and Six go on a date for the first time (off screen).
