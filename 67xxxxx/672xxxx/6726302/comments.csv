,PiraatBae,2011-12-27T10:51Z,"Thank you for the quality download, much appreciated.

Just for those that aren't aware, this movie was made in Argentina and the R1 release (this and most of the other torrents) is English DUBBED.  The dubbing is somewhat lackluster, especially for the two main characters.  This makes it a bit disappointing to watch."
