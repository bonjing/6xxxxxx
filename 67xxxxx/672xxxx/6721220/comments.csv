I just got done installing the upgraded... worked flawlessly and only took about 10 minutes. You apps will all re-appear (be sure to back-up before installing, do this by clicking ""Sync"" in iTunes)

To start the installation of iOS 5, in iTunes do the following:
1. SHIFT-click (ALT-click in Mac OS X) ""Restore""
2. Find and select the .IPSW file you downloaded in this torrent.
3. Install and follow the steps on screen.

It's easy as pie... if you can download Torrent files, you can install iOS 5."
,leefx,2011-10-05T09:14Z,"ALSO: 

You MUST have iTunes 10.5! If anyone needs a copy, post a comment here and I will upload it and seed it as well (Windows 32 & 64-bit only, as the Mac OS X version is already on TPB)!"
