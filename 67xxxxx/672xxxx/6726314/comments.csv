,SunKaz,2011-10-09T06:32Z,Well that sure was a fucked up movie.
,micktalbot,2011-10-10T18:56Z,I can't convert this with mk2vob to play on my PS3. anybody know why? Every other movie I convert works without a problem.
,av-0-0,2011-10-11T17:38Z,"@micktalbot: 
dont convert - use any media server to stream movie from your pc to ps3."
,micktalbot,2011-10-11T18:32Z,I'm using a wireless connection and if I stream it'll lag
,dauts,2011-10-11T19:47Z,TURN IT INTO ISO  OR DVD VOB FILES WITH MENU AND EVERYTHING AND EMAIL ME AT LOSDESCARADOS@YAHOO.COM  THANK YOU
,ptv83,2011-10-13T06:22Z,"micktalbot , if you use 802.11a or n on 5MHz you'll get less lag than if you use 802.11b or g on 2.4Mhz

i have an old style xbox with the old a/b/g adapter , i got a dual band dlink from office depot for $99 nad since i switched from 2.4 802.11g to 5MHz 802.11a i get no stutters or buffering glitches anymore.

i myself had no clue until i read the caption during the xbox windows media center setup that recommended a over b/g for video streaming.  gotta give microsoft props on that one, so much better now!!!"
,micktalbot,2011-10-13T22:57Z,"I've got a 1Gigabit N-router, not sure about all the specs and settings, but it didn't matter, since I couldn't stream Red State anyway, I tried and it didn't start since the file is corrupted, which is also why it can't be converted by mk2vob."
