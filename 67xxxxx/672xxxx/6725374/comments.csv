,shaqbrack,2011-10-07T03:28Z,i click install.bt and it just gives a command prompt and when i open minecraft it ask me for an account
,AzDeRi,2011-10-07T19:16Z,"@shaqbrack

Install.bat makes command prompth command to copy files to application data automatically, so it's just normal. And leave login blank and click play offline."
,shaqbrack,2011-10-08T04:19Z,Sorry  i still cant get it to work cna you send step by step instructions to my email shaqbrack@live.com really would appreciate it

,RagdollNL,2011-10-08T16:51Z,"Same problem as shaqbrack. Only after I leave the fields blank, I cannot click the Play Offline button."
,RagdollNL,2011-10-08T16:53Z,"It says, Play online once to enable offline."
,RagdollNL,2011-10-08T17:59Z,"So now I got it working, I reinstalled. Now, however, the map is empty except Instructions.txt after the install."
,shaqbrack,2011-10-08T23:04Z,ahh i got it i had to move the entire .minecraft folder to the desktop the click install. bat :)
,samanika,2011-10-09T04:13Z,"Thanks for torrent.

I got it running easy enough but the first multiplayer map i made had a massive hole in it, the kind you saw in older versions when it would bug out and not load a part of the map... except it was the server not generating map there. I actually fell into it and fell forever because there was no bedrock. Lighting is also bugged

Other than that it works"
,Hausser,2011-10-09T14:34Z,"Do villages and wolfes work in smp ?
I flew around in creative mode on my server for quite a long time, found at least 4 pinewood and 2 taiga biomes, but not a single wolf in and no village between them.
(Map/server started with 1.8.1, two of the taiga biomes where ""created"" in 1.9 pre3)

I also started a new SP creative map, found a pack of wolfes after 2 minutes of flying."
,AzDeRi,2011-10-09T15:58Z,"@shaqbrack

1. Extract files on your desktop
2. Run install.bat
3. Run minecraft from your desktop"
,AzDeRi,2011-10-09T15:59Z,"@Hausser

Villages are working, so are wolves. If the hole in your map is so called ""World Hole"" you can try relogging to make it work. If it wont, it's a bug in generator."
,kukpulcs,2011-10-09T16:48Z,I don't know how to play offline without getting an account PLEASE HELP
,Disznaj,2011-10-09T17:47Z,Pls any server in survivor mode!
,AzDeRi,2011-10-09T22:31Z,"@kukpulcs

Just start game, leave login blank, play offline"
,AzDeRi,2011-10-10T00:59Z,"If you still cannot install this, check out these videos:



Also includes setting up your own server and joining it."

,pyres736,2011-10-10T04:18Z,ya how do i get it so that i can go online with the torrent is it not posable to go in to other servers?
,AzDeRi,2011-10-10T08:34Z,"@pyres736 

As told before, you can join any server that has online-mode set to false."
,Disznaj,2011-10-10T17:07Z,"IcyhaIe:
""im pretty much always hosting""

but cant connect...."
,PandaaMayaa,2011-10-11T00:07Z,It says I have to play online once to enable offline mode... Help please? ^^;
,AzDeRi,2011-10-11T15:46Z,"@PandaaMayaa

Most likely launching the game from wrong place.. Use one on your desktop."
,Funkadub,2011-10-11T21:52Z,Great up AzDeRi....once again.  The only thing we need now is for modloader to update so the mods will start to show up.
,AzDeRi,2011-10-12T16:45Z,"@Funkadub

Will see if possible. If so, will be with next release."
,AzDeRi,2011-10-12T21:09Z,"@Funkadub

Seems like modloader and neither the mods are supported by this update yet. I'm pretty sure that modders are waiting for a stable update instead of prerelases."
,bailey1998,2011-10-15T11:25Z,I go onto single player and it crashes?
