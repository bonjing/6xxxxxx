,691175002,2012-01-11T01:07Z,It will not run alone (requires a cd key or something) but if you apply the english patch there are no problems.

,cheez9006,2012-04-11T00:07Z,Using alcohol 120% but it has some problem when I try to install it and I cant read what it says. Could someone give us instructions or something if you have the time?
,Cineran,2012-04-20T05:48Z,"I'm having pretty much the same problems, i can get it to start installing after it finishes torrenting but  halfway through the install a message pops up that i can't understand and when i click ok it closes the installer and deletes everything it attempted to install, its not asking for the second disc cause i tried doing that and it still doesn't work."
,darkwarlord,2012-04-23T10:10Z,"installed, works fine. 

cheez9006 / other guy.
install using hfAppLocale, or the M$ AppL.
or go pro and switch your OS to JP Uni.

Installs fine, only issue is..one route TL."
