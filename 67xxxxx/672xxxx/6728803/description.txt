This book was written to give teachers a variety of activities to help students learn
about the ancient civilizations of China, India, Africa, and Mesopotamia. Many of the
hands-on activities encourage students to imagine what it would be like to live in the past. This resource presents information about the geography, architecture, arts,
sciences, governments, and religions of these ancient civilizations in an interesting format to make learning exciting and productive. The book is divided into four sections, one for each civilization. Each section begins with a map and time line, which you may choose to reproduce for students. You may also choose to create transparencies to show to students on an overhead projector. Each section also includes background information throughout. This background information is for your use, although some activities require that you share the background information with students. It is best to work through the activities within each section consecutively, because many of the topics build upon information introduced earlier in the unit. As you introduce each civilization to students, begin by using the map and references that accompany each new section. This will help students to understand the time frame and location of each civilization.
