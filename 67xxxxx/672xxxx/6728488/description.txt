The definitive racing game of 2011, Forza Motorsport 4 will bring together genre-defining, controller-based racing, the power and freedom of Kinect, and content from leading brands like "Top Gear" to create an automotive experience unlike anything before it.

The highest-rated racing franchise of this generation returns. Unrivaled in its innovation and quality, Forza Motorsport 4 pushes the racing genre forward, delivering the most stunning graphics ever seen on the Xbox 360 platform, radical experiences only possible with Kinect, groundbreaking social features through Xbox LIVE, and a landslide of new content, cars and new ways to play.

Forza Motorsport 4 will be the most expansive and vividly realistic automotive experience across any console, bringing you closer to the edge than you've ever been before. Through the power of Kinect, players will be able to step through the TV screen and jump into the driver's seat while the engaging controller-based experience will let you take on the bone-jarring physics, unparalleled levels of customisation, and rosters of dream cars and tracks.
