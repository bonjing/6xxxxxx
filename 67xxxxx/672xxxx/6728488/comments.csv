,collinsrv,2011-10-08T03:46Z,"@steve30x if you have the latest dashboard installed in your 360 then the only thing you need to do is to get the disc drive flashed with LT+ 2.0 which enables your xbox to read all kinds of game backups, including the xgd3 ones like forza 4. Once you flash it, all you need to do is download this game and burn it to a dual layer blank dvd with imgburn!!!"

,redfox88,2011-10-08T18:47Z,"@ amesy

Why do asshats like yourself bitch that they don't receive a PAL version first when the game is made and developed by a US based company?

@ Everybody Else

As of now, this rip appears to be having some issues. Id wait for a proper. I can't personally confirm it's not working but enough people are saying its broken. Also, c4eva, the firmware modder, has come out and said the firmware is fine and working on Forza 4 so that leads me to believe the disc was improperly ripped. Just hold off a few days while this all get sorted out and play one of the many other XGD3 games that just came out like Rage, Dark Souls, etc. Patience gentlemen."

,R3dnaxel4,2011-10-13T22:22Z,"For those who don't know. The New XGD3 disks are 8.7 GB Slightly larger than most burnable dual layer media out there. However the xbox modding community is on it. Apparently to play XGD3 games  one has to have LT2.0, the latest dashboard, VERBATIM DVD R DLs,  and ya have to buy a certain (currently undisclosed) DVD burner. The next release of jungle flasher will be able to flash the DVD burner with custom firmware, which will allow it to write ALL of the XGD3 Data to the disk. instead of 90% of it. Which would explain Dirty disk errors."
