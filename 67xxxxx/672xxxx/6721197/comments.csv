,jbocc,2011-10-06T21:08Z,this is only 128 kbps right? (just wondering)
,Willimaco09,2011-10-07T22:10Z,"Correct, If i had any better i'd post it. Didn't want to re-encode to trick anyone either."
,zerohawk,2011-10-11T03:33Z,im sure it is 128 kbps because their is a 320 kbps version with only the first seventracks and its 75 mib
