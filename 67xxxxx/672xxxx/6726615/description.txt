::Plot::
In "the not-too-distant future", liberal eugenics is common and DNA plays the primary role in determining social class. Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke) is conceived and born without the aid of this technology. He has a high probability of developing mental disorders, is myopic, has a heart defect, and his projected life expectancy is only 30.2 years. His parents initially placed their faith in natural birth and now regret it; Vincent's younger brother, Anton, is conceived with the aid of genetic selection. Anton surpasses his older brother in many aspects including a game that they call "chicken" â€” both swim out to sea, and the first to give up and swim back to shore is the loser. Anton always wins due to his superior physical stamina. Vincent dreams of a career in space, but is constantly reminded of his genetic inferiority. Vincent challenges Anton with a game of chicken when they are both older. This time, Vincent swims farther out than his brother, while Anton runs into trouble and begins to drown. Vincent saves him, then leaves home shortly thereafter.
