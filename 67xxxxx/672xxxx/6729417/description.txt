Perfect - 1999 - Sickly Men of Thirty or So



Englishman Jamie Clarke first came to prominence in the 80â€™s rock group â€œInnocence Lostâ€, and had some minor success with that band. After â€œInnocence Lostâ€ split Jamie was asked to play 5 live shows with the Pogues filling in for the sick Phil Chevron, 5 gigs turned to 5 years. Jamie was also involved in the songwriting (â€œThe Sun And The Moonâ€) for the last Pogues album â€œPogue Mahoneâ€. After the Pogues, Jamie moved to Germany and hooked up with Padja Zaric, the highly regarded Bosnian high-speed accordion player and formed â€œPerfectâ€.

â€œSickly men of thirty or soâ€¦â€ is the third full length from the band (and the first with drummer Andreas Schabinger) and what a widely diverse album it is, Punk, Folk, Country, Garage and classic British Pop influences from the 60â€™s, 70â€™s and 80â€™s. For the most part Jamie seems to have moved back to his 80â€™s roots. The music is acoustic based (but not always) Beatles influenced British pop mixed with a heavy doses of Padjaâ€™s accordion that gives â€œPerfectâ€ itâ€™s very distinctive identity.

â€œAdorableâ€ is the best song, classic British Pop, a hit single if there was any justice (or taste) left in the world. Pogues fan should check out the cover of â€œI Fought the Lawâ€ the accordion makes it much more Joe Strummer with the Pogues then the Clash. â€œSheer Perfectionâ€, â€œOh Manâ€, â€œMoving Upâ€ and especially â€œHeart Shaped Sunglassesâ€ (co written with Spider Stacy and James McNally) are all highlights.
