PLOT:

My Neighborâ€™s Wife is about two couples who are best friends and the emotional ups and downs that people go through when faced with marital infidelity. In a nutshell, conflict ensues when Carla Abellana decides to break up with her husband Jake Cuenca because of Jakeâ€™s one night stand mistake with Lovi Poe, a mistake that also rips apart Cieloâ€™s (Lovi) marriage with Dennis Trillo. The movie tackles what happens when couples break upâ€” what happens to their friendship, what happens to their perspective on relationships, and how it changes the way they view their own.
