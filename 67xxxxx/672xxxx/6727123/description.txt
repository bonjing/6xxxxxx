A dry island somewhere in the vastness of the ocean has been completely deserted except for the young panda Nanda. After years without rain, all animals have left the idyllic island one by one. Meanwhile, the whole flora has dried up.


But Nanda refuses to give up and has made it his objective to save the island with his shamanâ€™s knowledge and transform it back into the paradise it used to be. The young pandaâ€™s specialty â€“ alas, it is also the only ritual he has mastered yet â€“ is his rain dance. With that dance he wants to supply the island with sufficient water.

Unfortunately, the young shamanâ€™s abilities are still lacking in many ways, so he is only able to summon a rather small cloud so far. This can be used for selective watering only. Even worse, this cloud often appears where the water is not needed.
