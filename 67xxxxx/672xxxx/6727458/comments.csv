,Abuf88,2011-10-07T19:07Z,"Nevermind, it just took a long time to open. Like 5 mins at least. Weird... Great game though, everything  about the game itself is flawless. Thank you Sephiroth93!"
,Sephiroth93,2011-10-07T19:14Z,"Well, THETA made the keygen, but my suggestion to other people:

Run as Admin
Wait a moment"
,Lakis_TXC,2011-12-06T22:35Z,"keygen doesn't work at all for me. Ran it as admin, waited for hours..."
,Sephiroth93,2011-12-15T20:56Z,Hmmm... What OS do you use?
,Kv99,2012-01-03T23:45Z,"Hey Sephiroth, game installs fine and everything, but I'm having issues getting the keygen to run. Do you think you could post some serial keys here? 
Thanks for the torrent!"

Funny, as soon as you close your Browser, it starts work.. Try that.. or close something else, I am not sure why it does that... THETA either failed or keygen has corrupted during seeding or something.

Try that. ^

I bet THETA failed with their keygen."
,Kv99,2012-01-05T00:58Z,"Thanks, that worked.
Kinda odd really, but so long as it works..."
,Creeper12,2012-01-16T09:32Z,"Warning, the keygen is a trojan!  It does not show positive on the antivirus, but I ran it in a virtual machine and monitored the packets.  It does indeed try to phone home, but not sure to what extent.  Anyways, I created a bunch of keys so you don't need to run it anyways:
