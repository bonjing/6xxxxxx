Pediatric Practice: Endocrinology is an outstanding clinical analysis and decision-making tool for those treating endocrine problems in children. Featuring an innovative problem-oriented approach, this well-illustrated, full-color guide skillfully integrates pathophysiology with clinical management. Numerous figures illustrate the principles of normal and abnormal physiology and treatment rationale and effects.

No other resource offers this concise yet comprehensive review of current knowledge, links these concepts with analysis of clinical situations, and provides such practical recommendations for rational and efficient evaluation and treatment of children with endocrine disorders.

Pediatric Practice: Endocrinology opens with an introductory chapter that clarifies the link between genetics, cell biology, and physiology with pathophysiology to provide a clear overview of the endocrine system. Subsequent chapters cover disorders of growth, water metabolism, thyroid and adrenal glands, bone and mineral metabolism, puberty, sex development, obesity, diabetes, and hypoglycemia. Throughout the book emphasis is placed on care of the patient, with the goal of optimizing care and improving the medical management and outcomes for these patients. More than 300 full-color images, figures, and tables enhance the presentation.
