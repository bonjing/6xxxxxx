,ethrv78,2011-10-05T02:38Z,since the link does not tell you this is an .epub if you can use it enjoy if not try elsewhere
,supersnurre2000,2011-10-05T02:51Z,"ah yeah, sorry about that, it just slipped my mind converting it into multiple formats and uploading them.
As he said it is a epub file, but they are easy enough to read with freeware readers. calibre, adobe digital editions etc.."

Also, its .EPub so it doesnt work on a lot of E Readers. But you can download a free reader from Adobe here. --> http://www.adobe.com/products/digitaleditions/#fp (It supports both Pdfs and EPubs.)

Thanks!!!! "
