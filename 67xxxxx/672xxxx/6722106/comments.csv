,riverfront12,2011-10-05T19:10Z,Downloaded the uTorrent 3.0. It's awesome for this torrent. Downloads well.
,jareehDr0,2011-10-05T19:54Z,@extremezone Why you didn't upload RELOADED??
,tix666,2011-10-05T20:21Z,"so we can't play online, huh?"
,simolino,2011-10-05T20:24Z,"I'm going with the RELOADED version, cause I don't know who the fuck 3DM is. Seriously if any one commands true veteran respect around here it's RELOADED. Listen I know 3DM is new to the scene, but they've got to gain our trust first...you guys are up against some of the toughest competition mainly from SKIDROW and RELOADED, but usually not limited to RAZOR1911 and FLT. DARKSIDE does good shit occasionally, and ALI213/syonous&tomek just step in to save everyone's ass when a tough game comes up."

,sora1203,2011-10-07T13:09Z,"3DM is an uploader as well as Reloaded. I do not download a lot of PC games but from what I often see, Reloaded and SKIDROW are among the most popular guys who upload PC games. Hope this helps."

,zlatantz,2011-10-13T19:02Z,"Thx. :D 
Great Upload, I didn't even have to disable my internet. Solution was:
In the beginning where you have to create your NBA 2K12 account I just entered year above 1998 (younger than 13). And now I play it without disabling internet and creating account. So, just did it once, and now it works good."

,roundpuff,2011-10-16T17:02Z,"i noticed on my player and creating a legend mode, when you're on the bench you should watch/let it run without simulating for the 1st quarter, after that you can simulate to your next appearance. i tried it since if i dont it just quits after the 3rd quarter."

,CuttURface,2011-10-22T18:01Z,"I've tried Both the Reloaded and 3DM crack.
For me the game freezes during the 3rd quarter when playing the second game of the season.

,CuttURface,2011-10-22T19:20Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6721235/NBA_2K12_CRACK_FIX_by_Sonuyos__amp_amp__TOMEK1166

Hey everyone I was able  to find a crack that fixes the freeze bug.
I can play the entire match without freezing.
For now this seems to be the best solution to the freeze issue that I know of. 

It's to early to tell if it's 100% fixed. 
I'm planning to play the entire season and if I encounter any other bugs, I'll post it.

All you do is dl the crack, copy and replace to your installation nba2k12 folder.

The crack is all you need if you have the game already downloaded.

 It shouldn't matter if you have the reloaded or 3dm as long as you use the crack above you should be good.

Best of luck guys."
