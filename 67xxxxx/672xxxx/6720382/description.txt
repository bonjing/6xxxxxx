Ane Brun was moving out of the traditional singer-songwriter suit as early as the last album, Changing of the Seasons, and Tobias Froberg completes that trip, and It All Starts With One allows for his own sound to be taken to a new level. He hired two drummers, Per Eklund (Lykke Li, Miike Snow) and Ola Hultgren (Loney Dear, thus Owls) to play together on most of the albumâ€™s songs. Martin Hederos (Soundtrack Of Our Lives, Tonbruket) was behind the organs. A large part of what takes place in the musical arrangements is due to the interaction between the evocative rhythm section and Hederosâ€™ soaring piano. Froberg only wanted bass on a single song, creating space and movement for Aneâ€™s exceptional voice, which was flanked by, among others, the sisters from First Aid Kid (Do You Remember) and JosÃ© GonzÃ¡lez (Worship).Some of the songs were completed by January 2011, but most have been written in Aneâ€™s writing studio in Stockholm in the January / February period of 2011. It was at this time that the Arab revolution started and Ane spoke of how affected she was by the courage and energy that people showed the world.It All Starts With One explored the dynamics involved in trying to find balance between embracing the independent without feeling lonely, and to keep oneself and ones core intact, whilst wanting to help someone in need. The album also includes a encouraged dose of passionate love, a celebration of language, a carnival of words and an attempt at reconciliation
