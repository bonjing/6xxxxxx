,DJAbi7,2011-10-07T19:13Z,"Is this really a BRrip? Because it's a 720p...

Why isn't there a DVD rip first? Or at least a R5?

Weard, but I let it know...

,reythekid,2011-10-07T22:29Z,"Well look I'm downloading... But I think the person meant if it was a real blueray rip guys :\ and rips were posted and said to be ""real"" but then they turned out not to be... Will post back on the A/V later though :\ but it's taking long as heck to download dunno why"
,chrismichaeld1,2011-10-07T22:44Z,"@rza3rdwrld

I do agree with your comment but as of late some skulled uploaders have been loading cam's in this section and labeling them High Res. (You know who you are). So even I speculate now when it comes to the quality. "

,bigghands,2011-10-09T02:48Z,not quite sure why people are complaining about a movie Rotten Tomatoes gives a 29/100.  It didn't get that low of a rating by accident.
,JGNROMERO,2011-10-09T05:13Z,nest time dont hard subs pls to avoid down rate
,shadowgp7,2011-10-09T12:48Z,"The uploader gives you a great release from a movie that just came out to the theaters...and you fuckers have a problem with the hard subs???Do you think that HE put them?!He just find this copy and he shared it with you.Download it if you want,watch it and say thanx."
,zingru,2011-10-09T14:00Z,"i used to give movies to freinds and colleagues, but stopped doing so because every time i gave 20 movies maybe 1 was not up to standard or their player wouldnt play it.
so i had to hear complaints all the time, nobody ever said thx for the 19 other.
so fuuuuuck all u complaining assholes
i am surprised anyone wants to upload anything at all. its free if you want the right to complain go to blockbuster"
,JOR23,2011-10-09T19:47Z,to all those who complaint about the subtitles...im learning korean...lets all be smarter...
,ninline,2011-10-09T19:48Z,You're right.  The cheap bastards just moan and whine all the time about shit they don't pay for.  They should be kissing people like zingooo's ass instead of biting it.
,Gr8tful,2011-10-09T20:06Z,"If you are going to download and complain then DONT DOWNLOAD. These people are doing ALL of us a favor. I just made an account to say that so many of you are ungrateful and seem to have such 'high' expectations but yet do nothing but sit around and grip about what others have done FOR YOU! If you don't like it and can do better, then shut-up and do it. Comments should consist of a quality rating and at most if you must let the uploader (don't even know if that is the right term) of actual problems with the video. There are other sites for rating movie quality : i.e. rotten tomatoes and IMDb there are plenty. It's pretty much common sense, I am no computer wiz and have no computer smarts but most of ya'll are just plain rude. BE grateful. I am done commenting SORRY"
,JOR23,2011-10-10T03:06Z,"ę°ěŹ...It means: thank you...in korean,like I said.....................IM LEARNING...PEACE OUT!"

,maitresaman,2011-10-29T02:24Z,"Bullshit upload. Subs are hard coded so you have to watch that shit the whole time.

As others have said use srt within the mkv so there's no issues"
,DieHardNinja,2011-10-29T13:39Z,"Who do you think is worse, people who express genuine dissatisfaction with something or the people demanding them to remain silent.  I know we don't all live in the United States of America where people are guaranteed a right to free speech, but that doesn't matter.  This is cyberspace.  People are freed by anonymity to state anything they choose.  For others to try and admonish and parent others is ludicrous (and not in the Mike Tyson sense, I mean truly ridiculous).  Just allow others to express themselves and if you don't agree, then feel free to state your case and leave it at that.  I know, I know, look who's sounding like a parent now.  I'm just offering some advice that may calm you down.  Count to 10 or 100 if you have to people! :-)"

,ST4Y_D33P,2012-04-27T03:44Z,"Careful guys. If you read - this video is encoded with hard subtitles... Korean subtitles at that.

Don't bother. Just download from a different uploader... unless you want big Korean subtitles throughout your whole movie."
