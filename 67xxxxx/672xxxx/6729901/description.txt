There is some great music here for your next party or to start your own Club
even for those that want to better enjoy and appreciate life through the
unique great gift of ballroom dance experiences

What can be more heartwarming than British! Its ultimately all I live for
-in the family of all our folks - as good decent loving folks mainly - amen

Enjoy and quit the punk music tolerance in your life for a happier
more fulfilling existence - sienpre!
