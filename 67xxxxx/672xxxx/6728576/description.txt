A fill-in math word problem is a funny math story
waiting to happen. Most of the word problem is
already supplied, except for a few key words and
numbers that have been removed and replaced with
blanks. Itâ€™s up to students to fill in those blanks with
missing nouns, verbs, and adjectivesâ€”just as they
would in other word games. The difference is that
this game is missing some numbers as well. When
your students supply the missing numbers along
with the words, you suddenly have a wacky math
word problem thatâ€™s fun to read and solve!
