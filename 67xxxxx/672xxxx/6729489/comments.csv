,Striker2005,2011-10-10T07:53Z,"I was hoping alot on this, but it looks awful. Ill stick with Dirt 3."
,DaztheJazz,2011-10-10T09:16Z,"I agree with Stirker2005, this is no more than an update of the last game. Same crap graphics, terrible car sounds, and if its possible, even worse support for steering wheels.  "
,asdasdqweasd,2011-10-10T12:07Z,"I haven't tried it yet, but if it has decent handling I'll take it over Dirt 3's ridiculously long loading times any day. Graphics don't matter so much because who has time to stare at your texture quality while your going 150mph."
,diablothe2nd,2011-10-10T13:21Z,"Thanks for the torrent EZ!

but I feel like I wasted my bandwidth on this, and even my money too as I bought it!

It's AWFUL. I have a logitech G27 and even with the steering linearity set to max I have to make really large turns just to move the car a little. And with force feedback turned on I can still hardly feel anything the car is doing.

I'll be looking to get a refund if they dont patch this games wheel support in the next couple of weeks. 

Very dissapointed."
,zegga,2011-10-10T13:55Z,Wouldn't you want steering linearity on 0?
,rochak1231,2011-10-10T16:47Z,all seeders and leechers are fail...no speed ....and the tip given here to get max speed does not works...
,AboulSAM,2011-10-10T20:36Z,Can we play it online because i played last year's game online for 2 months and it worked great.
,diablothe2nd,2011-10-10T23:43Z,"@zegga : not according to the scrolling help text and the testing graph! max makes an exponential looking curve.

i wonder if they're stupid enough to have put the settings the wrong way around? (seen that happen before). will try again later when i'm more inclined to tolerate the other issues it has."
,robbarrow,2011-10-11T19:14Z,"HELP!! i have no sound... how to fix it?

but game is working!"
,Dj_Speeddemon,2011-10-13T19:55Z,"Hey Ive got a problem i cant do any stages in the UK it goes onto the loading screen then crashes on me
anyone got ideas how to fix it
apart from that great torrent "
,simply92,2011-10-15T18:46Z,I've u really want a good rally game.. try Dirt 3 or RBR .. those are better than this =) nice try but still not good enough ;)
,bbzlov,2011-10-18T19:02Z,"Wasted time. 

Graphics: 3/10
Game play: 2/10
Sound effects: 4/10

This is honestly such a disappointment. This has the graphics of a game from 2004 not 2011! The game play is simply unrealistic.

Computer specs:
-OS: Windows 7 ultimate.
-CPU: Intel Core i5 3.20GHz
-VIDEO: GeForce GTX 470 1.25GB (Over clocked)
-RAM: 6GB
-SOUND: THX
-HDD: 3TB"
,dumpynl,2011-10-18T20:46Z,"This game dos bot work on 64bit.
It wants to work with the wrong ActiveX."

My DirectX was corrupted.

Thanks for this game!!!"

,shinobiXRT,2011-10-31T12:48Z,no crack

,immagical,2011-12-17T01:40Z,"eh guys you can also change the ""SFX"" in the game to low setting and that also stops the crashes in game play or the sound setting to 24 bit 14400 in your windows computer,, the ""SFX"" setting in the game also works on grand theft auto san andreas,.  if the game play when driving seems to go laggy slow motion style thats the problam,.  sfx set to low.."
