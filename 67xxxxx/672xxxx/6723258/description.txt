If you own a digital camera and actively take pictures with it, you probably have a hard drive, memory card, or laptop filled with images that you keep meaning to do something with but never get around to. "101 Quick and Easy Secrets for Using Your Digital Photographs" will show you how to make the most out of the images you have or plan to take, detailing the best way to manipulate, manage, publish, share, and promote your photographs. You'll learn how to navigate through both free downloadable software programs that help you manage your photos, such as Picasa, and the programs you already have on your computer, such as iPhoto. To help you share your photos with others, the book explores free online sites, such as Flickr and Facebook, and tells you how to best utilize them to suit your needs. The book also walks through the printing process, from finding the right paper for your prints to finding the best printer to make them last. And if you don't want to do the printing yourself, you'll discover how to outsource it. And when it comes to displaying your printed photographs, whether you prefer elaborate scrapbooks or simple frames, this book will show you the best places to purchase all the supplies and tools you need. Whether you are a professional looking to polish your portfolio and promote yourself or a casual photographer just looking to organize and display your family photos, "101 Quick and Easy Secrets for Using Your Digital Photographs" will help you make the most out of your collection of digital photographs.
