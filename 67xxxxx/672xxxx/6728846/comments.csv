,reinoso,2011-10-08T07:41Z,quality??
,Marshmont,2011-10-08T07:52Z,the best quality yet for this movie. kinda grainy but more than watchable A: 9 V:5 
,Marshmont,2011-10-08T07:59Z,btw thanks IwannaFan2
,dzlrules,2011-10-08T13:19Z,"whoever ripped this, should stop. Audio is muuuuch better than video. For nearly 2gb of disk space, it's not worth killing those electrons.

A-7 / V-3.2"
,FMyLife0,2011-10-08T20:38Z,"Very poor video quality, snowy amd dark V4/A8, still the best copy out there. "
,FMyLife0,2011-10-08T23:48Z,"The other 900mb ppvrip is alot better than this, DONT DOWNLOAD THIS"
,aitrex,2011-10-09T01:04Z,"Audio is bad, video is really bad. PPVRip, really? Just wait for a better release."
,supersteve2345,2011-10-09T03:55Z,Like a really old VHS I will watch it then delete for the HDD space it's not the best but thanks dude you ROCK
,celtqueen,2011-10-09T06:26Z,"hey, Iwanna...really? quit with these ups, will ya?  you're wasting your time and ours. there is a way to record PPV's, instead of using your camera in front of the tv, as you are obviously doing.  if you're gonna take the time, trouble and risk to put these up, then do it right.  i appreciate that you put in work, but the results are what counts and this is NOTworth it."
,phrozenstare,2011-10-13T22:58Z,"no way to record PPV's? really?

you are clueless celtqueen  get off the internet before you hurt yourself"
