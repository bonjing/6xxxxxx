,Fanstyg,2011-10-08T02:22Z,"Nrg.file? is it for mac?
Cant find info about this release on any other site either, including nfo hump..."
,crudler12,2011-10-08T02:49Z,nrg is like an iso
,GDL,2011-10-08T03:10Z,"The complete release is over 4G, this will be missing the content, plugins, etc :("
,knight_eagle,2011-10-08T04:42Z,"Rockets through D/L till it hits 91% than doesn't budge! WTF! Common, Those who have the whole thing need to stick around and seed a bit. AND those that post need to make sure more than one or two people have it before logging off!"
,kurik,2011-10-08T05:23Z,"This is just the 32-bit version, right?"
,mas2ery,2011-10-08T06:22Z,"at the time of this post, Im at 98.7% and uploaded 607 mb. and there is 4 seeds at least now, i started this DL at 6:47 pm. its now 9:24 giddy up"
,blacksidex6,2011-10-08T08:02Z,thanks BLACKTROY... I got some issues with the 8 edition...I hope this...
,kurik,2011-10-08T12:43Z,"Seems to work just fine, installs both the 32 and 64 bit versions, but the crack only works with 32."
[T],Peterq,2011-10-08T18:30Z,"@kurik - correct, only 32bit works!
Any chance of uploading the content packs?"
[T],Peterq,2011-10-08T20:47Z,I've found what I believe to be the full app with content on another site. If it's genuine I'll upload here!
,Netbunny,2011-10-08T23:12Z,"Great upload thanks, but it's missing a keycode for queue manager, and some other content is missing. Will be keeping an eye out for the rest of this prog. Aside from the missing files it is working perfectly for me on 32 bit. "
,Kezo2005,2011-10-09T07:21Z,"Thanks anyways, but I'll wait til the 64 bit comes out! No point having 14 gbs of RAM when you can't even use it!

Damn you XP, why don't you DIE already!"
,_AKUMA_,2011-10-09T08:07Z,"Better off just to wait for the official CYGISO release of this program.  People are in too much of a hurry to get this, and so we are going to have countless hacks and cracks for it until then.  I think this came out of the CGPersia site anyway.  Not knocking them, but they aren't exactly ""the standard"" in piracy either."
,nt110,2011-10-09T08:20Z,"I hate to be one of ""those"" guys, but is there a crack for the x64 version being made? (if there is one, can someone upload it?)
I have 12GB of RAM and want to use my computer's full potential in both rendering AND the main program.

Thanks for any info."
,nt110,2011-10-09T08:21Z,".... Aaaaaand of course I posted that comment before reading the last two posts before me.

Sorry about that. :S"
,GDL,2011-10-09T18:44Z,There's 64bit windows xp too for your memory problems :P
,Notoriously,2011-10-15T17:56Z,"after i installed it, i did everything u said but when i run it it just closes. help me. i downloaded both ur versions and i have the same problem."
,cyber365,2011-10-16T01:03Z,THIS HAVE HIDEN & TIME VIRUS!! NOW I'M BACK AFTER MY HD WERE FREEZED AND FORMATED! WATCH OUT!!! DAM!!
,mentyra,2011-11-18T00:07Z,"me and my friend downloaded it at the same time. his works fine but whenever i run it, it opens for a sec then screen goes white and the program crashes saying 'there is a problem with the executable file' ... anyone have any ideas how to fix this?"
,craigjacey,2012-01-23T10:27Z,Downloaded in under 5 minutes. Install took a bit longer. hope the comment about timed virus is incorrect. seeding anyways..
,glabos2,2012-02-06T19:51Z,"The compressed file was obviously created by a cretin with absolutely no background in RAR files. There are RAR files within RAR files within RAR files. WTF !!!! 

After wasting hours downloading and then creating the actual uncompressed files by decompressing 3 levels of RAR files I was able to install the program. The install point binary was digitally signed by Smith Micro and installed without incident after deselecting all the content libraries. 

However, it did NOT run even after copying the files into the proper program directory. The popup error message complained about invalid side-by-side programs and advised checking Windows app event log, or running Windows sxstrace utility. There were no app events recorded and the sxstrace utility yielded nothing of value. Also attempted installing the content library separately from their install exe's but also same result. (The path in the RAR files is not the path the installer expects to find the content library exe's so that generates an error unless deselected before installing)

Attempted installs on 3 separate versions of Win7 Ultimate including 23/64 bits. Same result for all installs- Side-by-Side does not natch configuration message. 

If you suffer through the multiple needless un-RAR routines you will yield the Smith Micro digitally signed install files. Too bad they just don't install properly.

If anyone else has solved the Side-By-Side config error message please post your work around.

Thanks"
,mmmmm32,2012-02-09T21:48Z,a side by side error is nothing to do with the download its a problem with how it installed on your computer i had a side by side issue with an older poser version a few years back sorry i cant remember how to resolve it tho do a search for side by side errors the solution is out there 
,mmmmm32,2012-02-09T22:10Z,side by side is microsoft visual c issue is fixable but worst it can be means reinstall windows 
,titanium69,2012-03-02T05:16Z,Loaded fine. Ran fine. But several content libraries failed to load. So...I'll try someone elses.   One that has content.
,hyvick,2012-04-25T14:10Z,"dowmload it,,, ill seed"
