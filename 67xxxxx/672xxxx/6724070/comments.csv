,Kali_Flower,2011-10-08T07:59Z,"Ok- I'm going to download & watch then come back to comment on quality and such :) 

One suggestion I can offer right now- which is more of a personal preference thing I suppose, but still- I always like it when the episode info is given. Number of episodes, their title and run-time listed in order; that kind of thing. 

I don't think having more details can be a bad thing, as long as they aren't spoilers. Not that we don't already know how this one turns out, but you know what I mean."
,SixPigeons,2011-10-10T06:48Z,"Thanks for the upload.  A nice little set of videos.  Since the Walking Dead website blocks video outside of the U.S., this was nice to get.  The download speed was fast, too.

My one criticism would be that the video seems to be too compressed.  It would be nice to have a sharper picture.  Considering how short this story is, it would still be a small file, even at a higher resolution.

Thanks again for uploading this.  Good luck with your future releases."
,Kali_Flower,2011-10-15T10:24Z,"Quick download speed, nice quality, a sweet collection overall. 

I like how I didn't have to sit through an intro for each one so that they just played basically like one video. I converted it and burned it to DVD and it still looked/sounded good, too. I would agree with SixPigeons that it seemed a little too compressed, but I'd still give it at least a solid 8.5 for A/V.

Excellent job- far better than my first several torrents turned out!"
,Istoryahe,2011-10-17T03:03Z,Thanks for the info about quality 6Pigeons. I went and looked on Filestube instead for a better quality and large file

Very good for an MP4. Would be nice to have a listing of what episodes are contained. This is the best torrent on TPB for these webisodes.

Thanks man!"
