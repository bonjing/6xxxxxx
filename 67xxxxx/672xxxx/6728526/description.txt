Okay, this one is cropped where the subtitles were, obviously that means some of the bottom section of video is missing. It's a take it or leave it release really. Also, it has been converted to XviD format for those who prefer it. I know some prefer it left as it is - others prefer cropping....

I did originally convert to 700mb with Aimersoft Ultimate, but it was too pixelated, so I tried a different programme, and got this rip, which is far better.


PLOT:

A young woman grows up to be a stone-cold assassin after witnessing her parents' murder as a child in Bogota.She works for her uncle as a hitman by day, but her personal time is spent engaging in vigilante murders that she hopes will lead her to her ultimate target - the mobster responsible for her parents' death.
