I just wanted to say a massive thank you for all the top quality vintage filth you give us. I am a massive collector of the 'classics' and you just keep the quality offerings coming - even the really rare stuff which I thought I'd never get to see. 

Please don't stop, you are a legend fella. 

Thanks."
