,muLineZu,2011-10-08T13:37Z,"The Omen Collection Blu-ray box (four-disc) set includes the following titles:
- The Omen 666
- The Omen
- Damien: Omen II
- The Final Conflict
What happened to The Omen 666 (2006)? It is a remake from the original The Omen (1976), but is seems to be considered part of the collection.
Don't mean to be ungrateful, as I have a lot to thank you both (jbr & PetaFOX) especially for the great collections ripped and uploaded.
Thank you very much!"

The first one is the best but all of them are great. But the first one is ""new hope"" of omen trilogy so to say.
