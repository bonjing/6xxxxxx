Special Thanks to YeshuaAgapao. These are files from one of his torrents.
I\'ve organized and retagged them for mp3 players.  This contains only the audio files, not the document files.  All 1189 Chapeters are here. Now they are organized for user friendly mp3 player use, and the whole bible in 623mb is pretty impressive!  Thanks again YeshuaAgapao.

Alexander Scourby reads this very well, and not too fast like some others.

**NOTE**  This is the first torrent I've ever made. Any helpful tips for improvement would be appreciated, and any help seeding would be as well
