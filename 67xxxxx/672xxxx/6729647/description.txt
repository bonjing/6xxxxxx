Storyline:

Beautiful, sophisticated women are all over Oscar Grubman. He is sensitive and compassionate, speaks French fluently, is 
passionate about Voltaire, and thinks the feature that tells the most about a woman is her hands. On the train home from 
Chauncey Academy for the Thanksgiving weekend, Oscar confides in his best friend that he has plans for this vacation--he 
will win the heart of his true love. But there is one major problem--Oscar's true love is his stepmother Eve. Oscar is 
certain that he could be a better mate to Eve than his work-obsessed father. He fails to win Eve's heart and is consequently 
dejected. Oscar's path to his true love is further crossed by Diane, Eve's best friend who, one night while wearing Eve's 
borrowed perfumed scarf, offers him temporary comfort in an unconventional tryst. For Diane, Oscar fills a void in her 
life. For Oscar, Diane is somewhat of a distraction, as his continued pursuit of Eve leads to an unexpected resolution.

*I don't take requests because I don't have time and everyone will fill the comment section with them instead of commenting about quality and other tehnical specs of the movies or say thanks.Thank you for understanding!
*For best performance I suggest you use KMPlayer(find it with google) for playback
*These movies were made especially for PC and they don't play on a PS3.If you want to re-encode for PS3 or test for other devices be my guests.
*I'll ask everybody to stop with the "it doesn't work","it's out of sync" comments because I tested the movies before I uploaded them and they work fine.
