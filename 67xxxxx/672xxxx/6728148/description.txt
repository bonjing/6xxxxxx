 RELEASE NOTES


January 21, 1968: A B-52G bomber carrying four thermo nuclear bombs,

Airbase. The search party finds the wreck and three of the bombs, but
the fourth is missing.

Presence: The notorious Russian Mafia boss and arms dealer Yebievdenko
has a new toy for sale, an atom bomb. The CIA learns of his plans to
sell it to a Libyan ruler, and the fears are that it will be used in a
terrorist attack against the USA as revenge for the American
involvement in the Libyan conflict.

As a member of the US special unit, it is now up to you to stop the
