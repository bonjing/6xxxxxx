I've Tried my Logitech Rumble Pad 2 on this game and The Left analogue Was Inverted, Meaning when I push up for forward It walks Backward.

So I Decided To Use The xbox360cemu.v.3.0 and After Copying all 

dinput8.dll
xbox360cemu
xinput1_3.dll
xinput9_1_0.dll

To the game main directory all was Fixed . So I'm Pretty Sure The Game Supports The xbox 360 controller :)"
