,fastfxr,2011-10-15T02:59Z,"Why a .wbfs?  WBFS Manager automatically reads .ISO files, but you make users go through the extra effort of downloading a lame-ass WBFS-to-ISO program?  

Lame.
Not seeding.  "

The Wii Backup File System is the superior file format, end of story. If you want to waste your time downloading a larger file that is essentially exactly the same thing, be my guest. There is no rule that you must format your hard drive to WBFS.

WBFS Manager has it's uses, but it isn't the best manager software for Wii games currently. Your proclamation didn't really merit a response from me, but it may be important for others to know these things. That is all."

If you have unlimited bandwidth, then good for you. I think I speak for the others who don't when I say quit your damn crying. It takes but 3-5 minutes to convert, stop being lazy.
Hobbit, thanks for another great up, very much appreciated man."

,ozzyvanity,2012-01-02T05:05Z,"So I was wondering, if I download Just Dance 3 Best Buy Edition, and I wanna replace it with this one. Do I have to start over everything or does it save my memory already? :o"
