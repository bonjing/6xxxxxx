REVIEWS

Two former LPs by big bands led by bassist Oscar Pettiford (who doubles on cello) are reissued in full on this single CD.
The arrangements by Gigi Gryce, Lucky Thompson, and Benny Golson feature a lot of concise solos, an inventive use of the harp (either by Janet Putnam or Betty Glamann), and colorful ensembles. Among the many soloists are trumpeter Art Farmer, trombonists Jimmy Cleveland and Al Grey, the French horn of Julius Watkins, the tenors of Thompson or Golson, and the bassist-leader.
This formerly rare music is highly recommended to straight-ahead jazz fans, for it is full of fresh material and subtle surprises. (AMG)




Nonetheless, the fidelity of this originally ABC-Paramount recording (entitled 'The Oscar Pettiford Orchestra in Hi-Fi' ) manages to preserve the identifiable, unique sound of Pettiford's bass--light but definitive, always dead-on pitch and squarely-center on the beat. And surprising, especially for a quasi-big band recording (scaled down slightly and with unusual orchestration), is the focus on Pettiford's cello work, which is quite possibly the best the instrument has sounded on any jazz recording past or present.
The arrangements are fresh and sizzling, breezy and swinging, with instruments like harp (not a harmonica!) and French horns used not merely for color (though they definitely cast an unmistakable, distinctive hue on the entire proceedings) but as solo instruments (to my mind, Julius Watkins' French horn is used far more effectively here that it would be later in Mingus' groups). Most of the tunes are first rate.
It's a rare treat to hear Lucky Thompson and Gigi Gryce play together, as well as the lead trumpet clinic by Ernie Royal. The rhythm sections cooks. It's just great. (Amazon)
