From the Infowars web site ::

Alex talks with "Freeway" Ricky Ross, who was sentenced to life for dealing cocaine. His sentence was reduced after a series of articles by journalist Gary Webb in the San Jose Mercury News brought to light a connection between one of Ross's cocaine sources and the CIA as part of the Iran-Contra scandal. Ross was featured in Kevin Booth's documentary American Drug War: The Last White Hope. 

Alex also talks with actress, comedian, writer, television producer and director Roseanne Barr. She has said Wall Street bankers should be sent to re-education camps and if that does not work they should be beheaded. 

Alex also continues his coverage of the Occupy Wall Street protests that have fanned out over the country and spread to Europe.   

Today's broadcast went 20 minutes into 4th hour "overDrive" to finish the conversation with Ross and Booth.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
