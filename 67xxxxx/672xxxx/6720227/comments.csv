As long as you accept it for the nonsense that it is; it's full of violence, sex, murder, rape, genocide, theft, incest, and homo-erotic relations.

Much more gripping than Homer. "

Attacking people's beliefs systems this way will only strengthen them, never persuade them. So good luck with that."
