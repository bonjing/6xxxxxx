,kudu10,2011-10-08T23:40Z,Thanks for ruining the game for those of us didnt get to watch it. The whole point of uploads of sports is for people who maybe didn't get to watch it. How completely selfish of you. 
,toxic_elvis,2011-10-09T08:24Z,"i didn't ruin you anything. If you are waiting for the full game, than don't download this...simple... and if you think of a result you all ready saw that somewhere :)"
,timbojunk,2011-10-10T01:45Z,"no toxic_elvis, I had avoided seeing the results and was waiting on a torrent. I even already had the search and was refreshing the page periodically. 
You are the spoiler."
,toxic_elvis,2011-10-10T20:07Z,"@all sorry for me spoiling it, it was not my intention. I would change the torrent name, but as you know since recently i can't edit the torrent... SORRY...i will seed full game soon"
