"Fast Lane"

[Royce Da 5'9"]
First verse, uh
Iâ€™m armed â€™til Iâ€™m on a island
My lifeâ€™s ridinâ€™ on the Autobahn on autopilot
Before I touch dirt, Iâ€™ll kill you all with kindness
I kill ya, my natural personaâ€™s much worse
Youâ€™ve been warned if youâ€™ve been born or if you conform
Slap up a cop and then snatch him out of his uniform
Leave him witâ€™ his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn
Yâ€™all niggasâ€™ intellect mad slow, yâ€™all fags know
Claiminâ€™ you banginâ€™, you flaminâ€™
Bet you could light your own cigarette wit ya asshole
Me and Shady deaded the past, so that basically resurrected my cashflow
I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
Though I ainâ€™t wrapped tight
My blood typeâ€™s the â€™80s!
My â€™90s was like the Navy, you was like the Bradys
You still fly kites daily!

[Eminem]
Catch me in my Mercedes
Bumpinâ€™ â€œIce, Ice Baby,â€ screaminâ€™ Shady â€™til I die
Like a half a pair of dice, lifeâ€™s crazy
So I live it to the fullest â€™til Iâ€™m Swayze
And you only live it once, so Iâ€™m thinkinâ€™ â€™bout this nice, nice lady
Wait, no, stop me now before I get on a roll (Danish)
Let me tell you what this pretty little dameâ€™s name is, â€™cause sheâ€™s kinda famous
And I hope that I donâ€™t sound too heinous when I say this
Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus!
You morons think that Iâ€™m a genius
Really I belong inside a dang insane asylum, cleaninâ€™, try them trailer parks
Crazy, I am back, and I am razor-sharp, baby
And thatâ€™s back witâ€™ a capital B witâ€™ an exclamation mark, maybe
You should listen when I flip the linguistics
â€˜Cause Iâ€™m gonna rip this mystical slick shit
You donâ€™t wanna become another victim or statistic of this shit
â€˜Cause after I spit the bullets, Iâ€™ma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball
Iâ€™ma kick the ballistics! So get this dick, Iâ€™ma live this

[Hook]
Livinâ€™ life in the fast lane
Movinâ€™ at the speed of life and I canâ€™t slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But Iâ€™m almost at the finish line, so I canâ€™t stop now

I donâ€™t really know where Iâ€™m headed, just enjoyinâ€™ the ride
Just gonâ€™ roll â€™til I drop and ride â€™til I die
Iâ€™m livinâ€™ life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal)
Iâ€™m livinâ€™ life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal)
Royce

[Royce Da 5'9"]
My whole goal as a poetâ€™s to be relaxed in orbit
At war witâ€™ a bottle, this Captain Morgan attacks my organs
My slow flow is euphoric, itâ€™s like I rap endorphins
I made a pact with the Devil that says â€œIâ€™ll let you take me
You let me take this shovel, dig up the corpse of Jack Kevorkianâ€
Go â€˜back and forth in more beef that you can pack a fork in
Iâ€™m livinâ€™ the life of the infinite enemy down
My tenement, too many now, to send my serenity powers
Spin â€˜em around, enterinâ€™ in the vicinity

[Eminem]
Now, was called Eminem, but he threw away the candy and ate the rapper
Chewed him up (Pt!) and spitted him out
Girl, giddy-up, now get, get down
Heâ€™s lookinâ€™ around this club and it looks like people are havinâ€™ a shit fit now
Here, little t-t-trailer trash, take a look whoâ€™s back in t-t-town
Did I s-st-stutter, motherfucker? F-ck the mall, he shuts
The whole motherfuckinâ€™ Walmart d-d-down every time he comes a-r-r-round
And he came to the club tonight witâ€™ 5â€™9â€³ to hold this bitch down
Like a motherfuckinâ€™ chick underwater, he tryna d-dr-drown
Shawty, when you dance, you got me captivated
Just by the way that you keep lickinâ€™ them dicks like lips, Iâ€™m agitated, aggravated
To the point you donâ€™t suck my dick, then youâ€™re gonna get decapitated
Other words, you donâ€™t fuckinâ€™ give me head, then Iâ€™m have to take it

[Royce]
And then after takinâ€™ that, Iâ€™ma catch a case, itâ€™s gonâ€™ be fascinatinâ€™
Itâ€™s gonâ€™ say â€œThe whole rap game passed awayâ€ on top of the affadavit
Graduated from master debater slash massive masturbator
To Michael Jacksonâ€™ activator (Woo!)
Meaninâ€™ Iâ€™m on fire off the top, might wanna back up the data
Runninâ€™ over hip-hop in a verbal tractor-trailer
Homie, this sick, you can normally ask a hater
Donâ€™t it make sense, these shell casings is just like a bag of paper
Drop in the lap of a tax evader (Homie, they spent)

[Eminem]
Now make that ass drop like a sack of potatoes
What, girl, Iâ€™m the crack-a-lator
Percolator to this party, be my penis ejaculator later
Tell your boyfriend that you just struck paydirt
You rollinâ€™ with a player, you wonâ€™t be exaggeratinâ€™ when you sayinâ€™
