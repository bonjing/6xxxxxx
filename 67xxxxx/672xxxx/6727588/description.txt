Already 64 years old when he recorded this obscure and forgotten Blues album in early 1970, Arthur "Big Boy" Crudup had cruelly seen 3 of his compositions covered by Elvis Presley (most famously "That's All Right"), but because of strange royalty arrangements - never saw any cash for them. But like Curtis Jones, Otis Spann, Muddy Waters and so many other black blues artists of the time (who all complained of being 'done' by industry types), they moved to Britain and Europe where their music was being listened to and appreciated by ecstatic white musicians and mixed audiences hungry for the real deal.
Working a small UK tour at the time, which was financed by The National Blues Federation of the USA, Crudup stopped into a London studio to record this album.The whole LP was recorded in one day, The album title came from a pub in Putney (featured behind him on the sleeve) where he received a none-to-enlightened reception and famously included an acidic reaction to it in its title 

Arthur Crudup died in early 1974, aged 68. Music historians often say that he gave a lot to the Blues and an incalculable donation to world karma via Elvis Presley and his 1st US 7" single on Sun Records in 1955 - Crudup's own "That's All Right" - thereby starting a journey that many of us are still on. It's just such a damn shame that the music business didn't return him the compliment.
