A Dark & Thrilling Dreamlike World 

With the original score for the show CRISS Angel Believe, Cirque du Soleil fans are provided an in-depth look at renowned French composer Ã‰ric Serraâ€™s work which features key tracks from the pre-opening of the show in September 2008 to today. Ã‰ric Serra created the initial music composition for the show CRISS ANGEL Believe and incorporates his vast experience in film music scores (The Big Blue, The Last Combat, Subway, La Femme Nikita, Atlantis, The Fifth Element, etc.). Inspired by the showâ€™s themes and written and arranged to blend with the visuals, Serra takes the listener on a thrilling, dreamlike exploration beginning with sounds of vintage children-inspired melodies to rock and gothic moments with heavy, industrial, electronic beats to classical and operatic influences. Featured on 4 songs of this album is Nitza, original lead vocalist of the show and award-winning (Los Angeles Music Awards, Hollywood Music Awards, DEKA) world music artist.
