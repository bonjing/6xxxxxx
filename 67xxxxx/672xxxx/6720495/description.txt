This is a continuation of Vol. 7 of Trends in Logic. It wil cover the wealth of recent developments of Lukasiewicz Logic and their algebras (Chang MV-algebras), with particular reference to (de Finetti) coherent evaluation of continuously valued events, (Renyi) conditionals for such events, related algorithms.
From the Back Cover
In recent years, the discovery of the relationships between formulas in Åukasiewicz logic and rational polyhedra, Chang MV-algebras and lattice-ordered abelian roups, MV-algebraic states and coherent de Finettiâ€™s assessments of continuous events, has changed the study and practice of many-valued logic. This book is intended as an up-to-date monograph on inï¬nite-valued Åukasiewicz logic and MV-algebras. Each chapter features a combination of classical and reÂ¬cent results, well beyond the traditional domain of algebraic logic: among others, a comprehensive account is given of many eï¬€ective procedures that have been reÂ¬cently developed for the algebraic and geometric objects represented by formulas in Åukasiewicz logic. The book embodies the viewpoint that modern Åukasiewicz logic and MV-algebras provide a benchmark for the study of several deep mathematical probÂ¬lems, such as RÃ©nyi conditionals of continuously valued events, the many-valued generalization of CarathÃ©odory algebraic probability theory, morphisms and invariÂ¬ant measures of rational polyhedra, bases and Schauder bases as jointly reï¬nable partitions of unity, and ï¬rst-order logic with [0,1]-valued identity on Hilbert space. Complete versions are given of a compact body of recent results and techniques, proving virtually everything that is used throughout, so that the book can be used both for individual study and as a source of reference for the more advanced reader.
