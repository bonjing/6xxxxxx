You do a great job of keeping file size manageable, & still maintain quality & to add the subs, is a really nice extra. Plus you're very nice, even to jerks who can't seem to appreciate that you are doing them a favor by doing this, and you have no control over airdates, etc.  Very considerate! Also? i had lost almost ALL of my last season 7 on my DVR, so i was SO glad to find yours! You're my hero!  Thanks!!"
