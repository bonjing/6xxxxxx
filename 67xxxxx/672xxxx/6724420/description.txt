::Plot::
  Jackie is recruited by Section 13 to search for twelve magic Talismans scattered across the globe, in order to stop a criminal organization known as the Dark Hand from using them to revive an ancient demon sorcerer, Shendu. When the tiger Talisman is split in half, so is Jackie, and his dark half hands over the Talismans, allowing the Dark Hand to reanimate Shendu. Shendu travels to China to summon his dragon army to destroy all of Asia. Jackie pulls the Talismans out of Shendu, causing him to transform back into a statue, and Jade destroys him. However, this leaves a vacuum to be filled by a new more powerful evil force.
Whilst the ending theme for other seasons are the same as the opening, in the first season, the ending theme is "Chan's the Man" by Wheatus.
