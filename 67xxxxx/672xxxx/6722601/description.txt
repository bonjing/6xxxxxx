Nepheton is an emulation of the classic Roland TR-808 drum machine taking its sound a step further with all the original functions and many additional features.

Full features:
* 17 fully synthesized instruments.
* Perfectly scaled knob ranges.
* Enhanced control of instruments' sounds.
* Dynamic signal routing from instruments to outputs.
* User defined output configuration.
* Mute/solo for each instrument (affect triggering not just the signal).
* Fully controllable via MIDI CC.
* Quick MIDI CC assignation with MIDI Learn function.
* Many ways of controlling the device:
o External mode (note mode):
+ User defined MIDI map (default set equal to General MIDI).
+ MIDI tune and velocity controls instruments' levels and tunes.
o Internal sequencer (pattern mode) with 3 sub modes:
+ 16 patterns (12 basic rhythms and 4 intros/fill ins.
+ Pattern contains up to 4 segments (up to 16 steps per segment).
+ Each segment can be defined with one of four available measures.
+ Each step can be defined normal or accented.
+ Shuffle mode.
+ Tap mode.
+ Chain mode.
+ Shuffle defined per pattern part.
+ Scale function and intelligent Rescale (automatically stretches pattern to the chosen measure).
+ Built in Randomizer (selection of instruments to random, steps to be affected, frequency of the randomized notes and more).
+ Patterns import/export via human readable xml files.
* Two modes of synchronization:
o Precise synchronization to the host tempo.
o Synchronization to internal clock - tempo controlled in the range 30-303 BPM (+-0.1).
* Built-in preset manager.
