A series of sketches all based around the themes of sex and relationships 


This saucy British sketch comedy series revolves around a group of recurring, very dysfunctional characters and their sexual issues, which range from a woman marrying a closeted homosexual to a teacher who comes on to one of her students. Language goes mostly uncensored ("s--t" is unbleeped), and innuendo is constant. Overall, it's ribald, racy, and hilarious
