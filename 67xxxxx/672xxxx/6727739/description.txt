Tense dungeon crawling, fearsome enemy encounters and groundbreaking online features combine for a truly unique RPG experience. Dark Souls breaks down barriers with a seamless world design that encourages exploration and fosters an adaptable gameplay experience.

Storyline:
Demons, spawned by the wrath of gods, have brought darkness to the world. Stricken by the curse of the undead, many have lost their souls. Players must battle hideous demons and unimaginable monsters to collect souls and find the Eternal Flame of Life, which is losing its power to restore souls and keep the eternal night at bay.

Seamless environments in a dark fantasy universe: abandoned castles infested with the undead, labyrinthine catacombs, a world of sunken ruins, haunted forests, vast dungeons and magical lakes are all there for the courageous to explore at will.

Expanded RPG elements: plentiful options to customise characters with different equipment, weapons and spells will provide players a deep RPG experience.

The Beacon Fire: placed at strategic points throughout the game world, the Beacon Fire serves as a Recovery, Restart and Sharing Point.
