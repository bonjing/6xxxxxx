,Metalprofi666,2011-10-08T13:55Z,"and yes, i have updated my firmware to LT 2.0"

,01seb01,2011-10-08T16:27Z,"Thanks for the reply boobsman

Thanks again
"
[V],boobsman,2011-10-08T16:42Z,"@ Metalprofi666, the xgd3 games can be burned to a standard dual layer, the burn will fail due to disc size but the data missed off is just disc padding and will not effect the game in any way. There are new burn instructions for imgburn contained with the files you can also read through the Gears of War 3 nfo instructions given by Rrod as they will be the same for all xgd3 games from now on:

,Bozznii,2011-10-09T15:01Z,"I downloaded another torrent, but also dark souls pal.

And i did everything the guide boobsman linked told me to.

but i get a ""this game needs to be updated"" thing and it wont work.. what should I do?"
,stezo77,2011-10-09T16:30Z,might be a tittle update 
,stezo77,2011-10-09T16:34Z,is this a rrod rip
,dodge112,2011-10-09T23:42Z,Works perfectly thanks alot for this one and Gears of War 3 Boobsman!
,Metalprofi666,2011-10-09T23:44Z,"@boobsman
in that page you gave me it suggests to write the laybreak to 2133520...does it mean that i should erase the previous number we had on xd2. 1913760 or no need to change the number since its in Calculate Optimal? thnx"
,Bozznii,2011-10-10T15:12Z,how did u guys get it to work?
,crashoveride17072,2011-10-11T14:02Z,"Cheers mate :-) very nice upload , keep up the good work"
,Metalprofi666,2011-10-11T16:09Z,it works CONFIRMED...just follow the steps..that's all...cheers and thnx to the uploader
,RafaelGarcia,2011-10-11T16:43Z,"Please, more seeds!"
[V],boobsman,2011-10-12T12:08Z,"@Metalprofi666, 2133520 is the layer break for xgd3 discs and is too large for the standard dual layer, if you have it set to that the burn will fail at 50%. You need to have the break set to optimal or 2086912 as this is the max for the first layer of the disc."
,Metalprofi666,2011-10-12T21:42Z,"@boobsman
how then i burned the game with the layer  2133520 

and the game works perfectly...mmm..so, again i have to change this laybreak into 2086912? is that what u r saying?..I hope i understood u well buddy :)"
,Metalprofi666,2011-10-12T21:43Z,which character fits best for this game? I started with Thief but the game looks tough 
,leftyjay,2011-10-15T18:12Z,"thanks ! But is it a 0800 rip, so stealth ?"
,sunpanos,2011-10-16T10:38Z,"it doesnt work for me, as any other xdg3 game! i have followed instructions found and burn it succesfully but when i press play game it just does nothing!! recent games games such as fifa 12 work fine..."
,Dibbus,2011-10-19T00:39Z,Hey guys! I'm almost done with this download.. it took me like 2 days as it mostly just downloaded at 25kb/s so i'm gonna seed it for as long as you guys need ;) Just switched from pc gaming to console gaming and already notice that console pirates just dont seed as much as pc gamers... anyway hope you wont have such a horrible download as me!
,Dibbus,2011-10-19T14:42Z,"I have a problem, when I'm running abgx360 it says ''error: D:\-filename-.iso isnt recognized as an xbox360 iso or stealth file!''

So my question is... how can i fix this?"
,pteeth,2011-10-19T23:21Z,"@Dibbus

abgx doesn't recognize xgd3 games yet. wait for an update to abgx.

from what I understand, if it's a 0800 rip, it's a 1:1 copy, so there aren't any stealth problems.

don't know if this is 0800 or not."
,jacksonl,2011-10-26T19:36Z,is it ok to update from the disc?
,sillyskiz,2011-10-30T02:12Z,"i have the same question as jacksonl and bozznii. the game loads but tells me it needs to apply an update.

is this update safe? will it cause any problems with the LT2.0?"
,humbye,2011-11-12T08:34Z,"@boobsman

Thanks for the quality release! Burned it using ImgBurn and the truncate option, and works perfectly!!!

Just a quick question though. When you say the ""LT2.0"" you're talking about the firmware on the Xbox 360 right? I'm asking because I bought my Xbox 360 pre-modded and have no idea about flashing the firmware."
,AminAveh12345,2011-12-11T11:29Z,Seed FFS...
,amadeus9237,2012-04-23T03:58Z,"I just burned this on a verbatim disc properly by stealth patching with abgx and burning with img burn..
When i insert it the xbox reads it and displays the img and a ""Play dark souls""
also when i press details i see a dark souls background and i am able to install the game(installed it)but when i run it it shows an error saying ""Disc not supported""
Suggestions? "
,ingulu,2012-05-15T19:40Z,"Same problem here. Any ideas please ?

Games like Deus Ex etc. work just fine but for ""Dark Souls"" and ""The Witcher 2"" I have this exact problem.

I can install the game but disk not supported :/"
