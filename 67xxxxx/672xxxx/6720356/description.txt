An enjoyable, guided journey into your heart's desire, this process of self-discovery helps you to connect with what is most important for you.

Illuminating Your Heart's Desire guides you through the maze of your many conflicting desires. You are guided to search for those desires that can bring you true happiness, leading to deeper insight into yourself and the development of higher wisdom.

You will learn how to channel energy, that is normally dissipated by too many desires, into something meaningful and fulfilling.

You do this by creating a statement of intent (a sankalpa) that summarizes the one desire that is most important for you, your heart's desire.

By repeating your sankalpa in your meditation and creating a plan of action to achieve it, you begin to fully realize that you are the co-creator of your own life. You are the motivating force behind your own dreams and you have what it takes to realize them.
