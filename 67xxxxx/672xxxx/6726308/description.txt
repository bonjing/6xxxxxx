The film follows 50-something layabout Keiser as he tries to reform his old rock band The Cormorants. A huge deal in the 1970s, the band members now languish in obscurity doing various odd jobs. When offered a chance at fame once again, they begin to wonder just how much they want to reclaim their youth.
