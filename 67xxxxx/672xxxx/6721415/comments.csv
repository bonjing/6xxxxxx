If you have heard the previous two albums you know what to expect, it's interesting but still lightyears away from classic albums like The Process, Last Rites and Too Dark Park. Sadly there are no movies /tvs samples in their music anymore, a strong SP trademark from the past is gone. Nevertheless Cullorblind must be the best SP song in over 15 years."

Like @resonator said, their style has changed greatly over the almost 30 years they've been around, but if it hadn't, they'd be boring & probably suck by now.

30 years. They'd already been around 8 years when I first heard Too Dark Park in 9th grade, my first year of high school. (1990) 

Jesus, now I feel old.

Too Dark Park will, for me, always remain one of my most favorite albums of all time. Oddly enough, my favorite SP song is 'Worlock' which is on 'Rabies'. (And I know I'm certainly not the only person who feels that way about both items ;)

Thank you, anonymous person, for this leak."
