,ghedipunk,2011-10-06T18:48Z,"It looks like my initial seeding speed is around 600kB/s.  At this rate, it should take 6 days before I've been able to upload a complete copy.

Yes, I'm still planning on seeding for a few months."
,bog23man,2011-10-06T19:01Z,"hey,
I will seed with you.  Thanks for the videos when they finally download !! :)

Cool torrent"
,scjdg,2011-10-08T06:52Z,"Bless you, I will definatly seed once I have this fully down.  "
,schroed4,2011-10-12T11:29Z,"I have a very similar torrent!... unfortunately, it has a different naming scheme, and it would take probably an hour of work to get is fixed. Sorry I can't help!"
,ghedipunk,2011-10-12T19:49Z,"Thanks, bog23man and scjdg.  Also, thanks for the offer, schroed4.  

Yes, I changed the naming scheme around a bit from the original sources.  I figured that a uniform naming scheme would lead to fewer potential problems, and I chose this particular one (starting the file names with ""SxxxEyyPzz - Name Of Serial"") because it would be possible to take all of the video files, dump them in one directory, select them all and play them in order without having to re-order them in your video player of choice.

As for the state of the torrent:  It's very healthy for being so new.  I have 60 peers connected, and I've been uploading at a very consistent average of 625kB/s.

I have very strong evidence that says that I'm not the only seeder any more; someone was running a seedbox that was outpacing every other peer in terms of percentage downloaded...  Today, I'm not seeing that host in my client list any more, and it should have downloaded the complete torrent by now if it continued at the same speed since the last couple of times I've seen it.  (The Pirate Bay's statistics say there are 2 seeders, but I know those stats aren't actually reliable, as I saw it go up to 4 seeders before I'd even uploaded 25% of this.)

In terms of raw bits and reliability, I've uploaded 312GB out of the 201GB...  I've been down a total of 5 times, each time less than 3 minutes.

The average completion of the people I'm connected to is 30%, with a core group of 6 people leading the pack at 82.3%.  For those who haven't hit their ISP's download cap yet, things should start speeding up soon, as the number of rare pieces continues to drop."
,ArdentCustodian,2011-10-15T15:51Z,"Excellent torrent, thanks. I will help seed as well."
,aloses,2011-10-27T20:30Z,"Awesome!  I waited three days to test the first completed episode and it is AWESOME.  Great quality on the Pertwee episode I set for download first!  
I was missing most of the Pertwee days but have the rest. I will seed as soon as I can, wish someone with a better connection would seed.
Thanks from a long time Whovian! "
,norabaron,2011-12-17T10:09Z,"Thanks so much for collecting, uploading, and seeding this! I expect it to be well worth the wait."
,Whiteknightmac,2011-12-22T00:00Z,Incredible torrent. Going to start downloading this right away and count me in for seeding.
,Ahlberger,2011-12-31T15:41Z,"Just started watching the new series last week and I'm already well into the 3rd season so I thought I should start downloading this now! I will be seeding after as much as I can but with a max dl speed of 250kb/s we'll see how that goes... :)
Oh and the 8th doctor was that only a movie or do I have to get those seasons somewhere else?"
,ghedipunk,2012-01-04T02:54Z,"The Eighth Doctor's movie was his only appearance on television.  It was intended to reboot the series in 1996 after it ended in 1989 as a ""backdoor"" pilot, but due to it being targeted at US audiences by Fox, it wasn't received well by people who hadn't learned the joys of hiding behind the couch in fear of the Daleks.

The Eighth Doctor did appear in other media; books, comics, fanfic, slash, Rule 34's etc., but this torrent is limited to just what appeared on television."
,nug700,2012-02-11T05:27Z,"It's only downloading at like 3 KB/s... except for the occasional 300 KB/s, that immediately drops back down...."
,sefrie,2012-02-11T19:58Z,Please SEED.  This is saying it will take 1 year and 33 weeks to complete on a cable connection.
,zuva2rex,2012-03-04T04:00Z,"Looks like #17 The Time Meddler is labeled as season 1 but should be 2.

Otherwise this is fantastic.  Thanks"
,Giggaflop,2012-04-01T14:28Z,Seeding at 7MB/s
,Camwi,2012-05-04T01:39Z,"This is going to murder my monthly cap, but I'll seed for months if I have to, to give back what I've downloaded.

Thanks so much for the upload!"
,John1918,2012-05-12T04:52Z,"Very nice torrent, and greatly appreciated, have seeded a full copy, will attempt to keep it running for another couple."
,Athan485,2012-05-18T05:14Z,I must not have seen this torrent the last time I searched for the original series; this is absolutely amazing. Thank you so much  for the upload :3
[T],MrLore,2012-05-24T16:04Z,"Amazing torrent, thank you greatly!"
,anonfag69,2012-06-02T20:48Z,"Thank you for making a torrent of this series. Oh, and somebody please seed! Also when I'm finished downloading I will seed for a couple of months."
