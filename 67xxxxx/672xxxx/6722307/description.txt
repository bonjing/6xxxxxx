BUBBLE GUM is a coming of an age story     
of family and for families....set in       
Industrial town of 1980 Jamshedpur - an    
era when there was no TV, Internet, mobile 
and face book! It is a fun, frothy and     
warm coming of an age story of a fourteen  
year old Vedant. He has just stepped out   
of childhood and has not yet stepped into  
adulthood. It is while going through       
turbulent phase of life in his academically
critical year of Standard 9 first love or  
rather infatuation happens to him and sends
his relationship with his family and his   
world upside down finally leading him to   
discover the meaning of love, life and     
relationship in a positive way!
