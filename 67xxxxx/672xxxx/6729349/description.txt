  Rab returns home to find that his wife Mary has kidnapped Chingford   
  Steel, the government minister for work, who is on a goodwill tour    
  of Govan. There's not much goodwill in the Nesbitt house, however,    
  as Mary has just lost her job and decides to discuss the matter with  
  the minister by dinging him over the head with a frying pan. When     
  Chingford Steel activates his official panic alarm to summon the      
  police, Rab and Mary realise they will be arrested as soon as they    
  let him go, so they decide to keep him.
