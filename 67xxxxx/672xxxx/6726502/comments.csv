[T],skJGZV6z,2011-10-09T07:18Z,"Fox brings in some of the most attractive women. I also appreciate that they're often not waif-thin models, either, but real women with healthy body shapes. But I've always wondered how the producers broach the subject of desired dress-code and the ""leg-chair"" positions to potential guests and hosts. Is that awkward, or would I be surprised to learn these women embrace these ideas? They all seem to really enjoy their on-camera time, so I think it's just me.

The left like to egg Fox on this, and Fox itself tends to deflect the issue, but I think the reality is on display for itself, every hour of broadcast.

I have heard the argument that this is a tactic Fox uses to help inject their propaganda: you're too busy ogling the women to pay attention question the message. I say: yes, I am too busy ogling the women; no, I'm still paying attention. Case-in-point: Prof. Caroline Heldman, a frequent guest who gives the progressive view. I find myself pausing the show to talk-out my own counter arguments when she leans in to give her viewpoint. Nevertheless, I can't look away. It's a very smart strategy.

Now if someone like Heldman replaced Maddow on MSNBC, I'd probably tune in every so often and watch...but only so often. The legs bring me ""under the tent"", but it's the argument keeps me from changing the channel."
