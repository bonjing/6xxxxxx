speed/compression.

Notes: 
* includes integrated "Imagination 3" Theme. WinRAR's default theme is so bland 
and ugly to look at. (refer to screenshot) 
* this version is truly stealth: i tested thoroughly.
* PortableAppz has a version posted but like many of his apps., it leaves trash
in the registry and uses the standard theme.
