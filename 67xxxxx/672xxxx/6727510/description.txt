The Fabulous Oldies - Hits of the 40s 50s (8CDSet) (musicfromrizzo) 192k mp3

Here are more great oldies from original artists mainly - of the forties
and fifties for you! Enjoy this great music from a time when we
had a better sense of what to live for - real and true - old fashioned
care for one and all - in the family, and rightly so indeed!
