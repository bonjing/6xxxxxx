At the time of writing,a userâ€™s account was deleted as recently as 17 hours ago,so it seems that you can request admins to delete your Pirate Bay account by posting at Supr Bay.Go to this forum and post a new thread with the topic''Please delete my TPB account'' or something similar.However,if you are too late, this may not help,the site sale was announced today morning(June 30),so you may not be able to delete your account.

If you have something against TPB just don't come here anymore, It's that simple!! I do hope you change your mind though because it is pretty sad when a fellow pirate lowers his flag and sinks his own ship!!"
