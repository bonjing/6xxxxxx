,Sony7,2011-10-10T03:46Z,WTF? sound is OK!!! I've got 5.1 channel speakers.. on Sound Blaster Audigy 4  and it works just fine!! you all gor problems with your computers! 
,maitresaman,2011-10-10T19:46Z,"For those who complain about audio, why don't you tell the rest how you are playing the movie. Might be an issue with you. Try using KMplayer and see if the audio plays. If it does, then STFU."
,lordquad,2011-10-10T22:04Z,"The audio is god damn awful, PERIOD! If you cannot hear that then either you must be playing it on shitty hardware or be in urgent need for an appointment with an audiologist!

We are playing it on MPlayer Classic HC/K-Lite, mplayer, VLC, it doesn't matter because there's nothiong wrong with the software as we have enough experience with playing movies to tell the difference between a movie with bad audio from a good one!"
,Vroem,2011-10-12T10:34Z,"This movie contains a stereo and a 5.1 track.
If you are hearing distorted audio, it may be because your software plays both streams together. 
Please RTM on how to disable one of the two streams, it's included in the torrent."
,Leonidas123,2011-10-26T06:51Z,"Confirmed, Sound is not good. Video is OK, but not great. Its watchable. You can wait for a better release."
