			Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Living Scriptures Inc., the same company that produced the cherished Book of 
Mormon and Old / New Testament animated videos, also created this live-actor 
series recreating moments in the lives of each of the presidents of the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  14 presidents' lives are recounted, from
the church's founder, Joseph Smith Jr., up to Howard W. Hunter.   

From the website:
"Using live actors and actual footage, your family will enjoy learning about 
each prophet and see the character traits that made them men of God. Youâ€™ll 
also see the actual places they lived and taught, and your testimony will be 
strengthened as you watch the church progress throughout the years."  

These video files were ripped from the individual 14 DVD discs.  Bonus features
are not included, however, I ripped both English and Spanish subtitles from 
7 of them.  They are in Xvid, avi container packaging, so they are not too 
resource-intensive.

In providing this series as a torrent, I strongly recommend that if you enjoy 
the series, that you purchase at least a few of the DVDs (or the entire 
series) from Living Scriptures Inc. to support them.
