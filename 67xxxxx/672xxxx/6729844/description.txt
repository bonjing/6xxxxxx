Itâ€™s 1971 and artistic duo, Paul and Limpe Fuchs, aka Anima-Sound, set off with their two kids on a European tour â€“ at 20mph in a tractor-drawn mobile home. With an improvised set-up comprising drums, wind instruments and electronics they play brachial free Jazz/ Noise improvs at everyday venues badly in need of some culture â€¦ such as pedestrian zones in Munich, in front of a miners audience in the Ruhr District, or in the countryside under the stars. This film is a rare and haunting document of some of Krautrock's outstanding pioneers.

This is not an .avi - it is a folder containing the VTS files etc. Subtitles are an optional track that can be clicked on and off with remote control.

This is also the first time I have uploaded anything so i apologize for any glitches.
