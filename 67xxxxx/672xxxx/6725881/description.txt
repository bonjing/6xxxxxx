This was a CD put out by the late Ofra Haza, a superstar on the Israeli
music scene years ago. She died unfortunately young of aids.

Born in Yemen, she developed an affinity for Arabic music with
a Jewish flavour of kinship.


The song Galbi on this CD was by the way on the top of some radio
charts in local New York along the way as it has appeal for many from
midseatern cultural backgrounds broadly speaking.

In 1987 "Galbi" was remixed, then in The Netherlands by the Dutch DJ
Peter Vriends and re-issued as a 12" single on the minor label Street Heat
with the subtitle The Dutch Remix, also including the 1984 Israeli Played
Out remix.

The latest official remix of "Galbi" was included on the 2008 album Forever
Ofra Haza - Her Greatest Songs Remixed, then remixed and re-produced by German production team Ferris Bueller and Kai Panschow, issued on the Edel Records
label.

The sounds on this CD are uniquely Eastern broadly speaking (especially
the pronounced use of the tambla/tabla) which is also popular in Indian
and Pakistan music too.

As such it is a bit hard on the palette for Europeans to enjoy, as
such it is here for those who are of Mideastern descent or cultural affnity
or curiosity. I hope you find it an interesting CD to listen to once
all the way through in any event. I can handle it just fine myself
once in a while - over the years.
