,sikais1,2011-10-12T07:25Z,on what disk shoul i burn this game? the same as alwys(DVD+RDL) or other disk.
,SimStim,2011-10-12T10:15Z,"@sikais1

Burn on regular DVD-DL, as explained in the link I posted earlier

@everyone with speed issues

I'm not seeding this personally, I only posted the torrent information. I started re-downloading it, and after 5 minutes I can see 5 full seeds (100 %), one in the 90s and many more in the 80s and 70s, so it's a perfectly healthy torrent. Download speed after 5 minutes is 200+ KB / sec. If you get less, maybe your ISP is throttling you or you're connecting to the wrong peers. Good luck!"
,mrnexus,2011-10-12T15:26Z,"@simstim i must be connecting to the wrong peers because not once have a seen or been connected to a seeder in u-torrent it says 0 of 6 connected(2 in swarm)in the general tab of u-torrent, i do know my isp throttles me but they dont from 12am until 2pm daily ive been using torrents for a while now so i know the times when they throttle the p2p traffic etc, DO u know a way simstim that i can get connected to the seeders here as iam stuck on 86.8%,and would you know anyway that i can get around my isp throttleing me by connecting with u-torrent to TPB without them knowing what site/traffic iam downloading etc,by the way thks m8 for the download and ur reply."
,milan4884,2011-10-12T19:00Z,This is someting like follout?
,SimStim,2011-10-12T19:40Z,"@milan4884

If you want to compare it to something, then probably Borderlands...

@mrnexus

TPB doesn't have an own tracker for a while already, so it all depends on what peers you get through PEX (peer exchange) and / or DHT (decentralised network). Maybe you can set DHT to another port, sometimes it helps. But there's really so many factors, from ISP to router to OS to torrent client and its settings...anyone except you could only guess."
,spamflap,2011-10-12T19:47Z,Hi mate is this a 0800 Rip? Thanks
,SimStim,2011-10-12T19:53Z,"This the an official SRT release, and I'm almost through playing it =) There have been many bad comments about Rage as a game, it is in fact not ground-breaking, but it's still fun, good graphics, great level-design, I like it."
,spamflap,2011-10-12T20:33Z,Okay thanks :) Is it live safe?
,wishmasteruk,2011-10-13T12:33Z,live is never 100% safe
,cinogen,2011-10-26T23:30Z,"What is going on with last xbox games? no seeds on almost any of them...
