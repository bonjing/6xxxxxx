This is the link http://www.itechtalk.com/thread20546.html

PS: I havnt tried this mapped controller yet. I downloaded this torrent couple of days ago, followed the instructions and everything worked perfectly for me. Keyboard controls are a bit of a pain in the neck for me so hence the PS3 controller. Have ordered one and its due in the next couple of days. So once I get it I will try it then."
