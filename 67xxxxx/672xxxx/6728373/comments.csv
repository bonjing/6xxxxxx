I was lucky to get the 32GB for $117 from Amazon during the firesale.

Thanks for the upload!"
,MxChris,2011-10-10T01:51Z,"I'd suggest downloading this torrent from Demonoid, where it's highly seeded AND WHERE I CREATED AND POSTED IT ORIGINALLY.

Douchebag."
,LukeScooto,2011-10-14T06:51Z,"Sure ya did, double douchebag."
,MxChris,2011-10-15T02:48Z,"Check the dates both torrents were posted, and then go fuck yourself. ;)"
,goblue13,2011-10-16T18:20Z,Someone seed this for 10 minutes! I'm stuck at 99.8% with one piece missing and I've been at that for over a week! My share ratio's at 6.6 and I want to finally be able to show as a seeder.
,BCSC,2011-10-18T01:51Z,"LukeScooto you sir are the Triple Douchebag! He did post to demonoid. Here's your proof: I imagine you're too much of a leech pesant to have an account there so here's the info.  Mad prop MxChris

HP Touchpad 100+ Apps and Games

,rp3,2011-10-22T21:54Z,Would be nice if someone could seed to 100%.  Since Demonoid is closed it makes it hard for anyone to get this stuff unless it's seeded here.  Any help please?
,cyfunk,2011-10-26T00:48Z,"Thanks for not archiving it, seriously. Just needed a single ipk

rp3: it's open all the time

BCSC: leech peasant? You realize demonoid has no ratio requirements right? 

What's wrong with you people? Passing something off as your own is weird but having a problem with it is worse. It's p2p for the love of god. You should want other people to move it around for you. Quit being selfish with things that are not your own"
,cgigate,2011-11-01T04:16Z,"NO any seeder!
Sighs!"
