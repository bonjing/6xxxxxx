    Jean Preston leads a party to India to investigate the disappearance     
    of her fiance, Greg Jones, but someone manages to thwart their           
    efforts through lies and murder. They pursue the trail to Africa         
    where guide Gary Lambert and his comic cook Gabby guide them into        
    unknown territory. Greg is found living with Zita, a jealous and         
    beautiful Amazon queen. The mysterious deaths continue as Lambert        
    tries to discover who has been dealing in contraband ivory. When he      
    solves that mystery, he also uncovers the identity of the mysterious     
    murderer.
