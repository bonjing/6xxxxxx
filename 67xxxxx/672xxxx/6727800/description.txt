An audacious hidden camera series with Chris Hollins. An acting rogue tradesman tries to rip people off in their own homes using well-known con tricks to show us all how easy it can be to be taken in. A Hampshire businessman sets up his wife Tina on her birthday for a visit from our bogus gas man. Some present! Roger fakes a pressure drop in their central heating system and tries to charge a fortune to fix it. Meanwhile a taxi driver sets up his girlfriend Tamsin, and tells her their fuse box is 'fizzing'. Roger claims that it is leaking power into the ground, so will she pay the extortionate sum he demands for a special energy conserving gadget? Also, a Cheshire woman explains how her mother was repeatedly targeted by ruthless tradesmen who took advantage of the elderly consumer's failing memory and conned her out of 6,300 pounds.
