,Marocian_stallion,2011-10-08T10:45Z,"little situation here , 
ABGX360 does not recognize this iso file . 
what should we do now to check ??? 
xgd3 games are all not checkable "
,joolet88,2011-10-08T20:19Z,"We have to wait for a abgx update. Burn it and avoid going online. No multiplayer so far for the xgd3. 

And BTW SEED after you have finshed!!! 0 Seedes! let us other have it!"
