Enjoy =)

Her passion for music began at age 12, with a 7 year stint singing as a backup vocalist with a local Ottawa band. She devoted virtually all her spare time practicing the many different choreographs, along with aerobic training to ensure she was in top shape for her live performances of non-stop singing and dancing. Even at that young age, Emjay was willing to work hard and do what it took to attain her dream; to one day become a lead singer. The effort was well recognized; the band won 8 American Guild Awards. Still with the band in 1993, Emjay won first place as Pop Solo Artist at the American Guild Awards.
