,Pawan1993,2011-10-06T04:10Z,I agree but at least it's not a fake.
,euphoria4949,2011-10-06T05:45Z,"God damn it people just shut up whining and bitching about RARs, they take less than 10 seconds to extract! If it takes you more than a few seconds well then that's your fault for having a cheap shitty PC.
Just be bloody grateful and say thank you!!

Thanks sceneline top quality as always :)"
,euphoria4949,2011-10-06T05:48Z,Oh and by the way there is a damn good reason why people upload in RARs and its done for your benefit! You would know that if you had a fricking glue what you was moaning about!
,babydollsuckerpunch,2011-10-06T09:29Z,thank you!! your awsome sceneline!! i dont mind RARS at all :)
,jhansonTPB,2011-10-06T18:29Z,"The problem with .rars is people have to extract it to view it, which means they immediately delete the .rar version and stop seeded. Scenetards need to pull their heads out of their asses and take 10sec to unrar before uploading."
,jedigon,2011-10-11T05:51Z,seed please!
