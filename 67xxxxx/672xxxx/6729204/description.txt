Hey guys sorry for the removal of the original torrent :( there were a shit load of bugs and mess ups reported! I check the game and turns out I completely forgot to edit a portion of the game on multiplayer! Thankfully I fixed everything and added a special update :D Enjoy!

The special update added a map me and my friend have been working on! Its called 
\\\\\\\"Dead Dirt\\\\\\\"
Basically there is literally like 10 10x10 feet panes of land on this map, place at the ends. Everything else is completely water. So jets, Boats, Waters, and WAR!!! 
Hope you guys ENJOY!

trololololololololololol! :P

Oh yah, i changed the name cause \"Battlefield 2: Evolution of War\" sounded too long!
