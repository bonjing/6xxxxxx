The quality of a few of these PDFs is poor. Damaged scans right from the bound books, not proper digitals. Still, they're OCR'd, so at least they're usable.

This torrent needs better copies of the Adventurer's Vault 2, Arcane Power, Bloodsand Arena, Dark Sun - Marauders of the Dune Sea, Dark Sun Campaign Setting, Dark Sun Creature Catalog, Death's Reach, Demonicon, Divine Power, Draconomicon Metallic Dragons, Dungeon Master's Guide 2, Dungeon Master's Screen, Eberron Campaign Guide, Eberron Players Guide, Eberron Seekers of the Ashen Crown, Hammerfast, Heroes of Shadow, Heroes of the Fallen Lands, Heroes of The Forgotten Kingdoms, Martial Power 2, Monster Manual 2 and 3, both Monster Vaults, Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium, Neverwinter Campaign Setting, Orcs of Stonefang Pass, Player's Handbook 3, Player's Handbook Races - Dragonborn, Player's Handbook Races - Tieflings, Player's Strategy Guide, Primal Power, Prince of Undeath, Psionic Power, Revenge of the Giants, the Rules Compendium, the Starter Set, The Plane Above - Secrets of the Astral Sea, The Plane Below - Secrets of the Elemental Chaos, The Shadowfell - Gloomwrought And Beyond, The Slaying Stone, The Underdark, Tomb of Horrors, Vor Rukoth, and both Dragon Magazine Annual releases.

Also looks like you have a printer edition of the Player Handbook (complete with cutter marks). Bravo~! If you'd like the standard digital edition (same great quality, but without the cutter marks or printer guides), I can provide that.

Also, if anyone knows where to get or has a copy of the fonts used in the proper digital files ""DnDLolthSC"", ""DnDVecnaSC"", ""Draconic"", ""GamePiLTStd-DiceDominoes"", ""Mentor Sans"", ""Mentor Std"", or any of the other unique fonts, please do tell!"
,kenjimaro,2011-10-13T09:20Z,"- Scratch that on the fonts, I got 'em."
,psichoticpanda,2011-10-14T00:43Z,"Thanks for the feedback, like i said i did'nt look through most of them, i will get working on some better copies and i will re-upload this."
,karossii,2011-11-11T22:58Z,Any chance anyone has heroes of the feywild available...?
,Jeddicus,2012-01-23T14:03Z,Has any of the poor quality stuff been updated yet? just curious...
,Jeddicus,2012-01-23T14:03Z,"Also, thanks for this, and I will seed for a bit."
,Gauntes,2012-01-24T00:28Z,"WOTC stopped releasing the PDF versions of their books after they noticed pirating
...
Actually I think the reason they stopped updating their character builder was for the same reason

I am glad that some people bothered to scan them at all"
,unicornographer,2012-03-27T06:28Z,"Thanks for the download, will seed =]"
,Ornlu_Wolfjarl,2012-04-03T05:52Z,"Hey man, thx a lot for the torrent, will seed now, until i need to format the pc again :)

also some pdf's not in best quality but it's still readable so I don't mind, especially since they had to be scanned after WOTC stopped publishing their books in high-quality PDF to avoid piracy."
