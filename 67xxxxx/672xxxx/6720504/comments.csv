,necro-noxxx,2011-10-06T01:08Z,"ok guys  i will help with performance  issues and eliminating most of the texture pop ups..add these to your default config found in your rage/base folder..  ill explain as i type them..

this helped a bit with texture streaming pop ups

seta vt_pageimagesizeuniquediffuseonly2 ""16384""
seta vt_pageimagesizeuniquediffuseonly ""16384""
seta vt_pageimagesizeunique ""16384""
seta vt_pageimagesizevmtr ""16384

add those above  for cards with 2gigs of mem only--- 512 to 1.5 add these bellow

seta vt_pageimagesizeuniquediffuseonly2 ""8192""
seta vt_pageimagesizeuniquediffuseonly ""8192""
seta vt_pageimagesizeunique ""8192""
seta vt_pageimagesizevmtr ""8192""

adding these other cvar  helped make the above run smooth and perform better


seta vt_maxPPF ""16""

the above is for higher end newer cards--below is for lower end older cards

seta vt_maxPPF ""8""

ok now these steps will add performance improvement --create a folder called  id software  in c:/users/your user name/appdata/local  then in that folder create a folder called rage  
so u should have this line when your done c:/users/your user name/appdata/local/id software/rage

in windows 7 if u dont know how to find your appdata folder  type %appdata% in search bar in start menu ..anyways what that does is create cache files the game needs  that somehow dont get created when installig or runnin the game ..ull notice after u run the game after that there will be 2 new files in the folder u created..

finally i will give u some usefulll cvar u can  test   though only one i use from here is the  add console command.

seta cvaradd g_fov ""add number 80 or lower here ""
seta com_allowconsole 1
seta cg_usecompression 0
seta cg_useprecompressedtextures 0
seta com_skipIntroVideo 1
seta image_anisotropy 16

seat maxcachememoryMB 1024
seat ik_enablesmoothing 0
seta mem_phymemblocksizem 3072
seta m_smooth 0  
seta m_rawinput 1

back up your default config before u edit it  just to be safe and gl..  this worked for me gettin over 60 fps and almost no texture pop ups  on a 9800gtx and amd dual core 3.0  also using 8x aa  forcing tripple buffering and vsynch through the card settings...i am also using the beta drivers for bf3..if you have an ati card dl the new drivers and hotfix  rushed out to help with    issues related to rage."

,Cocobagginz,2011-10-06T05:16Z,"Okay so im sensing the hostility before i ask the question, but am in no way a newb in torrents. I made sure that this was the torrent i downloaded, but am trembling with anxiety about this password issue.. I gave out my email and some fake addresses to both of the links that were supposed to provide me with the correct password to unlock the skidrow crack, keygen, and edited steam files. Problem is both the passwords were different 0.o and neither worked! I would sure hate to download this large ass game all over again when i only need a keygen or activation-bypass. So yes, if someone can address this (or already has) let your sincere and humble peers in your online community know whats good. -Cocobagginz"

Come on people, .torrent files aren't a hard concept. 

This torrent was uploaded 2 days ago. There are 1854 seeders, so there is NO lack of seeders whatsoever, and more is coming all the time, as there's over 27000 leechers. 

So, if you setup your torrent software to allow thousands of connections, you can download the torrent simultaneously from over 28000+ people (As the leechers are uploading as they download)

So please just shut the fuck up, thanks :)

You need Deamon Tools or PowerISO. Use that to mount the images.
That is ""sr-rage1"". 
DONT open DVD1 or DVD2.

The game does not ask for a serial during setup. If it does then maybe THIS is not the torrent you downloaded or you just did something wrong. 
Just mount ""sr-rage1"", if youÂ´re not prompted with a ""Autorun"" then open ""My Computer"", open the disk and click ""setup""

When install is done YOU HAVE TO CRACK IT. If you donÂ´t crack it the game will just ask you for a activation of sorts or tell you that you need a disk.

The crack is on ""sr-rage3"". Open the disk and then open the SKIDROW folder. The crack is there!
Then copy all the files in the SKIDROW folder and paste it in the game directory.

C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda Softworks\Rage

that is becours the company's profiding your internet has put a cap on it so people like us cant download it fast
but wait a few years and more and more people wil have fiber glas here in the netherlands almost every home is connected to it already and 2years a go almost non had it

HOPE THIS CLEAR THAT OP AND MAYBE SOME WILL YEL AT THE INTERNET PROFIDERS INSTED OF SPAMING ""SEED, YOU F***"" TO THE OTHER TORRENT USERS"

Just like someone else mentioned.  I have cable internet too and get about 1.5-2MBs but only can upload for some reason at 100kb max.  At 100kb it slows down everything I don't know why.

So I try but sorry I can't share as much as other can.  I try to seed more overnight if I can.

I am installing right now.  It has unpacked at around 35gb.  I can't wait to play this.  THe crack is in the 3rd disk so someone you are retarded wondering if you need a keygen.

I really want to buy this soo bad.  For others with ATI cards there is a hot patch.  I am not sure if you have to uninstall you current drivers or not.... I have the bf3 hot patch installed at the moment.  It is supposed to fix the texture and loading issues.

,sherriff89,2011-10-07T23:00Z,"So.. I have the same problem as most of these people, It crashes soon as I open my rage.exe I have a ATI radeon 5450, so I most likely need the rage performance driver update. I tried to install it twice, (going through the to the 5xxx series, and choosing my win7 x64) and both time I have gotten a blue screen when it goes to analyze. Any suggestions..? :S I was debating asking their customer support, but I dont wanna explain that I just downloaded Rage and im trying to get it to work.. lol"
,thedeathlessprince,2011-10-07T23:01Z,"The graphics aren't that great... especially for a modern game.

It is as I feared, another shithouse console port... it's like they ripped out bits from Fallout 3 (which was pretty bad itself) and Borderlands, mashed it together without any kind of decent story and didn't even bother to bridge the gap between console and pc...

I have been playing for half an hour, I still see no point to the game and I'm absolutely bored.

You'd think that in the seven years they've supposed to have been working on this they could put in a little button to turn toggle crouching on and off... or assign a key for grenades instead of a 'quick use item' system.

...I was actually looking forward to this game you know? I guess having any kind of expectations is a no no... especially when EA gets their grubby little hands on something."

All in all, the game refuses to start, using the command line ""Delfs1970"" provided gets the game running but then it crashes as soon as I start a new game. 

I am not sure what the problem is, but I am going to try the BTARENA.org torrent instead, as such I am discontinuing seeding this. I am not calling this torrent fake I trust extremezone, but if I did do everything right, and I generally do, then something is wrong with the torrent.  "

""We do not see the PC as the leading platform for games,"" Carmack added. ""That statement will enrage some people, but it is hard to characterize it otherwise; both console versions will have larger audiences than the PC version. A high end PC is nearly 10 times as powerful as a console, and we could unquestionably provide a better experience if we chose that as our design point and we were able to expend the same amount of resources on it. Nowadays most of the quality of a game comes from the development effort put into it, not the technology it runs on. A game built with a tenth the resources on a platform 10 times as powerful would be an inferior product in almost all cases.""

I believe I've found out how to correct this problem...


First for the record I've have tested just about every fix I've found on these comments 

in this torrent and the BTARENA.org torrent and for my system up to date I've only 

experienced a crash or start, or crash on start of new game. Giving this, it is my 

opinion from the testing that wheather you use extremezone's torrent or AiTB's torrent 

this SHOULD work. I am not promising miricles, it is obvious that ID seriously messed up 

the port for this game, and this may not work on every system, but it did work on mine. 

For those wanting to know, my system exceeds the reccomended specs for this game:

AMD Phoenom 2 955 black edition (3.2Ghz quadcore liquid-cooled)
running on MSI 790FX-GD70 mobo
with 8GB Vengence DDR3 RAM 
and Powercolor ATI HD6950 OCed to 880/1375 
running the game on a SATA2 SSD. 


edit: some of the steps I provide may seem worded for idiots, I am not implying that 

anyone here is an idiot, simply trying to help everyone who is having trouble with these 

rediciolus bugs in this game. So no offense. 



Steps to follow:

1) DL torrent and install game (kinda an idiot step, but better STS)

2) follow SKIDROW's instructions and copy everything from the ""SKIDROW"" folder on DISC3 

to your install directory of RAGE. 

3) if you use ATI proceed to step 2a), if you use NVIDIA procceed to step 2b)

3a) I have tested the following drivers 10.8, 11.9, 11.9 rage proformance edition, and 

the new preview driver 11.10...Of these drivers all worked expect for the new preview 

driver, HOWEVER the ""11.9 rage proformance"" driver worked the best for me. remeber for 

safty sake to unistall your old driver and THEN install the new one and THEN reboot the 

system...Also it has been noted by serval people including myself that the only way to 

get rid of the ""video tearing"" is to force on Vsync in the CCC panel. With it on I am 

still getting a very playable 60FPS on my 32"" HDTV 1080rez. 

3b) if you've read everything so far, you know already that I don't own an NVIDIA card, 

so Idk what driver exactly for you to use, however I have read that there is a similar 

new driver that was released for RAGE for NVIDIA users, and that they work, but they 

still have to ""force on"" Vsync or else there is video tearing. 

4) goto your RAGE install directory and in the ""BASE"" folder delete the ""video"" folder, 

sadly this removes sevral videos, but I don't think gameplay is affected. 

Most users files will be located:

C:\program files (x86)\rage\base\

or 

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\rage\base




After following those 4 steps the game SHOULD work, however if it doesn't never fear 

there are MORE FIXES





5) On page 20 of the comments for the ""skidrow-extremezone"" torrent 

(http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6720504/Rage-SKIDROW) there are fixes provided by 2 

users: Delfs1970 and Nname1. 
They derserve all credit if these fixes help you, the following is just a copy of what 

they posted, along with some notes of my own. 
FOR THE RECORD: I did use both of these fixes, I CANNOT confirm if my fix (deleting the 

video folder) will work without Nname1's fix, if someone would confirm or deney this I 

would appreciate it. I did not test this because I finnally got this game to work and I 

am not screwing with it. 



Nname1 posted:

- I used his fixes but not the AMD driver he provided, again I used my own copy of the 

""AMD-RAGE proformance 11.9"" driver I DLed from AMD website. 

- Also I found two sets of instructions for how to install his fix; I don't know if it 

matters but these are the steps I followed.

N1) USE winrar, I don't care what version just use it, its better. I used 4.00 64bit

N2) extract ""RAGE.leak.patch"" rar"

N5) run the Crashfix.exe and follow setup instructions (I personally scaned the torrent and the files before using them, using Avira Security Suite, there are no viruses unlike what some idiot posted on the website belonging to this torrent.

hopefully that will work...if it doesn't, here's what Delfs1970's posted

What I needed is this in the Rage.exe command line -> ""+cvaradd g_fov 20 +set com_skipIntroVideo 1 +set com_allowConsole 1 +fc_maxcachememoryMB 1024 +ik_enablesmoothing 0 +image_usecompression 0 +jobs_numthreads 4 +mem_phymemblocksizem 512 m_smooth 0"" (REMOVE THE QUOTES!!) - Believe it or not this stopped the crashing at the loading screens between different scenes/levels. Next I have this Rage Config file (If you don't know what this is go to Google and find out).

Again after a lot of trail and error this works great, looks really good, and plays well. Fun game and worth while WHEN you get it working right. My specs may NOT be the same as yours so adjust to what is need by your specs. Hopefully, this helps someone.""""


- I personally did everything stated here with the exception I changed the command line to fit my specs and system better, also if you want achievements you cannot enable the console.

- heres what I changed:

+set com_allowConsole 0 (was 1) (changed so I could get achievements)
+fc_maxcachememoryMB 2048 (was 1024) (just a guess but I am hoping for better proformance +mem_phymemblocksizem 1024 (was 512) (again...proformance)
+ik_enablesmoothing 1 (was 0) (pro..form...ance)
m_smooth 1 (was 0) (hell if I know, just a test, call it scientific curiousity)

so my command line looked like this when I was finished, it did work...

+cvaradd g_fov 20 +set com_skipIntroVideo 1 +set com_allowConsole 0 +fc_maxcachememoryMB 2048 +ik_enablesmoothing 1 +image_usecompression 0 +jobs_numthreads 4 +mem_phymemblocksizem 1024 m_smooth 1




to make a Rageconfig.cfg file I did this:

D1) goto your Rage directory and in the BASe folder copy any .cfg file present and paste in same directory, I copied the vehicle_4.cfg and ended up with ""vehicle_4-copy.cfg""

D2) rename new file to ""rageconfig.cfg""

D3) open new file using ""open with"" command and use Wordpad, make sure the ""always use this program is NOT checked. 

D4) delete all data in the wordpad, copy in all the configs listed above into word pad, they all start with ""seta"". Save file, and close. "

NOW the game SHOULD work, remeber I didn't promise, just that my game now works after all these steps. 

I have written them down in hope that it will help someone, please let me know if it did, or post any questions, I will be posting this long comment on both torrents, and checking on them periodically over the next few days. 

In closing:

- I am now seeding both torrents because I believe either will work (eventually) at a ratio of 2:1 (thats 72GBs I am going to be uploading), I know DL rates are slow due to leechers, please be patient. 

- credit goes to Nname 1 and Delfs1970 for there fixes

- Extreme credit goes to all of SKIDROW, including extremezone and AiTB for another great release, thank-you for making it possible for us to solve bugs without having wasted $59.99 first.

- Please do support the devolpers as they DO deserve your support, I am sure someday they will learn how to beta test properly, or at least make a good port. it the mean time we need ot support them so they can continue to make great games. 

- last but not least, if you have read all of this, credit goes to you for doing so :)

-please if there are any MAJOR or minor mistakes I have made, including spelling or a directory link, please help me to fix them, and don't flame this post. I wrote all this to help everyone, and if you don't like my ideas, ect...go do your own thing leave the rest of us who want to fix this game, and play it, alone.  "

You frame rate might not be the highest but if you have a RADEON 4850 like me you will be able to play. You can try adjusting some of the amd vision settings to get a better frame rate there is a lot you can do but if your getting 20fps or more its probably not worth trying to get more.
,druhklam_orbowetsch,2011-10-08T22:34Z,"So... I've finished the game. Well, it is indeed too small for 18GB installation. I finished it in ""hard"" difficulty quite fast, less than 15 hours all side quests done, not all races however. I have to say that despite the graphic issues already addressed, the game installs and runs flawlessly. Indeed, in the start looks dull and boring, first missions are boring as fuck, yes it is a linear game which SUCKS big time, but after a while and when things is getting hot and the real action starts, it becomes quite enjoyable and packed with shooting action. Beautiful world (again having in mind the graphic issues), reminded me that of Borderlines, and there's even a setting (google for how-to) to unlock high-res textures (1.5GB ram graphic card needed).  As a FPS isn't exactly a... prototype (and blah blah blah), nothing innovating as usual, but again, what else except action you could ever asked from a FPS game? The absence of the linear mission structure could have boosted the game to sky, as well as some RPG elements (stats etc). In conclusion Rage is a very nice piece of software for what it is. Many thanx extremezone!!!"

,Xe1887,2011-10-09T03:32Z,"RAGE Patch Release Notes - October 8th 2011
-------------------------------------------

RAGE defaults to lower video settings to allow the game to work on a
wide variety of hardware and software configurations.
Unfortunately, it is not possible to anticipate all possible graphics
driver issues in combination with unique end user hardware and software
configurations. For this reason RAGE does not automatically increase
video/graphics settings as this could result in negative side effects
on specific hardware and software configurations. The original release
of RAGE does not expose many video/graphics options for people to tweak
because some of these settings, although desirable from a quality
perspective, simply will not work on specific configurations either due
to hardware limitations and/or driver bugs. Due to popular demand for
more video and graphics options, this patch updates the video settings
menu and exposes several quality and performance settings. However, not
everyone may be able to increase the settings due to hardware limitations
and/or driver bugs.

VSync
-----

The new ""VSync"" option in the video settings menu allows you to remove
screen tearing. There are three options: ON, OFF and SMART.

When VSync is turned OFF you may experience screen tearing.

When VSync is turned ON you should not see screen tearing. However,
any time your frame rate drops below 60 frames per second you will
get a sudden more severe drop to 30 frames per second. This is how VSync
inherently works. If your computer cannot maintain 60 frames per
second and you miss the synchronization to the vertical retrace of
your monitor then you will miss a whole frame and synchronize to
the next frame instead.

Some graphics drivers now support a so called ""swap-tear"" extension.
You can try using this extension by setting VSync to SMART.
If your graphics driver supports this extension and you set VSync
to SMART then RAGE will synchronize to the vertical retrace of
your monitor when your computer is able to maintain 60 frames per
second and the screen may tear if your frame rate drops below 60 frames
per second. In other words the SMART VSync option trades a sudden drop
to 30 frames per second with occasional screen tearing. Occasional
screen tearing is usually considered less distracting than a more
severe drop in frame rate.

If your graphics driver does not support SMART VSync and you set VSync
to SMART in the video settings then RAGE will automatically fall back to
turning VSync OFF and you may experience screen tearing. The ""swap-tear""
extension is brand new and may still present some issues on certain
graphics hardware. If you experience any problems using SMART Vsync
then set VSync to either ON or OFF. We are actively working with the
graphics hardware vendors to improve the ""swap-tear"" extension.

If changing VSync in the RAGE video settings menu does not appear to
make any difference then make sure you are not overriding the VSync
setting in the graphics vendor control panel. You can find the
graphics vendor control panel by right-clicking on the Windows desktop
and selecting the "" control panel"" option from the pop-up menu.

If you force VSync to the 'on' setting in the graphics vendor control
panel then you should not see any screen tearing in RAGE but you may
get a more severe drop in frame rate if your computer cannot maintain
60 frames per second.

If you force VSync to the 'off' setting in the graphics vendor control
panel then you may experience screen tearing no matter what setting you
use for the VSync option in the RAGE video settings menu.

Texture Cache
-------------

The new ""Texture Cache"" option in the video settings menu allows you
to increase the texture cache size to keep more texture data in
video memory.

If the Texture Cache is set to LARGE then RAGE will keep more texture
data in video memory. This may not only significantly reduce blurry
textures and texture popping, it will also allow complex scenes to be
rendered with more texture detail.

However, this may not work on computers that do not hav"

Now this is my config (I am playing RAGE just on a laptop):

Operating System: Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit (6.1, Build 7601) Service Pack 1
Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2410M CPU @ 2.30GHz (4 CPUs), ~2.3GHz
Memory: 8192MB RAM
Graphics card: NVIDIA GeForce GT 525M
VRAM: 1 MB
Driver: 285.38 beta

I am running RAGE in 1366x768 resolution, with 4X Antialising and with GPU Transcoding enabled. I use the following command to start the game (in admin mode):

""C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda Softworks\Rage\Rage.exe"" +cvaradd g_fov 20 +com_allowconsole 1 +com_skipIntroVideo 1 +image_anisotropy 4 +image_usecompression 0 +g_showplayershadow 1 +m_smooth 0

The contents of my rageconfig.cfg file located in ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda Softworks\Rage\base"" are the following:

vt_useCudaTranscode 2
vt_pageimagesizeuniquediffuseonly2 8192
vt_pageimagesizeuniquediffuseonly 8192
vt_pageimagesizeunique 8192
vt_pageimagesizevmtr 8192
vt_restart
vt_maxaniso 4
image_anisotropy 4

........and so IT RUNS PERFECTLY!!!!!!!!!!! ...even when turning around in 180 degrees suddenly (in this case at first I may see for a moment, how the game loads the textures, but that happens only once in a scene, and only if I do this rapid turning around, otherwise it is perfect).

It is a very well made game imo, and those who drastically underrate it (by giving it 0/10 on metacritic, etc) can't be taken seriously. No doubt that on some configs the game may brake, but be patient, there is now a new Patch (Update 1) from SKiDROW... ... ... This game is worth it. Absolutely massive FPS!!!!!!!!!"

,Kingel2097,2011-10-10T04:53Z,"*ALL BOW TO EZ*
Fantastic work m8 working 100% on my system, graphics are stunning!
Guys dont forget to install the RAGE Update 1 torrent from also from EZ.
 This gives you an option to set the texture storage to Large so no more slow loading textures! (Ofcourse only if you got a beasty GFX card 1GB+)
Option to set antistrpoic filtering and most importantly V-Sync! 
Also full compatability with the Nvidia Control Center settings.
Really a perfect rip and a perfect crack.
Running everything as high as it will go @ 60FPS no crashing. no freezing and no lagging.
Follow the instuctions on the NFO File (Open with notepad) or on this screen, Thanks again EZ you da man!

At the end of the day nobody fuken cares and if all else fails buy the game to support the developers."

,Legisy,2011-10-11T14:42Z,"For those who have textures problem and did not helped drivers update, AMD Catalystâ„¢ 11.10 Version 2 Preview Driver update and the rageconfig.cfg trick. I found this video ""/watch?NR=1&v=YsyPn63Q_Yc"" it helped me allot I just did what is written in description:

1.Create a Rage.exe (shortcut), rightclick the shortcut and open the properties. Copy and paste the following launch parameters:

-cvaradd g_fov 12 -com_allowconsole 1 -com_skipIntroVideo 1 -image_anisotropy 16 -image_usecompression 0 -g_showplayershadow 1 -m_smooth 0

For Example: (keep a space after .exe()

D:\Rage\Rage.exe -cvaradd g_fov 12 -com_allowconsole 1 -com_skipIntroVideo 1 -image_anisotropy 16 -image_usecompression 0 -g_showplayershadow 1 -m_smooth 0

2.Create a file called rageconfig.cfg in Rage/base/ and put the following commands in there:
seta image_usecompression ""0""
seta image_anisotropy ""16""
seta vt_pageimagesizeuniquediffuseonly2 ""8192""
seta vt_pageimagesizeuniquediffuseonly ""8192""
seta vt_pageimagesizeunique ""8192""
seta vt_pageimagesizevmtr ""8192""
seta vt_maxppf ""24""
seta vt_maxlockedpages ""256""
seta vt_minlod ""-2""
seta vt_lodBias ""-2""
seta vt_maxaniso ""2""
seta vt_qualityhdplossless ""1""
seta vt_qualityhdppower ""0""
seta vt_qualityhdpspecular ""0""
seta vt_qualityhdpnormal ""0""
seta vt_qualityhdpdiffuse ""0""
seta vt_qualitydctpower ""100""
seta vt_qualitydctspecular ""100""
seta vt_qualitydctnormal ""100""
seta vt_qualitydctchroma ""100""
seta vt_qualitydctluma ""100""
seta vt_restart

3. Go to C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\ and create a folder called ""id software"" (without ""). Then create a folder called ""rage"" (without "") inside that folder.

4. Run game and play."

i installed this before and ran okay but i just upgraded my motherboard and went from 4 gig to 8 gig ram now it's just freezing every second.

Anyone have any clue what im talking about

The Title clearly refers to the ending, all i felt was RAGE. where is the running around aimlessly and collecting stuff ??? all you can do is go to a very few places and do pretty much the same things everytime you get there, and weapons with all kinds of ammo you dont even got a use for, a big ass inventory collection of all sort of engineered goodies which is totally useless. and the worst part WHO THE HELL WANNA PLAY A RACE GAME IN A FPS.. well not me, if i wanted to play race game i would get Need for speed or something..

I am able to get through the intro movie scene no problem w/o the update 1 installed. When the first opportunity to move around comes about there is serious screen tearing, textures magically load up as I look left and right and game stutters crazy.. Then when I first get outside and that first mutant gets shot in head is where it locks up and becomes completely unplayable."

Without this driver, the game would freeze & crash, every time at the beginning when I got on the atv & turned the corner...... I hate games like this, when you got to be a fucking detective to figure out how to make it work.......My computer specs are way above what is  recommended.
Even with this fix, it's barely playable. Lags terribly
They shouldn't have released this game until the got all the bugs out of it, first.
Especially one this big,...You Fucking Dumb-Asses.
I guess i'll have to wait for the next patch, hopefully they'll fix it once & for all."

""PC days are over, we make games for consoles now"", yeah it shows, the gfx is choppy as fuck, doesn't have anything to do with gpu hz or vram. You can use lowest settings, the framerate remains so bad it's almost not playable on a oc'd 5870. And the textures keep loading while you watch them. Turn 180 degrees and back again, and they start loading again. I've played for 10 minutes and I already hate the game. When an enemy comes running towards you, the gfx is so choppy you only really see 4-5 frames rendered before he's up in your face.

Got that solved by updating my amd drivers. Game starts up nice, can set my controls and stuff start the campain. The intro video with the guys getting back to earth but then (when i asume the gameplay is realy starting) it shows a couple of frames stops for about 4 seconds shows a few more frames stops again for a couple of seconds.

Still had extreem freez-up during the game

The trick for me was to alter some settings to my  desktop shortcut. Rightclick the basterd and go to properties-> compatibillity (windows98/ Windows Me) Then select the ""shortcut"" tab and add          +cvaradd jobs_numThreads -1

after the target. 
Keep the directories that are there just add that after it. With a space inbetween.

After looking at a freeze frame more then playing i've just wacked 4 bad guy's without a glitch. 

Just getting started but looks like a pretty cool game and not that hard to get going just have to know how..

Create a desktop shortcut of the Rage.exe file.

Set the shortcut to Windows98/Me compatibility mode.

In the target address bar, add this instruction:

After you're done exit out of shortcut properties and start the game.

I was getting 1 FPS with my 5670 ATI card. Now I get 45-60 FPS with no screen tearing or annoying popups.

If that fails, you'll have to disable Catalyst AI to get playable framerates, but you'll see horrible screen tearing and popups.

im just ganna say it, what a disappointment. shit story, no depth in, well, anything, gay ass driving games, christ id, WTF? 

I do love the graphix and love the fact that ExtremeZone gave it to us all free of charge, but games like this r why i don't buy many PC games any more.

thanx again extremezone. love your work."

thanks man:) but i've allready done that in order to play the game at all. 

i will try to solve this problem and get back to u guys with the answer. 

but for now, may i suggest downloading the amd catalyst 11.10 preview driver or the amd catalyst rage preformance driver, for me these two were the only ones giving me a decent result"

The crack works like any other crack, just copy/paste the needed files and VOILA!!! Extremezone is currently the god amongst gods when it comes to realeasing new games and stuff, he has never let me down, so dont wank him. if your DL does not work when DL from extremezone, GET YOURSELF A BETTER CONNECTION OR A NEW RIG...

This is how to install the crash fix:

browse game directory

2.delete every .dll file and ini files and the rage.exe

3. unrar CrashFix.part1.rar and part 2 and you should get a crash.exe run it and should reinstall those exes and dlls you just deleted [ now the crack is from 3dm ] not skidrow

4.install

amd_catalyst_rage_performance_driver.exe

[ it only works for amd raedons cards of series 5xxx or 6xxx ]

[ go to the nvidia site for the newest update ]

should take like 30 minutes to install

5. now you start the game with has no graphics options and this is a xbox 360 shitty import

you don't need a the crack.rar or RAGE.leak.patch.rar they are only if you have a preloaded version !!

Or your system is VERY old, your Video card is crap, or you don't know how to update your Sound/Video Drivers.  You should try ALL before you blame the FAIL on the upload or the pack.  Because if it works for the OTHER 95% of people then OBVIOUSLY there is something wrong with YOUR system..not the Pack.  Have a good day and keep up the perfect work SKIDROW!"

If you like 'quest grinders' in a linear map, then this game is for you. If you're looking for a rich cinematic epic adventure, then this game really isn't for you.

The Wastelands are gorgeous. Just absolutely gorgeous, but there's nothing in there that really keeps the story moving forward. What I mean by this is if you have played games such as BioWare's games or Metal Gear Solid 4, there are tons of action and story driven cutscenes that really suck you in. As with any game Bethesda is associated with, this is missing from Rage... which is disappointing.

Decent game, but not the masterpiece id Software promised."
,vicecityfreak,2011-10-27T00:15Z,"Torrent worked for me (on AMD drivers and all). Here are the exact steps I followed:

1. Download the Skidrow release (18 gb), install, apply crack, etc.
2. Download the Skidrow update (1 gb), unpack the RAR file (JUST THE RAR FILE, IGNORE THE R1, R2, etc.) install into main game directory
3. Download the AMD driver update: 
http://www2.ati.com/drivers/hotfix/amd_catalyst_rage_performance_driver.exe
4.Update DirectX by going into the ""directx"" folder in the install directory and clicking the .exe file

,StarPhishPrime,2011-11-28T15:55Z,"man this game was 95% talk and 5% substance. It's a shame really, had they actually had an open game world / genuine rpg elements this would have been a hit for sure.

Glad i didnt pay money for this garbage."

,Jan_Vat,2011-11-28T19:58Z,"Yeah, much like many others who have commented, this game is glitchy as hell and I could not get it to run. There is obviously something wrong with the coding in this game because it is not compatible with my system; maybe it's just a catalyst driver issue, I don't know. But once it started to render graphics after the intro video it skipped like hell. Others have also said that the game is very anti-climatic.
So to summarise: you may get problems with this game. It is 18GB in size so I hope you're patient. And it's anti-climatic with no story line.
All in all, skip this and don't download, it's not worth it."

,metalmatt13,2011-12-30T15:16Z,"@Wasp91 How exactly is this ""fake""? You probably don't know how to install a game or even follow instructions if you can't install this.

Every Skidrow game is the same:
2. Mount or burn image
3. Install
4. Copy everything from the SKIDROW folder on DVD 3, to the game
installation
5. Play the game
6. Support the companies, which software you actually enjoy!

@calkhi The crack isn't missing it is on the third disk like it says. Go to computer and then right click the virtual drive and select open. Then you will find the skidrow folder. This is how every skidrow release is."
,metalmatt13,2011-12-30T15:19Z,"Oh and you should probably download this update and install it. Don't forget to apply the crack from the update, because the crack provided in this download is made for this version, since you are updating you need a crack made for that specific version.

,08191980,2012-01-04T03:00Z,"I can't seem to get Rage to run on my machine. I replaced a bad motherboard & decided to reinstall windows from scratch as well. I installed Rage & Update 1 through the usual method (mount images, copy over SKIDROW contents into install dir, etc.) but it doesn't work on my system. 

After I launch Rage, the mouse flickers for a moment then nothing...the screen doesn't do anything, I just sit in Windows. When viewing Task Manager, the Rage executable just flickers into existence for a moment before going away. 

I'm wondering if Rage doesn't like x64 Windows, but couldn't find anything about that just yet. Thoughts?"

,chuckdm,2012-02-09T06:47Z,"Have thhis installed and working great, seriously considering buying it.  The campaign is a fucking blast - my sole complaint is that it's criminally short.  I want more!

That said, I have console cheats working, but according to the internet at large, there's supposed to be a menu option to type in cheats, separate from the console.  I don't have this option.  I wouldn't care, except that I really, really want to see how the game plays when I can use explosive crossbow bolts right from the start.  Instead, they're unlocked halfway through the game.

So...anyone know how to either:
A) Enable the normal GUI cheats instead of (or in addition to) the console?
B) Type in a console command to give me the Crossbow and the Explosive Bolts?

Really want to give this a try.

Oh and to everyone having problems: using XP x64, by far the best platform for a gaming rig.  Downgrade from Win7, update your drivers, and I promise you, 90% of the problems you're having with any current game will disappear.  That, and read the NFO, but you probably already know that.  I hope :P"
