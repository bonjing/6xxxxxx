,Tryst49,2011-10-04T22:59Z,"Can anyone suggest a conversion program to convert to MP3?

Loved the series, read all of them and would love to have these audio books because my old paperbacks have been lost with so many house moves now."

For those who aren't sure how to play these files without iTunes: I don't have itunes, but VLC works."

foobar2000 or dbpoweramp will do the job

Also, if you rename the file extension(s) from .m4b to .m4a the files will play on many mp3 players."
