The More than Complete DC-Now More Completerer!

This thirty-ninth alphabetical installment is: DC from Secret O-Shal

What's This?
     It's a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.
       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those "Pre-DC" comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some "Post DC" comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c.875-885gb in total. It will take as long as it takes. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.

=================================

A lot of Shadows and Secrets and Shades and some War today. They seem to go together in a way. A way that just looks at the titles and not the content. Superficial, like me.

I have decided on the makeup the rest of the torrents - small changes are possible. I plan on 16 more. Most are 13-18gb. The Superman torrent will be around 35-38gb. The big Batman one was popular so I'll do the same with Superman.

Today's offering:  DC from DC from Secret O-Shal

Enjoy!


Since the secret origins comics are not a series, each having their own topic, I decided to list them individually so you can see what's there. I don't know what the big secret is. Why does every one have a "Secret Origin". My origin, for one is not secret. Except from you

Since these were published in years from 1961 to 1999, and history in a  comics universe is not fixed like it is in the s so-called real one they will not be consistent.
Later ones will contradict earlier ones, some of the later ones will contradict post 1999 changes DC did, and with the reboot of the Universe, only what's in the "new 52" issues can be trusted as "true in universe". 

There's probably no way to know if our actual history has been ret-conned by some powerful alien with time travel, or likewise by a human from the future, or just by the action of natural forces we do not understand yet, or even know exist. Don't loose sleep over it. You can't do anything about it or make different choices because of it. So it makes no difference whether it's happening or not.  As Spock said, a difference which makes no difference *is* no difference. But Spock always was a bit of  a smart-ass.. 

Don't get me wrong, I like Spock, Spock was a childhood hero, but it would be hard to convince me that logic dictates you must correct people who state a number to a practical amount of precision by re-stating the figure to more precision than is useful. I'm 90% certain it does not.  Or as Spock would say  89.986579426% certain, to be precise.

I think that would get pretty old after awhile.

You might not be able to figure out what the original title of this was from the abbreviation. It was "Sinister House of Secret Love" for 4 issues. I Just love that title. So deliciously bizarre. Apparently the marketing guys at DC decided it would sell better if they took the love out. Its supposed to be sinister they said-  "what's love got to do, got to do with it. Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken".

You might have heard of the 1996 Steve Martin film about Sergeant Bilko. That was based on the 1955-59 TV series called "The Phil Silvers Show" starring (get ready) the late Phil Silvers, who was a really funny guy. This comic is entirely unrelated, being instead an ahead-of-it's-time look at the stress and general emotional toll of war on the men and women who serve, little understood by the millions at home who have not experienced combat. It deals honestly and realistically with drug and alcohol problems, PSTD (then called "battle fatigue" or "shell shock"), the loneliness and fear that led many into infidelity and the struggles to reconcile that with the sincere love they had for their wives and husbands. It portrays the enemy in a sympathetic fashion, humanizing them, rather than reducing them to faceless, emotionless, evil fiends to be destroyed at any cost,  as the military and civilian leadership frequently would prefer the soldiers and the public to believe them to be. These books are not for the squeamish.They are not for those who prefer not to face the harsh and unpleasant truths about our own history. It may be that war is the only answer sometimes, these comics seem to say, but enter and and see the cost, lest you call for war lightly.

Nah, this is totally about the TV show, just for laughs. Go read some Vertigo (uggh! Â® Â© ) junk if you want some of the above.
