I've yet to see anyone (on any torrent) provide a good reason for doing this.  I've never had a corrupt file from any torrent, nor have I ever seen a complaint about corrupt files...just complaints about rar'd files.  So that can't be it.  I just don't get it.  It takes extra time and effort for you to rar it.  They don't seed as well because people unpack and delete the rar files.  Why keep two copies of the same show.  I guess I'll never understand, because no one has ever seemed to provide an intelligent response about the benefits outweighing the negatives.  Ah well.  I know this is a pretty negative comment...but I do thank you for your uploads.  When there's no unrar'd version of the torrent, I'm forced here and at least I can still get it.  So I thank you for that."

Con's: wasting more time reading your useless comment than it took for me to open this dl
