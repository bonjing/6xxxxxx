[V],psspss,2011-10-07T06:17Z,i have a look in to it.. have to wait for this to seed out first and the web has been playing up or blocking the uploading at times.
,aldog1,2011-10-07T07:09Z,"Thanks psspss - I tried having a go, but the software I was using was a major fail (GetFLV). There must be something decent out there to get the job done!  Currently, no one has capped 'The One' yet, so you'll be the only one out there with it if you do! :)"
[V],psspss,2011-10-07T09:42Z,"i have the S02 E01 now will convert to xvid syandard so works on dvd players and pc etc and share soon now others seeded out

,aldog1,2011-10-07T11:39Z,"Thanks psspss - have obtained tubedigger and it seems to be working and will save the file as a .flv - any software you recommend to make it a high quality XViD?  WinFF seems OK, or something similar?  Cheers again for doing 'The One'.  Your work is appreciated!"
[V],psspss,2011-10-07T14:43Z,"mot save as mp4 (but really are flv format which is mp4 varient) I find the headers often have issues
some wont convert

best free software to convert is AVIDEMUX 2.5

however for these type files I just use the free version of Leawo FLV Converter
and leave  select the xvid mediym settings
seems to convert all FLV varients properly
I have ffdshow installed and check using VLS 1.1.0 player which uses own codecs and fasters PC player about

anyhow Im seeding the file now if what to join in
