OIO is a 3D scrolling platformer. The player controls OIO, a little wooden character, 
who can grow wooden beams by throwing special seeds on fertile grounds. As he wakes 
up in a strange universe made of wood, OIO finds that all his wooden companions are 
petrified. Being left alone in this gigantic place, he will embark for a journey that 
will help him understand what happened to his people. He will retrace the history of 
the wood civilization and how the steel changed everything in the run to more power 
and technology.
