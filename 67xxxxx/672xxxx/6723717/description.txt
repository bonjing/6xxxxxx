Rage is a groundbreaking first-person shooter set in the not-too-distant future after an asteroid impacts Earth, leaving a ravaged world behind. You emerge into this vast wasteland to discover humanity working to rebuild itself against such forces as raider gangs, mutants, and the Authority Ã¢â‚¬â€ an oppressive government regime that has a special interest in you in particular. Featuring intense first-person action, vehicle combat, an expansive world and jaw-dropping graphics powered by idÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s revolutionary idTech 5 technology, Rage continues the legacy of design studio Id Software in delivering an experience like no other.

Key Features:
- Visceral 1st-person gunplay and exploration. Take on bandit gangs and hordes of mutants using an arsenal of exotic weapons and special items, such as wingsticks, personal turrets, sentry bots, and remote-controlled bomb cars.
- Frenetic 3rd-person vehicular mayhem. Burn rubber across the wasteland in your very own super buggy! Upgrade and customize your car with special parts, paint jobs and weapons, then test your skills as you battle four-wheeling bandit clans and participate in deadly races.
- Three ways to play for unlimited action. Immerse yourself in a rich story-driven single-player experience, grab a friend for exclusive co-op modes, or go online for all-out multiplayer mayhem.
- An expansive experience. Beyond the first-person action and vehicle combat, RAGEÃ‚Â® offers a world open to explore, with unique characters, side quests, and a compelling storyline.
- Graphics that have to be seen to be believed. Powered by idÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cutting-edge new id Tech 5 engine, new Megatexture technology brings the vast wasteland to life in never-before- possible detail with action running at up to an astounding 60 frames per second.
