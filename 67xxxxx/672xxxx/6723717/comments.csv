,the5age,2011-10-13T23:53Z,"This ware is working fine without any issues once you get it working. I had issues, first the black screen, then freezing constantly and then, poor performance - BUT everything can be solved - assuming your issues are related to ATI drivers. 

First make a link (shortcut) to your rage.exe file. 

Then paste this in the shortcut properties in the ""Target"" field:

 Rage.exe +cvaradd g_fov 10 +com_allowconsole 1 +com_skipIntroVideo 1 +image_usecompression 0 +g_showplayershadow 1 +m_smooth 0 +image_anisotropy 16 +jobs_numThreads 0

Now, if you still get black screen go to game folder, then /base/video/ and delete - rename or move the .bik files.

Now you should be able to play the game, if you get poor performance - download the optimized Rage AMD driver 10.9 from Guru3D.

After this, my game runs at max settings, high cache and anisotropy + 8xAA in full HD without texture popping - or very little (in big areas). HD6670 1gig + 4Gigs or ddr3 on Athlon 2x2.

It's recommended that you run the updater in the game folder for the latest updates.

NOTE, these AMD drivers will not work with Adobe Ae and Pr."
,lkjubea12,2011-10-13T23:55Z,I just installed the game and I am installing the update will beck back in. SO FAR THX A LOT!
,lkjubea12,2011-10-14T00:05Z,"My game just keeps crashing it says ""Rage has stopped working"", I installed the thing on DVD3, any solutions?"
,nengchang,2011-10-14T03:44Z,@the5age It tells me that the target of the shortcut has invalid characters?

,StealingLife,2011-12-09T16:18Z,"great torrent, took a while to download but SO worth it. the graphics in this game blew me away i cant believe that its animated it looks real, on a nice computer it does anyways :). no clue what all these other comments are talking about with all these problems i just downloaded, opened the file and installed, had 1 error pop up at the end of my installation but it doesnt seem to make the game run any slower and it doesnt seem to hinder anything about it, at all. there are a couple little glitches (im sure these are fixed with updates) with video/audio but hey its torrented, you cant really ask for much better than this. amazing rip zingooo! keep the goodies comin"
