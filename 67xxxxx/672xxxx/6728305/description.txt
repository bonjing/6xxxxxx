Corde Oblique is the project of the Napolitan guitarist-composer Riccardo Prencipe gathering female mediterranean voices and musicians from Ashram, Mediavolo, Hexperos, Argine

Anyone who likes calm, chilled out, folky chords and strong yet subtle vocals will enjoy this immensely. The soothing chords make this a perfect album to stick on whilst working or chilling out, but each song still has some bite, and the soaring crescendos fill me with joy each and every time.
