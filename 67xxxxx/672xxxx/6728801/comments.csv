I think we are witnessing the death throes of the savage nation folks, truly sorry to say it.  It's increasingly obvious he is only here now to sell us this ridiculous ""novel"" he repeated claims with a straight face is the greatest American novel ever written.

It's  a shame none of his staff intervenes, but I imagine they are all sycophants, leeching off the thrashing sea lion they know is dying and have no intention of changing a thing. 

I am not going to remember this Mike, the Mike who allows every third word to be edited, or censored usually when a minority is mentioned with anything less than pure genuflection.  I am going to remember the shouting mad Mike.  The one with the train at the end.  

Thanks for all your uploads over the years bro."

I do in fact pay a yearly subscription so I can get all of his daily programs but I am really considering not renewing when this year is over. I am very sorry to post these shitty ""best of "" shows but unfortunately I don't have time to listen to them before I post. When I do get a chance to see if its actually him or an encore broadcast then I always try to let you guys know about it. ""Encore"" what does that mean anyway? They always just replay snippets from shows that aired only a couple of days prior. I always look forward to the show but I am starting to lose interest fast."
,wonderboylv,2011-10-09T23:22Z,"Of Course he's still a strong independant voice of reason through all the bullshit lately, so some constructive crticism would be better than just sticking it the the guy.
Of course I don't go out of my way to listen to other prominent talk show hosts.  I'll have to give others a listen and post a comparison.
Until then please keep posting Savage's shows, I'll leave a comment after I've given beck, inghram, and limbaugh a listen
"
,Papaoso42,2011-10-10T12:54Z,Beck and Limbaugh are a waste of time but Inghram is pretty good. I wouldn't say we are sticking it too him but I have been listening to him for over five years and the Savage I started listening to is not the same Savage that I hear today. Its just a bit disappointing to me and I am sure many others.
