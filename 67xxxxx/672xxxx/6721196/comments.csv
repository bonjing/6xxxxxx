,bhutan_6,2011-10-06T02:01Z,"Hello, this is regarding one of your old uploaded games Haunted House Wii By Atari. I apologize for posting here. I have downloaded it, and it works fine with Dolphin but I can not get this game to work with USB loader GX or CFG Loader. I have tried burning it on a disc and also tried a PAL version, but same problem. My Wii just restarts itself as soon as I try to run it. Can you please tell me what settings or any specific IOS did you used? Thx. "

As far as I can remember, I used no special settings. I used either waninko's cIOS 249 or 250. Does this work for you?"
,bhutan_6,2011-10-06T15:19Z,"Thx for your reply. I have tried latest Waninkoko Cios 249, 250 and Hermes 222,223 and 224. USB loader GX and CFG loader and different settings on my 3.2j wii. No luck. Black screen and after few seconds my Wii just restarts itself. I have 51 other titles in my hdd and all of them works flawlessly except this one. It's just driving me nuts."

It probably has a lot to do with the fact that you're using 3.2j. I'm sorry, but I have no idea how to get it to work. I would try every cIOS you have as well as options in USB Loader GX such as ""block IOS reload,"" all the various video modes and error 002 fix. If you still can't get it to run, I can't help you."
