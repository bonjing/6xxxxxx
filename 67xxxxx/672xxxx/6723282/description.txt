There are some very good textbooks in Filter Theory and Design so why do we need a new one? We have been active in researching and teaching the field of electronic filters for more than three decades at both undergraduate and postgraduate courses and from our experience the depth and coverage offered by the existing books falls short on several counts. Indeed, most of the existing books concentrate on the active filters alone even though many of the design principles may stem from passive filter theory. Our long experience and involvement in all facets of the subject have enabled us to provide a coherent and seamless framework that encompasses passive and active filters and includes the most modern and up to date design methodologies. Analogue Electronic Filters is suitable both for undergraduate and postgraduate students and also for professionals who wish to understand in depth and apply filter synthesis and design methods. Recently one of the authors published a similar book in Greek. The manuscript of this successful book will be reviewed, improved, reorganized and translated for the publication as outlined in this proposal. Analogue Electronic Filters can be supported by a website with all supplementary aids and material such as computer programs, Mathcad or MATLAB files as well as a forum.
From the Back Cover
Filters are essential subsystems in a huge variety of electronic systems. Filter applications are innumerable; they are used for noise reduction, demodulation, signal detection, multiplexing, sampling, sound and speech processing, transmission line equalization and image processing, to name just a few. In practice, no electronic system can exist without filters. They can be found in everything from power supplies to mobile phones and hard disk drives and from loudspeakers and MP3 players to home cinema systems and broadband Internet connections. This textbook introduces basic concepts and methods and the associated mathematical and computational tools employed in electronic filter theory, synthesis and design.  This book can be used as an integral part of undergraduate courses on analog electronic filters. Includes numerous, solved examples, applied examples and exercises for each chapter.Includes detailed coverage of active and passive filters in an independent but correlated manner.Emphasizes real filter design from the outset.Uses a rigorous but simplified approach to theoretical concepts and reinforces understanding through real design examples.Presents necessary theoretical background and mathematical formulations for the design of passive and active filters in a natural manner that makes the use of standard tables and nomographs unnecessary and superfluous even in the most mystifiying case of elliptic filters.Uses a step-by-step presentation for all filter design procedures and demonstrates these in numerous example applications.
