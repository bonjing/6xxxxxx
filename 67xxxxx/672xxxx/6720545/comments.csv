,nflfan,2011-10-05T09:23Z,"Great job again, Phatwarez. Hopefully one or two others will be uploading games so you won't be doing so many. "
,Vanvanero,2011-10-05T11:17Z,"Hate to be the one to say this, but after praising Phatwarez on this upload, I'm having problems with the playback on this file. It judders a whole lot, the sound's OK but the image is choppy.

Not a complain, these things happen.

Thanks again, anyway."

Yeah they're all like that, high motion scenes max out my cpu and frames are dropped. Some broadcasts are worse then others, depending on how it's directed.

That's the difficulty with recording multiple HD broadcasts using software encoding. Consumer-level hardware based 1080p encoding equipment is right on the cutting edge, such as the buggy blackmagic intensity pro, and the soon-to-be-available darkcrystal hd capture pro. You can put that on my christmas list if your looking for donation ideas =)"
