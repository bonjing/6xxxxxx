,rcthebearcub,2011-10-13T13:10Z,Looks to be fake. The songs fade out awkwardly (between Time and Great Gig even!) the radio between Have A Cigar and Wish You Were plays twice! Learning To Fly has the Echoes fade in intro. If this is real it's definitely not the standard of how Floyd usually does compilations.
