The game that not only requires a hacked or homebrew-enabled PS3, but a little imagination is
ThatOtherDev's "They Do Not Die 2." Now at version 0.6 you'll notice plenty of improvements
since our last coverage, which was v0.2.
I say you require imagination because this is a "zombie shooter," minus the zombies in a
graphical/visual sense...
