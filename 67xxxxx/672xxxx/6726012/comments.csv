,christo7,2011-10-07T09:00Z,"You RAR, I download, unzip, and delete without seeding. You're a dick, I'm a dick."
,cephas86,2011-10-07T09:57Z,"Wow both of your comments are worthless. You people are lazy, the end."
,maggot_corpse,2011-10-07T12:14Z,"cephas, what's the point or rars?"
,Artificial_Madness,2011-10-07T13:00Z,What's the point in being 10s lazy?
,mordasz,2011-10-07T13:51Z,People don't realize that these files originate on USENET where RARs are more useful. If you want no RARs wait for a mkv release.
,maggot_corpse,2011-10-07T14:40Z,thanks for the advice. really helped
[V],meech,2011-10-08T02:12Z,"Sounds like the lazy one is the uploader who won't unpack after getting from usenet, before uploading here where rars are useless."
,m00se1207,2011-12-18T17:46Z,"I don't think its being lazy, I'm the same way, If I download torrents and have to unzip the files (RAR ing Them is useless because you don't gain space) After opening them I don't want to deal with the hassle of two separate files on my computer"
