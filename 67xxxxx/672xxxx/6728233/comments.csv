,BMeyers94,2011-10-09T23:46Z,"Honestly, I'm not sure if it's the extended version, but the run time is 2:05:00. That is two hours and five minutes."
,upload69,2011-10-10T08:03Z,About 10 minutes shorter than extended edition listed on Amazon.
,wingit,2011-10-11T00:12Z,"Movie likes to be laggy, don't know if its encoded right. Audio's split by about 1.5-3 seconds also.


Shame this is the only viable HD too."
,BMeyers94,2011-10-12T00:54Z,That's probably because you have a slower computer. Convert it to DVD format and burn it. Works perfectly.
,nabi1987,2011-10-13T04:02Z,"The torrent is very bad. You have copied it from another torrent which is in three languages i.e. Hindi , tamil and english. Its not even proper 720p.
Deleted it and waiting for a proper rip.
Its really a shame that there is no proper torrent out there."
,nabi1987,2011-10-13T04:05Z,"Also there are no subtitles. None of any language.
Those available on the NET are also useless with this upload.
Complete waste of time."
