Mute Math are more versatile than they seem at surface value, and their musical range finally shows through on Odd Soul. While a fundamentally uneven 13 songs, this departure from the processed norm finds the musicians channeling their inner groove through soulful rhythms and riffs.  Starting with a track modeled after the primal garage blues stomp of the Black Keys, the album switches styles from there on out. Mute Math sound most natural when they let loose as a funk rock/alt-rock hybrid. This form of music totally works for them and pops up in more than a few of their best songs, including Cavalries, One More, and Walking Paranoia.
