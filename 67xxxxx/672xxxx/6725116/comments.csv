Yes it is flac.  CD-ripped.  Not transcoded.  Here is proof."
,crazi25,2012-02-14T07:37Z,"your ripper is crap then, listen to through a decent system"
[H],politux,2012-02-14T09:39Z,Isn't it interesting that the haters have never uploaded a single torrent.
,motiondesigner,2012-02-28T00:14Z,Thank you!
,Xovier,2012-03-19T20:00Z,Nice torrent man. I know that this is a FLAC and sounds great! He should probably get a better audio hardware. I am using BeoSound 5 Encore :P
,Fyerfox,2012-05-01T02:20Z,"Thanks politux, excellent torrent and FLAC quality.

It is FLAC; the 22khz waveforms are all there, you can see by the picture.

The confusion might come from the fact that Gotye isn't as punchy as most modern pop artists.  Probably doesn't sound as defined on $20 logitech satellites. 

And dafuq is the hate with his ripper.  That wouldn't even be it.  It goes from CD(digital) to hardrive(also digital).  Now unless his ripper was so bad that it missed bits during the rip, there is no problem.  Definitely doesn't sound like any missed bits."
