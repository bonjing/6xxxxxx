"Rebranding"

When longtime Hale Dayton client Fred Potter 
(Tom Virtue, "Transformers: Dark of the 
Moon"), is caught in an extra-marital tryst, 
the team sets to work on damage control. As 
Stephen (Anthony Head) and Helen (Kathryn 
Hahn) mastermind the response for the client, 
Dan (Mo Mandel), Gregg (Al Madrigal) and Emma 
(Natasha Leggero) help Helen in a rebranding 
campaign of another sort, setting Alex up 
with a slick online profile and a cute new 
date.

Evolve... or die.
