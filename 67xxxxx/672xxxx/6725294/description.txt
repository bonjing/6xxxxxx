Postpartum depression soars to terrifying new heights in this suspenseful thriller about a ten year old boy who struggles to save his family from an unspeakable evil. Based on actual events, Baby Blues centers on the harrowing experiences of a young farm-boy named Jimmy (Ridge Canipe) who realizes that something is serious wrong with his increasingly-unstable mother.
