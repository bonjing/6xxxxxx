Muddy Waters  Johnny Winter Sessions 1976-1981
Released: 2009
Label: Raven
Format: Mp3@320

In the latter half of the 1970s, Chicago blues kingpin Muddy Waters experienced something of a career resuscitation when he joined forces with Johnny Winter, who produced a series of albums that put the punch back in Muddy's music. The best tracks from these four albums are included on this 19-track collection. Though Muddy was approaching the end of his life when these recordings were made, he sounds like he's standing 10 feet tall. The sex, stomp, and sheer menace of some of these tunes should have been enough to send all the lukewarm blues-rockers of the era limping back home with their tails between their legs.

19 TRACKS THAT COLLECT THE BEST FROM HIS COLLABORATION ALBUMS WITH JOHNNY - "HARD AGAIN", "I'M READY", "KING BEE", AND "LIVE".
