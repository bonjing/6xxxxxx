,nymphoses,2011-12-23T10:51Z,"Fucking Kickass, I downloaded many torrents of you and I seeded each and every one of them even though my plan is limited and a slow one, but where the fuck are you? moved to direct links, don't you know that direct links sucks infront of the p2p sharing, you encoded many films during this period, then what is your fucking problem to upload them as torrents? Here we clearly missing you and your torrents but you don't give a shit to our feelings, This so called YIFY had taken over your place and uploading many torrents but they are not good as yours.
So comeback and upload torrents, any way your direct link site sucks (don't you understand that maximum # of torrent downloaders can't afford direct links?). So stop saying that direct link is free, safe and fast. JUST GOT EMOTIONAL, SORRY"
,libertaswv,2012-01-01T20:58Z,"^... and on that note...ahem...

Thx for the up. Grabbed your up of limitless the other day (seeding now), and it was a beautiful copy. I had no idea your ups were this good...Deserve much wider support than many of them are currently getting. Your listings are part of my daily check, now. Consistent quality.

Thx for all your work - it's appreciated.

Thx also to all s/l's for making it happen."
