The crew, along with daughter of Jason, Haily Hawes, visit the Shanley Hotel to investigate child ghosts who occasionally bounce balls and are heard walking back and forth on the third floor. Next, the TAPS team heads to Fort Niagra to look deeper into the claims of shadow figures, being pushed, and the headless apparition of a soldier.
