,Fangular,2011-10-22T12:11Z,"Hi.. I know you don;t always upload Project Runway, but I was wondering if you could please, please upload the latest episode of it!? (It's ep S09E13 - 'Finale Part One'.) The regular uploaders like TvTeam haven't done so this week, although it screened last Thursday. (I don't understand why they'd upload the whole season and then stop when there are only two episodes left to go, but that's what they seem to be doing!)

I think the last episode you uploaded this season was #8, but it would be spactacular if you could upload this latest one too - am sure I'm not the only PR fan hanging out for it!

Regardless, thanks for everything you've done so far, and all the other episodes you've uploaded.

Cheers!
