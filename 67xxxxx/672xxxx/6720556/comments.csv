,keatonp12,2011-10-05T02:56Z,"I finished downloading.  About a min into instalation, I got an error message. ""An unknown error has occurred. (21)"""

I am seeding the shit out of this for you all!"
,jibba123,2011-10-05T05:56Z,Don't you have to have a valid developer UDID to use this?
,jibba123,2011-10-05T07:00Z,"Also received an error trying to install this, assuming it requires a valid UDID."
,something-else,2011-10-06T00:49Z,"No UDID needed, make sure you are running Beta 8 of iTunes for Mac (don't know what the Windows version is).

This worked great for me."
,d.eichkind,2011-10-06T01:24Z,If it works for one person will it work for all?
,orx,2011-10-06T09:15Z,"Yes it works if you do it right. If you get errors there are a few different reasons:

You are not using a REAL iphone cable (using like a small mini-usb for the Mophie battery pack).

If it fails try restarting iTunes (yes you have to install the version 5 itunes beta that comes in this torrent).

Sometimes there is an error with the UDID thing, if so just add:
74.208.10.249    gs.apple.com

to your hosts file (c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc). Open a command prompt and type: ipconfig /flushdns and try again..."
