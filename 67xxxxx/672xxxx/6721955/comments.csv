,tubeamp,2012-03-20T13:27Z,"Looks like this is legit, but I thought it was for lion+ only?  Has this one been touched by the hand of the pirate to make it work?"
,tubeamp,2012-03-20T13:31Z,"nevermind, just found out that you have to pay for 4.x for snow leopard ... crafty/crappy apple sales department!"
,Lance.Alexander,2012-03-29T04:32Z,"so im running 10.6.8 and i cant seem to get this to install. i keep getting an unknown error message when i get to the install page, same thing happened when i tried to install 3.6.2.... any help is much appreciated"
,n1kn7h,2012-05-05T16:12Z,"I got past the 'installation failed' error by changing the computer's date to 1/10/2011,   untick 'set date and time automatically' first.  The signature on the software expires at a certain date.
Minimum OSX version needed is 10.6.7"
,snrdb2012,2012-05-05T20:24Z,"@n1kn7h what is your version? did it work on 10.6.8? I also saw the issue with the date somewhere else and had already tried it. Although it begins the installation, it will be stopped later with another ""Installation Failed"" message."
