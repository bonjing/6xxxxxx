hootieman dont be a fake ass.
nothing wrong with this upload
"
,Wesleh,2011-10-07T22:49Z,"Thanks for your support TheFakeWatcher.
I bet hootieman didnt even download this file and just instantly wrote a comment, the idiot.

This videofile is exactly the same as the episode on the MTV site.
But now there are no advertisements during the episode.
I also uploaded this for people like myself that don't live in the US so they can't watch it on the MTV site.

Anyways, have fun and keep seeding :)"
,Thermometer,2011-10-07T23:19Z,"Seeding like a bitch right now!
Torrent is legit and video quality is pretty good!"
,Sp1kes,2011-10-07T23:45Z,The timeline is screwed up I think. At least the other one was. Still watchable to get the jist.
,jpeg23,2011-10-07T23:54Z,is this a repack?? coz the other 1 was not in order??
,Danejris,2011-10-08T00:15Z,"@Wesleh

Thanks man though I wonder where the rest of the guys are."
,Buck.Nasty,2011-10-08T00:43Z,There is an error in the timeline indeed. Thanks for uploading though.
,only1evisu,2011-10-08T01:21Z,"Well done for uploading, but the timeline is shite.... Bits cut everywhere.... "
,atndigcrk,2011-10-08T02:24Z,"the mtv stream from there site is protected stream from copying so u will see sometime messed up view, but the legit copy is out now anyways "
,f7go,2011-10-08T03:21Z,thanks in advance but WTF video and audio are perfect only thing thats not its the edit cuz its not in sequence ..... anyway thank u again UP 
,zalvothechemist,2011-10-08T03:28Z,thanks for the upload  :)
,ppptest,2011-10-08T04:54Z,"The scenes are COMPLETELY OUT OF ORDER! The credits start rolling halfway through, etc. Try a different copy."
,weflyball00ns,2011-10-08T05:19Z,I had the same issue with all the scenes being out of order... So annoying to watch! All the good bits are given away in the beginning :(
,hootieman,2011-10-08T05:20Z,nothing wrong with this download eh TheFakeWatcher? Well you aren't watching close enough scenes are outta order you fuck. Just go to Http://mtv.com and watch it there lol 
,Alex228,2011-10-08T05:29Z,Does NOT work via stream to the PS3.
,Wesleh,2011-10-08T06:27Z,"Yeah problem is that my ripper downloads the seperated parts. I was too enthusiast that I was gonna be the first one that released it on TPB so I was in hurry.
In this hurry I forgot that there was a timeline so now the scenes are ordered alphabetical XD
Sorry for this, next time I'll make a good version.
Thanks for your support anyways!"
,SinCityTm,2011-10-08T06:51Z,Im just glad theres finally a copy of this episode...thanx mister
,Ashleynin,2011-10-08T07:57Z,"It's all messed up...Wesleh you should've looked over it. Well i'm gonna d/w from ""Tvteam"" anyways !!
707 seeders & 193 leechers not-bad (:"
,mille555,2011-10-08T14:30Z,this shit is fucked up i didnt even realize the time limit was distorted until i was half in to the episode... this fucked up the whole thing for me so THANKS for uploading this piece of shit asshole
,missworld,2011-10-08T15:33Z,"It's actually playing backways! What kinda fucked up shit is that! It's our own fault, Wesleh doesn't have a skull symbol to indicate he isn't a retard uploader "
,missworld,2011-10-08T15:39Z,"Thefakewatcher you mongel, the bang of Korky from Life goes on from you is stinking up the place man.. Nice work my hole! 

You pair of fucking dicks saying shit about Hottieman cause he spotted your fuck up! shouldn't you Wesleh check your own upload before you spout your horse shit for us all to laugh at! Get fucked! I'm embarrassed for you! "
,atndigcrk,2011-10-08T20:16Z,why are ppl still gettin the webrip when the real avi xvid is out already ....wierd jus get the real deal ...http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6728653/Jersey_Shore_S04E10_Damage_is_Done_(SEEDBOX)(NEW___)
,Wesleh,2011-10-09T00:00Z,"Instead of blaming me for the fault I made accidently, why you guys don't be friendly and thankful?
I was the first one that made it possible for you guys to download it, and just because I made a little mistake I'm shit in your oppinion.
The persons that are shit, are the people that are flaming over here without even saying thanks.
It's actually the first time I ripped a web episode and uploaded it.
You guys should realize that you're shitty comments are demotivating for any new uploaders in the scene.

Anyways, I dont care, I'm just telling you idiots.
Next time I'll try to upload a proper version for the guys that at least said thanks :)"
,Facecrook,2011-10-13T00:58Z,I just watched it.... or half of it since the scenes ARE out of order it goes from the girls at the Wine place to Snooki throwing things at the Situation
,Facecrook,2011-10-13T01:20Z,And if you cant take criticism about your uploads dont upload anything....
