Nappy Brown Something Gonna Jump Out The Bushes 
Released: April 1987
Label: Black Top
Format: Mp3@320 

Ultra-solid support from guitarists Anson Funderburgh, Eugene Ross, Ronnie Earl, and Earl King and Black Top's superb house horn section make this Dallas-cut set Brown's one of his best contemporary . His lusty shouting style works well on covers of the Dominoes' "Have Mercy Baby," the "5" Royales' title track, a pair of Earl King-penned numbers, and Robert Ward's "Your Love Is Real."
Rhythm & blues giant Napoleon "Nappy" Brown was as fine a singer as you'd ever hear, a dynamic onstage performer, and a gentleman who dodged many obstacles throughout a career that spanned six decades.
Brown's unique vocal style was rooted in both the passion of gospel music and the fire of the blues, and the singer often used techniques such as vibrato and melisma, along with tricks like rolling the consonants or extending the syllables of a word to liven up his vocal delivery. A consummate performer, Brown's 1950s-era hits would set the stage for the rise of soul music in the '60s, as well as influencing rock & roll singers like Elvis Presley and the later development of the soul-blues style.
