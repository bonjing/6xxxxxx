This is the great PC game S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - Clear Sky.

Instructions for installing the game:

Mount the ISO with a mounting program, such as Daemon Tools, Virtual CloneDrive, etc.

Run setup.exe after mounting (it will be in your disk drive, right click &gt; explore).

After running the setup, make sure that the box to run the game is unchecked, and finish.

Run the "stkcs-for-pack-blahblahblah" .exe file, this will patch the game to the latest version.

After running that, make sure the box to run the game is unchecked again, and finish.

Go to the "Crack" folder, take the files in it, and go to the Clear Sky directory. Put the files into the "bin" folder, in the game directory.

Run the game.

NOTE: If you get a "cannot open fsgame.ltx" error after this, take the "runCS.bat" file, and put it into the main game directory folder. Use this file to run the game.

Enjoy!

Note: I would highly recommend using the "Clear Sky Complete" modification with this game, it makes the experience much better.
