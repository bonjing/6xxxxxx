 January 21, 1968: A B-52G bomber carrying four thermo nuclear bombs,    
 crashes into the icy Arctic waters of North Star Bay near Thule         
 Airbase. The search party finds the wreck and three of the bombs, but   
 the fourth is missing.                                                  
                                                                         
 Presence: The notorious Russian Mafia boss and arms dealer Yebievdenko  
 has a new toy for sale, an atom bomb. The CIA learns of his plans to    
 sell it to a Libyan ruler, and the fears are that it will be used in a  
 terrorist attack against the USA as revenge for the American            
 involvement in the Libyan conflict.                                     
                                                                         
 As a member of the US special unit, it is now up to you to stop the
