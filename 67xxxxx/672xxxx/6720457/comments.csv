(1)For people asking about a CD-key, obviously you didn't follow directions.  If you copy the crack files before you start the game, it never asks for a key.
(2) For people claiming there's a password - piss off.  Nothing is passworded.
(3) To eliminate some of the pop-in textures on an nVidia card, enable GPU transcoding in the video options and raise your AA to 8x or 16x.

,exp20thcen,2011-10-08T18:23Z,"RAGE CRASH ON STARTUP or CRASH ON START OF GAME? (part 1):


I believe I've found out how to correct this problem...


First for the record I've have tested just about every fix I've found on these comments in this torrent and the BTARENA.org torrent and for my system up to date I've only experienced a crash or start, or crash on start of new game. Giving this, it is my opinion from the testing that wheather you use extremezone's torrent or AiTB's torrent this SHOULD work. I am not promising miricles, it is obvious that ID seriously messed up the port for this game, and this may not work on every system, but it did work on mine. 

For those wanting to know, my system exceeds the reccomended specs for this game:

AMD Phoenom 2 955 black edition (3.2Ghz quadcore liquid-cooled)
running on MSI 790FX-GD70 mobo
with 8GB Vengence DDR3 RAM 
and Powercolor ATI HD6950 OCed to 880/1375 
running the game on a SATA2 SSD. 


edit: some of the steps I provide may seem worded for idiots, I am not implying that anyone here is an idiot, simply trying to help everyone who is having trouble with these rediciolus bugs in this game. So no offense. 



Steps to follow:

1) DL torrent and install game (kinda an idiot step, but better STS)

2) follow SKIDROW's instructions and copy everything from the ""SKIDROW"" folder on DISC3 to your install directory of RAGE. 

3) if you use ATI proceed to step 2a), if you use NVIDIA procceed to step 2b)

3a) I have tested the following drivers 10.8, 11.9, 11.9 rage proformance edition, and the new preview driver 11.10...Of these drivers all worked expect for the new preview driver, HOWEVER the ""11.9 rage proformance"" driver worked the best for me. remeber for safty sake to unistall your old driver and THEN install the new one and THEN reboot the system...Also it has been noted by serval people including myself that the only way to get rid of the ""video tearing"" is to force on Vsync in the CCC panel. With it on I am still getting a very playable 60FPS on my 32"" HDTV 1080rez. 

3b) if you've read everything so far, you know already that I don't own an NVIDIA card, so Idk what driver exactly for you to use, however I have read that there is a similar new driver that was released for RAGE for NVIDIA users, and that they work, but they still have to ""force on"" Vsync or else there is video tearing. 

4) goto your RAGE install directory and in the ""BASE"" folder delete the ""video"" folder, sadly this removes sevral videos, but I don't think gameplay is affected. 

Most users files will be located:

C:\program files (x86)\rage\base\

or 

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\rage\base




After following those 4 steps the game SHOULD work, however if it doesn't never fear there are MORE FIXES"
,exp20thcen,2011-10-08T18:23Z,"RAGE CRASH ON STARTUP or CRASH ON START OF GAME? (part 2):


5) On page 20 of the comments for the ""skidrow-extremezone"" torrent (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6720504/Rage-SKIDROW) there are fixes provided by 2 users: Delfs1970 and Nname1. 
They derserve all credit if these fixes help you, the following is just a copy of what they posted, along with some notes of my own. 
FOR THE RECORD: I did use both of these fixes, I CANNOT confirm if my fix (deleting the video folder) will work without Nname1's fix, if someone would confirm or deney this I would appreciate it. I did not test this because I finnally got this game to work and I am not screwing with it. 



Nname1 posted:


"" For those who need the full crash fix + new update I have uploaded a torrent here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6728210/RAGE.2011.Crack_CrashFix_ONLY It also contains the new AMD drivers ""

- I used his fixes but not the AMD driver he provided, again I used my own copy of the ""AMD-RAGE proformance 11.9"" driver I DLed from AMD website. 

- Also I found two sets of instructions for how to install his fix; I don't know if it matters but these are the steps I followed.

N1) USE winrar, I don't care what version just use it, its better. I used 4.00 64bit edition. it is free.

N2) extract ""RAGE.leak.patch"" rar to RAGE directory ""copy and replace"" all files.

N3) extract ""Crack.Only"" rar to RAGE directory ""copy and replace"" all files.

N4) USING winRAR extract either ""CrashFix.part1"" or ""CrashFix.part2"" to your RAGE directory, it doesn't matter which as WinRAR extracts both automatically. 

N5) run the Crashfix.exe and follow setup instructions (I personally scaned the torrent and the files before using them, using Avira Security Suite, there are no viruses unlike what some idiot posted on the website belonging to this torrent. 

N7) what happend to N6? doesn't matter, there is no N6 or N7, but I gotta give props to Mass effect where I can. :)"
,exp20thcen,2011-10-08T18:24Z,"RAGE CRASH ON STARTUP or CRASH ON START OF GAME? (part 3):


hopefully that will work...if it doesn't, here's what Delfs1970's posted 



""""It took me lots of reading just to get this to work. First I have a quad core at overclocked to 3.6ghz, 6870 not overclocked with 1gb, and 4gigs of DDR2 800, and it runs good. What I needed is this in the Rage.exe command line -> ""+cvaradd g_fov 20 +set com_skipIntroVideo 1 +set com_allowConsole 1 +fc_maxcachememoryMB 1024 +ik_enablesmoothing 0 +image_usecompression 0 +jobs_numthreads 4 +mem_phymemblocksizem 512 m_smooth 0"" (REMOVE THE QUOTES!!) - Believe it or not this stopped the crashing at the loading screens between different scenes/levels. Next I have this Rage Config file (If you don't know what this is go to Google and find out).

seta image_usecompression ""0""
seta image_anisotropy ""16""
seta vt_pageimagesizeuniquediffuseonly2 ""8192""
seta vt_pageimagesizeuniquediffuseonly ""8192""
seta vt_pageimagesizeunique ""8192""

seta vt_qualitydctspecular ""100""
seta vt_qualitydctnormal ""100""
seta vt_qualitydctchroma ""100""
seta vt_qualitydctluma ""100""
seta vt_restart

Again after a lot of trail and error this works great, looks really good, and plays well. Fun game and worth while WHEN you get it working right. My specs may NOT be the same as yours so adjust to what is need by your specs. Hopefully, this helps someone.""""


- I personally did everything stated here with the exception I changed the command line to fit my specs and system better, also if you want achievements you cannot enable the console.

- heres what I changed:

+set com_allowConsole 0 (was 1) (changed so I could get achievements)
+fc_maxcachememoryMB 2048 (was 1024) (just a guess but I am hoping for better proformance +mem_phymemblocksizem 1024 (was 512) (again...proformance)
+ik_enablesmoothing 1 (was 0) (pro..form...ance)
m_smooth 1 (was 0) (hell if I know, just a test, call it scientific curiousity)

so my command line looked like this when I was finished, it did work...

+cvaradd g_fov 20 +set com_skipIntroVideo 1 +set com_allowConsole 0 +fc_maxcachememoryMB 2048 +ik_enablesmoothing 1 +image_usecompression 0 +jobs_numthreads 4 +mem_phymemblocksizem 1024 m_smooth 1



to make a Rageconfig.cfg file I did this:

D1) goto your Rage directory and in the BASe folder copy any .cfg file present and paste in same directory, I copied the vehicle_4.cfg and ended up with ""vehicle_4-copy.cfg""

D2) rename new file to ""rageconfig.cfg""

D3) open new file using ""open with"" command and use Wordpad, make sure the ""always use this program is NOT checked. 

D4) delete all data in the wordpad, copy in all the configs listed above into word pad, they all start with ""seta"". Save file, and close. "

NOW the game SHOULD work, remeber I didn't promise, just that my game now works after all these steps. 

I have written them down in hope that it will help someone, please let me know if it did, or post any questions, I will be posting this long comment on both torrents, and checking on them periodically over the next few days. 

In closing:

- I am now seeding both torrents because I believe either will work (eventually) at a ratio of 2:1 (thats 72GBs I am going to be uploading), I know DL rates are slow due to leechers, please be patient. 

- credit goes to Nname 1 and Delfs1970 for there fixes

- Extreme credit goes to all of SKIDROW, including extremezone and AiTB for another great release, thank-you for making it possible for us to solve bugs without having wasted $59.99 first.

- Please do support the devolpers as they DO deserve your support, I am sure someday they will learn how to beta test properly, or at least make a good port. it the mean time we need ot support them so they can continue to make great games. 

- last but not least, if you have read all of this, credit goes to you for doing so :)

-please if there are any MAJOR or minor mistakes I have made, including spelling or a directory link, please help me to fix them, and don't flame this post. I wrote all this to help everyone, and if you don't like my ideas, ect...go do your own thing leave the rest of us who want to fix this game, and play it, alone.  "

,shipz2640,2011-10-26T11:07Z,"@kal442 The first step (unpack the release) normally refers to the original releases. SKIDROW's original releases are divided into a bunch of different small archives (say 57 99 MB files, for example). If you use an archive utility such as WinRAR, when you open one of the archives and extract the file you will see  next to it to let you know there are archives before the opened archive and after the opened archive that contain parts for the extraction. The program will automatically extract from all parts to create the file.

Since this is a repack, you can ignore this step as this has already been done. Normally that step is still included as the original NFO file normally remains un-edited."

,borryl,2011-10-27T21:08Z,"I have same problem as TheDownload1245.
I have downloaded the latest AMD-Catalyst driver, the AMD-Rage-fix and Skidrow Update 1.
There were a noticeable improvement over the course of these steps but the problem is very much there. Game is unplayable.

Anyone have any ideas? Maybe in-game graphics settings or maybe Catalyst settings?"
,borryl,2011-10-29T22:40Z,"TheDownload1245:
add: +jobs_numThreads 0
to the ""target"" of your desktop shortcut.
so it reads something like:
F:\Rage\Rage.exe +jobs_numThreads 0

This fixed the hang problem for me, but I still got the texture problems, even after trying catalyst 11.8 and 11.9 plus the Rage update.

But it makes the game playable, although not as pretty as it should."
,Cerebral222,2011-10-30T03:13Z,"I installed this on 2 PC's with no hick-ups, 1 PC has a nvidia GT 8800 Graphics card, the other, a simple nvidia GX 220, both PC's are Windows 7 32 bit with 4 Gig RAM, so I can state that the torrent is sound, if your having problems with this game it has to be your rig set-up or software clashes, you would have the same issues if you bought the game from a retailer."
