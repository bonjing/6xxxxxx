Perfect - 2004 - Once Twice Three Times a Maybe


After legendary critics favorites the Replacements called it quits in the early \\\\\\\'90s, founding â€˜Mats member and bassist Tommy Stinson formed a new rock band in 1995 â€“ Perfect. Their album, a near- (dare we say?) perfect mix of driving rock, sophisticated pop and smartass lyrics recalls the Replacements at the height of their rocking irreverence and shouldâ€™ve been an instant classic. Unfortunately, record company politics intervened and the album was never released â€“ until now!
