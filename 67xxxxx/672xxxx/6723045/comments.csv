Tamil is a Dravidian language spoken mainly in southern India, Sri Lanka and Singapore.  Just a little FYI.  That print is still available if you're interested.  But, not one of mine.  Sorry. :("

I'm sure many will appreciate that because you're right - 3D glasses reduce the brightness because of physics. Whether magenta/green/other glasses which work by absorbing part of the color spectrum (absorbing some light) or shutter glasses which physically close their shutters 50% of the time (ie. cut out 50% of the light). The amount of times I've found myself squinting at the screen without realising it until I take the glasses off for some reason and realise how bright the screen actually is. I suppose I should manually increase the brightness when watching 3D, but your effort adding a brightness filter should help by default. Cheers!"

If you do the same audio substitution but keep the brightness the same, that would be dandy."
