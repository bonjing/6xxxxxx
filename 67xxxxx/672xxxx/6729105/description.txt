Join the children of hell! TKK's best and most hard to find album. This is a personal rip I did on an original CD.

Tracklist:

1. A Daisy Chain 4 Satan (Acid & Flowers Mix) 
2. The Days Of Swine & Roses 
3. Hand In Hand 
4. Waiting For Mommie 
5. Confessions Of A Knife (Theme Part I) 
6. Ride The Mindway 
7. Rivers Of Blood, Years Of Darkness 
8. Kooler Than Jesus (Electric Messiah Mix) 
9. Burning Dirt 
10. Confessions Of A Knife (Theme Part II) 
11. Do You Fear (The Inferno Express?) 

This is by far TKK's best album, unfortunately none of their albums have a sound anywhere close to this.

If you like then seed so others can share this treasure.
