Unreported World - South Africa~ Trouble in the Townships  2011 10 07  Ch 4


New Unreported World reporter Krishnan Guru-Murthy visits South Africa. Seventeen years after it was freed from apartheid, he finds a country in which violent protests against corruption and the lack of basic services mean its ambition to lead the continent as a prosperous democracy hangs in the balance.

Simmering with anger, South Africa's people tell Krishnan they feel a sense of betrayal they will tolerate no longer. Since January last year there have been over 130 violent protests and the people's patience is running out.
