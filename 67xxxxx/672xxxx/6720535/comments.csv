http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0128445/"
,jinjanjaa,2011-10-06T18:04Z,its 720p and not 1080p........ but thanks anyway.....
,gazza2009,2011-10-07T18:35Z,plus its the old version arnie film not recent 1
,gorm4660,2011-10-08T05:42Z,"Pretty cool of you to attempt to get people on here thinking this is the new one with Jason Momoa, but you are actually a shithead hooking them in with this old one (myself included unfortunately) Dick Off!!!"
,PabloMansini,2011-10-08T14:06Z,"I agree, your a knob, at least put in 1982 version dick wad."
,Azraelalpha,2011-10-09T00:21Z,"Or, you could always read the movide description before you click ""download"", you n00bs."
,Azraelalpha,2011-10-09T00:23Z,You guys could also read the movie description before whining.
,gorm4660,2011-10-09T23:27Z,"Fortunately I did read the movie description, and did not download it. So my complaint is valid. List it as it is, not using misdirection to accumulate stats."
,ThePirateMachine,2011-10-13T13:58Z,"If you clicked here thinking it was the recent Conan, how hard is it to click ""Back"" or ""Previous"" or even just close the tab? Also, everything is posted in the description inc date and screens. So only noobs and idiots who would complain that this is not the new conan film."
,ttf2010,2011-10-16T14:59Z,"Agreed - says 1982 in TAGS and first line of description - quit the whining about downloading the ""wrong"" FREE movie."
,majikmann,2011-10-23T02:12Z,"all you idiots saying that ""it's in the description""... you're probably the same type of loser this guy is! Be straight up from jump street! why mislead? The only reason I can think of: a complete donkey ball muncher!

,icepax,2011-10-24T17:40Z,"@MRShanku: Love your work, mate!

Just ignore all the fucking retards who can't read and complain that this is noooooooot the 2011's version.

Why is there so many dumb cunts in TPB?!..."
,david50,2011-10-31T05:55Z,This is the only version worth watching.. the new one is dogshit. Anyone know if this is the extend cut with the scenes they should have left out? God I hate the scene at the end they added where Conan whines about the good 'ol days. He might as well be picking flowers in a dress. I just wan't the original original in HD. Anyone?
,Mr.Lucifero,2011-12-08T21:55Z,MRShanku...I think you need more MiB for this movie....Most of the movie is fine but any scenes in the dark is somewhat pixilated....Aaaaand there are quite a few scenes in the dark in this movie....
,nosing_glass,2012-01-20T14:45Z,"thanks, this version is much better than the new one.
 +1"
