It appears that the movie is in Spanish. If you have seen the trailer, that is reasonably obvious ;)
However, it would be nice if more of the up-loaders on TPB would list the language of the film along with the other info.
I have noticed that the info and organization of TPB is well above many other sites in quality, which is a very good thing, indeed.
Thanks for the up-load!
