The movie is packaged to work with Windows Media Center (with Media Browser plugin) - but can be watched with any player that will play am m4v file.

I had to get this film from VHS because the only DVDs of this film seem to be French for some crazy reason!!

Still, I felt the need to share this piece of 90s Australiana.
