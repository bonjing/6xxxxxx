use a standard, 4.7GB single layer DVD-R disc.

sudo growisofs -speed=8 -dvd-compat -Z /dev/dvdrw=/path/to/forks-over-knives.iso

The DVD will play in any DVD player that will read DVD-R media"
[T],metalcore.,2011-10-09T03:32Z,this untouched or stripped down?
,tikal808,2011-10-10T07:38Z,"@metalcore, This is a direct dd image of the DVD version of this film. It has the full menu, scene selection, and ""special features"" The about file inside the torrent does mention that filming was done in HD, and the producers released the film on Bluray and DVD simultaneously. This is the DVD version, and yes it's only 3.9GB in uncompressed form.

I do recommend watching this film in two halves, on two different days. It's just too much information to absorb in just one sitting. Anyway, I hope you enjoy!"
