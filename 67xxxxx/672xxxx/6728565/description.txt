Best western T.V. series ever! Yes this IS real. Comes with all 225 episodes, catagorized by season, and the best quality possible for this series. I hope you all enjoy this 1950's classic hit.

This old black and white series features the classy, styled, ex West Point graduate/ soldier -now gunslinger by the name of Paladin. Whom at a base charge of $1,000 sets out from his comfy home in San Francisco's Carlton Hotel to solve any problem worthy of his 'special' expertise. With a firm conviction of morals, beliefs, and abilities, and a profound knowledge of history, literature and philosophy (not to mention his custom-made .45 caliber Colt Single Action Army revolver) Paladin helps bring order and culture to the very wild west of the late 1800's.


Enjoy and Seed!!
