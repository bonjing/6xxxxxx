,Hider141,2011-10-05T18:18Z,"@thomasbradly: STFU. If you don't like indian movies just stay out of these movies. Nobody forces you to watch them.
Yes, the indian movies might not have a multi million dollars budget, might not be so Hollywood-ish, but are great movies worth watching (I would rather watch 10-15 indian movies, then watch a single crappy Hollywood production)."

,Tleilaxu_Ghola,2011-10-06T20:52Z,"quit whining and sling torrent. 

that being said, subtitled movies could have been in parenthesis in the description. 

If I am just slinging files around I at least like to know if I want to give this file some bandwidth, or possibly sling a 1080p version of green lantern or something else more helpful.

I still have not watched ""water for Elephants, but it has a high ratio so I have to keep it around if I want my good download speed to be maintained.

just sayin'"

,drewkrew,2011-10-07T18:19Z,"DVD Screener?!!!
Er... i disagree there. I would say the source is definately a CAM.

Appreciate your efforts SAM-DDR, but you are very confusing with your torrent titles, for example: this one says ""DVD SCR"" when it is from a cam source... 
your RASCALS torrent has ""PDVDrip"" which in nine years of torrent handling i have never come across before; what does it stand for?!? Preview-dvd maybe? (which would be a screener then anyway lol!), 
and also the ""1CDrip"" thing is a strange tag to use here, i can only assume that its maybe because you used to see some movie avi files supplied in two parts of around 700mb each in the olden days where VCD's were common place mainly because of the fact the files would fit on or came from cd's - so maybe your using that tag to show that this example is in one file??? 

Please don't think i'm slating you, your efforts are greatly appreciated as are all uploaders. It's just the title descriptions could cause confusion, and constuctive critiscm can lead to good things ;-)

Thankyou for uploading it, we look forward to seeing more from you."
