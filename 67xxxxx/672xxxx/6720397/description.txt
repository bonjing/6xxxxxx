Critically wounded and lying unconscious   
in a Mumbai hospital, ACP Yashvardhan of   
the Narcotics Control Bureau reflects on   
his life and his love-affair with Maya.    
With the assistance of the Commissioner    
as well as his colleagues, Atul, Kamlesh   
and Mahesh Pandey, and an informer,        
Arvind Shetty, he was able to apprehend    
drug-dealers in Kutch, Gujarat; Jalandhar, 
Punjab, as well as in Himachal Pradesh.    
Unknowingly, he paved the way for Vasu     
Anna Reddy to become the sole drug-dealer  
and invite his Mombasa-based brother,      
Vishnu, to join him. An encounter with     
the team kills Vasu, and some of the team  
gets suspended. A vengeful Vishnu decides  
to target the entire police unit as well   
as their respective families, and vows     
that he will not rest until he has killed
