Move beyond simple site creation and build web applications with HTML5 that can compete with desktop apps and run on mobile devices. This practical guide shows you how HTML5's JavaScript APIs give you the power to take web development into many fields that used to require platform-specific developmentâ€”particularly mobile deployment.

You'll not only discover how to take advantage of local storage, geolocation, multithreaded processing, and flexible network connectivity with HTML5, you'll also learn many ways to make application development with JavaScript more powerful.

Learn how HTML5 will bring about a radical change in web browser applications 
Get details about powerful toolkits that will help you program in JavaScript more efficiently 
Discover powerful aspects of JavaScript that you may not be aware of, such as closures, lambda, and functional programming 
Learn how HTML5 lets your applications store data in the browser so that you're not bound to the server 
Take your app offline, and explore how an offline application cache can speed up page loading when the app is online 
Use HTML5 Web Workers to create multithreaded applications with JavaScript 
Make your application mobile through geolocation and other HTML5 elements 
Learn a new way to communicate between the browser and a server with web sockets

What Is HTML5?

HTML5: Everyoneâ€™s using it, nobody knows what it is. I realize that sounds more like a line out of an existential movie â€” maybe Waiting for Godot or a screenplay by Sartre â€” than a statement about HTML5. But itâ€™s really the truth: most of the people using HTML5 are treating it as HTML4+, or even worse, HTML4 (and some stuff they donâ€™t use). The result? A real delay in the paradigm shift that HTML5 is almost certain to bring. Itâ€™s certainly not time to look away, because by the time you look back, you may have missed something really important: a subtle but important transition centered around HTML5.

Creating standards-compliant animations for the Web just got a lot easier. With this concise guide, youâ€™ll learn how to convert Flash animations into HTML5, using Wallabyâ€”the experimental tool from Adobe. Wallaby makes Flash content available for devices that don't support Flash runtimes, including the iPhone and iPad.

Developing HTML5 animations is time-consuming with all the coding required. This book shows you how to create compelling content for HTML5 environments with relative ease, whether you know Flash or not. After a quick introduction to simple animation building with Flash, you'll learn how Wallaby helps you convert those animations into HTML5 code.

Learn how to create a simple Flash animation, using Flash Professional CS5 
Become familiar with the Flash Library, Stage drawing canvas, and animation Timeline 
Take the right approach to building a complex Flash animation for HTML5 
Get performance tips to optimize animations for desktops and mobile devices 
Use simple JavaScript and CSS code to place the Wallaby animation in a web page 
Add interactivity to your HTML5 animation with jQuery
