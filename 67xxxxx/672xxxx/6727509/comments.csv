,dumas1000,2011-10-07T16:43Z,"They've added a few features and repolished the AI. IGN gave this game a 9.5 out of 10, which is unusually high for a sports game with how they usually rate things. They said that there's no going back to 2k11 after you play 2k12. However, the rosters are exactly the same. There has been no player movement towards the 2012 season. Nor will there be. It's basically understood by everyone involved that the entire NBA season has already been cancelled. That's not official, of course, but everyone knows it. They should call this NBA 2k11 Redux or something. They fashioned the game mostly around legends anyway and not really current players."

,mpamphsultras7,2012-01-20T20:26Z,"@bram00 
I'm 1000% sure that the graphics the PS3 and XBOX 360 consoles have is 10 times better,clearer,especially if you have HD cable.But also I think that in PC the graphics depend on the RAM and on the video card.Anyway you can find out what's better from the price.
PS3 & XBOX 360 :60$
PC :30$"
