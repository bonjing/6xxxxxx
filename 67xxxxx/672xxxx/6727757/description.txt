    Two men escaping the police by ship are blown off course by a typhoon    
    and shipwrecked on an uncharted island populated by women who make a     
    living diving for pearls. What the men don't know is that the women      
    are also part of a shark cult that sacrifices young virgins to the       
    sharks in the surrounding ocean in order to appease the shark gods.
