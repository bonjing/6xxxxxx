As for the show, and those occasional 'breaks' in the audio apparently due to censorshit: Can be momentarily annoying as hell. Gets the blood and anger up. As Lady rips it up. Despite or in spite of that, 'Dirty Girl' Lady Gaga fights the damn good fight. The first 40 minutes are without costume break. She just breaks halls, balls and hearts. From the start through 'You & I' are to die for. Then there is a costume break interlude, and Sting is coming, so whatever. "
