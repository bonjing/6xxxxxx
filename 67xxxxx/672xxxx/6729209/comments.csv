,biafra84,2011-10-08T14:54Z,"You gotta be shit'n me. The nr of seeders 's going down ? You do know how to keep seeding right ? Don't delete the torrent after you got it, you selfish fucks. Let other people get it too !! "

,Mesohappy,2011-10-08T17:39Z,"Hey standard tv person. The rest of the modern would has HD. Yes it may take a little longer take up more space.
It looks soooo much better HD than a fuzzy fur ball. Hope you get an HD TV  for Christmas or what ever day you may recieve gifts. :) "
[T],V100,2011-10-08T17:42Z,"biafra84 ""you selfish fucks. Let other people get it too !!"", seems rather hypocritical coming from someone who has never uploaded anything. 

On the other hand I can sympathize with cad40, lots of great stuff, seeding like a mad man...

I wanted to chime in to say thank, cad40, I really enjoy these and would have no way to get it without your help. I should also point out that while I will not be able to replace everything I get from folks here you should know that instead my high speed connection uploads ~40 poorly seeded/ near dead torrents instead. I up at my max rate, and all the time. Thanks again cad40."
,il_grammo,2011-10-08T17:44Z,Thanks a lot Cad40. Where I live the F1 coverage is rubbish.
,Mesohappy,2011-10-08T17:53Z,"Lots of thx. The BBC coverage is Soo much better than Speed. The 3 old farts telling the same old jokes gets auuuhg.
? cad40. If I was to want to be able to record HD TV and put it into a Format to be used to seed with. What parts do you need. If you are willing to explain. If you just want to e-mail send to my Pirate Bay. Arrrg "
,sanigene,2011-10-08T21:20Z,damn.  connected to 65 seeds and 18 leeches but only downing at 20kb/s.  the race will be up before i get to watch the quali :-(
