,deman1084,2012-01-05T20:14Z,"Thanks for this toilet sniffer as well as your other good work.
Props to anyone seeding as well. Gunna take me about a week at this rate -15% after a day- but for 8 seasons of something thats fair enough tbh
Will try to seed for a long time myself but 60G takes up a lot of my hard drive space. Is it possible to still seed if its only on my external hard drive? (never bothered trying before)."

,jokai82,2012-04-18T04:28Z,"Thank you for this! 
1 Question TSV.. Are all the episodes from each season DVDRIP quality? Meaning none of them have any tv channel logos from WB or CW, etc?"
