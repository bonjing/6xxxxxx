,cfordhere,2011-10-12T03:05Z,immediately after downloading this installed a connect.dll into my syswow64 folder. it also picked up the keygen but that is normal for my antivirus to pick that up. be aware this may happen
,moskeeto2,2012-06-02T16:33Z,McAfee detected and removed a trojan in the keygen for me.  be wary.
