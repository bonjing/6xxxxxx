TotalFinder adds tabs, hotkeys, and other tweaks to the Mac OS X Finder. 

Implemented features: 

- TABS like in Google Chrome! 
-Add a dual-panel mode (like in good old Norton Commander) 
-Make Finder available system-wide on a hot-key (like Visor) 
-Stop creating .DS_Store litter Show the folders always on top


Future goals: 

Add a better keyboard shortcuts (for keyboard-oriented freaks like me) 
Enable a cooperation mode with Terminal.app (for command-line lovers) 
Add user friendly MacFUSE support 
And what about better git/svn/hg integration
And more satisfaction! 


Requirements: 
Mac OS X 10.6 or later. 


Whatâ€™s New: 

-NEW Compatibility with Finder 10.7.1 (which is included in OSX update 10.7.2). 
-FIXED Symbolic links to folders sort as expected when â€œFolders on Topâ€ is enabled. 
-REMOVED Removed Asepsis feature and the kernel extension. Asepsis is now freely available as a standalone software.
