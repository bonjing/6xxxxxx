She also wrote "No Logo," a book that has become a cultural manifesto for critics of unfettered capitalism worldwide. Klein joins us to discuss the Occupy Wall Street movement and why it is being belittled in the corporate media. "My biggest fear was that the Obama presidency was was going to lead this generation of young people into political cynicism and political apathy," Klein says.
