-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


A complex, realistic and mature story touching upon subject matter seldom seen in 
other RPGs, told in a manner that is understandable and attractive to contemporary 
gamers. We investigate the assassinations of the rulers of the Northern Kingdoms 
and follow Geralt s personal theme, in which heâ€™s looking for his own identity. 
Gradually we learn how powerful forces influence our situation and what role they 
order us to play.

Believable, true-to-life characters with their own motivations and goals. During 
our journey we meet ordinary men, soldiers, rebels, powerful mages, rulers and 
their assassins. Depending on our decisions we meet different game characters, 
and our relationships shape further actions in the game.

Rich, living world in which every character has their own way of life and unique 
occupations. Our actions modify the relationship with the game-world population and, 
in the case of the main plot line, open or close the possibilities of interaction 
with the game world.
