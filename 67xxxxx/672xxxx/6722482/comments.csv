,hitlike,2011-10-09T13:41Z,Any comments about the torrent?
,haidaboy,2011-10-10T03:43Z,"Frankly I wouldn't download this one.
It contains an EXE file (which is often a bad thing)

However I did run the EXE on an isolated machine and it began a lot of unnecessary additional extractions to odd-named files, so I cancelled it.

Download a different version is my advice."
,p2b,2011-10-10T07:52Z,"its self extraction archive nothing more, you can either run the .exe or extract with winrar & it will extract few odd named files from which you just have to run the setup.bat & play from desktop. i hope you'll can read the description posted. also teamcrossfire is a very great team which recently made to public trackers before it was only at a private site. so i would like you to try first & then comment any boolsheet.

peace

,haidaboy,2011-10-10T09:08Z,"Perhaps the file is legit.  However it is not prepared in the normal fashion.  It would be much simpler and less suspicious to extract it normally instead of adding all that unnecessary rigamarole.

The setup file reverts to a command prompt, which begins extracting things...supposedly.  

A little more attention to ease of use instead of force-promoting ""teamcrossfire"" might be advantageous in this day of virus-infested downloads."
,p2b,2011-10-10T11:33Z,"keeping the ease of use in mind it has been made as an .exe so you just have to run it & select your location. although there's hardly any difference between .exe or the .rar as none the less they are same. also if its teamcrossfire's rip so they would definitely promote themselves like a normal ripper/group would do & i see no harm in it. & there's nothing hard in it, its pretty siomple like all other rips. also there have more than hundred's of downloads of this torrent & there's not a single complain about anything yet. there is no suspicious thing or virus or trojans or whatever & if it is then its surely a false alert. & regarding the command prompt every ripper/group out there uses command prompts for it exept for bb who use install shield so i dont see any problem with that too.

P.S. - if you dont like tcf rips better dont download it!

thanks

,haidaboy,2011-10-10T12:45Z,"I'm sorry to disagree with p2b, but most rippers pack their files and allow them to be unpacked using 7-zip, winrar, or a similar programme without any extra command-line operations.  Then the game is installed normally, and either a keygen, or a serial is included to facilitate the install.  Then a cracked .exe file is copied over the installed .exe file to avoid the ""insert disc"" nag.  (And in the particular case, this game is non-DRM so the install should not need any of the above).

Most rippers do not splash their name all over a command prompt screen and force people to use some proprietary extraction process.  

Most rippers have a small file that promotes themselves included with the download, which is fine.  I enjoy many of them.  Often a ripper will include their name in the filename at the end (such as Skidrow does).

This file may be perfectly legit.  And it did not register as a positive on any of my antivirus applications.  I just feel there was a lot of unnecessary ""annoyance"" connected with it, which can sometimes indicate that there may be something ""fishy"" about a file.

And yes, I have downloaded the Skidrow version of this since those are not convoluted with this type of thing."
,p2b,2011-10-10T15:00Z,"@haidaboy - just for your information this is a rip hehe. skidrow is a group of crackers & they provide full iso's. you got yourself confused here, its a full rip of the game & not the iso, if you can see the size difference between this & the skidrow release. also we are a group of rippers like TPTB, KAOS, BLACKBOX etc. not sceners like SKIDROW, RELOADED, RAZOR1911 etc. hehe ;)


peace ;)"
,p2b,2011-10-10T15:02Z,"P.S. - you dont need no keygens, cracks or anything in rips, just run the setup & play from desktop :D"
,haidaboy,2011-10-10T20:02Z,"Frankly, I like ISO's much better.  Just mount, install, and maybe use a keygen, serial or replace a file or two, and you're done.

However I will keep an open mind and possibly use a Teamcrossfire torrent in the future."
,asifdrmc,2011-10-12T08:25Z,does it have high res texture pack & all dlc?
,p2b,2011-10-13T17:49Z,its a complete rip with everything in it! nothing ripped/removed. has all the dlc & high resolution textures & its updated to 2.0 (:
,roy_1989,2011-10-14T00:08Z,i just started downloading this copy and i'll leave my review after the installation 
,aaronjunited,2011-10-14T12:05Z,"Ran the exe, then setup.bat and when I run launcher from desktop i get the error. Instructions tell me to run vcredist_x86.exe

There is no vcredist_x86.exe in dir 2 nor any of the folders. I ran a windows search and found none.

What do i do now?"
,aaronjunited,2011-10-14T12:06Z,"and were the hell is the disk 2 directory, there aint know disk 1 or 2."
,aaronjunited,2011-10-14T14:19Z,Doesnt matter i downloaded Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86) from microsoft website.
,roy_1989,2011-10-16T00:43Z,"it's working just fine, however i didn't like the game that much, "
,asifdrmc,2011-10-16T17:45Z,"works 100%,good 1 team crossfire"
,LazyMonk,2011-10-25T14:56Z,"I have SKIDROW's torrent which works great, but I want version 2.0.
I tried this torrent and the game works... kind-off.
It runs in minimum graphics settings - crappy blurry textures - no matter what I choose in the settings."
,madlisboa,2011-10-27T16:13Z,"Some1 knows why i cant open the launcher,i need change resolution to play the game right,thx."

,p2b,2011-10-29T15:50Z,"@madlisboz - the launcher works only if internet's working or else it wont

@lazymonk - the problem is from your side & not the rip, others are playing it very well

,madlisboa,2011-10-29T20:33Z,"U mean i need internet for launcher works?if yes,yes i have internet."
,madlisboa,2011-10-30T13:41Z,"Unfortunately i cant play,bcuzz launcher doesnt work for me,and game play im maximum resolution :(."
,Svefn-g-englar,2011-11-23T10:30Z,"Launcher won't work. I made sure there was registry values for the game and of course I'm connected to the Internet.

Would be nice to change settings without messing around with .ini files.

For anyone who doesn't know, go to My Documents>Witcher 2>config>profiles

Find one that you think your system can handle (Uber was too much, using High) copy those values. Open User.ini in the config folder and paste those settings in."
,LCFer,2012-01-08T14:16Z,the launcher doesnt work with or without internet.
