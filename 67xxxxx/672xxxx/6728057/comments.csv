,liccleminkey4170,2011-10-07T22:33Z,"Ahhh XaltedSmoke, Thank you soooo much for uploading this series, you've made my day on many occasions recently :)

I'm also hoping the Fibro Cottage will win, Micheal has been an absolute delight throughout, however for me they pretty much all have been. There's something about the Australian people, their openness, humour and compassion for one another make them an absolute joy to watch :)"

64 will be up in about 30 mins."
