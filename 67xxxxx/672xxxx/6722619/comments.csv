,neoturk01,2011-10-15T23:45Z,"sucks this is false

tried opening package content and transferring to  live contents .. tried openning auz afterwards not authorize..

when you try to copy paste live patch and ename it, the application doesnt even open

waste waste of time and gets me mad

,neoturk01,2011-10-16T04:53Z,"12th try , day 2

Copied contents from the fake patch to live contents, opened auz..

invalid authorization...

fucking cunt"
,neoturk01,2011-10-16T04:58Z,"tried replacing the live patch with live, renaming it live..

still said invalid..

love the fakie fag"
,pars18,2011-10-16T10:50Z,"It's not my fault if you aren't capable to crack an application. I did not say to replace any file.

1. Download the trial version

2. Open ""LivePatch"" select ""Live.app""

3. Open Authorize826.auz"
,marinhojr,2011-10-16T19:11Z,pars18: LivePatch does not even open to me
,jayfantom,2011-10-17T18:28Z,"I think this patch is for macs guys, which is only why it won't work for the majority of you people, correct me if I'm wrong pars18. Also, if you could release a 8.2.6 patch for Windows, I would "
,Rizzo220,2011-10-18T02:44Z,Get a Mac then. LOL
,pars18,2011-10-18T18:21Z,"Yes this is a Patch only for mac, that's why i put the torrent in the mac section"
,marinhojr,2011-10-19T03:54Z,"Don't know why but I needed to run
chmod 777 LivePatch
in
LivePatch.app/Contents/MacOS$>

Then it worked.

Cheers!!"
,jayfantom,2011-10-21T08:10Z,why are there no patches for PC though? Is it harder to get through security or something? I really need Ableton on PC D:
,0265gl,2011-10-21T12:05Z,"Hey Pars, could you please explain in detail how to patch live 8.2.6?

I really don't understand what to do as simple as it sounds. When I open live patch it just bounces on the dock and nothing happens.

Much obliged"
,haight510,2011-10-25T18:24Z,"Hey, I'm having some trouble with this patch too. The LivePatch.app just bounces for a fraction of a second and then quits. Any way around this problem? 

as neoturk said, ""ur cunt doesn't work"". troll."
,younggolfjedi,2011-10-30T00:24Z,"yea, the livepatch doesnt open for me. and im not sure what u mean by open LivePatch and select Live.app. ... is that to say, open LivePatch and OPEN ableton live? ive done this before with 2.2 so im no newb but this livePatch doesnt wanna open for me. are u sure i dont have to replace it with the ""live"" thats in the contents?"
,doctordal,2011-11-03T04:50Z,"Yeah dude, you've got to be more specific here...I click it, it animates, then nothing"
,samleroux,2011-11-04T04:17Z,@ marinhojr  what exactly did you run in terminal for it to work?
,finnolin,2011-11-05T19:00Z,"IF ""LivePatch.app"" WONT OPEN:
put the LivePatch.app in the ""Applications"" Folder open terminal and write:

chmod 777 /Applications/LivePatch.app/Contents/MacOS/LivePatch

if terminal returns ""No such file or directory"" you have to change the Path. type ""pwd"" and it shows where you are on your system.
if terminal returns nothing LivePatch.app should work now.

After that I still had to authorize live (just drag the ""Authorize826.auz"" on ""Live.app"")

..hope it helps...."
,faune42,2011-11-07T20:27Z,WHY does this give me some kind of Mainstage patch file???!!!
,faune42,2011-11-07T20:28Z,nvm...clicking on show package contents brought up the right files....but still that was weird!!
,tsrejca,2011-11-27T22:49Z,"hey thanx finnolin ... your command in terminal worked.
cheers :)"
,Urei1601s,2011-12-03T03:27Z,"First time using Mac since the 90's... OS X Lion 107.2
After a few failed installs with 8.2.5 (worked just fine with Leopard) I found this and DL'ed the Demo from Ableton. Invalid, Invalid, RTFM and did the teminal command and bewm. Works! Strange process and much more inconvenient than just clicking a .auz but im not complaining. OS X Lion with Live 8.2.6 FTW! Thank you."
,spulch,2011-12-22T18:15Z,Anyone else having contant crashing issues? I get crashes on export and randomly when using a midi controller.
,matteov,2012-04-19T17:01Z,"I don't understand how to do it man,
I downloaded the file, opened it, and there is nothing called LivePatch.app or Authorize826...
Just ableton 8.2.6 patch, then when i try to open that, all this writing comes up in terminal... can you please help me"
