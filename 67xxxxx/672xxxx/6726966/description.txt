Lights 2011 sophomore effort Siberia is a much heavier sounding affair than her gentle, 2009 full-length The Listening. There she delivered a batch of Cyndi Lauper-meets-Postal Service-meets-Daft Punk dorm room anthems that were pleasantly catchy. Two years later, Siberia showcases singer/songwriter Valerie Poxleitners more mature, sonically sophisticated approach to her synth-driven melodic pop that draws on such dance-sympathetic styles as dubstep, hip-hop, and electronica. Where before Lights keyboards plinked and percolated like tiny bubbles popping with a soft, twee-like exuberance, here she slams you with overdriven, fuzz-pulsing synth and drum machine-driven tracks that, aside from Poxleitners angelic vocals, have an almost purposefully lo-fi sound.
