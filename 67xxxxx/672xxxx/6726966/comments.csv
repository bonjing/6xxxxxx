Lightsâ€™ first full album, 2009â€™s The Listening saw her being compared to Owl City and other solo electronic acts. While that album was generally well received, there were still questions of whether she would evolve from the cotton candy electro-pop present on her debut album. With her 2011 release, entitled Siberia, Lights throws some grit and muscle into her electronic sounds, and manages to retain the elements that made The Listening a tasteful record. 

Lead single â€œToesâ€ starts off with a bubbly synth reminiscent of â€œSaviorâ€, but further along there is just enough of a gritty underbelly of tones in order to nicely show the new direction Lights has taken. Her vocals still hold all the air and melody that were present on The Listening, and the bouncy pop sounds are still present, but each song sees a layer of dirt being poured on. Whether itâ€™s the distorted bass line of â€œSiberiaâ€, the bass wobble of â€œFourth Dimensionâ€, or the noise of nine-minute album closer â€œDay Oneâ€. 

Siberia shows a new side of Lightsâ€™ musical journey. Thereâ€™s still the child-like melodies and innocence, but thereâ€™s growth there. Itâ€™s less â€œPretendâ€ and more real. Whether this is good or bad is up to each listenerâ€™s preference, but for Lightsâ€™ musical career this is a step in the right direction. Although Siberia is a nice move forward, there are still flaws that hurt the album. Some of her electronic work can be annoying, particularly the glitchy synth line in â€œBannerâ€ which feels off-time; the guest vocals also tend to degrade the songs they are present in, instead of adding another dimension to the music. Siberia also suffers from relative repetition, as songs tend to feel similar in their structure and tone, but this is to be expected from a growing artist. 

Lights is as popular as ever, and Siberia will likely increase her renown, as the production is bigger, and the music catchier. Although it suffers from a few setbacks, Siberia shows Lights progressing from what she showed on The Listening, and is in itself a very solid album worth picking up.

I thought politux screwed up on the ripping of this due to all the distortion.
Downloaded another rip of the album and that was also distorted.
I agree with Zuktor. The slow and painful removal of hands is necessary."

Thanks everyone for the comments.  :)"
