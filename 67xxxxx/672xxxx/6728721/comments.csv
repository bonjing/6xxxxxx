Nonetheless thanks!"

depending of the model you have,sure.
Works very fine on my HIS HD 6950
Turbo-2 GB unlocked to 6970 :)
(first series with unlock bios features...)
btw one my friends gets excellent results also
on his HIS 4890 Turbo-XT-1 GB running on 
1050 Mhz stable GPU core...
his specific model still stay a very interesting model and when combined with a Q9650,no problem so far as well anyway :)
What card do you have bro ?
3000 series ?
looking for another card ?
The HD 3870 still stay a good and decent model
as well as all best 9800 GTX+ OC models.
285 and 295 GTX also stay good models anyway.
I must test now this new driver on my laptop on 
HD 6470 to see if really compatible and stable as well.
Cheers and thx for your feedback ."
