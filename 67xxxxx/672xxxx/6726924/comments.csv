[V],boobsman,2011-10-07T17:13Z,"This is XGD2, you burn as normal but you will need LT1.9 or above to play this game."

,Empfmil,2011-10-08T15:35Z,"ah, so not every game from now will be xgd3? some will still be xgd2?"
[V],boobsman,2011-10-08T16:44Z,"@ Empfmil, not all games will be xgd3 but i think most will. This will be based on the old Dead rising 2 game which is why its xgd2, i would still recommend getting your console flashed with LT2.0."
