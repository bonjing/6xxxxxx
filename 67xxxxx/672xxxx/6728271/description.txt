Ok, these tunes are the original tracks that various ska bands covered so a title of 'Roots of Ska' would probably be more appropriate but it is still a quality download all the same ;-)

British bands like the Specials took Jamaican ska and rocksteady and then speeded the whole thing up and tossed in just a dash of punk to create the British pop ska explosion of the late '70s. This 20-track set collects some of the Jamaican originals that inspired the whole thing, and sides like Justin Hinds' "Carry Go Bring Come," the Maytals' "Monkey Man," Desmond Dekker's "007 (Shanty Town)," and the Ethiopians' "Train to Skaville" would be classic recordings in a discussion about any era or genre. It's possible to look at this release as an introduction to the so-called Two Tone Revolution in Britain, but it's also possible to just view it as a nice set of classic Jamaican singles. Either way, it's fun.
