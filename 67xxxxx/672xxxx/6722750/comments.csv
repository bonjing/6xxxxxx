,dizzie7,2011-10-16T10:26Z,"patch won't work. Says the original file is ""in use"""
,darkman006,2011-11-11T00:25Z,have to right click and run the patch as an administrator. Great! Works perfectly!
,sphare,2011-11-23T10:26Z,"Does this work for anyone? The patch breaks the digital signature of ""jliccl.dll"" and thus Jaksta won't start anymore to enter the serial. And I am running as Administrator. Reverted to non-patched file and Jaksta starts again. I guess just another non-working release. Just for your information: the diablo2oo2 Universal Patcher-based patch generates false positives in some virus scanners. So don't be too alarmed."
,FlacoFats,2011-12-10T11:21Z,@sphare Are you one of those people that just doesn't know what there doing but thinks they are a true kopimist that knows all... I ask this as someone put a thank you comment back in October and your comment is from November. I can't imagine that someone would take time to thank the up loader if it didn't work; further more I never DL'ed a torrent from a VIP or trusted source that didn't work... I'm just saying if your gonna post comments make its the arrow and not the Indian. (no disrespect if you were wrong just keep educating yourself as the info is out there.)
,sphare,2011-12-10T13:49Z,"@FacoMat you seem to be one of those who drill their heads to expand their memory. And I don't take s*** from people who haven't even released anything. And you can't even imagine that someone is even faking thank-yous to make people think their file is working but is also installing viruses, trojans, backdoors and such crap. Btw, the patch only works with .NET 2.0 SP2 or later. The unpatched Jaksta version simply works with .NET 2.0 (without any Service Pack needed). And this is what I tried. When I tried .NET 2.0 SP2 even the patched version started. That's odd enough and nowhere mentioned. But Jaksta/ReplayMedia Catcher is crap anyway, hardly downloads anything. At least not the vids I'm interested. Other programs do. As for trusted/VIP sources: those people don't mean anything, there are even lots of non-working programs/torrents from those ""trusted"" people here on TPB. ""Trusted"" or ""VIP"" doesn't mean anything. It's simply a title you could apply for some time ago. Doesn't mean anything ""trustworthy"" or special in my eyes. Those ""trusted"" ones often just seem to copy-post torrents from other sources they haven't even tested themselves thoroughly. And just because you haven't encountered a non-working torrent from a trusted/VIP, hardly means anything."
,koney007,2011-12-15T19:06Z,Everything work's fine but when lunch the program every time work's for few minute then crash...on lion  pls help

,zikwitit,2012-02-22T06:52Z,"Can somebody give some more detailed instructions?  I moved the patch.exe file into the dir....but that didn't work.  I tried to ""extract"" it with 7zip while in the dir folder and it says I didn't have sufficient access.  I tried to Run As Administrator and it still says I don't have access.  What am I doing wrong?"
,tetnem,2012-03-03T12:45Z,"Hey, people! 

DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT, IT'S A TROJAN VIRUS!!!!!! DON'T TRUST THIS FUCKER!"
,rayhaque,2012-03-10T15:06Z,The patch and keygen files from this torrent are infested with viruses.  Run them through virustotal.com and you will see.  BEWARE!
,tetnem,2012-04-04T13:08Z,"Hey, guys!

I was wrong. This torrent is NOT a trojan virus!! All you must do is to copy the ""jliccl.dll"" file from the direction folder after you have installed the program. Then you patch it and replace the patched file with the one in  the direction folder. Then will the program work fine and the problem is solved. :)"
