,ismo246,2012-03-23T00:43Z,Hi! I don't know where to post this so I try to post this to here: I had 32 inch tv and i played my games with multiman. Now I have bought new tv which is 42 inchies. Problem is that now when I play games via multiman my tv shows the games in 32 inch. So ther's like a big black frame in my tv when I play via multiman. When I play original game there's no problem. Any solutions? Thanks!
