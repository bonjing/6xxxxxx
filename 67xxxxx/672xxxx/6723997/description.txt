FSX - Switzerland Professional X

Serial key inside the Documentation folder (Always Keep the serial folder away from the .exe or the install does not seem to work)
other than that install should be a breeze 

I uploaded this mainly because I noticed the old one is dieing and is also difficult for some to install properly



The new Switzerland Professional is the ultimate VFR-scenery and is now made for the FSX!
 Every 3D object has been positioned absolutely realistic in whole Switzerland.
 The houses are placed at the actual spot.
 The trees and forests in 3D are precisely set.
 To thrill the scenery, all sightseeing spots like the house of parliament in Bern, 
the great minster of Zurich, the chapel bridge in Lucerne, the cathedral of St. Gall 
and lots more are highlights to enjoy your flights.
 All big waters and rivers are simulated with FSX-water effects.
Leatest sensation: Winter texture !
A other sensation: Night texture ! 
Texture resolution: 2m/pixel  Mesh: 20m
