Really appreciated.

By the way, can you throw them up asap for the last 5 episodes :) I can barely wait for your uploads haha - the final week is getting exciting."

Who is everyone's guess for the winner?

The episodes will be up as soon as I have them.
Sometimes its fairly early in the morning, and sometimes its that evening.  I usually upload them within 5 mins of finishing the download myself.  Quick skim to check that its complete, then up it goes!

Hopefully this won't be a one-off and there will be another season.  From what I hear unfortunately the ratings haven't been so hot.  Shame."

There will be a second season I hear - they're planning on changing the format somehow to help with the ratings."
